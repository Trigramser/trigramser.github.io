<div class="caption">Chapter 1151: War Or Peace</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The endless smoke shrouded the entire horizon as rows of rockets whizzed off and targeted the far distance before they engulfed all the targets in explosions.</br>
</br>
The dust of the explosion swept across the battlefield. In deafening roars, the soldiers stood up from the bunker with their rifle, followed behind the tanks and armored vehicles that began to accelerate as they rushed toward the battlefield filled with black smoke...</br>
</br>
The representatives from different forces looked at the rolling dust in the distance and revealed different expressions.</br>
</br>
The representatives from the Northern Alliance Area scorned at the scene. Inheriting the weapons and tactics before the war, they were not afraid of the simple firepower bombardment. Only one weapon of the NAC caught their attention and that was the particle cannon capable of penetrating the Wanderer Tank.</br>
</br>
Representatives of the Southern Survivors Alliance were in shock. They whispered around and exchanged opinions. Against the immense firepower, they did not have the confidence to even last through one round of bombardment. Even if the survivors of the entire south knitted tightly together into a rope, it would just be a rope against the mighty NAC…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around and looked at the representatives from the south who look shell-shocked and smiled.</br>
</br>
"How is the NAC military?"</br>
</br>
Other than the Northern Alliance Area representatives' disdain look, the representatives from the south all expressed their most sincere praises. They all willingly stated their intention to maintain a peaceful relationship…</br>
</br>
A military exercise like this was conducted every year by the NAC.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, the purpose was to enhance Jiang Chen's presence of general who rarely appeared in front of people. On another hand, it was to maintain the combat effectiveness of the soldiers. It also served the purpose of consuming excess weapons inventory. Finally, it could deter the small survivor settlements around NAC. Four birds with one stone.</br>
</br>
NAC was rich, too rich.</br>
</br>
The three Gardens of Edens had almost monopolized the food trade in half of the Pan-Asia region. The inexhaustible amount of iron, aluminum, and rare earth minerals made people envious. The Sixth Street that completed industrialization transported countless amounts of industrially manufactured goods to the surrounding survivor settlements, used trade to plunder the crystals, resources, and even the population and land of other survivor settlements...</br>
</br>
To ensure the smooth flow of the trade routes, it was not enough to rely on guards. From time to time, it was important to gather the representatives of the local forces to flex NAC's muscles to show the true ruler of the land.</br>
</br>
In the distance, a Tiger II had already bulldozed through the smoky battlefield. The soldiers fired alternatively to maintain constant suppression. Under the cover of machine-gun firepower, they pushed toward the target area. Soon, in the center of the battlefield a few kilometers away, the banner of NAC waved high in the air.</br>
</br>
</br>
The entire military exercise was coming to an end...</br>
</br>
The already unimpressed representatives of the Northern Alliance Area scorned and left without saying anything. Representatives of other survivors' settlements sighed with relief and expressed their gratitude to Jiang Chen, and then left in a hurry.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? That's the power of the First Corp."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo said with a hearty smile.</br>
</br>
"Very impressive," Jiang Chen nodded and looked at the black smoke that gradually dissipated in the distance. After a moment of pause, he suddenly sighed with some emotion. "I just feel that something is missing."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo pondered for a moment and a frown began to show. However, he couldn't interpret the general's message.</br>
</br>
In the distance, the soldiers have been lined up, boarded the trucks in order, and withdrew from the battlefield in an orderly manner.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua provided the most suitable tactics for NAC. The tactic of using firepower at random and then rushing to the target was now replaced by tactics where the armored vehicles and tanks worked together with infantry. However, Jiang Chen looked at the black smoke that was slowing fading and felt something was missing.</br>
</br>
What is it?</br>
</br>
Not only did Cheng Weiguo fail to understand the message in his words, but even Jiang Chen himself also could not fully understand.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because he could separate from the world at any time, he always looked at the problems from the perspective of an outsider. In some places, he has always been more sensitive than the indigenous people of this world.</br>
</br>
Of course, it may just be his illusion.</br>
</br>
At this time, Lu Minghui, the bishop of the Guardian Sect, who left with the representatives walked to him with a dignified look.</br>
</br>
The guard noticed that he was approaching Jiang Chen and stopped him.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter," Jiang Chen raised his hand to indicate that the guard could be at ease, "Mr. Bishop?"</br>
</br>
Lu Minghui leaned in and whispered, "If I dare to ask Mr. General, is our covenant still in place?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly frowned and looked at him with confusion. "Of course... What do you mean?"</br>
</br>
Lu Minghui smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"This is a long story..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Indeed, a long story.</br>
</br>
After half an hour, the bishop finally explained the situation to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
This was the case.</br>
</br>
The CCCP tank formation appeared in the northern part of Shangjing. It immediately took over the military outpost established by the Shangjing Survivors Alliance in Badaling. The local survivors immediately organized coalition forces for defense, but the effort was completely futile against the CCCP's steel torrent.</br>
</br>
As one of the survivor forces of Shangjing, the Guardian Sect naturally sent people, but the results were obvious. If they won, then Lu Minghui wouldn't be here seeking for help.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a while to digest the information from the bishop.</br>
</br>
In the map from before the war, no matter from which direction, the border between the CCCP and the Pan-Asia Cooperation was hundreds of kilometers away from Shangjing.</br>
</br>
Didn't the world government already leave the Earth? Where did the CCCP tank come from? Why did they suddenly become interested in Pan-Asia Cooperation?</br>
</br>
However, these issues were not the focus.</br>
</br>
The point was, was NAC going to head north?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not immediately reply to Lu Minghui. After he returned to the Fishbone base, he immediately convened the top officials of the military government to discuss possible countermeasures.</br>
</br>
Regarding whether or not to send troops, the military government was also divided into two factions.</br>
</br>
One faction supports sending troops, and the other faction naturally opposed...</br>
</br>
"...NAC needs time to grow and nourish, not to mention the nuclear winter is just becoming more and more severe. The northern territories are meaningless to us. Our covenant with the Guardian Sect only promises to allow them to remain in Wanghai in an autonomous region after the restoration of the Holy Shield. This has nothing to do with the covenant." After a pause, Chu Nan went on to say, "I propose that instead of sending troops, it is better to fulfill the promises in advance and help them move south."</br>
</br>
"Mutants and zombies can stop flesh, but they can't stop iron. If they are coming for us, then there is no meaning in deferring." Han Junhua said without emotion, "The best choice at this time is to stop the CCCP tanks in the Shangjing region and prevent them from moving south."</br>
</br>
"Please pay attention to your identity," Chu Nan glanced at Han Junhua, being vocal of his opinion. "I remember that Advisor Han is a NAC Advisor, not a Pan-Asia Cooperation Advisor."</br>
</br>
"I am standing in the position of NAC. Of course, I'm only an advisor. As for the decision..." She was not bothered by Chu Nan's words, instead, she looked at Jiang Chen with the same expressionless state, "Please decide."</br>
</br>
Everyone looked at Jiang Chen and waited for Jiang Chen's decision.</br>
</br>
The military government was a dictatorial government. There was no vote or democracy. All soldiers were only loyal to the same great existence – The General of the NAC.</br>
</br>
No matter the result and no matter which side of the balance everyone was tipping towards.</br>
</br>
War or peace was at his whim.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1152"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1152: NAC Needs A War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After a long pause, Jiang Chen stood up and looked around at the top officials of the military government, then said slowly.</br>
</br>
"NAC has been at peace for too long."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan secretly sighed.</br>
</br>
When he heard this sentence, he already guessed Jiang Chen's choice.</br>
</br>
However, he did not have any dissatisfaction in his mind. Even if he did not agree with the choice to fight the north, he would execute Jiang Chen's orders without reservation.</br>
</br>
The military government had no bureaucrats, only soldiers. The duty of soldiers was to obey the superior without any doubt.</br>
</br>
"I know that war is never a good thing. I also know that NAC needs time to grow." After a pause, Jiang Chen raised his voice, "But the space for survival never grows by itself. We can't hope CCCP knows to take the gains. We are very wealthy, wealthy to the point that survivors across the Pacific know about our wealth. If we don't take care of the problem outside our border, then the trouble will come to us. If Shangjing falls, we will be next."</br>
</br>
"This is not about the covenant, but about us."</br>
</br>
"NAC needs a war."</br>
</br>
"Now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen responded to the eyes focused on him and said word by word.</br>
</br>
Peace had lasted for too long. After the expansion of NAC's territory to Wu City, it stopped its expansion. IT was not just the soldiers who began to slack, but every survivor under the NAC. In fact, from the beginning of the baby boom, Jiang Chen began to sense something had changed.</br>
</br>
It was also for the same reason that he had the idea of ​​"something was missing" in the military exercise.</br>
</br>
Until this moment, Jiang Chen finally understood what was missed.</br>
</br>
NAC's force was still the same, but the sharp blade lost the taint of blood.</br>
</br>
Long-lasting peace had begun to rust the war machine. As civilization gradually recovered, the survivors had even begun to forget that they were on the wasteland, not the good times before the war.</br>
</br>
War was the main theme of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Only the war could sweep away the mottled rust and let NAC, the behemoth born for war, re-energize its vitality.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen's voice faded, Cheng Weiguo immediately stood up, full of excitement.</br>
</br>
"I'm willing to lead the First Corp!"</br>
</br>
"The First Corp must stay put," Jiang Chen shook his head. "Your mission is to build defense along the coast."</br>
</br>
"But..." Cheng Weiguo's expression was a little eager.</br>
</br>
"No need to say more, I have already decided," Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped Cheng Weiguo's words, "I am going to lead the troops to the north!"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
War!</br>
</br>
When the notice of war was posted on the public notice board, the expression of every NAC survivor was not gloomy but full of excitement.</br>
</br>
That's right, excitement!</br>
</br>
Countless powerful opponents once stood in front of the NAC, but they lost to the General. Now the General had decided to "lead the army", almost no one thought about the possibility of failure. In everyone's mind, General meant victory.</br>
</br>
</br>
The survivors lined up in front of the conscription points and eagerly looked in front of them with the goal of becoming a member of the expeditionary army. With a pocket full of war bonds, the merchants squeezed out from the crowded banks with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
Stimulated by countless arms orders, the military factories in the Sixth Street operated like clockwork and pushed their capacity to the limit.</br>
</br>
From the workers to the soldiers, every gear on the NAC war machine spun under the command of the war and it shook the land it stood on. Over the three-day period, 5,000 reverses were mobilized and completed the assembly in the northern suburbs of Wanghai. With Jiang Chen's order, they could board the airship and fly north.</br>
</br>
Of course, not everyone liked this war.</br>
</br>
For example, Jiang Chen's family, especially Sun Jiao, were full of resentment of the idea that he must leave two days after his return.</br>
</br>
"It's hard for you to come back. Can't you just stay home for a while?" The delicious food lost its taste, and the chopsticks were placed on the bowls. Sun Jiao held her chin with one hand and sighed in resentment.</br>
</br>
The dinner that was supposed to be full of joy was now somewhat gloomy. Even Lin Lin, who always expressed her appreciation for Yao Yao's cooking, moved her chopsticks at a slower rate.</br>
</br>
"It's not that I don't want to stay at home, but the trouble came too unexpectedly." Jiang Chen helplessly shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Can't you let other people go? For example, Han Junhua since she is very good anyway." Sun Jiao was persistent.</br>
</br>
"It can only be me," Jiang Chen shook his head. "To maintain the prestige of the general, I must do something. I have been sitting behind the scenes for too long, it is time for me to make another appearance."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao sighed and no longer tried to persuade him. She knew his personality very well. Although he was very easy-going most of the time and would act freely at her will, for matters that involved principles, it was difficult to persuade him.</br>
</br>
"Be careful."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Jiang Chen responded with a reassuring smile. "Don't worry too much, you know my ability."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao threw a menacing stare at Jiang Chen with her eyes red.</br>
</br>
"I know, that's why I'm afraid that you'll not be careful!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen focused on Sun Jian and watched her silently before he responded to the eyes full of care with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I promise I will be careful."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao pouted, then began to eat.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin rolled her eyes, exaggeratedly spat out her tongue, and turned her head away from looking at the two people staring at each other.</br>
</br>
The table suddenly turned quiet.</br>
</br>
An odd quietness.</br>
</br>
Just then, with her hands holding her chin, Sun Xiaorou, who didn't speak at all, suddenly broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which... Who will accompany brother-in-law on this expedition?"</br>
</br>
The table was silent and soon fell into a deeper silence than before. Even Lin Lin put down her chopsticks.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao secretively raised her small head and glanced at Jiang Chen. Then, her eyes quickly escaped to the window.</br>
</br>
With her hands still holding her chin, Xiaorou smiled and looked at the petrified Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Who should I choose?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was a little awkward, and he realized the unnatural state of the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
It seemed like a hard choice regardless...</br>
</br>
At this moment, his eyes met with Xiaorou's grin in her eyes.</br>
</br>
Behind her, he seemed to see the tail of a little devil waving to him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly realized what happened as he facepalmed.</br>
</br>
This girl definitely did this intentionally!</br>
</br>
Fortunately, she did not continue to make it difficult for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The little devil smiled, put her finger on her lips, and changed the subject.</br>
</br>
"Well... in short, let's wash the dishes first?"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Even after they had cleaned up the dishes, the family still didn't manage to decide who would accompany Jiang Chen to Shangjing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then went to the washroom.</br>
</br>
Just as he pushed open the door again and planned to go upstairs, he saw Lin Lin standing in the hallway.</br>
</br>
She didn't look like she was waiting to go to the washroom, but instead was waiting for him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin strangely, then asked.</br>
</br>
"Is something up?"</br>
</br>
"Follow me, I have something for you."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin did not wait for Jiang Chen to answer and headed straight to the backyard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not understand what her intention was as he looked at her back. However, since Lin Lin was not Xiaorou after all, she wouldn't be pulling a prank on him.</br>
</br>
With this thought in mind, Jiang Chen Chen followed Lin Lin curiously to the backyard.</br>
</br>
The Moon scattered its light in the silent night. The north wind passed through the sparse branches of the autumn leaves and disturbed the previous silence.</br>
</br>
The cold air sneaked into Jiang Chen's neck along the collar of his shirt as he instantly felt the coolness of the night. Looking at Lin Lin's slender and thin back, Jiang Chen took a coat with a fluffy collar from the storage dimension and covered her.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the cold fingers accidentally touched her neck, Lin Lin shook like a startled rabbit and jumped forward. She then turned around and stared straight at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down the hands hanging in the air and looked at her.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?"</br>
</br>
"No, nothing..." Lin Lin grabbed the collar of the coat with both hands and tightened it around her to hide her cheek in the fluff. Through the fluff, she whispered, "What, what did you do?"</br>
</br>
"What did I do? I was afraid that you would be cold."</br>
</br>
"..." Lin Lin said. "Actually... I'm not afraid of the cold."</br>
</br>
"I almost forgot," Jiang Chen said, "You are a digitalized human."</br>
</br>
For a digitalized human, it should be easy for her to regulate her body temperature. In this way, his behavior seems to be extraneous.</br>
</br>
However, for some odd reason, after she heard Jiang Chen's words, Lin Lin's cheeks suddenly turned red and she started to act shy.</br>
</br>
"Really?"</br>
</br>
"Really? Really what."</br>
</br>
"You said, you almost..." She whispered halfway before she suddenly stopped. Then she looked up to Jiang Chen, shook her heads, and cheerfully smiled. "Oh, nothing."</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen did not hear her words clearly and continued to stare at her. "Right, give back my clothes since you don't need it anyway."</br>
</br>
"Not giving it back!" Lin Lin giggled and jumped forward. She then turned around, spat out her tongue, and made a funny face. "Not giving it back, it is now mine! Come and get it if you can~"</br>
</br>
The long silver hair exuded a faint silver glow in the moonlight, and with her innocent hops, it flowed like waves on the sandy beach.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen twitched at the scene of Lin Lin hopping in front of him.</br>
</br>
How can I get it!</br>
</br>
If I really got it off of her body, I'd be a pervert?!</br>
</br>
"Forget it, it's yours now," Jiang Chen sighed, "You said you were going to give me something? This coat is my gift to you."</br>
</br>
He didn't wear that coat many times anyway. It was just something he kept in the storage dimension as a spare.</br>
</br>
Since Lin Lin liked it, it was hers to keep.</br>
</br>
The two passed through the backyard and came to the Lin Institute.</br>
</br>
When they walked into the lab, Lin Lin closed the door and immediately walked in front of a computer and tapped a few buttons on the touchpad. The dark green data loading bar flashed through the holographic screen, and several characters made up the dialog box popped up in front of Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
It was also the same time Lin Lin clicked the last button.</br>
</br>
Soon, the black box next to her began to make the sound of gas leaking.</br>
</br>
Milky white mist escaped from the edges. The black lacquered lid slowly moved backward.</br>
</br>
From the gas that floated toward him, Jiang Chen felt a hint of coolness.</br>
</br>
In the mist, a black cube rested inside. Its size was no different from a Rubik's cube, but the engraving had a sense of mechanical perfection. Jiang Chen couldn't guess what it was just by looking at its appearance alone.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin walked next to it and picked up the cube from the cooling trough.</br>
</br>
Immediately afterward, Lin Lin stepped in front of Jiang Chen, reached out, and solemnly handed the cube into his hand. With a generous expression, she said.</br>
</br>
"Here, yours now."</br>
</br>
That expression made it look like this item was extremely valuable.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was confused as he weighed the Rubik's Cube in his hand and the coldness permeated through his skin.</br>
</br>
"What is this?"</br>
</br>
"Something amazing!" Lin Lin proudly raised her small chest, proud. "You can wear it on you."</br>
</br>
"How can such a big thing be worn on the body," Jiang Chen looked at the Rubik's Cube in his hand and turned it around a few times. "And, what is this?"</br>
</br>
"A shield generator, I removed it from the Holy Shield System and printed one with 3D printing technology," Lin Lin said proudly.</br>
</br>
The restoration work of the Holy Shield System was far more troublesome than imagined. Although the Guardian Sect mastered information about the system, it was not until the beginning of the restoration process that the two parties discovered the difficulty of restoring the entire system.</br>
</br>
As a research center of NAC's cutting-edge technology, Lin Lin and her two thousand sisters, of course, also participated in the restoration work of the Holy Shield System. In Jiang Chen's hand was a sub-generator of the Holy Shield System.</br>
</br>
After Lin Lin's modification, the generator was reduced to the size of a two-meters radius. Without any attack power, it could defend against nuclear weapons at medium and long distances.</br>
</br>
"If there is any danger, you can twist here."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin took the black cube back and twisted the top half halfway.</br>
</br>
Light blue particles began to shimmer like fireflies, The particles emerged from the air one after another and surrounded the two. In the center of the laboratory, the particles formed a circle of soap bubbles-like film.</br>
</br>
The pale blue light curtain began to take shape, and it was even possible to see reflections on the thin film.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was astonished.</br>
</br>
"This is the Holy Shield..."</br>
</br>
"The miniature version of the Holy Shield. You can interpret it this way." Lin Lin added.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen extended his right hand, but when he touched the film, he stopped and looked back at Lin Lin. With his eyes, he asked if he could do this. Lin Lin responded with a smile before Jiang Chen pressed his hand against the thin film</br>
</br>
A very soft feeling. It was completely unimaginable that this thin, gauze shield could withstand nuclear attacks. Jiang Chen tried to use force, but even as his hand pressed against the film, he could not push out at all.</br>
</br>
Surprised, Jiang Chen knocked on the thin film and looked at the ripples, astonished.</br>
</br>
"What is the principle behind this?"</br>
</br>
"What you're touching is a layer of 'Graviton'. The high-energy 'graviton' layer can prevent energy and material from penetrating and forces it to bypass the target. In the strict sense, this layer of the shield is a solidified version of a force field." Lin Lin explained the working principle with technical terminology that Jiang Chen could not understand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, as if seemingly understood, nodded, and immediately asked her the question he was most concerned about.</br>
</br>
"Can this work on vehicles?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head.</br>
</br>
"No. Moving will change the state of the shield generator, which will cause the shield to fail. The specific explanation is very troublesome, but it works like this." Lin Lin gently shook the black box in her hand.</br>
</br>
The shield was like a layer of gel hit by a bullet, fading like ripples. It was not until Lin Lin stopped did the shield regenerate.</br>
</br>
The regenerated shield pushed Jiang Chen's hand back into the shield.</br>
</br>
Looking at the light blue film, Jiang Chen sighed and gave up the idea of putting this on tanks</br>
</br>
In a moving environment, it was almost impossible to not change the motion state of an object. A bump could disperse the shield. It was obviously not meaningful to have such a shield on the tank. Perhaps this was the reason Pan-Asia Cooperation used the Holy Shield as a land-based urban defense system and didn't implement it into the battlefield.</br>
</br>
After Lin Lin removed the shield, she walked next to Jiang Chen and gave him the Rubik's cube.</br>
</br>
"In short," Lin Lin bit her lip and hesitated for a moment. Then, she finally made up her mind, looked away, and whispered, "Come back safely."</br>
</br>
The quiet murmur made Jiang Chen stop.</br>
</br>
Such thoughtful words didn't fit Lin Lin's style.</br>
</br>
The usual her would be showing off the technical content of the shield technology with technical terms he didn't understand, stare at Jiang Chen, as if he were primitive, then mock him before she finally asked for mango puddings as a reward...</br>
</br>
Today, however, she was very unusual.</br>
</br>
"Why…why are you looking at me?" Seeing Jiang Chen was staring at her, Lin Lin whispered.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly extended his hand and rubbed her head.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, I'm just going on a trip. Don't make it feel like a life or death situation. You're making me nervous."</br>
</br>
With a red face, Lin Lin bit her lower lip, tightened her fists, and slammed her fists against Jiang Chen's chest.</br>
</br>
"I'm trying to care about you! No, who, who cares about you! Humph!..."</br>
</br>
Halfway through her words, Lin Lin's tone suddenly softened.</br>
</br>
Her two small fists were held by Jiang Chen's palms.</br>
</br>
Feeling the warmth, the pair of tightened fists trembled and gradually loosened.</br>
</br>
Strange, digitalized humans shouldn't feel hot...</br>
</br>
"I will definitely come back safely."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently squeezing Lin Lin's little hands and responded to the eyes escaping around. Then he smiled.</br>
</br>
"I promise you."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In the morning of the next day, Jiang Chen held another "family meeting" that he didn't have for a long time to continue to discuss the same issue.</br>
</br>
After a brief introduction, the silence lasted for a long time. Then, Sun Jiao sighed and broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"How about... I go?"</br>
</br>
"No, sister is Miss General. Either you or brother-in-law must stay here." Sun Xiaorou shook her head.</br>
</br>
Although very reluctant, Sun Jiao was more understanding. She just sighed and gave up the idea.</br>
</br>
Then, after a long debate, she looked at Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
"How about... you? Remember to look after him for me! Otherwise, we'll have to add another pair of chopsticks at home."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen maliciously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen revealed a helpless expression.</br>
</br>
Am I that scandalous?</br>
</br>
However, the thought only existed for a moment and he agreed himself.</br>
</br>
Uh... seems like I really am?</br>
</br>
After Xiaorou heard her sister's words, she smiled but did not immediately agree.</br>
</br>
Just then, a hand slowly raised up and was accompanied by a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Can... can I go?"</br>
</br>
All eyes focused on her.</br>
</br>
Scared by all the gazes on her, Yao Yao almost put down her hand again.</br>
</br>
"If… if I can't, then... just..."</br>
</br>
She weakly defended herself and was just about to give up on the idea, when something in her mind pushed her further.</br>
</br>
The little girl shook her head with force and shook away her weakness. With courage, she no longer doubted herself. Her hands clinched tight and she looked at Jiang Chen with certainty.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao?</br>
</br>
Although the fact that Yao Yao could have the courage to suggest the idea impressed Jiang Chen, bringing Yao Yao...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was hesitant.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he favored Sun Xiaorou more. Whether it was her force or intelligence, it made more sense to choose her. She could be a bodyguard, an advisor, and at night...</br>
</br>
Of course, this was not to say that he did not like Yao Yao. On the contrary, he liked this well-behaved and gentle girl. Hugging her had a kind of magic that could make him feel peaceful and happy.</br>
</br>
But he was going to the battlefield. If he must use some energy to take care of Yao Yao, he was worried that accidents may happen to her.</br>
</br>
She seemed to have read Jiang Chen's hesitation as she lowered her head and whispered.</br>
</br>
"I'll be very obedient, super obedient... and, I will cook too..."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao began to blush as her face turned completely red and she lowered her head even more.</br>
</br>
Just now, she also realized her ability didn't seem to fit a combat role? On the battlefield, she wouldn't be of help to big brother and would instead become cumbersome...</br>
</br>
Just as little loli was about to cry, Lin Lin suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"Eden Technology."</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin and wondered why she would inexplicably say this.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I suddenly remembered," Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen, "The headquarters of Eden Technology is in Shangjing."</br>
</br>
"Eden Technology?" Xiaorou pressed her finger against her lower lip, "Is that the Garden of Eden technology?"</br>
</br>
"The Garden of Eden Project is developed by Eden Technology, but the Garden of Eden Project is just one of Eden Technology's projects," Lin Lin said, "In addition to the Garden of Eden Project, Eden Technology had also led many Pan-Asia Cooperation brainstorming projects."</br>
</br>
"Brainstorming projects?" Jiang Chen had to interrupt.</br>
</br>
"Stupid. As the name suggests," Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen as if he was an idiot and began to explain.</br>
</br>
World War Three broke out in 2171, but it began to brew as early as the economic crisis of 2150. When the think tanks of all the countries reached the same conclusion, being that the probability of war breaking out being more than 50%, then the war was inevitable.</br>
</br>
It was just the question of who would take the first shot.</br>
</br>
In order to become a survivor of the war, the countries began to throw the continuously depreciated currency into the research institute. The Scientific Ethics Committee that originally restricted the academic world also began to exist only as a formality. Various humane or inhumane experiments began to surface.</br>
</br>
Not just weapons, but also projects like fallout shelter projects and post-war recovery plans.</br>
</br>
And all of these research projects were jokingly called the brainstorming projects by Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
In addition, some projects could only be described as brainstorming projects.</br>
</br>
Including FEV virus, Genetic Vaccines, the Holy Shield System, Fallout Shelter No.005... These were the products of the bewildered thoughts of scientific research institutions around the world. Some of which had a miraculous effect, while others didn't quite serve the purpose they intended to serve.</br>
</br>
Of course, there were still some more difficult to define.</br>
</br>
For example, another epic research project of Eden Technology – Cell Bank of Eden.</br>
</br>
As one of the "brainstorming projects" during the war preparation period, Eden Technology scientists used multiple sets of quantum computers to laterally compare hundreds of millions of human somatic DNA sequences, deducing the original DNA sequence of humans and restoring the cells of modern human ancestors.</br>
</br>
"...so, this thing finally proved that humans evolved from monkeys?" Jiang Chen had a strange expression.</br>
</br>
Apart from this reason, he really couldn't think of any other purpose.</br>
</br>
"It is not to prove such a superficial problem." Lin Lin glared at Jiang Chen. "In the pre-war preparation period, all national research projects had only two intentions. One was to kill the enemy with the most efficient and cheapest means. The other one was to survive."</br>
</br>
"Then the cell bank..." Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"I need the information inside," Lin Lin said bluntly. "When I was in hospital, I heard my father mention this cell bank. It's hard to say now, but I can be sure that the information inside is crucial."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. "I will pay attention to it."</br>
</br>
"Are we are not discussing who should go with Jiang Chen?" Sun Jiao was still a bit let down.</br>
</br>
"The security level of the cell bank is Class A. If you don't want to mess with the 3,000 security drones inside, it is best to bring a hacker." Lin Lin smiled and put her arm around Yao Yao's shoulder. "Last year, Yao Yao's hacking ability already received a S rating."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
Being hugged by Lin Lin, the little girl blushed. She looked around with uneasiness, then shyly said.</br>
</br>
"It's not something worth mentioning..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Can I count on you?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Her eyes shone with the glory of hope. Yao Yao nodded hard and vowed, "I… I will work very hard!"</br>
</br>
"You don't have to work too hard. With Yao Yao's level, you can do it easily." Sun Xiaorou also grinned, while she covered her mouth. She also expressed her certainty to Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Then it's decided!" Sun Jiao said, "Yao Yao will go. Yao Yao, remember to look after this bad guy for me! Don't let him bring another girl back!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made a helpless expression. "Let's not talk about the last sentence yet... Can you change my nickname first?"</br>
</br>
"No, brother-in-law is a big bad guy." Sun Xiaorou chucked and turned to Yao Yao. "Well... I'm most worried about Yao Yao. If it is Yao Yao, Yao Yao might be eaten by the big bad wolf?"</br>
</br>
Eyes stared straight at the table, Yao Yao's head was lowered, silent. She had a silly smile on and her cheeks to her earlobe were completely red.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared viciously at Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
"Am I that bad?"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou made an innocent expression.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was Jiang Chen's illusion. At this moment, he accidentally saw a hint of disappointment in Yao Yao's excited expression.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1155: A Disaster Caused by a Can of Canned Food</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The wind, sharp as knife, gusted across the frozen soil.</br>
</br>
It was the middle of autumn, but the brick and gravel was covered by a layer of frost.</br>
</br>
The boots stepped on the rubble between the broken walls and made a creaking sound. The cold muzzle pointed at every shadow inside the ruins and fired occasionally. Black cotton gloves searched through the blood-stained bodies as they did not miss a single loot.</br>
</br>
Even a winter coat, rugged, was dissected of its burnt cotton core and temperature control chip and loaded onto the supply truck.</br>
</br>
As for the corpses completely looted, they were piled up in an open area. The hungry mutants feasted on them and saved them the effort of incineration.</br>
</br>
Incineration required fuel, and with winter on the way, they didn't want to waste a single bit of fuel, let alone waste it on the dead.</br>
</br>
Five hundred meters away from the Badaling Military Outpost, hundreds of different types of tanks were quietly parked on the open ground, surrounded by dozens of base vehicles the size of old-fashioned trains. The large-sized tires sank into the dirt, and the four-mounted crawler carried the entire carriage.</br>
</br>
Lines of soldiers wore kinetic skeletons and patrolled the camp. Even Death Claws could sense the deadliness from the organized force. They gritted their sharp fangs, but didn't dare to advance a single step.</br>
</br>
These Russians never set up camp.</br>
</br>
The base vehicles surrounded by tanks were their barracks, warehouses and even factories. With the chassis lowered, the workers could pick up the hammers and sickles and begin working.</br>
</br>
They used to be CCCP Border Guards, stationed in the frozen soil in the easternmost part of Siberia, to defend against NATO in Alaska across the sea. They inherited the legacy of the Soviets and ended their mission in the tenth year after the war. They began to migrate south.</br>
</br>
No longer with an organization, they were like the nomads a few centuries ago, and cities were their pasture.</br>
</br>
From the wilderness of the land of the extreme east of Siberia, all the way to the south, to the land of Pan-Asia Cooperation. Just like countless locusts, they crushed the seed of civilization and ravaged the ruins of the city until nothing was left...</br>
</br>
In order to survive, they had already pushed their survival skill to the limit. No one knew the essence of scavenging more than they did. Even the most experienced scavengers in Wanghai would feel hopeless scavenging a city visited by the Russians.</br>
</br>
Now, they finally survived the barren land and arrived at the fabled rich soil...</br>
</br>
"The weather here is comparable to our spring."</br>
</br>
The man with a full moustache on the chair looked out the window and grinned. The wrinkles on his face twisted together. If he had an eye patch and a captain's hat, he would look like a pirate from centuries ago.</br>
</br>
On the table in front of him, there was a small half bottle of vodka. The galvanized sickle and hammer had worn out and it left only the bare surface.</br>
</br>
</br>
He had been drinking this bottle for almost half a year. He usually would leave it in his box, except for when he was in a good mood. He would unscrew the cork, have a small sip, and reminiscent the good old times.</br>
</br>
Obviously, his mood was great.</br>
</br>
Quite great.</br>
</br>
Just as he looked out of the window, the door of the base vehicle was pushed open. A middle-aged man in a CCCP military coat stepped his boot in. The man then stood straight and saluted.</br>
</br>
"The supply statistics are complete."</br>
</br>
"How is the harvest?" Yegor asked, relaxed.</br>
</br>
"Quite great! More than fifty boxes of nutrient supplies above Grade C. Enough to last us for half a month," Sminov replied.</br>
</br>
"Indeed, the rich soil," Yegor raised an eyebrow before a cruel smile appeared. The wrinkles on his face became more and more menacing. "A military outpost harvest is almost the same as a survivor settlement in the Siberian wasteland."</br>
</br>
He was smiling happily, although in the eyes of others, this smile was horrifying.</br>
</br>
"In addition, we found this in their commander's personal belongings." Sminov took an aluminum can from his waist and handed it over.</br>
</br>
The smile on Yegor's face froze.</br>
</br>
Then it was shock, disbelief, and ecstasy.</br>
</br>
He grabbed a can on the table, grabbed the dagger on the table, and cut a hole in the can. The oily gravy immediately oozed out along the edge of the knife. In less than ten seconds, the entire room was filled with the smell of marinated beef.</br>
</br>
Sminov swallowed and looked away. He tried his best not to look at the can.</br>
</br>
Yegor smeared the blade against his tongue, felt the aroma spread out on his taste buds, and licked his tongue. He tried to make the deliciousness stay on the tip of his tongue longer. Right now, he was almost in tears because of excitement.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Yegor woke up.</br>
</br>
He first glanced at Sminov and saw that he didn't look in his direction. Then he covered the crack on the can with his thumb and turned the can on its back. He saw that the bottom of the can had a small line of text.</br>
</br>
[Fishbone Brand Canned Beef]</br>
</br>
[Materials: beef, salt, monosodium glutamate, spices...]</br>
</br>
[Production Date: 2192]</br>
</br>
Sure enough, it was produced after the war!</br>
</br>
Yegor felt his heart pounding, just like a beautiful woman had stripped naked and was teasing him.</br>
</br>
Canned beef!</br>
</br>
He couldn't remember the last time he ate meat.</br>
</br>
Ten years ago? Fifteen years ago?</br>
</br>
However, the most exciting thing he wanted to shout was, the whatever bone base was not afraid of other people knowing its location, it even left another line of text after the date of production.</br>
</br>
[Origin: Wanghai Sixth Street Food Processing Factory]</br>
</br>
Yegor stared at Sminov as he put the canned beef aside,</br>
</br>
"How many more canned beefs do we have?"</br>
</br>
Sminov lowered his head and replied.</br>
</br>
"That's all. But in the private baggage of other soldiers, we also found something like compressed crackers, instant noodles, etc..."</br>
</br>
"Are they all Fishbone Brand?"</br>
</br>
"Precisely..." Sminov nodded.</br>
</br>
"Excellent!" Yegor inserted the knife into the aluminum table, and suddenly stood up, laughing hysterically. "Great Fishbone! God bless East Siberian Border Guards! Sure enough, heaven is in the south!"</br>
</br>
After that, Yegor glanced at Sminov and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Under my command, the army shall advance 20 kilometers in the southeast direction. In addition, send the 13th Tank Squadron into the city to test the strength of Shangjing survivors! If they are just a bunch of fat sheep, we'll push in!"</br>
</br>
"Yes Sir!" Sminov saluted and left.</br>
</br>
"After taking over Shangjing, we will go all the way to the south, and take a look at Wanghai! We'll see how much cattle they have, how much fertile land they have! "</br>
</br>
Looking at the canned beef on the table, Yegor laughed.</br>
</br>
All the resistance would be turned into a dust under the tanks!</br>
</br>
No one could stop his steel torrent!</br>
</br>
No one! No organization!</br>
</br>
Yegor gazed emotionally into the distance as he licked his thumb full of meat juice.</br>

</br>
"ACHOOO!!"</br>
</br>
On the deck of AS Order, Jiang Chen, who was just having the moment of his life, suddenly sneezed.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel cold?" The little Loli next to him immediately handed him a tissue, then softly said, "Would you like me to go get you a coat?"</br>
</br>
"No, no," Jiang Chen took the tissue in embarrassment and cleaned himself, then tossed the tissue down the ship, "I don't think a coat is necessary. I am not cold. I guess someone is thinking about me. (1)"</br>
</br>
Although Yao Yao was still worried, she nodded in acknowledgment.</br>
</br>
That's probably true since when big brother left, everyone was very sad...</br>
</br>
But the thought of big brother belonging to her for the next month made her feel warm inside.</br>
</br>
I hope that there will be no twists and turns in this journey.</br>
</br>
The girl prayed silently.</br>
</br>
Above Yancheng, the steel's bow peaked out from the clouds like the head of a great white shark. The giant and menacing jaw ripped through the clouds ahead. The vortex engine on the wings on both sides left behind long marks, dividing the sky. Ten airships engraved with the NAC badge followed, led by AS Order, they were arranged into a V-shaped formation above the clouds, advancing toward the north.</br>
</br>
The survivors who lingered between the ruins looked up and envied the behemoth as they showed a look of fear and uneasiness. The brutal mutated humans hid, fearful of peeking their heads out of their windows. Even the dull-headed Dead Claw trembled under the power of NAC.</br>
</br>
5,000 expeditionary forces; 5,000 high-spirited soldiers.</br>
</br>
United under the banner of the General, no one would doubt the victory of this expedition.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the far north and narrowed his eyes as the cold wind blew onto his face.</br>
</br>
The outline of Chuyun Port was looming in the distance and there were only two hundred more kilometers before they leave the province. CCCP tanks already rolled into Badaling, so the survivors of Shangjing probably wouldn't be able to withstand them for too long. A tough battle awaited the expeditionary army.</br>
</br>
The Russians in this world were likely not be as friendly as the Russians in the other world...</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen would never have thought that a can of beef already made NAC a target for those Russians that just rolled into the Central Plains.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, indicating the origin on the can was something he proposed. As for the purpose, it was meant to "gain investments" and "attract immigrants". The historical data also proved that many inland survivors immigrated to Wanghai after they saw the origin on the can.</br>
</br>
The capability to produce food and trade food meant strength in the wasteland.</br>
</br>
As for the troubles associated with the idea...</br>
</br>
They never mattered. Too many people targeted NAC, and NAC never worried about having another enemy. Even without the words on the can, being such a large force, NAC would never be able to hide. Also, due to being such a large force Jiang Chen never feared.</br>
</br>
</br>
Soon, he would let those Russians know who the real target is.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The steel fleet rolled on the city road. Five tanks and five infantry vehicles were divided into two front and rear echelons, quietly moving in the direction of Sixth Ring Road north of Changping.</br>
</br>
They did not encounter any resistance along the away.</br>
</br>
As early as the fall of the Badaling Military Outpost, the survivors of the northern suburbs were evacuated to the Haidian area as they dragged their families into larger survivor settlements. Other than two Dead Claws who asked for their own deaths, they did not see a single soul.</br>
</br>
Sedov, with the captain's helmet, sat inside the tank. He scanned the surrounding streets emotionlessly through a digital wide-angle screen.</br>
</br>
When he passed a derelict supermarket, he suddenly sneered.</br>
</br>
He raised his hand and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
The tanks and vehicles stopped.</br>
</br>
The street was deathly silent, just as if a storm was forming.</br>
</br>
Soon, two of the infantry vehicles opened its hatch and released a half-human-tall spider robot.</br>
</br>
Eight steel mechanical legs moved rapidly, and soon the spider robot rushed to the intersection of the street a hundred meters ahead. It stopped next to a toppled garbage can and then two robotic arms popped out before reaching inside the tank.</br>
</br>
Just as the robotic arms touched the plastic bag inside, an explosion suddenly swallowed the robot, sending half of the street ablaze.</br>
</br>
"Three o'clock, high explosive munition. Fire!"</br>
</br>
The muzzles of the five tanks aimed at the supermarket on the side of the road.</br>
</br>
Without the slightest sign, five explosions detonated.</br>
</br>
With a loud bang, the entire supermarket seemed to be ravaged by a storm and almost collapsed The survivors hiding in the supermarket screamed and fled, but they were quickly hit by the second round of shells. The already rundown supermarket was destroyed and collapsed in ruins.</br>
</br>
"Damn it!"</br>
</br>
In the building five hundred meters away, a man in a winter jacket smashed his fist against the table.</br>
</br>
Based on this plan, when those Russian tanks passed by the roadside bomb, they would detonate the bomb. Then the soldiers ambushing in the supermarket would use rocket launchers to take out the infantry vehicles in the back.</br>
</br>
However, the plan failed before it even got executed.</br>
</br>
"Where is the problem," gritting his teeth, the man looked at the battlefield two streets away with gloom in his eyes.</br>
</br>
The ambush failed, so the only option is to stop them with bodies.</br>
</br>
DADADADADA-</br>
</br>
The infantry vehicles dispersed, and a dozen soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons jumped out of the hatch and searched for strategic locations.</br>
</br>
The heavy machine guns spat out its furry, sweeping across the collapsed walls. They tore the concrete bunkers and the flesh of Shangjing survivors together.</br>
</br>
"Their firepower is too strong!" With their backs against the wall, the survivors with "Iron Hammer" rocket launcher were all horrified. They roared into the radio on their shoulder, "WE NEED BACKUP! If we don't see reinforcements in three minutes, you fight this yourself!"</br>
</br>
They were not soldiers, they were just experienced hunters.</br>
</br>
However, what was in front of them was not prey but fully armored predators.</br>
</br>
"...reinforcement is on its way."</br>
</br>
"DAMMIT!" The soldier spat out and opened the safety for the rocket launcher. He was just about to poke out his head out when he was immediately forced down by a few bullets.</br>
</br>
These border guards knew how to use the least number of bullets to maximize the suppression capability. Through a single exchange, the skill gap between the two sides were exposed.</br>
</br>
However, at this time, dozens of plate-sized drones suddenly emerged from the shadows and surrounded the CCCP infantry vehicles from all directions.</br>
</br>
"Activate the EMP Defense Module"</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Soldiers in kinetic skeletons hid behind the vehicle and prepared for EMP defense. In loud and deafening static noises, the EMP weapon instantly deactivated the drones rushing to the armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
But it was futile!</br>
</br>
The deactivated drones continued to maintain their momentum, slamming against the armored vehicles. At first, the Russians didn't seem to be bothered, but when the drones hit the steel armor, their expressions changed.</br>
</br>
The incendiary bombs under the drones exploded, spilling vicious fuel all over the armored vehicle. The armored vehicle was instantly swallowed by flames and turned into a giant fireball. The two soldiers hiding behind the armored vehicles were unfortunately splashed by the fuel, as they screamed in agony.</br>
</br>
These survivors didn't use control fuzes, but the most primitive trigger fuzes!</br>
</br>
The burning armored vehicle quickly reversed and crashed into a house on the side of the road. The fuel quickly entered the vent and burned into the interior of the armored vehicle. The driver pushed the door open and rushed out of the armored car, frantically rolling on the ground, as he desperately tried to pull the clothes off of his body.</br>
</br>
However, his dying struggle was not successful even after he turned into charcoal...</br>
</br>
Through the wide-angle screen, looking at the flame still burning, Sedov's eyes were emotionless.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to order the next attack, the voice of the advisor sounded in his ear.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, come back."</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
"Retreat, this is the order."</br>
</br>
Sminov didn't deal with any nonsense. After he issued the order, he shut off the radio.</br>
</br>
[Retreat]</br>
</br>
Gloom was written all over Sedov's face as he looked at the red line flashing on the screen.</br>
</br>
It was the first time he lost an armored vehicle since their journey down south.</br>
</br>
Although he desperately wanted to crush these bugs with his tracks, an order was absolute for the Eastern Siberian Border Guards.</br>
</br>
Sedov's fist slammed against the wall as he gritted his teeth.</br>
</br>
"Retreat!"</br>
</br>
After they received the order to retreat, the infantries moved closer to the armored vehicles, returned inside, and began to withdraw...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1157: The Helpless Survivors</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Russians came in like a storm, but they also retreated like a gust of wind.</br>
</br>
In less than half a minute, the entire reconnaissance team retreated from the Sixth Ring Road toward the direction of Badaling. Even the burnt armored vehicle was hooked behind another armored vehicle as they retreated.</br>
</br>
The survivors, using the rifles supporting themselves, walked out from the ruins. They helped the medical staff that rushed over to lift the wounded onto stretchers and began digging up their comrades under the concrete pieces...</br>
</br>
The result was an armored vehicle being destroyed.</br>
</br>
As for the loss... it was insurmountable.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The headquarters of the Pan-Asia Cooperation was located in the Inner Ring Road of Shangjing Center.</br>
</br>
It used to be the political center of Pan-Asia Cooperation, where the representatives of the major regions held meetings. After the war, due to the nuclear winter, X1 bacteria leakage, and other incidents, the Pan-Asia Cooperation political forces moved inland. The place was soon emptied and then completely abandoned.</br>
</br>
Due to the quality of the building, it was once occupied by survivors and existed as a temporary shelter.</br>
</br>
There was a time when the survivors of Shangjing entered a painfully dark period because of the tightness of their living supplies. During this period, survivors not only need to be wary of the mutants hiding in the shadows but also needed to defend against ambushes hidden in the dark.</br>
</br>
Not only mutants were hunted, but scavengers that wandered on the wasteland, and even survivor settlements with a weak garrison. The major survivors' settlements attacked each other to compete for scarce living supplies, to compete for the remains of pre-war civilization, and to compete to enslave the weak...</br>
</br>
However, unlike Wanghai, the dark age of Shangjing soon came to an end.</br>
</br>
A hibernated refugee shelter with 5,000 militia was opened. The first thing that this well-equipped force did when they returned to the surface was to try and establish pre-war order in Shangjing and restore the glory of Pan-Asia Cooperation.</br>
</br>
However, unfortunately, the seed that the Pan-Asia Cooperation planted before the war did not sprout. Treating the survivors who had struggled on the wasteland for years with the same attitude as to how they would treat refugees soon meant that the group of idealists quickly died under the guns of the mob.</br>
</br>
However, they still played a positive role, that is, they used decisive actions to eliminate some of the most ruthless survivor settlements, then completely destroyed the cannibals hiding in the gutter, and almost wiped out the mutated humans. A small number of people recognized these facts and no longer worked against the flow of history to become a member of the survivors.</br>
</br>
They became the powerful kind of survivors.</br>
</br>
Later, under the coordination of this militia group, many survivors were convened, and a treaty was established. For example, the establishment of the Shangjing Survivor Alliance designated the area inside Third Ring Road as a safe area. The alliance prohibited the use of weapons of mass destruction and established the Badaling Military Outpost to stop the migration of mutants from the northern wilderness...</br>
</br>
</br>
The Pan-Asia Cooperation building was used as the headquarters of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance and was garrisoned by the survivors from different settlements.</br>
</br>
In the entire city of Shangjing, this location could be referred to as the safest area. Due to this fact, survivors spontaneously gathered around this area to build a free trade market.</br>
</br>
All major merchant fleets have traveled to and from here. After more than a decade of development, the place became a small city no inferior to the Sixth Street in terms of scale...</br>
</br>
Today, in a rare event, the heads of the major settlemnets gathered together. The Shangjing Survivors Alliance was holding a meeting of the highest level.</br>
</br>
"CCCP tanks have rolled to our doorstep." At the head of the conference table, the man with a square face looked around at the leaders of the forces in the room, with a gloomy expression on his face. "This monster is more frightening than any other mutants that we have encountered before. Shangjing is at a critical moment for survival. If anyone has thought of any good ideas, please bring them forward."</br>
</br>
The man with a square face was Ding Liwei, the head of the Second Militia Corps of Shangjing. Although the strength of the Second Militia Group was not as strong as when it first left the fallout shelter, it remained a powerful force and ranked top among the survivor forces in Shangjing.</br>
</br>
The man on his left was Wan Peng, the manager of Sunday Club.</br>
</br>
While the name sounded ordinary and didn't even resemble the name of a survivor force, on the land north of the Yellow River, no one would dare to despise the name Sunday Club or Wan Peng.</br>
</br>
As early as before the war, Sunday Club was the top destination for the upper class in Shangjing. And Wan Peng was the security head of this club. There were a large number of security robots in the building and a large number of living supplies stored in the warehouse. At the beginning of the X1 bacteria leak, when the entire Pan-Asia Cooperation's southern regions were collapsing, the club's boss went to the launch center, and Wan Peng naturally became the individual with the highest level of authority in the club.</br>
</br>
As the security head of this club, he was someone who dared to engage in fights. With the innate resources of Sunday Club, he seized the opportunity at the beginning of the apocalypse and soon became a dominant force in Shangjing.</br>
</br>
If the Second Militia Group did not return to the surface, he would be the king of Shangjing.</br>
</br>
"I think that the army of CCCP is not a force that we can resist alone. We may wish to send ambassadors and ask what their intentions are? If I remember correctly, after the 2174 Armistice Agreement came into effect, CCCP and PAC should be in the state of armistice. If we can reach a settlement with them..." Wan Peng frowned.</br>
</br>
"There is no such thing as if," a man in a trench coat shook his head. "If they are going to talk to us, they should be outside the concrete wall of the Badaling Military Outpost."</br>
</br>
There were no responses at the conference table; no one else spoke.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei sighed.</br>
</br>
Although he was not willing to admit it, the facts were all available to him. The Shangjing Survivors Alliance was now in a state of helplessness. It would be a wild dream if the remaining tanks and armored vehicles in the militia alone could stop the CCCP fleet.</br>
</br>
However, he was not willing to surrender.</br>
</br>
In his bones, he still regarded himself as a soldier of the Pan-Asia Cooperation. Even if everyone was disappointed with the Pan-Asia Cooperation and the World Government, he was not willing to disarm in front of his former enemy.</br>
</br>
That shame would be more painful than killing him.</br>
</br>
Just then, the old man in a cotton gown seated to his right sighed and broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"We have asked for help from the NAC. According to the news brought by Pope Lu, the General of NAC is willing to send reinforcements."</br>
</br>
The words of the old man made the eyes of everyone in the room turn brighter.</br>
</br>
Although Wanghai was thousands of kilometers away from here, everyone in the room has heard of the legendary NAC. Even if they could forget the name of the NAC General, they would never forget the taste of the Fishbone's canned food...</br>
</br>
NAC's products in the market outside of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building were among the best-selling goods.</br>
</br>
The archbishop of the Guardian Sect would not be lie.</br>
</br>
If NAC were here, then they would have a fighting chance against the CCCP!</br>
</br>
While the faces around the table were full of excitement, only Ding Liwei remained rationale.</br>
</br>
"Reinforcement? I'm afraid this reinforcement is not free?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Archbishop Xu Tiannan nodded as he helplessly said, "What if it is not free? Do we still have a opportunity to bargain?"</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's expression was a bit stiff, and he soon let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Yes, can they really bargain?</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan hesitantly said.</br>
</br>
"Just..."</br>
</br>
"Just?" Wan Peng frowned.</br>
</br>
"Just that Wanghai is thousands of kilometers away from Shangjing. Even if they want to help us, it's going to be a dangerous journey here. Even when they arrive, I'm afraid it's going to be too late." Xu Tiannan smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Everyone felt as if they fell from cloud nine to the bottom of the valley in a split second.</br>
</br>
Many of them owned merchants' fleets and they naturally understood the dangers in this journey. Even without considering the zombies and mutants, there were countless raiders.</br>
</br>
When the NAC reinforcements cross the Yellow River, the Shangjing Survivors Alliance would already become CCCP prisoners.</br>
</br>
Just then, there were eager footsteps outside the conference room.</br>
</br>
Everyone's heart clenched.</br>
</br>
Did the CCCP already launch a strike?</br>
</br>
The door of the conference room opened. A bodyguard walked in and whispered to Ding Liwei.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's expression didn't change. After listening to the bodyguard, he ordered.</br>
</br>
"Let him in."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The bodyguard nodded and left the meeting room.</br>
</br>
Soon, a guard ran into the conference room, gasping for air.</br>
</br>
In front of the leaders, he lowered his head in fear before quickly articulating what he needed to say. He was speaking so fast that he almost bit his tongue.</br>
</br>
"Report! There are a lot of airships in the airspace 20 kilometers away from Shangjing!"</br>
</br>
Everyone was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Airships?" Xu Tiannan was also shocked, but soon, his shock was replaced with ecstasy.</br>
</br>
He suddenly thought of the news from Bishop Lu Minghui. NAC used airships as a means of transportation in the trade routes to Hongcheng and Yizhou Island. In addition, they also built a giant airship made of steel!</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan quivered as he stood up. He left the conference table and walked to the guard in excitement.</br>
</br>
"Which direction are the airships coming from! Tell me now!"</br>
</br>
The guard stuttered as he looked at the archbishop.</br>
</br>
"From… from the South!"</br>
</br>
South!</br>
</br>
The direction of Wanghai!</br>
</br>
The direction of NAC!</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan's shoulders trembled with excitement, and the aged face turned red.</br>
</br>
Shangjing can be saved!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"That is Pingan Street!" Li Wang, the captain of AS Order, stood by Jiang Chen and pointed at the wall in the distance, "That is the most prosperous place in Shangjing. The building in the middle is the fabled Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, the political center of Pan-Asia Cooperation. Now, it's the political center of the survivors of Shangjing."</br>
</br>
Li Wang used to be the captain of Jiang Chen's guards, then was promoted as captain of AS Order during the expedition to Hongcheng. His mood was particularly high in this expedition with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The most prosperous place?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and laughed. "Why do I feel like it is more of a farm?"</br>
</br>
Li Wang laughed along with him. "Of course, you can't compare it with the Sixth Street. Based on the standards of these survivors, clean streets, stable order, and stores that accept crystals makes any place a paradise! At least within a few hundred kilometers, you can't find a more prosperous place than this."</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen's statement was still somewhat exaggerated.</br>
</br>
In any case, this place didn't look like a farm.</br>
</br>
The mighty concrete walls stopped the mutants and zombies outside. Shops and houses filled the streets. While the place didn't look prosper, it was filled with vitality. The hunters exchanged their prey for necessities and crystals; the mercenaries with weapons were bargaining with the merchants; the lone travelers were examining the rifles in the windows of the weapon store.</br>
</br>
In the corner of Pingan Street, several chimneys spewed out thick smoke, the furnaces smelted the waste into metal and sent it to the processing plant to make weapons or mechanical parts. This must be the legendary Industrial Zone of Pingan Street. If this place was compared with the Sixth Street four years ago, the industrialization here was at least twice as large as the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Without seeing the "prosperity" of the Sixth Street, Jiang Chen would probably exclaim about a "paradise" like this existing on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"Indeed, this place is in Shangjing. It's just unfortunate that they possess the legacy of pre-war civilization, but they never thought of doing anything with the legacy."</br>
</br>
"There is always a more reasonable choice in theory," Han Junhua focused on the decaying Pan-Asia Cooperation building and said, "But civilization itself is an irrational product. Just like this building. Who would have thought 30 years ago, in just 30 years, it would be run down to the point that there was no one to take care of it?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a brief moment, then turned his head to look at Han Junhua and smiled.</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect you to say something so interesting."</br>
</br>
"Is there anything wrong?"</br>
</br>
"No, just a little surprised."</br>
</br>
The airship flew near, and the outline of Pingan Street gradually became clear. Everything in the entire survivor settlement was in Jiang Chen's field of vision. But the people in the settlements all showed fear of the huge behemoths in the air.</br>
</br>
</br>
A guard on the concrete wall overcame the fear in his heart. He was preparing to aim the air defense machine gun before a veteran slapped him on the forehead. The veteran shouted. "Are you stupid? Do you think this can take that thing down? Go and report the situation! GO!"</br>
</br>
Just as the guard ran to deliver the message, the survivors of the entire Pingan Street were watching the airships pierce through the clouds like their nemesis.</br>
</br>
The expected alarm did not sound, and the guard who went to report quickly ran back. The 3,000 soldiers on Pingan Street received the order that the airships were not enemies, but NAC reinforcements!</br>
</br>
The soldiers standing on the wall were relieved.</br>
</br>
In just three minutes, many people's palms were already oozing with sweat.</br>
</br>
They didn't have the courage to resist when they saw the menacing cannons under the steel airship.</br>
</br>
Even the giant walls that stopped thousands of mutants would not last a single round against this size of an electromagnetic pulse cannon.</br>
</br>
Soon, the top leaders of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance stepped out of the Pan-Asia Cooperation building, arrived at the entrance of Pingan Street by car, and boarded the tower by elevator. They went to a radio station and Ding Liwei took the intercom from the hands of an officer, looked at the airships in the sky, and then cleared his throat.</br>
</br>
"Ding Liwei, the representative of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance, the head of the Second Militia Group of Shangjing. On behalf of all the survivors of Shangjing, I want to extend my appreciation for your reinforcement."</br>
</br>
The radio was silent for a long time.</br>
</br>
Then, after a series of static noises, Jiang Chen's voice rang out at the end of the intercom.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, NAC General. No need for formalities. Tell your people to clear an area for us."</br>
</br>
No sense of politeness at all.</br>
</br>
With ten transport airships, AS Order descended and flew over Pingan Street. The shadows shrouded the entire settlement. The survivors all paused what they were doing to gaze into the sky, staring straight at the huge monster on top of their heads they did not dare to even breathe heavily.</br>
</br>
AS Order stopped outside the northern wall of Pingan Street, then lowered the chamber on its belly.</br>
</br>
A platform filled with supply boxes tied by four graphene cables landed slowly on the ground. Immediately afterward, the soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons hooked themselves onto the graphene cables and quickly descended to the ground one by one.</br>
</br>
In less than a minute, AS Order deployed two hundred engineer soldiers onto the ground.</br>
</br>
"Do these primitive people know how to clean their homes?" Looking at the zombies wandering the streets, and the raiders behind the half-collapsed apartment buildings, Li Wang, with one foot on the guardrail, grinned.</br>
</br>
"Since we are allies, we'll help them a little." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Li Wang took back his foot and stood upright.</br>
</br>
The zombies began to gather under AS Order when they smelt the breath of living humans. Just as the soldiers on Pingan Street were hesitating about opening the door or not, AS Order in the air began to move.</br>
</br>
Two quadruple air defense machine guns turned their muzzles and aimed at the zombies that were forming. Without the slightest omen, the two machine guns instantly spat out half-meter-long flame tongues.</br>
</br>
Only a short humming sound was heard before broken gravels were lifted into the air.</br>
</br>
The hailstorm of bullets unleashed from above tore the zombies into pieces. The mutants, hiding in the dark, all hid the menacing light in their eyes and fled when they witnessed the guns' destructive power.</br>
</br>
The NAC soldiers raised their rifles and fired sporadically on the dusty street, killing the remaining zombies who had luckily escaped.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen stood on the deck of AS Order and watched this scene from the above, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Do you think we can see Badaling from this location?"</br>
</br>
Li Wang, next to Jiang Chen, grinned as he rubbed his chin. "There is only a little more than 50 kilometers from the Second Ring Road to Badaling. We're flying in the sky, so it would be weird if they didn't see us."</br>
</br>
"Oh, I don't know what they would think after seeing our steel airship."</br>
</br>
Li Wang chuckled, "What else can they think? Maybe they will go back to where they came from?"</br>
</br>
"That's hard to say."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1159: Conditions</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"That's hard to say."</br>
</br>
A standoffish female voice interrupted the two's bloating.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua in a military uniform walked over and stood next to Jiang Chen. Then, she opened the holographic screen on her watch and launched a map of Shangjing. Her finger was pointed at a location two kilometers southeast of Badaling.</br>
</br>
"I studied the map of Shangjing and found this."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen looked at the spot Han Junhua's slender index finger pointed to, he saw the logo of a subway station on the map, and then frowned.</br>
</br>
"What is the problem with Line 35 subway station?"</br>
</br>
"Have you ever taken the subway?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen just wanted to say that he had taken the subway before, but he remembered that the subway he took seemed to be the subway in the 21st century. He knew nothing about the subway in this world...</br>
</br>
Wait, he was not completely clueless.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly remembered that he took a subway in Wanghai in the virtual world he met Lin Lin in. If the subway in Shangjing was similar to the subway in Wanghai...</br>
</br>
Without waiting for Jiang Chen to answer, Han Junhua paused for a second and continued. "The 40 subway lines in Shangjing are distributed in a circular shape. After renovations in the early 22nd century, the average depths are between 200 and 400 meters. The standard track width is capable of allowing two maglev trains to pass in parallel, but there is also a passage for armored vehicles to pass through in the middle, which is the 'combat tunnel' mentioned in the 2200 national defense white paper."</br>
</br>
When he heard Han Junhua's explanation, he started to realize it was more serious.</br>
</br>
"If I am the commander of CCCP, I'll occupy here," Han Junhua's index finger gently tapped on the location of the subway station. "As long as they occupy the entire subway line in Shangjing, their tanks can move freely in Shangjing."</br>
</br>
"If we use the electromagnetic pulse cannon to collapse it—"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua interrupted Li Wang and shook her head.</br>
</br>
"If the tunnel can be collapsed by electromagnetic pulse cannons, what is the significance of the combat tunnel? Originally, it was an underground passage prepared to prevent NATO from destroying the road traffic network. Disregarding the electromagnetic pulse cannon on AS Order, even NATO's ground-drilling missile had a hard time breaking through the special cement used as a protective layer."</br>
</br>
"What is your opinion?" Jiang Chen frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
"Complete the deployment immediately, and then withdraw AS Order and supply airships from the subway coverage area," Han Junhua's index finger drew a circle on the map. "What we don't know now is which CCCP force our enemy belonged to and what their air defense capability is. If their anti-aircraft vehicles move below us through the subway line, we are no different than sitting ducks in the air."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Within ten minutes, NAC completed the deployment of its first group of soldiers. A thousand expeditionary troops descended on the northern part of the wall of Pingan Street and began to set up camp.</br>
</br>
</br>
After seeing the firepower of AS Order, the survivors of Shangjing also witnessed the construction speed of the NAC.</br>
</br>
With the help of twenty engineering robots, concrete walls three-person tall quickly lifted off from the ground. Light and heavy machine guns and mortars were pushed onto the bunker, and barracks were also built one after another. Before the evening, a simple military base was completed.</br>
</br>
To ease the need for lookouts, NAC engineers placed explosives in the nearby buildings and exploded several buildings more than 20 stories tall.</br>
</br>
In deafening explosions, the buildings collapsed and completely blocked the passage to the northern part of Pingan Street, the zombies on the road were crushed into meat. If CCCP tanks wanted to pass this road, they must send engineers to clear the debris.</br>
</br>
Before dusk arrived, AS Order and the ten transport airships began to mobilize and moved in the direction of Qincheng. At the same time, Jiang Chen sent the Hunter Corps to the Badaling area to investigate the deployment of CCCP troops.</br>
</br>
When AS Order left with the transport airships, Pingan Street's gate opened under the giant wall.</br>
</br>
With a team of bodyguards, Ding Liwei and other high-ranking executives of the city gathered at the entrance of NAC's camp and expressed their intention to visit the soldiers.</br>
</br>
Next to Ding Liwei, Wan Peng glanced at the kinetic skeleton on the soldiers at the door and a flash of envy quickly appeared and disappeared from his eyes.</br>
</br>
The military factory in Pingan Street could also produce kinetic skeletons and even assemble power armors, but the cost of a kinetic skeleton was above 5,000 crystals, and the unit price of power armor was at least 10,000 crystals.</br>
</br>
Only his loyal guards were equipped with kinetic skeletons. As for the power armor, only his confidants had such a privilege.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei next to him was in a better situation. The Second Militia Group itself possessed a police model of the kinetic skeleton. If it wasn't for the war with the mutated humans more than a decade ago that ended up costing him heavily, he could have formed two battalions of power armors by now.</br>
</br>
However, even the soldiers of the Second Militia Group were nowhere as equipped as the NAC. Not only the soldiers patrolling wore kinetic skeletons, but there were also two power armors defending the area.</br>
</br>
My God, lowly guards also use power armors? How rich is the NAC!</br>
</br>
Or do their power armor and kinetic skeleton not cost money?</br>
</br>
Wan Peng was not the only one that was shocked, the executives of Shangjing Survivors Alliance all muttered in their mind. Just like that, the force of NAC already exerted psychological pressure on them.</br>
</br>
Even Ding Liwei of the Second Militia Corps and Xu Tiannan who invited the reinforcements didn't hold the most natural expressions.</br>
</br>
Although they were reinforcements, if the reinforcements were too strong, things may not end up well for them.</br>
</br>
After all, NAC's support came with a cost.</br>
</br>
Without leaving the executives out there for too long, the soldiers quickly received the order to permit passage. The two power armors stood aside, and the soldiers raised the railings to allow entry of the group.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, friends from Shangjing." Jiang Chen walked to the front of the group and extended his right hand, then he shook hands with the executives. After, he welcomed the group to head to the barrack that was in the middle of the camp.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei and Wan Peng exchanged looks and finally chose to accept Jiang Chen's invitation. The bodyguards with guns were left at the door, and the group walked with Jiang Chen inside the barrack.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat at the head of the conference table, after the crowd was seated, soldiers stepped forward and served tea for everyone.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's eyes were almost bulging out when he saw the tea-filled porcelain cups.</br>
</br>
While others may not recognize this luxury, as a former security head at a top club, he very well knew what floated in the cups. It was the best West Lake Green Tea, a luxury rare even before the war! But he was serving guests this?!</br>
</br>
Where did this guy get so many good things?</br>
</br>
"As the host, we should have set up a banquet for you, but we didn't expect to be entertained. We apologize for the situation." Xu Tiannan took a sip of the tea, and couldn't help but admire its fragrance, "great tea."</br>
</br>
"Not at all, just some ordinary tea," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei did not touch the tea on the table. He just looked at Jiang Chen. His sight was mixed with a bit of vigilance and distrust.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not care. The two sides were not connected, not to mention the fact that NAC's combat effectiveness was clearly more dominant. If there was no necessary vigilance, Jiang Chen would have doubts about how he has lived on the wasteland until now.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Ding Liwei finally spoke.</br>
</br>
"I have already long heard of Mr. Jiang's name. I didn't expect Mr. Jiang to personally head the troops. Please excuse us for not being the best host."</br>
</br>
"No need to worry, I'm not the kind of person who cares about formality."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then I am relieved." Ding Liwei smiled and paused for a while before saying, "Since Mr. Jiang is a direct person, then I will also be direct."</br>
</br>
"I am sure your reinforcements are not unconditional?"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1160: The Most Dangerous Place in Shangjing</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's words drew everyone's attention to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
No one naively thought NAC came to volunteer. Now Ding Liwei was straightforward, this made a lot of people breathe a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
Since it must be brought up eventually, it was better to deal with it sooner rather than later. Or by the time they resolved the conflict, the two sides would then fight over the same issue which would hurt their relationship.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a sip of the tea and said.</br>
</br>
"Of course, there is no free lunch."</br>
</br>
"I understand. Then, what are your conditions?" Looking at Jiang Chen, Ding Liwei went on to say, "To avoid unnecessary disputes in the future, we should discuss this matter first. What do you think?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Since Mr. Ding already brought this topic up, I certainly have no disagreeing opinion."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen extended a finger. "First, the military expenses of the expeditionary army will be borne by you."</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei, in a relaxed tone, responded, "This is not a problem. After all, you came so far to help us. We certainly will not let you do this for free. I just want to know how much the military expense will be?"</br>
</br>
"Not much," Jiang Chen laughed, "Ten million crystals sound about right."</br>
</br>
The conference table entered a strange silence.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's relaxed expression froze, Wan Peng's mouth began to twitch, and Xu Tiannan, who was drinking tea, almost spat it out of his mouth. All the survivors in the room had an unnatural expression on their faces.</br>
</br>
Ten million crystals!</br>
</br>
That's enough to buy more than two hundred power armors!</br>
</br>
They could certainly afford the crystals. But by the time they raise the amount, their treasury would be empty!</br>
</br>
"Ahem, Mr. Jiang, we're in a serious setting." Xu Tiannan wiped the tea off of the corner of his mouth, as he unnaturally smiled. "Ten million crystals... This, this is a bit too much."</br>
</br>
"Is it?" Jiang Chen revealed a very helpless expression. "But I've already given you a discount."</br>
</br>
"A discount?! Even the most powerful mercenary group in Shangjing has an employment price of only one hundred crystals per soldier, and you directly ask us for ten million?! Mr. Jiang, we are sincerely trying to meet your offer but you don't have to be this greedy," Wan Peng burst out.</br>
</br>
"Do the mercenaries have kinetic skeletons?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen used just one sentence to stuff back all of Wan Peng's words.</br>
</br>
"Do they have power armors?"</br>
</br>
"Do they have tanks?"</br>
</br>
"Do they have airships?"</br>
</br>
Looking at increasing awkward expressions of the survivor executives, Jiang Chen opened his hands.</br>
</br>
"Since they don't have those things, how can you expect us to charge the same price as them? Our NAC expeditionary force has equipped every soldier with a kinetic skeleton, and we have two companies of power armors. Do you still think ten million crystals is too expensive?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head, touched his chin, and then muttered to himself, "Hmmm... now I feel that I'm losing money."</br>
</br>
"Ten million is good, no loss at all," Xu Tiannan eyed Wan Peng and Ding Liwei and then quickly accepted the offer. Finally, he smiled at Jiang Chen. "It's just ten million is a lot. I don't think we can get the money ready for you right away."</br>
</br>
If the crystals are gone, they can send a hunting team to the suburbs for a round and at least make ten thousand crystals back. But if their lives are gone, the warehouses full of crystals would just be gifts for those barbarians from the north!</br>
</br>
"Archbishop Xu is very easy to negotiate with," Jiang Chen laughed and looked at the other survivors. "What about everyone else?"</br>
</br>
"I have no opinion," Someone said with a blank expression.</br>
</br>
"Ten million is fine... Everyone will pay together anyway," Someone said while bitterly laughing.</br>
</br>
"I suggest that the money will be paid in proportion to the number of people. There are only six hundred survivors in my settlement. We just don't have that many crystals." Someone held a difficult expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"Garbage! Your building is the richest in the Dongcheng District! Six hundred people? Heh, I am afraid you have not counted the slaves as people?" Someone immediately revealed the truth.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Listening to the quarrel around the conference table, Jiang Chen waved his hand and signaled them to quiet down.</br>
</br>
"As to how the ten million will be paid out and by who, you can go back and discuss on your own. It's okay if you don't have crystals. Real estate and industrial equipment are all accepted. We are not picky." With a bright smile, Jiang Chen paused, then in a serious tone, he went on to say, "In addition, there is intelligence that CCCP tanks may use the nearby subway lines. Before they become familiar with the lines, I suggest you transfer your personnel and assets to Pingan Street."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that when he finished the sentence, the faces of the survivors didn't show panic and fear, but they all shared a peculiar expression.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Seeing the survivors all stared at each other in confusion, Jiang Chen asked, "Is there a problem?"</br>
</br>
"Are you sure they will use the subway line?" Ding Liwei said with a strange expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"If nothing goes wrong," Jiang Chen reached out and opened his watch, magnified the holographic screen, and gently pushed it to the center of the conference table. "From a geographical point of view, they are next to the subway entrance of Line 35 Badaling Station. Unless they think their armor's thickness can overcome our air superiority, the subway network in Shangjing is their only choice."</br>
</br>
"The subway lines are not a good choice," Xu Tiannan, with a vague expression on his face, said. "I can guarantee it."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng sighed.</br>
</br>
"You may not be clear since it is your first visit to Shangjing. It is no exaggeration to say that the subway network is the most dangerous place in the whole city..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Wan Peng was not exaggerating, he was even being modest.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that the subway network in Shangjing is definitely the most dangerous area in the entire Pan-Asia Cooperation region.</br>
</br>
Intuitively, once a disaster arrived, where else would be safer than the subway line? Chu Nan even suggested to Jiang Chen that if the nuclear winter continued to deteriorate, it would be a good choice to simply transfer the NAC underground. Not to mention that after the renovation of the subway lines in Shanghai in the early 21st century, it was originally used as a strategic civil defense facility and military mobilization infrastructure.</br>
</br>
If the more than 40 subway lines in Shangjing could be used, why would Pingan Street not change its name to Subway Street? Why don't survivors hide underground?</br>
</br>
The explosion of shells echoed in the dark subway tunnels.</br>
</br>
"Why are there so many fu*king zombies!" With half of his body peaked out from the Polar Bear Tank. Yegor looked at the flood of zombies in front of him and cursed out. "Hold on tight, we're going to roll over them!"</br>
</br>
A dozen tanks in attacking formation accelerated to maximum horsepower and rolled toward the flood of zombies.</br>
</br>
As soon as his reconnaissance team engaged in a battle with survivors of Shangjing, after he studied the map of Shangjing, he aimed his sight at the entrance of No. 35 Subway Line near Badaling. He quickly sent soldiers to gather information on the subway line, then he ordered the whole army to set off and moved the camp to the vicinity of the subway station.</br>
</br>
When he saw the steel airships floating in the sky, he didn't say anything and ordered the entire force to move into the subway station.</br>
</br>
In the 22nd century, the subway line in Shangjing was really spacious. There was no problem fitting eight tanks side by side. After the engineers made some modifications, the waiting hall was a good place to set up camp.</br>
</br>
However, the smooth trip didn't last long.</br>
</br>
They soon encountered the first flood of zombies...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1161: The Power of Food</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was skeptical of how much trouble zombie flesh could bring to the Russian tanks. However, when he saw the expression of Wan Peng and Xu Tiannan when he mentioned the subway system, and even Ding Liwei's look of concern, Jiang Chen began to doubt himself too.</br>
</br>
In any case, everything would be known after the Hunter Corps return.</br>
</br>
Just like this, the two sides reached an agreement at the negotiating table.</br>
</br>
Ten million crystals as the military expense of NAC's reinforcements. The two sides would jointly fight against the CCCP tanks.</br>
</br>
As for the spoils, it would belong to whoever claimed them first.</br>
</br>
"One last point," Jiang Chen pointed to the direction of the giant wall of Pingan Street and smiled, "remove the weapons on the wall that are pointed towards us. Although those things have no deterrent to us, no one likes being pointed at by weapons."</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei thought Jiang Chen was about to propose another outrageous condition. When he heard Jiang Chen finish his sentence, he was relieved and said in a gentle tone.</br>
</br>
"You can rest assured that we will remove the weapons immediately!"</br>
</br>
The contract was finally signed, an electronic contract and a paper contract were produced with each side holding both copies.</br>
</br>
At the end of the negotiation, Ding Liwei stood up and looked around at the other executives and then looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Since the contract has been signed, it's time for us to leave."</br>
</br>
"Wait, don't rush to go," Jiang Chen stood up and reached out his hand. "Look, it's getting pretty late outside. You must have not eaten dinner yet. Why don't you all have dinner here and then leave?"</br>
</br>
Just saying this, Jiang Chen clearly heard many people swallowing.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, Ding Liwei wanted to refuse this proposal.</br>
</br>
But then he remembered that the canned meat in his fridge seemed to be all Fishbone branded, he didn't want to leave anymore. The serious square face seemed to want to refuse, but he clearly didn't want to say it. The awkward and conflicted expression on his face was almost comical.</br>
</br>
It didn't take much to convince them as all the executives stayed and followed Jiang Chen to the dining room next to the conference room.</br>
</br>
It was another round table, just a lot bigger than the one in the conference room.</br>
</br>
Soon, dishes with mesmerizing aromas were served on the table by a housekeeping robot.</br>
</br>
Wuchang Fish, Steamed Pork Belly, Fried Eggplant with Meat, Pork Ribs Soup... Even the rice was the Yangzhou Fried Rice.</br>
</br>
Their eyes fixed on the dazzling number of dishes, despite all of them being in the upper echelon of society. They were gulping as saliva secreted in their mouth as the aroma tempted their nose. If it were not because of their status, they would already have begun devouring the food.</br>
</br>
"No need to be so serious, please eat." Jiang Chen smiled and picked up his chopsticks first.</br>
</br>
</br>
In tradition, guests must wait to eat before the host picked up his chopsticks. It was just the guests didn't have the best etiquette when eating. They were decent at first, but they were about to use their hands and stuff their faces into the dishes.</br>
</br>
After a burp, Wan Peng leaned back against the chair with his belly full and smudged the grease on his lips with his hand, he complimented.</br>
</br>
"If you open a restaurant in Shangjing, I believe it won't take long to earn ten million crystals."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed at this joke and didn't speak.</br>
</br>
He was very curious. If he let these starved beasts know that in the Sixth Street a thousand kilometers away many restaurants served these dishes, would they move to the south?</br>
</br>
The table was a mess, but everyone was happy.</br>
</br>
The executives were full of joy and left with big bellies. They all expressed their gratitude to Jiang Chen. Although the military expense of ten million crystals made them a little hurt, the meal just now gave them an illusion of it all being "worth it"?</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei did immediately follow through with his words. After the group returned, the weapons on the giant wall were quickly removed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't expect that a meal would have won the gratitude of so many executives.</br>
</br>
Back in the military base, Jiang Chen went to his barracks and met Yao Yao, who was looking outside.</br>
</br>
The little girl didn't change her clothes yet. She was wearing a pale pink apron embroidered with a bear pattern on her chest.</br>
</br>
After seeing Jiang Chen, Yao Yao's eyes lit up and immediately stuck herself to him. She said in a mellow tone.</br>
</br>
"Did Yao Yao help out?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Jiang Chen smiled and touched Yao Yao's small head, "Yao Yao helped a lot."</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen's compliment, Yao Yao's cute face was filled with a shy smile.</br>
</br>
She blushed, she looked like a ripe apple that he wanted to bite into.</br>
</br>
Of course, he wouldn't actually bite Yao Yao's cute face.</br>
</br>
He gently left a good night kiss on her forehead, then he sent Yao Yao to sleep before he went to the command room in the center of the camp.</br>
</br>
After he discussed with the officers of the expeditionary force about their combat plan against the CCCP armored units, it was midnight. It was then that Jiang Chen finally returned to his room and immediately collapsed into his bed, yawning.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The next morning, under the escort of two entourages, the Archbishop Xu Tiannan came to the gate of the NAC military base.</br>
</br>
The soldier who received the order in advance allowed the entry of the old man.</br>
</br>
It was still the same conference room, but this time, there was only an elder and a young man in the room.</br>
</br>
Facing someone much younger than him, Xu Tiannan said respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Why did Mr. Jiang bring me here?"</br>
</br>
"It's not a big deal. I just want to chat with Archbishop Xu." Jiang Chen smiled, then gestured a guard to pour a cup of tea for the old man. When the fog floated up from the cup, he said, "I don't know if you have heard of Eden Technology?"</br>
</br>
"Eden Technology?" Xu Tiannan slightly frowned.</br>
</br>
"Have you not heard of it?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"If you are talking about the Garden of Eden Project, we have heard of it," Xu Tiannan's murky eyes were recollecting the past as he slowly said. "There was a disagreement in the Dusk Church, precisely because of the Eden Project. We came to Shangjing, and they went down to Wanghai..."</br>
</br>
"Bo Yu?" Jiang Chen remembered the man wearing 121 hydrogen bombs. He also remembered accidentally poking a hole in him with a laser sword and helping him materialize his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Xu Tiannan nodded. "He was a man, very talented, but too arrogant. If I didn't guess wrong, you should have already taken care of him."</br>
</br>
"It's been too long." Jiang Chen faintly smiled. "But what I want to ask is not about the Garden of Eden project, but the corporation behind it, Eden Technology. I heard that their headquarters is in Shangjing. Do you have any knowledge of it?"</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan pondered for a moment before finally shaking his head. "The Guardian Sect migrated to Shangjing for only a few years. We don't know much about many things here. However, even though I don't know, I know someone who definitely knows."</br>
</br>
"Who?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"There is a pub on Pingan Street called Hell Courier. The pub is run by an intelligence dealer from a neutral survivor settlement. They know everything from the coordinates of Death Claw nests to the recent relationship between major forces. They leak the majority of the news in Shangjing," Xu Tiannan said.</br>
</br>
"Neutral survivor settlement?" Jiang Chen frowned. "Right, I have heard that there are thousands of survivor settlements in Shangjing, but when I look at Pingan Street, at most there are 100,000 survivors. Is there another Pingan Street in Shangjing?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang must not know." Xu Tiannan smiled bitterly. "Not all survivors have joined our alliance. There are also some neutral survivor settlements who, despite obeying the rules we set and purchasing assets here, they never considered themselves as part of the alliance."</br>
</br>
Neutral survivor settlements?</br>
</br>
With the strength of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance, there are still existences that it can't take down?</br>
</br>
It seems that Shangjing may not be as shallow as what he sees on the surface...</br>
</br>
As he rubbed his chin, Jiang Chen nodded thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1162"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1162: A Useful Sidekick</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen obtained all the information he needed, he picked up his teacup and smiled at Xu Tiannan to express his gratitude.</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan gestured back with a smile.</br>
</br>
"No worries, this favor is not worth mentioning. If Mr. Jiang needs to know anything else, please let someone pass on the message, I will make the trip down."</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Usually, at this point, the guest would leave.</br>
</br>
However, the old man didn't have any intention of leaving.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Xu Tiannan did not leave, Jiang Chen was somewhat confused.</br>
</br>
"Is there anything else?"</br>
</br>
"No, nothing else," Xu Tiannan shook his head, with a sly smile, his eyes looked around inadvertently as if he was searching for something. "You see, it's getting late."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows in confusion.</br>
</br>
Just then, someone knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
A soldier walked in and saluted after he pushed open the door.</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
The soldier respectfully said, "Miss Yao asked me to tell you that it is time for your meal."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the soldier, then glanced the man with a big smile on his face. He instantly understood the old man's intention.</br>
</br>
So, you want a free meal again?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the old man, exasperated. However, Xu Tiannan's smile remained intact, pretending everything was normal.</br>
</br>
This old man has such thick skin!</br>
</br>
However, when Jiang Chen thought about it, since he already acquired useful information from him, he should return the favor by at least providing him with a meal. Especially since food was not something of value to him.</br>
</br>
It'll count as a means to reinforce their relationship.</br>
</br>
So, Jiang Chen looked at the soldier and coughed, "Get the kitchen to add one more pair of chopsticks."</br>
</br>
"Roger." The soldier saluted and left.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan went to the cafeteria with the soldier and Jiang Chen returned to his barracks.</br>
</br>
Outside the kitchen, the meticulous little loli already placed delicious dishes on the table. At this moment, both of her hands were under her chin as she gazed out the window.</br>
</br>
When she saw her beloved big brother appearing, Yao Yao jumped down from the chair and ran to the entrance, opening the door for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Looking at the little loli that appeared at the door, with a heartfelt smile, he rubbed her soft hair.</br>
</br>
"Don't wait for me, if you are hungry, eat first."</br>
</br>
The little loli embraced the warmth of the big hand. Her lovely eyes were half-closed and her long eyelashes trembled as her cherry-mouth formed into a crest.</br>
</br>
After he put on his slippers, Jiang Chen went to the bathroom and washed his hands before sitting at the table with the little loli.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao caringly filled his bowl with rice.</br>
</br>
Although the meal was less lively compared to before, it still had the same delicious taste.</br>
</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, gazing at Jiang Chen who was devouring the food, rested her chin against her hands. With a warm smile, she softly asked.</br>
</br>
"Does it taste good?"</br>
</br>
"It's amazing!" Jiang Chen smiled and looked at Yao Yao, who hadn't even moved her chopsticks. "Don't just look at me, eat."</br>
</br>
"Hehe..." The shy Yao Yao giggled. "Yao Yao can't help big brother in other places, so Yao Yao can only take care of big brother."</br>
</br>
Her smile was sweet and glowing. It made him want to protect it in his hands; it was so pure that he wanted to stroke his color onto it...</br>
</br>
Ahem, the latter half is extra.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly lowered his head.</br>
</br>
Whenever he recalled what happened in the bathroom last time and the fact that he almost crossed the line, it gave him a headache. Although Yao Yao's age is completely fine, her loli appearance always made him feel guilty if he had lucid thoughts...</br>
</br>
The faint jasmine fragrance in the air belonged to the girl.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly had a thought in his heart when he fixed his sight on her bright lips,</br>
</br>
Yao Yao has grown up...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen, in a rare instance, didn't take a nap, but left the military base with a team of guards and headed five to six kilometers towards the north.</br>
</br>
Noon was when zombies are the weakest, especially on sunny days.</br>
</br>
The X1 bacterial infections were undergoing photosynthesis and just like a sculpture, they were standing in the middle of the street. Unless creatures were within one meter of them, even if someone sneezed beside them, they would only dully move their head and look in that direction with a blank expression.</br>
</br>
Only zombies with condensed crystals were more responsive.</br>
</br>
Even the most amateur hunters could easily kill these dull-headed zombies.</br>
</br>
A bayonet was attached under the muzzle and the zombies passing by had their necks penetrated. The ones further away were left alone. Almost without a single shot, Jiang Chen, escorted by 40 guards, came to the door of an underground garage.</br>
</br>
The two survivor-looking men sat on the second floor. When they saw Jiang Chen's force through the window, they immediately got up and opened the hanging door of the garage. They wore a pair of old-fashioned winter clothes. The bald man smiled and greeted him before bowing respectfully.</br>
</br>
"I welcome the arrival of your highness."</br>
</br>
"Oh cut it out," Jiang Chen laughed and jokingly kicked him. "I'm here to inspect your work. Hurry, take me to see."</br>
</br>
The guy was using the words "Your Highness".</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hadn't seen him for a long time, but Zhou Guoping's flattering skills were becoming more and more advanced.</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes, please come in."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping, wiping his bright forehead, was grinning. He respectfully led Jiang Chen inside.</br>
</br>
He knew the boss spoke with a smile, so it meant that the flattering at least didn't hit the wrong spot.</br>
</br>
At the beginning of this year, the information system of the Hongcheng colony was built. After he handed over his duties, he moved from Hongcheng to Shangjing and settled on Pingan Street as an ordinary survivor.</br>
</br>
The growing status of Chu Nan gave him a strong sense of crisis. He was afraid that if one day Chu Nan remembered the things he did in the past, then he would end him. If he didn't make any contributions to NAC, the general wouldn't even bat an eye.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this, Zhou Guoping didn't serve as the president of the NAC Mercenary Union for too long before he taking on the initiative to seek out fieldwork. He took on duties most people didn't want to serve.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, giving up the great life of Wanghai for field assignments was definitely difficult.</br>
</br>
Although Zhou Guoping lacked morale and was a raider before, he was loyal. He diligently spent more than four years in intelligence work, running from the north to the south. Even without merits, Jiang Chen saw all his hard work.</br>
</br>
There was no organization completely pure and clean from top to bottom. Jiang Chen also needed someone like him.</br>
</br>
Someone who could serve him.</br>
</br>
With the guards behind him, Jiang Chen followed Zhou Guoping to the base he established in Shangjing.</br>
</br>
This place should have been an auto repair shop before the war. In the center of the warehouse, there were rusty robotic arms. Tools were piled up on the corners. Several survivor-looking men stood on the side and looked at his direction respectfully.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping brought these people from Wanghai. Without a doubt, they all didn't have the cleanest background. While Jiang Chen wouldn't trust them with tasks, Zhou Guoping used them to their fullest extent.</br>
</br>
People with similar minds gathered together.</br>
</br>
Bringing Jiang Chen and his guards into the repair shop, Zhou Guoping ordered his men to close the door. The dangers on wasteland were far more than zombies and aliens, they must be wary of their unscrupulous counterparts.</br>
</br>
The guards were divided into two groups; one group stayed on the first floor while another group followed Jiang Chen and Zhou Guoping to the second floor.</br>
</br>
"I have to ask you something," Jiang Chen entered Zhou Guoping's office, then pulled a chair to sit down. He waved his hand and gestured to the two guards who followed them in to leave. He then looked at Zhou Guoping, who was standing in front of him, and said, "Have you heard of Eden Technology?"</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen inadvertently touched his watch.</br>
</br>
The Honor Chip could judge whether a person is lying by monitoring a person's heart rate and brain waves. Although Zhou Guoping didn't have a reason to lie, he should be cautious.</br>
</br>
Zhou Yaping did not notice Jiang Chen's action as he pondered for a moment and finally shook his head with regret.</br>
</br>
"This... I have never heard of it. But if you want information about it, I will arrange for people to investigate immediately. I am very familiar with the entire Dongcheng District! As long as that Eden Technology is in Shangjing, I can dig it out!"</br>
</br>
With the confident speech Zhou Guoping gave, Jiang Chen just smiled without giving him more information.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen then asked.</br>
</br>
"You can put aside Eden Technology for now. Have you heard of the Hell Courier?"</br>
</br>
"I have heard of them," Zhou Guoping hurriedly nodded. "The famous bar in Pingan Street, the mercenaries and hunters like to spend their days in that bar. The most important thing is that it is a gathering place for Shangjing intelligence traffickers."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping suddenly seemed to understand.</br>
</br>
"...I understand what you mean. If I go there, I can definitely find something, hehe."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping chuckled, lowered his voice, and moved closer to Jiang Chen with a mysterious expression hanging on his face. "Boss... cough, General, in addition to the intelligence that others know, I also learned something else from other special channels."</br>
</br>
"Be direct." Jiang Chen was impatient.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping immediately stood up straight and said quickly.</br>
</br>
"The boss of the 'Hell Courier' was once a senior agent of the Pan-Asia Intelligence Agency..."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1163: Pingan Stree</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Under the ten-meters monstrous wall at the south gate of Pingan Street, there was only an arch that allowed two cars to pass and a small gate six people wide. The arch permitted the passage of vehicles while the small gate was used to process foot traffic. A team of soldiers stood at the gate as they guarded the entrance into Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, the purpose was to ensure contraband items such as small nuclear grenades and infection sources would not be brought into the city, and on the other hand, it was a way to collect tax for those who enter.</br>
</br>
Exactly like the Sixth Street four years ago.</br>
</br>
The only difference being that the crystals circulating in Shangjing were more than that in Wanghai at the time, and Pingan Street was also larger. Therefore, the tax was naturally more expensive.</br>
</br>
In addition, there was no Inner Circle or Outer Circle for Pingan Street. The concrete giant wall surrounded all the survivor settlements inside, so it was necessary to pay tax when entering the city. At the Sixth Street, only the Inner Circle was protected. Thus, it made sense to only collect tax upon entering the Inner Circle.</br>
</br>
At the small gate, the survivors formed a long line.</br>
</br>
"City gate tax, four crystal per person."</br>
</br>
A survivor dressed in hunter clothes took a bit longer to process the information before his face turned red and he angrily said.</br>
</br>
"Four crystals? Was it not two crystals yesterday? How did the city gate tax become four crystals today?! What the fu*k, why don't you go rob people instead!?"</br>
</br>
As soon as they heard that the city gate tax doubled, the people behind the queue suddenly became rattled.</br>
</br>
"Wasn't it two crystals before? How did it suddenly increase?"</br>
</br>
"What's going on!"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, I'll go to the east gate and see!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The soldiers who were guarding the gate were expressionless. There was a police-type power armor next to them. The soldier who collected the city gate tax lifted his chin impatiently and pointed to the notice at the door.</br>
</br>
"It changed last night, and it is the same at all the gates. If you have any questions, go to the city hall and ask. If you don't have a problem, hurry. People who want to come in, pay. People who don't have crystals, step aside."</br>
</br>
Although the tax increased by two crystals, everyone was forced to accept the price.</br>
</br>
There was no other option. The largest market and industrial area in Shangjing were located here. The hunters could only get rid of their loot there. The scavengers could only exchange their baskets of scavenged goods into crystals there. The mercenaries could only replenish ammunition and find new employers there...</br>
</br>
As for the option to force themselves in?</br>
</br>
Haha.</br>
</br>
Disregarding the police-type power armor at the door, the few heavy machine guns on the giant wall were enough deterrents to let those with ill-intentions to reconsider their choice.</br>
</br>
</br>
After the initial riot, the queue began to move slowly. Although many people left the queue, most of them stayed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his nose in embarrassment when he stood at the end of the queue.</br>
</br>
If he wasn't mistaken, the reason for the price increase of the city gate tax was because of him.</br>
</br>
The queue moved slowly and quickly reached his position.</br>
</br>
"Twenty-one people." Moving forward, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The tax official looked impatient and was about to speak, but then he saw the twenty people behind Jiang Chen, and his arrogant demeanor immediately disappeared.</br>
</br>
Twenty guards stood behind Jiang Chen. Although the clothes they wore were no different from the survivors around them, their vibe was not the same at all. It was as if a group of special forces stood in the middle of a group of new recruits. It was easy to spot the difference.</br>
</br>
"84 crystals... Who are you?" The tax official asked.</br>
</br>
"Mercenaries." Jiang Chen threw a dark green crystal on the table, raised his thumb, and pointed to the twenty guards behind him.</br>
</br>
The tax official's mouth twitched, clearly not believing his words. However, he didn't think more about the situation.</br>
</br>
He was only responsible for the collection of tax and not responsible for auditing people.</br>
</br>
"Go in."</br>
</br>
Without conversing more, Jiang Chen nodded and gestured to the guards behind him. They followed the procedure and stored their weapons at the weapon storage point behind the city gate and swayed into the bustling Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen learned about Hell Courier from Zhou Guoping, he divided his own guards into two groups. One group returned to the military base, and the other group disguised themselves and followed him to the south gate of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
At the moment, he hid a camouflage chain around his neck and under his collar.</br>
</br>
This camouflage necklace was very common before the war, and it almost replaced the existence of cosmetics.</br>
</br>
Holographic technology modified facial features to a certain extent. Although the facial features remained largely the same, he looked much older. Unless it was people close to him, it would be basically impossible to recognize him.</br>
</br>
The reason why he spent so much effort entering Pingan Street was to see the fabled Pan-Asia Cooperation intelligence personnel in person. On the other hand, he wanted to see the city. Although the degree of industrialization was not high and far from the Sixth Street under the ruling of NAC, it also possessed its own uniqueness.</br>
</br>
Such as gun control.</br>
</br>
It was not an exaggeration to say that Pingan Street in Shangjing should be the only large scale survivor settlement in the Pan-Asia Cooperation region to enforce complete gun control. Even the Sixth Street is unable to do this. On this piece of land that viewed weapons as life, the survivors in Shangjing not only showed no resistance or resentment, but they silently obeyed this rule.</br>
</br>
Even the strongest lone traveler could not be vigilant at all times.</br>
</br>
At least on Pingan Street, people could really have a good night's sleep without worrying about being awakened by gunshots at night or scared if an enemy would intrude and end their life.</br>
</br>
Of course, people could still sneak weapons in.</br>
</br>
But on the bright side, everyone seemed to obey this iron law.</br>
</br>
As they passed through the slums, Jiang Chen examined the streets before heading into the market at the south gate of Pingan Street. Compared with the Sixth Street, the lives of the people here were visibly worse. Disregarding the magnetic levitation road, many people here didn't even have proper winter clothing, and some people even wore exotic clothes made out of mutant furs.</br>
</br>
However, from their calm expressions, it seemed that this was the normal state for survivors on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
The survivors well fed and well protected in Wanghai were the abnormal ones.</br>
</br>
"Lu Fan."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
"Don't be so uptight, don't forget that you're a mercenary," Jiang Chen whispered.</br>
</br>
Since Li Wang was promoted to captain of AS Order, the new guard captain was Lu Fan. The 30-year-old bodyguard was superb in every aspect. He was also as loyal as Li Wang but he was not as clever as him. This sometimes would keep him too uptight.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan hesitated for a moment and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and gave up the idea of correcting his respectful appearance.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the probability of encountering Ding Liwei and Wan Peng was almost zero. He was not worried about being questioned after revealing some abnormalities. Pingan Street was more complex than he imagined. There were some neutral survivors as powerful as the Shangjing Survivor Alliance.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also paid attention when he entered the city.</br>
</br>
Along the way, he already encountered three groups of bodyguards following a person that looked wealthy.</br>
</br>
"Hell Courier" was located in the commercial street near the north gate. However, Jiang Chen did not go north but walked around the market before heading to the industrial area behind the slum.</br>
</br>
Similar to the situation he saw on AS Order, the industrial capability of Pingan Street was quite weak. But with wasteland standards, Pingan Street's capability was considered to be top-notch. Compared to the Sixth Street four years ago, its size more than doubled the Sixth Street's industrial strength.</br>
</br>
Of course, the Sixth Street's growth far outpaced this place.</br>
</br>
The surrounding buildings began to become lower, and the pedestrians on the street were mostly slaves or workers that looked malnourished.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan thought that Jiang Chen had gone the wrong way. He hesitated and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Hell Courier is on the commercial street near the north gate."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan then paused after processing the information.</br>
</br>
"Then why are we here..."</br>
</br>
"Do you see anyone going to the bar in the morning?" Jiang Chen smiled and raised his chin in the direction of the industrial zone, and then said, "Not to mention, going to Hell Courier to learn about Eden Technology is just a side quest. Our main purpose is to just take a stroll around Pingan Street. If I want to get some intelligence, I can just send anyone. Why would I come here?"</br>
</br>
"I just want to ask... Is there any purpose in this action?" Lu Fan said hesitantly. "My suggestion is to give us the task. This place is very unsafe. We may also encounter an unexpected situation, we—"</br>
</br>
"That's enough," Jiang Chen dismissed his suggestion. "I care more about my own safety than anything else. You don't have to worry, just follow me."</br>
</br>
After he paused for a moment, Jiang Chen went on.</br>
</br>
"I'm answering your previous question now. How is there no purpose?"</br>
</br>
He then looked up and gazed at the towering Pan-Asia Cooperation building in the center of Pingan Street, then he grinned. "This place will be ours soon."</br>
</br>
"You mean," Lu Fan's expression suddenly changed and excitement began to grow in his pupils, "After getting rid of CCCP, we'll..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and sighed.</br>
</br>
"There are many ways to solve the problem. I hope that you can think about it from another perspective. If you can't think about the same problem from multiple perspectives, you may miss a lot of better options. In that case, how can I trust you with more responsibilities?"</br>
</br>
Lu Fan immediately bowed his head and said sincerely.</br>
</br>
"I don't have any intention to be a high-ranking official. I just hope to serve the general to the best of my ability."</br>
</br>
"If you have this thought, it will be enough." Jiang Chen smiled. "NAC needs talents and needs loyal and reliable talents. Even if you want to stay in this position for a lifetime, you have to ask for my permission first, right?"</br>
</br>
"I'll follow the general's order," Lu Fan diligently said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and did not respond. He stood at the entrance of the industrial zone.</br>
</br>
"I just told you, let's think about the problem from another angle. In addition to the option of armed occupation, we have a lot of more gentle and effective options, which can allow us to take over this place without a drop of blood."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan did not interject. He stood respectfully on Jiang Chen's side, waiting for his order.</br>
</br>
"For example, we can buy this place."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, his eye narrowing as he gazed at the towering chimney in the steel mill.</br>
</br>
"Using their own money."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1164: Hell Courier</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Commercial Street located a hundred steps away from the North Gate, was also known as North Street.</br>
</br>
Despite CCCP tanks recently mobilization to Badaling and the NAC building a military base not far from the north gate, these factors didn't interfere with the lives of the local survivors.</br>
</br>
At night, the entire street was decorated with colorful neon.</br>
</br>
After a busy day, the survivors with a good harvest often returned to Pingan Street before dark. They sold their harvest on the market for crystals and then spent the rest of their time at a bar nearby to intoxicate their tensed nerves.</br>
</br>
The hunters and mercenaries traversed between the bars, followed the indispensable smell of alcohol, and seeked the best bar. The entire street seemed to be filled with people from all walks of life, just like the dark alleys on both sides of the street.</br>
</br>
Having said that, it was important to discuss the life of Shangjing survivors.</br>
</br>
Common knowledge was that most of the zombies are unable to form crystals. Only mutants powerful enough could form crystals. Therefore, hunting regular zombies were no different than wasting bullets.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this, the subway stations filled with zombies and mutants became raid quests for survivors of Shangjing, similar to online games.</br>
</br>
The north gate was close to the subway station. Every day, hundreds of hunter teams and lone travelers entered Subway Line 10 to 15. The transit stations of these subway lines were concentrated around the Third Ring Road, and the danger of mutants was moderate. Some abandoned fallout shelters were also concentrated here, and many places still had pre-war battle supplies.</br>
</br>
Whether for hunting or scavenging, the income underground was much higher than that on the surface.</br>
</br>
And these experiences were learned by the survivors of Shangjing through countless lives...</br>
</br>
After they entered this area, Lu Fan closely followed Jiang Chen while silently observing for possible threats in the shadows.</br>
</br>
When they turned two corners, Jiang Chen and the group quickly entered a side alley before stopping in front of a billboard with faded paint.</br>
</br>
"Hell Courier" was located in the corner of North Street, among several miscellaneous shops. It was so ordinary on the outside, just like a fly in a garbage dump. However, when Jiang Chen stepped one foot across the door, he discovered a different world behind the low-key and inconspicuous surface.</br>
</br>
In the hall hundreds of square meters in size, there were simple round tables scattered around. People in suits sat here as well as people wearing different mutant skins seamed together. The women in exposed clothes carried trays around the hall, pushing away customers' hands with a giggle while selling alcohol to the desperados.</br>
</br>
The scent of perfume, alcohol, and sweat mixed together in the air. The unpopular singer screamed on stage not far away before being quickly getting booed down by the survivors. He was replaced by a dancer barely covered with any clothes.</br>
</br>
</br>
He must say, as long as nutrition could be kept up, there were basically no ugly women in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Through genetic modification, although the people at the end of the twenty-second century didn't all look stunning, their average appearance was far better than that of the twenty-first century. For example, the lady on stage. Disregarding the vibe she possessed, she could definitely be considered a celebrity in the modern world.</br>
</br>
Of course, she could have been a celebrity before the war.</br>
</br>
He whispered a few words to Lu Fan, let the guards scatter around, and then just ordered a few bottles of beer. Then, Jiang Chen walked in the direction of the bar.</br>
</br>
"What drink?" the bartender behind the bar asked while wiping the glass.</br>
</br>
"I heard that there are intelligence dealers here." Jiang Chen sat on the high stool next to the bar, then looked at him.</br>
</br>
"The whole street is filled with intelligence dealers." The bartender's cold expression remained.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is it..." Jiang Chen looked at the menu and looked down the price list. "First, let me have a cup of Bullet Grain Beer."</br>
</br>
Then, he pulled a large dark green crystal from his pocket and dropped it on the crystal analyzer on the bar.</br>
</br>
The bartender's eyelids twitched and the number on the crystal analyzer jumped to 101 points.</br>
</br>
"The extra is your tip." Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The bartender did not say anything else. He silently put the crystal away, turned, and walked to the cabinet.</br>
</br>
Without waiting long, a bottle of beer was placed at the bar.</br>
</br>
"Your beer."</br>
</br>
Then, the bartender placed another small bottle next to him.</br>
</br>
"Plus, you may need a bottle of Dragon Blue."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"There is a typo on the bottle."</br>
</br>
"It's called Dragon Blue," A middle-aged man sat on the high stool next to him and grinned at him. "Because your tongue will get bigger after drinking it and your tongue will also turn blue. It is said that the gallbladder of Death Claws is added during brewing, and also a type of blue mushroom that grows in the subway station. It feels great when you drink it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shuddered.</br>
</br>
Mutants wee poisonous. The more powerful the mutant, the more poisonous they become. It was the rule of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
For example, the meat of Death Claws was more toxic than arsenic. It was the first time he heard its gallbladder could be used to make alcohol.</br>
</br>
As for the blue mushroom in the subway...</br>
</br>
Are you sure they are not a type of poisonous mushroom?</br>
</br>
"If you're careful, you can discover that there are many delicious things on mutants. For example, the Mud Crab roe, the caviar made from Mutant Piranha, and the medium-rare steak from a Phoenix Scorpion. They are all delicious, right?" The man grinned and said, "Perhaps in two hundred years, we'll figure out all the delicious part of mutants."</br>
</br>
Phoenix Scorpion?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only vaguely recalled that it seemed to be a type of venomous large scorpion in the northern wilderness.</br>
</br>
His scalp was numb just from the thought of it.</br>
</br>
These foodies are simply fearless!</br>
</br>
"What is your name?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Sura," the man took a drink, raised an eyelid, and grinned. "You can also call me Old Luo. Everyone calls me that. This is your first time here?"</br>
</br>
Sura, a pseudonym.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen was not interested in knowing his real name, so he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Yes. Is that strange?"</br>
</br>
"It's not strange, new customers come here every day," the man named Sura said and pointed to the bottle of Dragon Blue in front of Jiang Chen. "If you want to know about something that's interesting, just put a bottle of Dragon Blue on the table, and naturally someone will come to you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the man and raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Oh? So, you are the intelligence dealer?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Old Luo spat out a cigarette ring, then looked at Jiang Chen. "Tell me, what do you want to hear?"</br>
</br>
"What questions can I ask?"</br>
</br>
"As long as I know." Old Luo shrugged.</br>
</br>
"The first question," Jiang Chen smiled and looked at the back of the bartender who went to the other side of the bar, his fingers gently tapping on the table. "Who is the owner of this bar? Where is he and how can I see him?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1165"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1165: Brother Tiger? Brother Cat?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Old Luo paused for a brief second.</br>
</br>
"The first question I can answer. I can't answer the second and third questions."</br>
</br>
"So, answer my first question." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Old Luo just smiled mysteriously and did not speak.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood. He put his hand into his pocket and from the storage dimension, he took out a crystal similar to the previous one. Then, he gently placed it on the table. "Is this enough?"</br>
</br>
"Scarecrow."</br>
</br>
"Scarecrow?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and watched as Old Luo took the crystal.</br>
</br>
Old Luo noticed the dissatisfaction on Jiang Chen's face and began to explain.</br>
</br>
"Scarecrow is his name. I didn't lie to you. Many people make new names for themselves after the war. Scarecrow is just one of them. Can I ask a question? Why are you looking for him?"</br>
</br>
"I heard that he is a former Pan-Asia Cooperation intelligence personnel."</br>
</br>
"Former intelligence personnel? There is such a saying." Touching his chin, Old Luo frowned and said thoughtfully. "It's just a saying. Some people say that he is a very powerful lone traveler, or Mr. Ding's other unknown identity, who knows?"</br>
</br>
"You are very close to him?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Very close?" Old Luo joked. "I hope to be familiar with him, so I don't have to pay for my drinks."</br>
</br>
"You don't need it to pay for it now," Jiang Chen smiled, tapping his index finger against the blue bottle. "This bottle of Dragon Blue is on me."</br>
</br>
He would never drink the suspicious thing made from parts of Death Claws!</br>
</br>
However, it would a pity to waste it. He would like to see someone drink this to see the "clinical effects."</br>
</br>
Yes, he still needed a lab rat, so Old Luo was a great choice.</br>
</br>
"No need," Old Luo shook his head and stood up from the high stool. "I should go now."</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"No, just some people are looking for trouble." Old Luo shrugged and fixed the collar of his gray suit.</br>
</br>
"Do you need my help?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No," Old Luo raised an eyebrow. "I'm used to solving my own problems."</br>
</br>
"I suggest you try it. The feeling is quite good," Old Luo said and then suddenly laughed. "Especially for people with a lot on their mind, you only need a small shot to forget all of your troubles for a short moment."</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, I don't need to drink alcohol to deal with my problems." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Lucky guy. By the way, your mask is not bad," Old Luo grinned, turned, and disappeared into the crowd.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen looked at the direction where Old Luo disappeared into, he reached for the chain under his collar as a peculiar expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
What is this ability?</br>
</br>
He actually could see through the camouflage chain?</br>
</br>
After a while, he couldn't figure out why, so he just laughed it off and gave up on the thought. Just as he was about to get up, several brawny men without the nicest appearance walked towards him.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Here is a question for you, where did the man who was sitting next to you go?" The man with a straight cut walked up to Jiang Chen. One of his feet stepped onto the stool that Old Luo sat on as he looked down at Jiang Che with menace.</br>
</br>
His thugs also surrounded Jiang Chen and formed into a line, blocking the sights of others.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was to pressure Jiang Chen, a man with spiked hair took out a butterfly knife and spun it in his hand. The mung bean-like eyes glanced at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The survivors in the bar noticed the abnormality of the atmosphere and gathered their attention to watch the show unfold.</br>
</br>
Fighting was very common on this street. Mercenaries, hunters, and lone travelers all gathered here. It would be odd for conflicts to not happen on the street.</br>
</br>
Even the guards on Pingan Street didn't bother with this street. As long as there were no shooting nor murder, anything else was fair game.</br>
</br>
"Who is that? Looks like a tough guy." Someone whispered.</br>
</br>
"Shh, be quiet, that guy is Tiger."</br>
</br>
"Tiger? Is it… that Tiger?" One person looked shocked.</br>
</br>
"Indeed! I heard that last month, he and a survivor had a squabble here, and later it turned into a brawl. I think he lost when they fought, and he admitted defeat. But then, he sent people to follow the guy back to his settlement…" Another person added.</br>
</br>
"And then?" Seeing the man was no longer speaking, the crowds urged him to continue.</br>
</br>
"And then," the man sighed. "He brought more than fifty raiders and killed the survivor's settlement inside and out, and ra*ped the man's wife and daughter in front of him. It's..."</br>
</br>
Among the whispers, Tiger felt disrespected seeing Jiang Chen completely ignore him. The thugs sensed their boss's abnormal mood and instantly became rattled, doing their best to please their boss.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, the boss asked you a question. Are you deaf?"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, do you not have ears?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
As if Jiang Chen didn't hear the curses, he looked at the man whose foot was on the high stool. His index finger gently tapped the blue bottle and he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Do you want a drink?"</br>
</br>
"Brother Tiger asked you a question, don't speak nonsense." The man who played with the butterfly knife, who didn't speak the whole time, sneered. Then, he tried to push Jiang Chen's shoulder</br>
</br>
However, before his hand could reach Jiang Chen, he felt a huge force around his collar</br>
</br>
Earth's gravity seemed to lose its effect.</br>
</br>
His feet left the ground, and a large hand threw him out by the collar. He smashed against a wall ten-meters back. With a thump, his back made intimate contact with the wall and he instantly blacked out, unable to climb up again.</br>
</br>
Things happened in an instant, so fast that everyone did not have time to react.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k you!"</br>
</br>
After Tiger processed what just happened, he cursed and grabbed the stool with one hand.</br>
</br>
However, just as he turned around, his pupils met with twenty pairs of emotionless eyes.</br>
</br>
Twenty men stood behind him and surrounded him and his four thugs.</br>
</br>
There was a murderous vibe in the air. It was so chilly that it could freeze time.</br>
</br>
Tiger gulped. His face turned from red to a pale white before turning bright red again. It looked comical.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood up and walked slowly to the man.</br>
</br>
"I heard that you are Tiger?"</br>
</br>
Tiger didn't dare to speak, shuddering in fear.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan, with a grimacing smile, put his hand around Tiger's shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Gen... the boss asked you something, are you going to disrespect him like that?"</br>
</br>
"Big, big, big boss..." Feeling the immense strength on his shoulder, Tiger felt like his bone was about to be crushed. With barely the ability to speak, he was shuddering, "Boss, sorry. I didn't know better. Please just let me go like you let go of a fart."</br>
</br>
"Tiger, right?" Jiang Chen smiled at the scared Tiger. "I heard that you have something to ask me about?"</br>
</br>
"I don't dare, I don't dare, please forgive me, my mouth is too careless!" Tiger began to slap himself</br>
</br>
He was really slapping himself. Every slap made a loud sound, followed by his face turning red and purple. Just looking at his face was enough to feel how painful it was.</br>
</br>
The thugs behind Tiger looked at their boss, dumbfounded as if a tall and stalwart figure in their heart just collapsed instantly.</br>
</br>
Looking at Tiger slapping himself, Jiang Chen suddenly felt bored.</br>
</br>
Sometimes people judged the situation too well that it becomes boring. If he resisted, maybe it would have been more fun.</br>
</br>
He waved his hand and said in a tone that lacked interest.</br>
</br>
"Draw a cat on his face and then throw him out."</br>
</br>
When Tiger heard Jiang Chen's words, Tiger's entire face turned from red to green.</br>
</br>
Draw a cat on his face? This is more embarrassing than killing him. How will his thugs look at him? How will he hang around here?</br>
</br>
Lu Fan was troubled.</br>
</br>
"Boss, I don't know how to paint..."</br>
</br>
Tiger, in his mind, was filled with joy. But before he could let out a sigh of relief, his heart sunk to the bottom again.</br>
</br>
"Stupid!" Jiang Chen sighed, "What did I teach you this morning?"</br>
</br>
Lu Fan lowered his head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment and then lazily said when he lookedaround the group of survivors watching this show.</br>
</br>
"Are there any tattoo artists here?"</br>
</br>
No one responded.</br>
</br>
Without surprise, Jiang Chen took a crystal out from his pocket and shook the crystal in front of the survivors before asking again.</br>
</br>
With a generous enough reward, there would always be a brave man. Under the temptation of the cobblestone-sized crystal, a man with a mask jumped out and even prepared the tools. The reason why he wore a mask was to not offend Tiger.</br>
</br>
"Draw a cat on his face and this crystal is yours." Jiang Chen pointed to Tiger.</br>
</br>
"Do you want a fat or thin one?" The man didn't pay attention to the warning in Tiger's eyes as he smiled, looking at Jiang Chen with flattery in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Is there a saying in this?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Indeed!" The man chuckled while rubbing his hand. "There are many different kinds of cats, fat and thin, male and female, which type do you prefer?"</br>
</br>
Not wanting to be bothered by this question, Jiang Chen took out another crystal from his pocket. He then tossed this crystal along with the previous one into the man's lap.</br>
</br>
"One fat and one thin, one male and one female, give me two paintings, one on each side."</br>
</br>
"Perfect!" The man started the tool in his hand with excitement.</br>
</br>
"Don't, don't come," Tiger said, looking terrified as he tried to escape. However, the big hand pressing on his shoulder locked him down.</br>
</br>
Also, to prevent him from moving, two guards stepped forward and stood on his sides, directly pinning his hands and pressing his head against the table.</br>
</br>
"Oh, brother, I can't help it."</br>
</br>
Tiger, at this moment, was just like a woman who has been stripped. With fear in his eyes, he watched the tattoo artist that approached him. Soon, the bar was filled with a desperate cry.</br>
</br>
The pain didn't just come from his flesh, but also his dignity.</br>
</br>
Only Tiger himself could understand the pain of being tattooed two cats on his face, in public.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With the support of his thugs, Tiger covered his head with clothes and limped back to the hotel in North Street.</br>
</br>
Because he was not cooperative when he was getting his tattoo, he took a beating and looked quite miserable.</br>
</br>
In the curious sight of others, he lowered his head through the hall and returned to his room while being held by his thugs.</br>
</br>
He slammed the door behind him and pulled off the clothes that covered his head. Then, he quickly walked to the mirror.</br>
</br>
There were two cats tattooed on his face; a fat one and a skinny one. They moved while his muscles twitched and looked quite vivid under the light.</br>
</br>
Tiger looked hopeless.</br>
</br>
"Brother… Brother Tiger," the thug said with a flattering voice as he did his best to restrain his laughter while Tiger's muscles twitched. He handed the iodine and cotton swabs with both hands. Please… please treat yourself first."</br>
</br>
Tiger knocked away the iodine and cotton swabs and stared at himself with a grimacing expression; his pupils burned with blazing fury.</br>
</br>
"Tiger, we can't just forget it like this!" Another thug said with despair and rage.</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Tiger said in a sullen tone.</br>
</br>
They almost caught the man called Sura, but he managed to escape under his eyes. They went to question someone who may know him, but twenty burly men showed up and not only did they give him a beating, but they also drew two cats on his face...</br>
</br>
Only twenty people...</br>
</br>
I have 500 guns under my control!</br>
</br>
Even those leaders in the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building must respect me. Who was that guy?</br>
</br>
Tiger carefully compared the man's face with the ones in his memory, and eventually did not match his name with anyone influential. And based on his accent, that guy wasn't even a local.</br>
</br>
He must be a mercenary of a merchant fleet and only been on Pingan Street for a few days.</br>
</br>
For this kind of fool, I have countless means to make him repay!</br>
</br>
With a sneer, Tiger already prepared a plan.</br>
</br>
"Follow my order to keep a close eye on them."</br>
</br>
"I already issued the order," A thug rushed forward and smiled insidiously. "Our people will be watching the four gates. Unless they hide in Pingan Street, otherwise..."</br>
</br>
"Very good." Tiger nodded, pleased. Then he again looked at himself in the mirror in humiliation. After a long silence, he said while gritting his teeth, "… go find me a mask."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The thug nodded and rushed out of the door.</br>
</br>
"Tiger... what about Sura?" The thug who handed the iodine and cotton swabs carefully asked.</br>
</br>
"Continue to look for him. Even if we have to flip the city upside down, we have to get him!" With rage burning even more furiously in his eyes, Tiger gritted his teeth, as if the name carried a deep hatred. He said word by word, "I will slice him piece by piece!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Under the watch of the crowd, Jiang Chen took his guards and strolled out of the bar.</br>
</br>
</br>
As for the bottle of "Dragon Blue", he tossed it into the storage dimension and prepared to take it back to Lin Lin for testing.</br>
</br>
The man named Sura said an interesting sentence. Perhaps in another two hundred years, the delicious parts of mutants would have all been figured out by the survivors.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen agreed with the notion.</br>
</br>
Mutants couldn't be eaten as food was just a lesson learned through blood by the survivors in the first twenty years on the wasteland, but it was not completely accurate. Since mutant meat could be processed into nutrient supply, so then the mutant must possess some nutrients that could be absorbed by the human body.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he should set up a research institute to study how to turn mutants into delicious delicacies.</br>
</br>
Of course, no matter how tasty, he would never eat it.</br>
</br>
"Boss, where are we going now?" Lu Fan whispered as he walked next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the sky turning dark and thought it must be late. So he casually said.</br>
</br>
"Just find a place to rest."</br>
</br>
It was already 11 o'clock in the evening. At this point, the four gates of Pingan Street were all closed. Unless he revealed his identity, it would be absolutely impossible for the guards to open the gate just for him.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't plan to expose his identity just yet. He still had things to do on this street.</br>
</br>
After they left the North Gate Commercial Street, Lu Fan, who walked halfway behind Jiang Chen, suddenly narrowed his eyes and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"Someone is following us."</br>
</br>
Without a change in expression, Jiang Chen whispered.</br>
</br>
"Who?"</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Lu Fan looked slightly disappointed and quietly said.</br>
</br>
"He's gone..."</br>
</br>
"Gone?" Jiang Chen was somewhat surprised. He looked at Lu Fan. "Are you sure he's gone?"</br>
</br>
"Yes... He gave up. He may have realized that he exposed his whereabouts." Lu Fan lowered his head and looked embarrassed. "...I'm incompetent."</br>
</br>
"This is not on you," Jiang Chen looked around, nonchalantly, "this means his anti-reconnaissance ability is strong. Let the brothers keep their guards up. If you see the person again, bring him directly to me."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Lu Fan obyed.</br>
</br>
Who could it be?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know, and he didn't bother to care.</br>
</br>
No one could hurt him.</br>
</br>
This was not only his confidence in his own strength but also his complete trust in the twenty guards around him.</br>
</br>
Many people here had followed him for four years, and some of them were even knights. Whether loyalty or strength, he didn't have any doubt.</br>
</br>
What's to fear?</br>
</br>
On the street outside the North Gate Commercial Street, Jiang Chen randomly picked a hotel that looked decent. After paying 30 crystals to get rooms for himself and the 20 guards, he rented out the entire top floor and chose to live in the most luxurious presidential suite on the top floor of the hotel.</br>
</br>
While it was the presidential suite, the facilities were very simple and crude.</br>
</br>
He took a shower, then laid down on the clean bedding before he received a message for Ayesha.</br>
</br>
It was about the 2020 General Election in the UA. The attachments contained all the information about the candidate for the B City Consortium, John F. Kennedy. This information was clearly handled by professionals, clean without any imperfection.</br>
</br>
After he read this information from the beginning to the end, even Jiang Chen, as a foreigner, thought about voting him.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen was fully aware.</br>
</br>
There was no absolute clean politician in this world.</br>
</br>
The more perfect the information, the more secrets that were concealed in the dark.</br>
</br>
After thinking for a moment, Jiang Chen responded with four words on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
Act as you wish</br>
</br>
Then he clicked send.</br>
</br>
He trusted Ayesha would make the right decision for him.</br>
</br>
However, not long after this message was sent out and he had turned off the holographic screen to get ready to sleep, the blue light particles reappeared, and Jean's holographic image appeared beside him.</br>
</br>
With a serious and stern expression, Jean's emotionless electronic voice said.</br>
</br>
"Warning, backdoor programs are detected in the wrist-worn computer, the computer is being infiltrated..."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1167: The Booze-loving Russians</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Subway Line 35, the waiting hall of Xinfeng Station.</br>
</br>
CCCP's Subway Line 35 reconnaissance team was stationed here.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was correct with his guess. The flesh was no match against the steel armor, at least not the mutants that wandered on Subway Line 35. The CCCP tanks easily crushed through them and left only a pile of meat.</br>
</br>
The only trouble they encountered was a group of Spitters and a few Roshans that threw things around.</br>
</br>
However, these encounters were just problems. They weren't even considered dangers.</br>
</br>
Along the way, three stations were cleared out. Two of the stations already showed varying degrees of collapses. Only the Xinfeng station located within the Fifth Ring Road was relatively intact.</br>
</br>
Yegor issued a rest order. More than a dozen tanks sealed the lanes on both ends. The remaining armored vehicles, with the help of the infantry, cleared the zombies in the waiting hall and cleared out some open space. Several base vehicles were mobilized there before they were deployed into the hall.</br>
</br>
On the hundred-meter-long ramp, soldiers wearing CCCP-made military uniforms used polyethylene bullet-proof panels to build simple fortifications at the ticket gates, and mounted machine guns to guard against possible threats from the outside.</br>
</br>
After the camp was set up, Yegor jumped down from the tank covered in blood and flesh and moved towards the deployed base.</br>
</br>
Not far away, the engineers used shovels to clean the meat chunks from the tank, collected them in a box, and transported the box to the Organic Boiler so that the meat could be processed into nutrient supply. At the back of the armored vehicles were bags full of Spitter bodies. The soldiers in protective suits were searching with their daggers for crystals.</br>
</br>
These crystals were energy-rich and could be used to generate electricity via a special generator, or they could be made into pseudo-nuclear fusion batteries to power tank engines.</br>
</br>
Although the crystals were not as large as the crystals formed by mutants in the Siberian wilderness, the quantity was much greater in comparison; greater that they had ever imagined.</br>
</br>
In the communication base vehicle, Sminov was in contact with the remainder of the force.</br>
</br>
When Yegor entered, Sminov immediately stood up and saluted.</br>
</br>
"How is the harvest?" Yegor nodded to signal for him to sit down. He pulled up a chair and sat across from him, "Tell me everything."</br>
</br>
"The captured organic matter produced a total of 3,000 nutrient supplies, and 1,000 crystals. The newly cultivated 50 cloned soldiers in the incubator base have awakened and are currently undergoing training courses in virtual training facilities," Sminov reported.</br>
</br>
The CCCP frontline forces possessed two powerful weapons. One was the cloned soldier and the other was the nano serum.</br>
</br>
The former constituted the Soviet rushing team, while the latter formed the super soldiers in the Soviet army, both of which gave NATO and Pan-Asia Cooperation a headache.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the culture tank, with enough nutrient, the clones could complete the baby to adult growth process in just ten days. With minimal training, they could rush into the battlefield. The clones "produced" from this technology had IQs lower than 100 and an average life space of less than 10 years. The only purpose they served was to oppress the enemy with numbers and waste the enemy's ammunition… and it was surprisingly effective.</br>
</br>
With the right commander, it would serve a miraculous effect on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
As for the nano serum, it would be a topic for another day.</br>
</br>
Rich in organic matter and abundant in energy, all the mutants in Eastern Siberia added together would not be comparable to the metro in Shangjing. While they fought desperately for survival against the extreme weather, the survivors of the Pan-Asia Cooperation possessed such a wonderful treasure.</br>
</br>
Compared with Uelen covered in eternal ice, this place was paradise...</br>
</br>
"It's paradise here," Yegor couldn't stop admiring.</br>
</br>
He felt fortunate for making the decision of heading south to Pan-Asia instead of crossing Siberia to the west and heading to Moscow.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Sminov was quite emotional too. "Not only are there these weak zombies and mutants, just now, our field researchers found a fluorescent fungus in the subway, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. These elements could be used as a substitute for some chemical raw materials... I have to say that there are good things everywhere."</br>
</br>
As soon as Yegor heard chemical materials, he looked at Sminov and hurriedly asked him what he was most concerned about.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation with the ammunition production line?"</br>
</br>
"The ammunition production line has started to run. We have dismantled some of the facilities in the subway for recycling, and the metal resources have been supplemented, but other resources are still lacking...especially oil and its substitutes, rubber, and some chemical raw materials."</br>
</br>
Ammunition had always been a big problem that plagued the border guards. Without an industrial backbone, it was almost impossible to maintain this gigantic armored force. Fortunately, they owned dozens of base vehicles, as long as they gathered resources, they could achieve a certain degree of self-sufficiency.</br>
</br>
Of course, the premise had been that a sufficient amount of resources could be collected.</br>
</br>
When Yegor heard the news that the ammunition production line started to operate again, the issue that kept Yegor up at night finally went away. The weather-beaten face finally showed a hint of a smile.</br>
</br>
"Sir."</br>
</br>
"What's going on?"</br>
</br>
"Do we still want to continue to explore?" Sminov looked out the window. "These resources are now enough for us to digest for a long time."</br>
</br>
"Why not?"</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
"You want to talk about the risks and benefits, right?" Yegor smiled. He was in a good mood today, so his temper was much better. "My dear comrade, I know exactly what you mean. After all, the rewards today are probably more than the gains of a week in the Siberian wilderness. Especially with the Organic Boiler running non-stop. The wonderful noise is like a melody. To tell you the truth, I never imagined that we could live with such wealth."</br>
</br>
"Then why..." Sminov said with some hesitation.</br>
</br>
Although they didn't encounter any danger, the dark tunnel always gave him an ominous premonition.</br>
</br>
It felt like the tunnel was leading straight to hell.</br>
</br>
"Did you notice?" Looking at the direction of the subway line, Yegor narrowed his eyes. "The tunnel here is wide, even in the middle of the tracks, there is a cement road enough for two cars to run in parallel."</br>
</br>
Yegor's original intention was just using the subway line as a mean to launch a sneak attack against NAC's steel airship, however, as he continued to explore the subway, he began to notice the strangeness of this place.</br>
</br>
"This is a strategic tunnel for Pan-Asia Cooperation." Yegor pointed at his feet, "The underground transportation network of the city together constitutes the Pan-Asia Cooperation wartime transportation network."</br>
</br>
Sminov nodded. Obviously, he also noticed this.</br>
</br>
Just...</br>
</br>
So what?</br>
</br>
"Comrade Sminov, I don't know if you have considered this," Yegor grinned with his hands behind his back. "For example, what is buried underneath this intricate subway network?"</br>
</br>
"Why are you so sure something must be buried below?" Sminov was confused.</br>
</br>
"The instinct of a leader." Yegor pointed at his head with his finger. There was a sense of excitement buried in his pupils. "My instinct tells me that there must be something buried underneath. It may be a super weapon., it may also be just a bunch of useless gold, but in any case, I can't sit still and just let it lie below my feet. Do you understand this feeling? Comrade Sminov?"</br>
</br>
Sminov took a deep breath and nodded.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
"That's good." Yegor looked at him, nodded and was about to head out.</br>
</br>
However, with one foot already out the door, he suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
"Right," He turned and looked at Sminov before he pointed to his feet. "Are there a lot of fungi here?"</br>
</br>
Slightly stunned, Sminoff nodded.</br>
</br>
"I don't know if there are a lot, but there are quite a number of them. But most of the fungi are inedible. Even if it is used as a raw material for nutrient supply, the organic matter percentage is not high either, and it is not comparable to mutants..."</br>
</br>
"It's not food, it has nothing to do with food," Yegor opened his mouth. "I heard that there is a kind of alcohol that seems to be called... mushroom wine."</br>
</br>
Sminov took a slight pause, and his expression gradually turn into ecstasy.</br>
</br>
Liquor!</br>
</br>
Mushroom wine!</br>
</br>
The two Russians looked at each other and simultaneously began to laugh hysterically.</br>
</br>
Alcohol was a wonderful substance!</br>
</br>
Even if it were a poisonous mushroom-brewed alcohol, as long as they could distill the alcohol and drink it.</br>
</br>
As for the taste, who cares?</br>
</br>
Anyway, vodka was almost the taste of alcohol, and many people had not tasted alcohol for more than ten years. Even the most inferior blended alcohol would be the finest wine in the world for the Russians.</br>
</br>
As long as it was alcohol, they were never picky!</br>
</br>
"I'll give you a task." Yegor's expression changed. "Select two field researchers and be sure to tackle the issue of brewing drinkable mushroom wine!"</br>
</br>
As if he had already smelled the alcohol, Sminov's back was straight as he shouted loudly.</br>
</br>
"Guaranteed to complete the mission!"</br>
</br>
"Go now!"</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After Old Luo casually strolled out of the North Gate Commercial Street, he disappeared into a nearby dark alley. After he turned two corners, he walked into a dead end.</br>
</br>
In front of the run-down wall, he put his hand against the wall and suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"It's time to come out."</br>
</br>
With an applause, a man with a felt hat on and in an old black suit walked into the alley.</br>
</br>
"Not bad."</br>
</br>
The five men standing behind him were all in black suits too.</br>
</br>
Six automatic rifles were in their hands, and the six men stood at the entrance to the dead end, they blocked Old Luo's only escape route.</br>
</br>
The man smiled happily as he looked at Old Luo without any way to flee.</br>
</br>
"When did you notice?"</br>
</br>
"From the time you stared at me," Old Luo grinned; the shadow of the alley blocked the disdainful expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" The man raised his eyebrows with interest. "That's interesting. But anyone with a little intelligence shouldn't be stupid enough to walk into a dead end.... Or are you just lost?"</br>
</br>
Old Luo smiled and did not answer but asked.</br>
</br>
"Who sent you? The Church? Wan Peng? Or the famous Ding Liwei?"</br>
</br>
The man did not answer and just looked at Old Luo with a sly smile.</br>
</br>
Seeing that man didn't respond, Old Luo burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"Wait... is it that Tiger's clan?"</br>
</br>
"Is it important?" The man quietly spoke while he snapped a finger, "You just need to know that someone wants your life. That is enough."</br>
</br>
The five gunmen behind the man all simultaneously loaded their rifle, took a half step forward, and pointed the black muzzles at Old Luo in the dead end, stopping any chance of his survival.</br>
</br>
"Good night," The man gently lowered his felt hat and said in a hoarse voice, "Sweet dreams."</br>
</br>
Old Luo smiled.</br>
</br>
"Good night."</br>
</br>
The slender dagger, as thin as a scalpel, slipped from his cuff and was expertly pinched at his fingertips.</br>
</br>
Under the dim moonlight, the silver was like a shimmer of light, undetectable.</br>
</br>
Like feathers and the shackles of the Grim Reaper, the unspoken words blew into the black suit man's ear.</br>
</br>
"You too, sweet dreams."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Pingan Street was already asleep, but the Pan-Asia Cooperation building was still brightly lit.</br>
</br>
In the quiet Shangjing, like the candlelight of the civilized world, the last lingering flame swayed into the empty and dark night.</br>
</br>
In the conference room, where the Pan-Asia officials held their meetings, the senior officials of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance held another meeting.</br>
</br>
However, the nature of this meeting was somewhat different from that of the last meeting. The number of attendees was less than half of the previous ones. They were representatives of the forces working in the building, such as Ding Liwei, Wan Peng, and so on.</br>
</br>
Like Xu Tiannan, although he led the Guardian Sect as the archbishop, his force migrated to Shangjing, so he was only regarded as a foreigner. Even though his force was not to be reckoned with, he still couldn't squeeze into the core of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
Mayor Liu sighed at the conference table.</br>
</br>
"The city gate tax at four crystals is still too high, and the survivors have reacted negatively to it. The City Hall received a thousand complaint letters today."</br>
</br>
Among all the people sitting here, as the mayor, he was the one with the least amount of power.</br>
</br>
The reason why he rose to the position was probably the result of mutual compromise between the leaders. Either Ding Liwei or Wan Peng could easily be in this position with more stability.</br>
</br>
"High?" Wan Peng snorted. "I feel we charged too low."</br>
</br>
Because of NAC's astronomical bill, he bled crystals with his warehouse shrinking by one million crystals. Even with the financial resources of his Sunday club, it was still a large expense.</br>
</br>
"We only got five million," Ding Liwei said. "After all, our expenses are not small. It's impossible to squeeze out ten million crystals to the NAC. The city gate tax will continue to be maintained at four. No matter how much resistance, it must be carried out. At least it should last until the spring of next year. This is our bottom line."</br>
</br>
The factories needed crystals, workers and soldiers also required crystals. The profit from hunting was just a drop in the bucket. The capital chain and the supply chain got intermingled. Although they indeed possessed wealth, they still must be cautious of their finances as there was no room for error.</br>
</br>
"I mean, at least to make the news public—"</br>
</br>
"Impossible," Wan Peng interrupted the words of Mayor Liu. "Are you considering the consequences of publicity? Why did we want to block the news of the Badaling Military Outpost at all costs? Think about it, Mayor Liu, if you let Pingan Street survivors know that hundreds of CCCP tanks have rolled to the doorstep of Shangjing, what will they do?"</br>
</br>
"The news will spread sooner or later." Mayor Liu smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"We'll deal with it when it does," Wan Peng said and stared at him. "At that time, we naturally will let them believe that the tanks were not coming for us."</br>
</br>
Mayor Liu still wished to add something, but in the end, he swallowed his words.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's opinion was naturally the consensus reached by the Survivors Alliance. As the mayor, he didn't have the right to comment, let alone change the mind of the leaders.</br>
</br>
"The next question." Ding Liwei looked at the meeting table at the man wearing glasses.</br>
</br>
The man wearing glasses nodded. "The next question. The Guardian Sect plans to move to Pingan Street within three days. Xu Tiannan asked us to arrange a place for his people, preferably at the East Gate of Pingan Street because their settlement is closer to the East Gate."</br>
</br>
"Is he not staying in the gym?" Ding Liwei frowned.</br>
</br>
"Because of the Russians."</br>
</br>
Russians.</br>
</br>
Someone said the word.</br>
</br>
When the word appeared on the conference table, the whole room suddenly fell silent.</br>
</br>
After a long time.</br>
</br>
"Approved," Ding Liwei slowly responded, then looked at Mayor Liu. "Go arrange it. Move part of the slums at the East Gate to the West Gate."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Mayor Liu nodded.</br>
</br>
"Go now."</br>
</br>
"Yes..."</br>
</br>
Mayor Liu simply packed up the things on the table and left the conference table.</br>
</br>
The door of the conference room closed.</br>
</br>
After a while, someone broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Russians are in the subway."</br>
</br>
"DAMMIT!" Wan Peng slammed his fist against the table, and gnashed his teeth. "Why couldn't they choose anywhere but the subway!"</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's expression was not so great either.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he also cursed the Russians in his mind.</br>
</br>
The man in the windbreaker sighed. He hadn't said anything since the beginning of the meeting, but then spoke for the first time.</br>
</br>
"What should we do now?"</br>
</br>
"First, stop the project. We'll wait for the Russians and NAC to leave first," Ding Liwei slightly frowned while staring at the subway lines on the holographic map. "Fortunately, they are at Line 35... I hope they don't find anything. As long as they don't go there, everything will be fine."</br>
</br>
"Stop? Okay, I'm going to the construction site now." The man in the windbreaker stood up and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
"Wait." Ding Liwei suddenly stopped him.</br>
</br>
"What else?" The man turned around.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei stared at him solemnly and said word by word.</br>
</br>
"You must find that old Luo."</br>
</br>
The man in the windbreaker nodded and quietly responded.</br>
</br>
"Rest assured."</br>
</br>
"He can't run."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Backdoor program?" Jiang Chen sat up on the bed and revealed a stern expression. "What?"</br>
</br>
"Do you want to activate Safe Mode?"</br>
</br>
"Of course!"</br>
</br>
In the holographic image, a stream of data flashed through Jean's pupils.</br>
</br>
Safe Mode was immediately activated, and the interdimensional communication and electromagnetic wave communication chip of the watch were physically disconnected.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen felt his watch heat up.</br>
</br>
He knew Jean was using the full computing power of the wrist-mounted computer to destroy the backdoor program.</br>
</br>
In a short while, smoke along with a burnt smell appeared from the side of the watch.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed and touched the side of the watch.</br>
</br>
Soon, he snatched a fine mechanical mosquito from the side of the watch.</br>
</br>
The mosquito had six limbs and had a data needle on its head. However, it was somewhat distorted because he snatched onto it. The mechanical mosquito should have optical invisibility capability, or else he would have sensed its presence.</br>
</br>
The "mosquito" likely downloaded the backdoor program to his watch.</br>
</br>
"Done?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jean said proudly. "You know who wrote my AI."</br>
</br>
I should thank Yao Yao when I go back.</br>
</br>
In his mind, Jiang Chen indulged for a moment and asked.</br>
</br>
"How much data was stolen?"</br>
</br>
"The amount of data transferred was only 1.3 megabyte."</br>
</br>
"List the documents that could have been stolen." Jiang Chen immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger... the suspected stolen documents are as follows..."</br>
</br>
Following Jiang Chen's instructions, Jean took out the information that might have been stolen and listed it as a catalogue with abstracts before presenting it in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When his eyes swept over the list, he breathed a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
The stolen documents were irrelevant information. He didn't have the habit of carrying important information with him. The interdimensional communication chip was separately encrypted, and the attacker who infiltrated his watch wrist-mounted computer was unable to reach that stage yet.</br>
</br>
"Can I lock the attacker's coordinates?" Jiang Chen suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was uncertain if the way Jean looked at him was the same as how she would look at an idiot...</br>
</br>
"If there was a satellite that tracks the signal source, then it is not impossible," Jean replied.</br>
</br>
"Well, I know I asked a very stupid question." Jiang Chen coughed.</br>
</br>
Jean's holographic image scattered like sand and disappeared from his side.</br>
</br>
The wrist-mounted computer was performing high-intensity computations. Now the CPU and RAM were both burning. In order preserve the hardware's life, Jean entered hibernation mode to save computing resources and release the memory of the wrist-mounted computer...</br>
</br>
After he stood up, Jiang Chen went to the window and recalled the people he met today.</br>
</br>
</br>
Old Luo, who he previously encountered in the bar; the person that stalked him on the road. Not accounting for those two, there were many opportunities to release the mechanical mosquito... There would be too many suspects who might download the backdoor program to his watch.</br>
</br>
Next to the window, Jiang Chen gazed into the night view of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
After being deep in thought, Jiang Chen reached out and restarted the communication chip on his watch and called Zhou Guoping.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me," Jiang Chen was concise.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping at the other end of the phone said respectfully.</br>
</br>
"What is the order, General?"</br>
</br>
"How infiltrated are your people in Pingan Street?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, boss, you came to the right person—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to waste too much time with him, so he directly interrupted his words and said.</br>
</br>
"Perfect, go and do something for me."</br>
</br>
"Please instruct me."</br>
</br>
"Help me investigate two people," Jiang Chen paused before he continued. "One's name is Scarecrow, the boss of Hell Courier. The other is Sura. If possible, bring his people to me."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the dimly lit room, the holographic screen flickered. Only the sound of the fan running could be heard.</br>
</br>
Rows of data flowed through the screen at an incredible speed.</br>
</br>
The speed at which a man tapped the trackpad gradually accelerated, accelerated, and accelerated...</br>
</br>
Eventually it accelerated to the limit.</br>
</br>
Ten fingers have turned into residual images and formed countless ripples on the touchpad.</br>
</br>
"DAMMIT!" A fist slammed onto the table, and both of the man's hands left the touchpad as he leaned back against the chair, his face full of gloom.</br>
</br>
A woman walked up to his side with cups of coffee and placed one of the cups next to his keyboard.</br>
</br>
"How's it going?"</br>
</br>
"It's awful." The man shook his head and said, "Lost a mechanical mosquito."</br>
</br>
The woman's face showed a flash of surprise.</br>
</br>
"A mechanical mosquito. They can even detect mechanical mosquitos? This alertness is really..."</br>
</br>
"Do you want to say too high? You guessed it," The man shrugged and said.</br>
</br>
Just then, a muffled sound came from the wall, and a ray of light scattered into the dark room.</br>
</br>
The two moved their hands to their waists.</br>
</br>
However, when they saw the person standing at the door, they sighed in unison and moved their hands away</br>
</br>
"I'm back."</br>
</br>
Old Luo pushed open the door, walked in, and closed the elevator door.</br>
</br>
"What's on your body..." The woman looked at him, slightly surprised.</br>
</br>
"I came across a little trouble." After he tossed the broken coat on the hanger, Old Luo sat down on the sofa, took out a cigarette from his pocket, and lit it for himself while he asked casually, "How's the investigation going?"</br>
</br>
"Like you," The man sitting in front of the touchpad shrugged. "Ran into a little trouble."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Old Luo raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"The person responsible for the target's information security has a relevant skill rating of at least A, or even S." The man picked up the cup of coffee with a weird color on the table, took a sip, and bitterly savored the taste. "Unbelievable, what age is this? There are still people who will pay attention to cybersecurity?"</br>
</br>
"Are you not a S-class?" Old Luo grinned. "Someone can make the famous Greyhound feel challenged?"</br>
</br>
"Attack and protection are two concepts," The man known as Greyhound shook his head. "Just like football, attacking is also different when you're at home compared to when you're away. Not to mention the hardware situation we have. I have used this server for more than 30 years."</br>
</br>
"Nothing?" asked Old Luo.</br>
</br>
"The mechanical mosquito is gone. Or, do you want to put another fly? Maybe this time—"</br>
</br>
"We can't continue to waste precious resources on him." Old Luo shook his head, looked at the ceiling and spat out a smoke ring. He then gazed at the smoke slowing fading and began to seemingly mutter to himself, "Especially when we still haven't found out what NAC knows about that thing."</br>
</br>
"What do you mean?"</br>
</br>
"You continue to try to crack the security procedures," Old Luo tapped his cigarette and then slowly said, "It is top priority to find that thing ahead of Ding Liwei and the Guardian Sect."</br>
</br>
"Leave it to me... I mean I'll try my best." Greyhound ​​spread his hands and sighed. "Tomorrow, I will go to the market again to see if I can get some old parts back, at least let it work. Until everything is over... it's too old."</br>
</br>
"Go." Old Luo nodded.</br>
</br>
The room returned to silence.</br>
</br>
The server seemed to be down again. Greyhound looked at it with helplessness as he held onto a wrench. In the meantime, the woman sat on the chair and read a book by the dim light, as she tried to kill some time.</br>
</br>
And Old Luo, just quietly stared at the spicy smoke ring that dissipated at the edge of the ceiling.</br>
</br>
After a long time, he sighed softly and threw the burnt cigarette butt into the bin.</br>
</br>
"It's getting more and more chaotic."</br>
</br>
Originally, their competitors were only Ding Liwei and Wan Peng of Pingan Street, as well as the Guardian's Sect. With the sudden fall of the Badaling Military Outpost, CCCP and NAC also entered the game.</br>
</br>
The most important thing was that the chips they carried weren't small.</br>
</br>
Maybe there would be an outcome to this game before the end of the year.</br>
</br>
Or maybe earlier...</br>
</br>
"Perhaps it's time to deal the hand?"</br>
</br>
Old Luo stared at the ceiling quietly. There was an intrigued light that appeared in his eyes and his dry lips moved as he seemingly muttered to himself.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1171: Auction Part 1</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen stretched his body, yawned, and sat up from the bed.</br>
</br>
After he quickly brushed up, Jiang Chen walked into the kitchen, still sleepy. He took out a box of instant pasta and a box of milk from the storage dimension and stuffed the pasta into the microwave oven on the cabinet.</br>
</br>
Then, he placed the milk and the pasta that dripped with tomato sauce onto the table and prepared to enjoy his breakfast. But then, Lu Fan knocked on the door, came in, and saluted.</br>
</br>
"Gen... boss, this is an invitation from the hotel manager."</br>
</br>
"An invitation?"</br>
</br>
Still yawning, Jiang Chen put down his fork and took the invitation from Lu Fan. He glanced at it for a moment before he displayed an intrigued expression.</br>
</br>
The Dorsett Hotel had an auction at ten in the morning and it was being held in the lobby on the second floor. He was holding the invitation to the auction along with an admission ticket.</br>
</br>
Although he did not register to participate in the auction, but because he lived in the presidential suite on the top floor, the hotel manager certainly would not miss a rich guest. Therefore, whether he registered or not, the hotel manager would send an invitation out of respect. What's more, the hotel manager prepared a VIP booth along with a beautiful waitress to serve him.</br>
</br>
After all, apart from the really wealthy, no one would live in the presidential suite that cost 200 crystals per night.</br>
</br>
The profit of a Death Claw was only about 50 crystals. Living in the hotel for one night meant four Death Claws must be killed. Other than the people with no better place to spend their wealth, even the rich would not waste money on accommodation.</br>
</br>
Since there were no other arrangements that morning, he decided to check out the auction.</br>
</br>
With the thought in his mind, Jiang Chen left the invitation aside and continued to enjoy his breakfast.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
There were still ten minutes left before the auction started.</br>
</br>
With the reception of the waitress, Jiang Chen entered the auction venue from the VIP passage and into the VIP booth prepared for him at the Dorsett Hotel.</br>
</br>
The waitress respectfully pushed open the wooden door, slightly bowed, then stepped aside to invite him in.</br>
</br>
Red wooden beams decorated the roof, and the wooden floor was covered with a fur he couldn't identify. The room thirty square meters in size was lined with antique furniture. Even for pre-war standards, the decor would be considered extremely luxurious.</br>
</br>
In the VIP booth, a beautiful waitress in a cheongsam stood next to the red wooden table.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, she greeted him with a warm smile and a respectful bow. The neckline of the cheongsam inadvertently revealed a large area of softness. Her smile and her gesture, all lingered with temptation.</br>
</br>
After quickly examining the VIP booth, Jiang Chen thought that the owner of this place must be a powerful individual to be able to possess this asset on Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, regarding power, no one was more powerful than him.</br>
</br>
So, it was only a thought in his mind, nothing more.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the waitress took out a business card and courteously handed it to him with both hands.</br>
</br>
"This is the business card of our boss, and I hope you, sir, can accept it."</br>
</br>
"Business card?" After he received the business card, Jiang Chen smiled and looked at it. "Your boss is Mei Zhiyong?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," the waitress's face displayed a short glimpse of pride. "The Dorsett Hotel is just one of our boss's assets. Although he did not join the Survivors Alliance, my boss's influence in Shangjing is comparable to the members of the alliance."</br>
</br>
"Your boss is very powerful?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The waitress laughed and didn't act arrogantly because of her boss's identity. Instead, she said with the same respect.</br>
</br>
"I don't mean anything else, just listening to your accent, you should be from the South. Our boss recently bought two merchant fleets and is doing business with the survivors' in Wanghai. A friend is another connection. Well, the boss told me that if I ever see an influential businessman from the South, I must do my best to serve our friend... I hope you won't mind sir."</br>
</br>
"The auction process will be introduced by the host, I wish you can find your favorite item at the auction."</br>
</br>
With another bow, the waitress no longer disturbed Jiang Chen, and exited the booth.</br>
</br>
Inside the room, Jiang Chen sat in the old chair and overlooked the crowd gathered in the auction hall.</br>
</br>
The windows of the VIP Booth were unidirectional, light-transparent glass. From the outside, only blurred figures were visible, but from the inside, everything was crystal clear. The design maximized the privacy of the VIPs.</br>
</br>
After all, not only valuable items were auctioned here, so were items with "unknown" sources. If someone had an eye on an teim but did not win, it would be troublesome.</br>
</br>
For this very reason, even in the regular seats, the bidders wore masks randomly distributed by the hotel. Only a card with a number represented their respective identities.</br>
</br>
A booklet was presented to Jiang Chen, and the beautiful host smiled.</br>
</br>
"This is the catalogue of the auction items. If you see anything that interests you, just let me know?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see."</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen took the catalogue and flipped a few pages.</br>
</br>
In terms of scale, the level of this auction was undoubtedly quite high. Aside from the dozens of VIP booths, there were hundreds of merchants and riches that sat in the auction hall. With such a large scale, there should be some interesting items.</br>
</br>
And it was indeed true. When Jiang Chen flipped through the pages, he suddenly showed interest… or an intrigued smirk.</br>
</br>
"It's here?" Speaking to himself, his fingers slid over the item, remembered the number, and turned to the next page.</br>
</br>
The crowd in the venue spoke amongst themselves. Then on the platform in the center, a ray of light suddenly appeared.</br>
</br>
In the chatter, the auctioneer stepped onto the platform, clapped his hands to signal everyone to focus on him, and then announced the beginning of the auction...</br>
</br>
In general, the process was similar to the modern world.</br>
</br>
The auctioneer spectacularly praised each auction item and led many wealth individuals to bid. The auction items also varied greatly. There were commodity items that bankrupt merchants were desperate to get rid of, ingenious high-tech products, a box of canned beef, and even people.</br>
</br>
"...The next auction item is Zhao Qiuran! Many people should have heard of her name. Yes, she is a lone traveler active in Haizhou. Because of an accident, she was captured by a raider clan. By the way, the seller, in an effort to receive a good price, has not done anything to her, if you know what I mean. Ahe. Muscle Strength 41, Bone Strength 30, Reflex 37, Brain Activity 13, Gun Rating S, Combat Rating A+, Sneak Rating B... Starting price, 1500 crystals!"</br>
</br>
A woman with her hair scattered was fixed on a metal cart and forced to kneel down. The cart was pushed by two bodyguards with guns onto the center of the platform. Under the light, the auctioneer grabbed her loose hair and showed her face to the buyers in the audience.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1171"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1171: Auction Part 2</br>
</div></br>
</br>
He had to admit, even with the weariness on her face, it didn't hinder her beauty.</br>
</br>
However, what made Jiang Chen even more surprised was her Muscle Strength and Reflex.</br>
</br>
Good lord, it's a superhuman with stats higher than him. Why are lone travelers so OP?</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the eyes fiercer than the murderous Death Claw as well as the murderous vibe, he almost wanted to purchase her to be his bodyguard.</br>
</br>
With the exhibition of this "item", the atmosphere of the entire auction was pushed to a peak.</br>
</br>
In order to compete for this "item", several rich people bid fiercely against each other. With many competing bids, the beautiful lone traveler was won by a buyer who almost couldn't squeeze into his suit with a price of a kinetic skeleton and 7,000 crystals.</br>
</br>
She was pushed back with the cart, and the unfortunate Miss Zhao Qiuran disappeared from everyone's eyes. Items worth more than 1,000 crystals must be settled through special channels. It was meant to protect the privacy of buyers.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that in the corner of the hall, a chubby man with fat squeezing out from the buttons of his suit stood up in excitement as he rubbed his hands. He followed the hotel waiter and then went backstage.</br>
</br>
He was eager to inspect his "item".</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was his illusion, but Jiang Chen read a hint of disdain on Miss Zhao Qiuran's face when she was pushed back. She didn't look nervous at all. Either she was prepared to die, or she prepared backup plans.</br>
</br>
The chubby man probably wouldn't be able to enjoy his item.</br>
</br>
He shook his head, then Jiang Chen left the thought behind and continued to read through the catalog.</br>
</br>
Even if he bought her, she was likely to be used as a sex toy. He was not a philanthropist, and he didn't need something as disdainful as a sex toy. It just didn't make sense to take on the risk while spending 7,000 crystals.</br>
</br>
What's more, he couldn't help everyone.</br>
</br>
In less than half an hour, the auction sold more than 20 slaves at an incredible speed.</br>
</br>
Among them were mature women who were graceful and little lolis in cute skirts. The age range served people with all different tastes.</br>
</br>
In addition, Jiang Chen also found a very interesting thing.</br>
</br>
Often the female lone travelers with only above average beauty could be sold at a higher price than the pre-war celebrities with perfect figures and beauty. For example, a former actress who had produced a lot of albums and starred in two movies was only sold for 4,000 crystals, which was just half the price of Zhao Qiuran.</br>
</br>
Is it because the capturing process is more difficult?</br>
</br>
Or because of a deformed desire to conquer, or some other psychological needs...</br>
</br>
The children of the former Pan-Asia Cooperation officials, especially the non-clone ones with complete ID information, were also highly sought after by the rich.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the other side of the auction hall, Wan Peng was also in a VIP booth. He looked at the auction venue leisurely as he enjoyed the pair of hands perfect like jade massaging him.</br>
</br>
</br>
Next to him stood a middle-aged man in a suit.</br>
</br>
Judging from his respectful look, he should be Wan Peng's butler.</br>
</br>
"Is the investigation done?"</br>
</br>
"Not yet," said the middle-aged man. "The hotel is not willing to cooperate with our investigation. They said that if they disclosed the information of the buyer, the reputation of the Dorsett Hotel would be completely ruined."</br>
</br>
After listening to the middle-aged man, Wan Peng's expression didn't change. His eyes half-narrowed, enjoying the massage while he ordered.</br>
</br>
"It's okay. If this is the case, we'll do Mr. Ma a favor and purchase it."</br>
</br>
As he spoke, the slave auction came to an end.</br>
</br>
Now, half of the entire auction was over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen crossed his legs, looked at the catalog, and used one ear to listen to the auctioneer praising each item. However, as everything was irrelevant to him, he didn't show any interest.</br>
</br>
As the beautiful host examined the VIP who just flipped through the same catalog, she was anxious, but she could not say anything.</br>
</br>
Just then, in the center of the auction hall, a black trolley was pushed up.</br>
</br>
From the tray on the trolley, the auctioneer picked up a card.</br>
</br>
"It is said that there is a mysterious subway line buried deep under the more than 40 subway lines in Shangjing that serves as the passage to the Pan-Asia Cooperation's strategic reserve. It is not within the urban transportation system and is not open to the public. This special 'subway line' is called Line 0!"</br>
</br>
People began exchanging information and whispering.</br>
</br>
In VIP booth 076, Jiang Chen put down the catalog in his hand, looked at the auctioneer on the platform, and waited quietly for him to continue. In VIP booth 001 directly opposite of him, Wan Peng also slightly opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
"It is rumored that Subway Line 0 is not an ordinary subway line. It is buried with a large amount of war storage materials and industrial equipment. It is the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation. If anyone possesses the treasure, this person will undoubtedly become the richest individual in the entire Shangjing area and even the whole wasteland!"</br>
</br>
"And this card in my hand is the ticket to Subway Line 0. It is rumored that even if the location is found, a special ID card is required to pass the security at Subway Line 0... ID card of Subway Line 0, starting price, 1,000 crystals!"</br>
</br>
Whoever possessed the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation would become the richest person on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
It was tempting, but the survivors were not stupid.</br>
</br>
Disregarding the location of the treasure, the first issue would be its existence. Even with the key to the treasure chest, so what?</br>
</br>
But that being said, this ID card must possess some value, at least it could be valued as a collection item.</br>
</br>
What if the legendary Subway Line 0 was discovered one day? The buyer would be able to go directly or they could sell the card to someone and generate a great return.</br>
</br>
Of course, considering the risks involved, even those interested in biding didn't have a high price set in their mind.</br>
</br>
"Eleven hundred!"</br>
</br>
"Twelve hundred!"</br>
</br>
"Five thousand!"</br>
</br>
Five thousand crystals!</br>
</br>
Everyone gasped the cool air and cast their sights on VIP booth 001 who raised the price to five thousand.</br>
</br>
What kind of person was willing to spend five thousand crystals to buy a small card?</br>
</br>
Even the auctioneer in the middle was shocked by the wealth displayed by the buyer of VIP booth 001.</br>
</br>
As soon as the auctioneer regained clarity, he immediately shouted.</br>
</br>
"Five thousand crystals once!"</br>
</br>
"Five thousand crystals twice!"</br>
</br>
"Five thousand crystals..."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng smirked and leaned back against the chair. To be honest, Ding Liwei and he both had one of these ID cards. The reason why he spent this money was to prevent someone else from receiving the "ticket" to Subway Line 0.</br>
</br>
There were enough people interested in Subway Line 0. The last thing he wanted would be to have another unstable factor.</br>
</br>
Five thousand crystals, worth it...</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand crystals!"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's smile froze and his face gradually turned gloomy.</br>
</br>
"Twenty thousand!"</br>
</br>
There was a commotion in the auction hall.</br>
</br>
The card was actually bid to a price of twenty thousand crystals. The host felt that the palm of his hand that held the wooden hammer begin to sweat.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, twenty thousand crystals once..."</br>
</br>
"Fifty thousand."</br>
</br>
VIP booth 076 again raised its placard.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's expression turned even more gloomy.</br>
</br>
The host looked at him hesitantly, asking him if he was going to bid more, but she saw that Wan Peng just waved his hand and then spoke a few words to the middle-aged man next to him.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man nodded and left the room.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng looked outside and stared at the VIP booth numbered 076. He gnashed his teeth and thought in his mind, Don't let me know who you are. Don't ever think about Line 0, otherwise, you can go die!</br>
</br>
The fifty thousand crystals bid pushed the atmosphere to a climax.</br>
</br>
"Fifty thousand! VIP booth 076 is bidding Fifty thousand! Is there a higher price? If not, Fifty thousand, once, fifty thousand, twice, five thousand thrice..."</br>
</br>
On the platform, the auctioneer shouted three times, and the wooden hammer smashed down.</br>
</br>
"Deal!"</br>
</br>
Just like this, with an astronomical price of fifty thousand crystals, this mysterious ID card was collected by Jiang Chen in VIP booth 076.</br>
</br>
fifty thousand crystals to buy a card was certainly considered wasteful. The same price could purchase a customized power armor on Pingan Street!</br>
</br>
The people in the hall turned their eyes to VIP booth 076. They all wished to know the mysterious buyer.</br>
</br>
However, apart from a faint illusion, they could not see anything. They could only look at the unidirectional light-transparent glass and dream of the magnificent wealth.</br>
</br>
In VIP booth 076, the beautiful host next to Jiang Chen was flushing with excitement.</br>
</br>
For every item Jiang Chen purchased, she collected a small commission. Although this ratio was very small, she could receive fifty crystals on the fifty thousand crystals purchase. It was almost the equivalent to her basic salary of one month.</br>
</br>
Conversely, if Jiang Chen didn't buy anything without even bidding once, and the hotel would punish her. Precisely because of this, she was so anxious when Jiang Chen seem disinterested.</br>
</br>
The beautiful host with her charming smile gazed at Jiang Chen. Her watery eyes were full of passion.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen already purchased what he needed, he didn't want to stay further and stood up.</br>
</br>
"There is still half an hour left of the auction. Do you not want to stay, sir?" The host asked.</br>
</br>
"I already bought what I needed. Send the item to my room after."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and left the room.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Subway Line 0.</br>
</br>
Before he came to Shangjing, Jiang Chen had never heard of this term. However, when he saw the description of Subway Line 0 in the catalog, he gradually became interested.</br>
</br>
Digging an entire subway line hundreds of meters underground shouldn't be used to store nutrient supply or canned food. The items inside should at least not be cheaper than building this strategic subway line.</br>
</br>
The key term "The Treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation" really caught his attention.</br>
</br>
Of course, while he was interested, he did not immediately bid for it. Although the price was not his top concern, why would he waste money on purpose? No one could guarantee that the ID card was a real ID card nor if the legendary Subway Line 0 really existed.</br>
</br>
However, only when VIP booth 001 across from him offered the high price of five thousand crystals did Jiang Chen's concern dissipate and he made the decision to purchase the card.</br>
</br>
If Wan Peng learned that it was due to his decision of offering a high bid price that made Jiang Chen make up his mind to win the bid for this ID card, he would probably hurt himself. When VIP booth 076 offered a bid of ten thousand crystals, he immediately upped the bid to twenty thousand.</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen ended any possibility with the monstrous bid of fifty thousand crystals...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left the auction venue from the VIP passage, he was about to walk to the elevator when he saw a middle-aged man approach him.</br>
</br>
The man stood in front of Jiang Chen and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice.</br>
</br>
"Do you have time for a quick chat?"</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't even look at him and walked straight to the elevator.</br>
</br>
The expression on the face of the middle-aged man froze as he looked at Jiang Chen walk pass him.</br>
</br>
Although he also thought he would encounter obstacles here, he did not expect the rejection to be this direct. His response didn't leave him any face.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was about to go into the elevator, the middle-aged man thought of the task that his boss gave to him and rushed forward to stop in front of Jiang Chen. Then he revealed a smile on his face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up. When he saw the man in front of him, he finally took a closer look at the individual.</br>
</br>
A neat hairstyle, black suit with a black tie, and black leather shoes...</br>
</br>
If this place was not the apocalypse, Jiang Chen would have categorized him as an insurance agent.</br>
</br>
"Sir, may I ask for your name?" The middle-aged man asked after he cleared his throat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not intend to interact with him, but he suddenly thought of something as a mischievous smile formed and quickly faded. Then he said.</br>
</br>
"Lu Fan."</br>
</br>
"Lu Fan?" The middle-aged man frowned slightly. He carefully scanned the name in his mind and found that there was no one that matched his particular face. So, his voice became mixed with a hint of contemptuousness as he said in an authoritative manner, "My boss is inviting you to have a cup of tea."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Oh? Who is your boss?" Jiang Chen smiled. "Do I know him?"</br>
</br>
"Wan Peng, Manager Wan." The middle-aged man's eyebrows rose. His arrogance of being a left-hand man of a powerful individual fully displayed. "Have you heard of the Survivors Alliance? The Pingan Street you're stepping on is partially owned by this powerful individual. If you understand the situation, I advise you..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen just grinned by slightly lifting the corner of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"So?"</br>
</br>
The expression of the middle-aged man gradually turned gloomy.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean? Are you planning to reject the invitation?"</br>
</br>
"When did I show interest?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man suddenly smiled. The gloom on his face dissipated and was instead replaced by a look that seemed as if he was looking at a dead person.</br>
</br>
"Good, very good."</br>
</br>
The elevator arrived.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man stepped aside, made a gesture to invite Jiang Chen to step into the elevator, and looked at Jiang Chen with a menacing smile.</br>
</br>
"I hope that Mr. Lu will not regret today's choice."</br>
</br>
"Soon you will understand what kind of consequences you will receive if you take something you shouldn't take and you refuse someone you shouldn't refuse."</br>
</br>
"Of course, if you regret it now, you can hand over the ID card and maybe—"</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not even look at him and just stepped into the elevator.</br>
</br>
His contempt attitude was like looking at a tiny ant. It was not even worth the effort to take one more look.</br>
</br>
The door of the elevator closed, and the menacing smile that was frozen on the man's face gradually distorted.</br>
</br>
A rage overwhelmed him and completely destroyed his rationality.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
His fist slammed on the wall. His chest violently pumped as he gnashed his teeth and cursed.</br>
</br>
The people passing by all looked curiously in his direction.</br>
</br>
"WHAT THE FU*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT!"</br>
</br>
Using his fierce expression to intimidate the people looking in his direction, the middle-aged man took a deep breath and adjusted his mentality. Then he looked around before he quickly fixed his attire and hurried away.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Still in the same booth, Wan Peng sat next to the red wooden table as he sipped the tea from NAC and watched the crowds below. The beauty's silky finger gently massaged his shoulders.</br>
</br>
Although he did not purchase any items, the beautiful host behind him did not dare to show any dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
It was not because of anything else other than that his name was Wan Peng.</br>
</br>
Even if her manager Ma Qianjun came here, he still must respectfully greet Wan Peng and call him Brother Wan.</br>
</br>
The auction was nearing its end.</br>
</br>
With interesting items emerging one after another, and the winning price setting new highs. However, all the winning bids were still inferior to the record of fifty thousand crystals.</br>
</br>
When an N20 military power armor was bought by a leader of the Eastern District of Shangjing at a price of forty thousand crystals, it marked the conclusion of the auction.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man who had previously contacted Jiang Chen walked into the booth. He stood to the side of his boss with a sullen expression and lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"Boss."</br>
</br>
"How's the situation?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng asked quietly.</br>
</br>
"The kid is quite uncooperative," The middle-aged man said with indignation. "I had invited him sincerely, but he did not want to cooperate at all. I later stated your name, but he did not show any respect, and instead..."</br>
</br>
"Instead?" An eyebrow raised, Wan Peng looked at his subordinate and asked.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man gritted his teeth and pretended to be furious as he exaggerated the situation.</br>
</br>
"He sneered with disdain and said who the fu*k is..."</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man did not dare to finish his sentence, but rather kept his silence.</br>
</br>
After his subordinate finished, Wan Peng was not angry, instead, he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Haha, really?"</br>
</br>
"Boss..." The middle-aged man, anxiously asked, "What do you think..."</br>
</br>
"There are two ways to solve problems on the wasteland. One is to buy it from them with crystals. As for the second one..." Wan Peng took a sip of the fresh tea. "Is to take it from their dead bodies."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1173: Fifty Thousand Crystals</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Subway Line 0, ID Card, Wan Peng, Shangjing Survivor Alliance...</br>
</br>
Several keywords were connected together by a card.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not sure what was hidden inside Subway Line 0, but he was sure of one thing.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng, Ding Liwei, and even Archbishop Xu Tiannan omitted some information from him.</br>
</br>
They especially did not tell the whole truth in regards to the subway lines in Shangjing City.</br>
</br>
After he went back upstairs, he found Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"Get our brothers to prepare, it's time to go."</br>
</br>
When Lu Fan heard Jiang Chen's words, he was relieved and smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"Gen... boss, you are finally willing to go back?"</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Jiang Chen laughed. "Is it not fun on the streets?"</br>
</br>
"Fun? We're all stressed out from ensuring your safety," Lu Fan said with a bitter expression.</br>
</br>
"Haha," Jiang Chen patted Lu Fan's shoulder. "Great work. When I go back, I will get the chefs to prepare a few pounds of braised beef for you, and get you a few bottles of good booze to help you relax."</br>
</br>
Gulp--</br>
</br>
When the 1.80m tall man heard the words "braised beef" he uncontrollably swallowed.</br>
</br>
"Look at you." Jiang Chen laughed, then kicked him on the butt. "Hurry up and pack everything up in five minutes. If someone isn't ready in five minutes, I promise you he'll drink so much soup that he'll never want to drink soup again."</br>
</br>
"Hehe," Lu Fan rubbed his head in embarrassment before he turned around and jogged away.</br>
</br>
While Lu Fan went back to delegate, Jiang Chen returned to his room, opened the storage dimension, and took out a large box of crystals. 50,000 crystals was not a small number. He only stored around 100,000 crystals in his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not feel pained by this. After all, the entire Pingan Street still owed him 10 million crystals. It won't long before the Shangjing Survivor Alliance hulled a truck-full of crystals to his door.</br>
</br>
Fifty thousand was nothing but a drizzle.</br>
</br>
It didn't take five minutes at all.</br>
</br>
In less than a minute, the twenty guards were packed and stood in the living room in a straight line.</br>
</br>
They still wore their mercenary outfits, but the powerful K2 kinetic skeletons were hidden inside their clothes.</br>
</br>
With a satisfied nod, Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"We may encounter trouble on the way back. Keep your eyes open! If someone is pointing a gun at us, don't talk nonsense and just fire, YOU HEAR ME?"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Twenty guards pounded their chests and replied with force.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After about ten minutes, the auction was over, and the hotel manager personally came to Jiang Chen's room with a few assistants.</br>
</br>
The cobblestone-sized crystals piled in the box illuminated with a mysterious green ray that could blind eyes. The eyes of the assistants all turned dark green. Even the hotel manager who often saw a large number of crystals gulped at the sight.</br>
</br>
</br>
The hotel manager personally scanned the crystals with four crystal quality analyzers for more than twenty minutes before he counted the box-full of crystals.</br>
</br>
The crystals totaled 50,124 units of energy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen considered the extra 124 crystals as their tip.</br>
</br>
After the settlement was complete, Jiang Chen took the ID card from the manager and put it in his pocket. He then asked casually, "Do you not have a bank here? The type that can transfer money?"</br>
</br>
"We don't have that here," The hotel manager shook his head with an apologetic smile. "Only the one-hundred denomination issued by the City Hall can be settled for high-value goods. The denomination can be exchanged for the equivalent value in crystals from the City Hall at any time, but it is only circulated in the walls of Pingan Street. Outside of it, it's a piece of scrap paper.</br>
</br>
The hotel manager sighed.</br>
</br>
"I heard that there is a credit payment system in Wanghai in the south. Only if Shangjing has a similar system."</br>
</br>
It was impossible to open a bank on the wasteland without absolute strength. Even the Shangjing Survivors Alliance didn't have the power to complete this feat.</br>
</br>
In a place without law, daring to open a bank was asking to get robbed.</br>
</br>
What's more, without the ability to protect the wealth, how could others trust their assets with the bank?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pondered, maybe he could move NAC's bank to Shangjing, and open a branch here. The economic and trade exchanges between Shangjing and Wanghai were closely connected and he absolutely deemed it to be necessary.</br>
</br>
However, these plans must wait until the troubles of CCCP were resolved.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Five kilometers away from Pingan Street, a short man rushed into Dongcheng Hospital. He showed his identity to the guard in a fur outfit and then ran upstairs.</br>
</br>
On the side of the parking lot, Brother Tiger with his face bruised was sitting in a chair. The two cats on his face were replaced by a few bandages. At the moment, a woman dressed in a nurse uniform was kneeling between his legs. From her numbness and weary expression, it was easy to see she had suffered a tremendous amount of abuse.</br>
</br>
With an expression of enjoyment, Tiger took out a bad-quality cigarette and lit it for himself.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open and his pawn rushed in.</br>
</br>
"Brother, Brother Tiger!"</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
Tiger was startled and almost couldn't control himself.</br>
</br>
He kicked away the woman who was kneeling in front of him, stood up, and pulled up his pants. Just as he was about to unload his rage, he saw who came in and his anger dissipated.</br>
</br>
Tiger did up his belt and sat back down. Then he asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"What is the situation?"</br>
</br>
"They are out of town!" The short man gasped while he bowed down, "They just left the South Gate. I have told people to follow them."</br>
</br>
"Very good," Tiger's face revealed a menacing smile. He then grabbed a dagger from the table. "Bring dozens of our brothers and follow them back to their settlement. Kill all the men and leave the women. Also, cut the leader's hands and feet for me. I need him alive."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes!" The man nodded quickly.</br>
</br>
"Why're you still here?" Seeing that the pawn did not move, Tiger raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
The short man grinned and bowed again.</br>
</br>
"Here is what happened. Before they left Pingan Street, I sent people to the Dorsett Hotel to learn more about them. I learned a piece of extremely interesting news."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Go on." Tiger said.</br>
</br>
"These people are quite rich! Especially the leader! I heard that they spent fifty thousand crystals at the Dorsett Hotel, just to buy a card that may or may not work."</br>
</br>
Fifty thousand crystals!</br>
</br>
Tiger's eyes suddenly turned red when he heard the number. So red that it looked like his eyes were bleeding. He wished that card belonged to him.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, fifty thousand crystals to buy a card?"</br>
</br>
"It's rumored that the card is the ID card for Subway Line 0's security certification system. But you know that is just a myth."</br>
</br>
Tiger's small eyes narrowed into slits and greed filled his pupils.</br>
</br>
"So, the card is worth fifty thousand crystals?"</br>
</br>
Fifty thousand crystals!</br>
</br>
He had never seen so many crystals in his life!</br>
</br>
If he had fifty thousand crystals, he could buy a set of power armor in Pingan Street!</br>
</br>
With one foot on the chair, Tiger spat out, grabbed the rifle on the table, and fired into the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Soon, after hearing the gunshots, several of his confidants rushed in.</br>
</br>
Shouting at his confidants, Tiger stabbed a dagger into the wooden table and commanded like a true thug.</br>
</br>
"FU*K YA! The juicy piece of meat left town. Go and prepare! Bring our brothers and finish this deal! Drive our modified truck. If we get this deal done, we'll have fun for a year."</br>
</br>
"OHHHHH!!!"</br>
</br>
"MIGHTY TIGER!"</br>
</br>
"TAKE THE MEAT!"</br>
</br>
The cheers of the raiders filled the room.</br>
</br>
The blood of hatred boiled in Tiger's chest as he gathered up his boys.</br>
</br>
As soon as he thought of the humiliation from last night, he could not wait to peel off the man's skin, strip the man's tendons, and cut his flesh to feed the dogs.</br>
</br>
Yesterday's humiliation must be paid one hundred times in return!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1174: Then Make One!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The connecting station of Subway Line 35 was hell.</br>
</br>
The viscous blood immersed every inch of the tiles and shredded meat and severed parts were scattered everywhere. The smell of gunpowder occupied the place and it even covered the terrifying smell of blood. A seemingly endless amount of corpses laid on the ground with the stick-thin arms withering away.</br>
</br>
Pairs of military boots stepped over the dead bodies and stood in front of a collapsed wall.</br>
</br>
"The road ahead is blocked," Sminov said. "Maybe it is the masterpiece of the survivors."</br>
</br>
Yegor did not speak. He walked up to the collapsed gravel pile, extended his right hand, and wiped the wall with his index finger.</br>
</br>
He then gently rubbed his index finger with his thumb and closed his eyes as if he were sensing something.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, he opened his eyes and looked at the collapsed wall, then said slowly.</br>
</br>
"It collapsed a decade ago. It should be directional blasting."</br>
</br>
"It seems to be a dead end." Sminov walked beside the commander and frowned.</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily." Yegor grinned, and his fierce eyes flashed with madness.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Sminov felt a little uneasy for some unknown reasons.</br>
</br>
"Bring the map," Yegor said.</br>
</br>
Soon, a soldier stepped forward and handed him the traffic map of the subway lines in Shangjing.</br>
</br>
When he pushed the map on the wall, Yegor's eagle-like gaze followed the 35th Line all the way east. Eventually, he stopped at Dongcheng Park Station that was now below his feet. The place was the transit station between Line 35 and Line 27 and was also directly above Line 2.</br>
</br>
He used his index finger and thumb to measure the line, as if he was measuring something.</br>
</br>
Soon, a touch of joy appeared.</br>
</br>
"What did you find?" Sminov asked the commander.</br>
</br>
"Dear Comrade Sminov, I don't know if you have heard of Subway Line 0 in Shangjing."</br>
</br>
"I have heard about it. But..." Sminov frowned. "Isn't it just a myth? Like the Future Factory underground in the Kremlin, no one has ever verified it."</br>
</br>
"The best way to cover up a secret is to use a confusing story to cover an irrefutable truth. Of course, I have only recently begun to suspect this..." His gaze continued along Line 27 and stopped at Pingan Street. Yegor's eyes narrowed. "Only now, I'm very convinced that the legendary Subway Line 0 must exist, and the survivors here have been exploring this since ten years ago."</br>
</br>
Yegor's index finger pointed on the map. "Subway line 27 passes directly below the Pan-Asia Cooperation building, which is the politcal center of Pan-Asia Cooperation. This is abnormal, isn't it? Look down. It is directly connected to Line 35 and Line 2. If I didn't guess wrong, the answer is definitely here. Either Line 27 or Line 2 is connected to it."</br>
</br>
As for Line 35.</br>
</br>
They came from Line 35 and thus ruled this line out.</br>
</br>
Sminov took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although he felt that his commander's thoughts were crazy, he could not spot any flaws.</br>
</br>
Line 2 or Line 27, one of which must have a connecting station leading to the legendary Line 0.</br>
</br>
It was a multiple-choice question, and it seemed that it didn't matter if you chose the wrong one?</br>
</br>
"But how do we get there?" Sminov asked the commander. "There is no way."</br>
</br>
"There is no way?" Yegor raised his eyebrow and then his lips formed a fierce arc, "Then make one!"</br>
</br>
Line 2 or Line 27?</br>
</br>
This multiple-choice question could have two answers.</br>
</br>
They had plenty of tactical nuclear warheads.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The South Gate.</br>
</br>
At the warehouse by the South Gate, Jiang Chen took the weapons he stored in the warehouse with his guards and prepared to leave the city.</br>
</br>
However, when they crossed the wall and entered the buffer zone, they found a long queue at the gate. Soldiers armed with rifles and bulletproof vests were searching every single person leaving the city.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Just as he wished to investigate, he heard the survivors next to him whispering.</br>
</br>
"There was an explosion in North Street. I heard there were gunshots too," a person who looked like a lone traveler said.</br>
</br>
"Gunshots? What the fu*k, someone had too much to drink." The mercenary-looking survivor whispered, "Damn, this is going to be a long queue."</br>
</br>
"I heard that Ding Liwei was furious. He ordered the city to be placed under martial law and to search for the suspect. There had been no shootings in Pingan Street for three years, at least not right in the street. Most merchants choose to come and stay in this place because it's safe. Now, someone has slapped the face of the entire militia."</br>
</br>
"If the person gets caught, I'm afraid the punishment will not be light."</br>
</br>
"Light? Oh, they'll probably get locked up with a Death Claw."</br>
</br>
"Right, where did the explosion happen? Have you heard that?"</br>
</br>
"It seemed to be at the Dorsett Hotel..."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen listened to the chatter of the survivors, combined with the previous auction, he had already guessed the story. Miss Zhao Qiuran was indeed a... heroine. She actually bombed the Dorsett Hotel. Did that guy Wan Peng get blown up too? He should have been inside as well.</br>
</br>
Don't die.</br>
</br>
The Survivors Alliance has yet to pay.</br>
</br>
After giving a pat on Lu Fan's shoulder, Jiang Chen whispered a few words to his captain and pointed to the city gate. He moved a chair and sat down. He watched one of his soldiers speak to an officer at the gate and then stuff a crystal worth three hundred points into his hand.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan nodded, then walked toward the officer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not have the leisure to accompany the survivors and stay in line. There was no problem that money couldn't solve.</br>
</br>
More than three hundred crystals would be more than enough to bribe an officer.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen felt someone touch his arm.</br>
</br>
When he turned around, he saw a woman wearing a broken cloak, standing nervously beside him, and whispering in a begging tone.</br>
</br>
"Take me out of here."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment and recognized the face. With a sly smile, he said.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is this the attitude of someone asking for help?"</br>
</br>
What a coincidence. The Dorsett Hotel on North Street blew up, and she was already here at the South Gate. Only her movements were just one step too slow. Immediately when she escaped from the Dorsett Hotel, the militia stationed on Pingan Street put the city under martial law.</br>
</br>
Tightly biting her lower lip, Zhao Qiuran whispered.</br>
</br>
"I know something that's important to you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was really amused by her and laughed.</br>
</br>
"You don't even know who I am, how do you know if something is important to me?"</br>
</br>
"Who you're is not important, the important thing is that you took the card."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, surprised, and frowned.</br>
</br>
"How did you know I took the card?"</br>
</br>
"Can I explain it later?" Zhao Qiuran looked nervously in the direction of the city gate.</br>
</br>
With just moments to think, Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Fine, follow me."</br>
</br>
"Thank you," Zhao Qiuran whispered.</br>
</br>
"Don't thank me yet, and don't say anything, don't look at anything, and just lower your head. Right, where is your slave imprint?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran was confused.</br>
</br>
"Right arm, why?"</br>
</br>
"It's nothing."</br>
</br>
While they spoke, Lu Fan had come over with two soldier-looking men.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked normal, but judging from her slightly stiff expression, she was very tense.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave Lu Fan a look, then looked at the woman in the broken cloak.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan immediately understood and let the two soldiers begin their count.</br>
</br>
Twenty-one people left the queue, followed Lu Fan, and came to the security room under the city gate.</br>
</br>
"Why is there twenty-one?" When he saw Lu Fan with the people he brought, the officer was displeased.</br>
</br>
Counting Lu Fan, it was twenty-two, which was more than the agreed number.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lifted his chin slightly and used his acting skills. In an arrogant manner, he raised his voice.</br>
</br>
"Does a slave count?"</br>
</br>
Then, he reached out and grabbed Zhao Qiuran's arm and lifted up her sleeve.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's action made her feel stunned.</br>
</br>
If she didn't believe that he wouldn't set her up, she was about to run away.</br>
</br>
A string of black barcodes was printed on her arm.</br>
</br>
The officer glanced at it and did not say anything. He waved his hand and told the person to open the side door</br>
</br>
"Let them through."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran's heart finally calmed down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let go of her hand, and with the guards behind her, they walked toward the open door.</br>
</br>
In truth, if they scanned the mark, they would find out that she was the wanted slave they were looking for. However, the officer did not make it difficult for the wealthy owner, or rather, he did not believe Jiang Chen would risk making the entire Pingan Street his enemy to help a criminal.</br>
</br>
Just like that, the group of people safely left Pingan Street in a nerve-wracking state.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1175: You will soon know who is the lunatic</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Zhao Qiuran passed by the guards at the gate, her heart pounded rapidly.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the guards did not measure heart rates as she narrowly escaped from the city.</br>
</br>
After they walked a hundred meters out from the city gate, the group turned onto a street. Just as Zhao Qiuran was about to say something to Jiang Chen, twenty guns were pointed directly at her.</br>
</br>
She swallowed the thank you down and immediately raised her hands.</br>
</br>
Although her stats were higher than everyone else here, her body was not stronger than bullets and kinetic skeletons. She did not doubt for one second that if she showed the slightest hostility, these twenty guns would make her into a sieve.</br>
</br>
"Miss Zhao Qiuran, I think you should be able to talk about it now?" Jiang Chen turned around and looked at Zhao Qiuran, who was tense and said without much emotion. "For example, how did you know I bought that ID card."</br>
</br>
"Telesthesia." Zhao Qiuqi took a deep breath and said quickly, "You should have heard about the hidden genetic code before. My ability can perceive the spiritual characteristics of human beings within a certain range and exert influence... Listen, I absolutely mean no harm."</br>
</br>
Telesthesia?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard these words, he processed the information for a second. Then he suddenly recalled a person he encountered in the modern world.</br>
</br>
Around two years ago, when he destroyed the Kurofune, a girl stood in the middle of the road and used her ability to mentally shock him.</br>
</br>
That was his first contact with someone capable of using spiritual powers.</br>
</br>
He once asked Lin Lin about this but did not get an exact answer.</br>
</br>
Even before the war, the three key words of spirit, brain, and brainwave were high-frequency terms in research topics in the frontiers of biotechnology. These research topics including discussions such as why the brain marrow was enriched with Klein particles, and the supernatural interference of brain waves on physical phenomena. Even in the twenty-second century, these were unsolved mysteries.</br>
</br>
The nature that humans perceived was just the tip of the iceberg.</br>
</br>
The more you climb the mountain, the smaller you will feel. That was a true statement.</br>
</br>
"Are you satisfied with my answer?" Zhao Qiuran stared nervously at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Somewhat," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
He paused for a moment, then continued.</br>
</br>
"You said earlier, you know something that is important to me?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran nodded immediately.</br>
</br>
"I fled through the ventilation ducts and passed VIP booth 001 when I left. Sunday Club owner Wan Peng and his subordinate Lu Sen were inside. I heard they were planning against you..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"Just this?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran's expression froze and she asked awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"Does this not count?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Setting Wan Peng aside, even if Ding Liwei wanted to plot against me, and even if the entire Survivors Alliance or the entire city behind you were against me, I could overturn them, and the city inside out. If he really bothers me, I'll just get rid of him.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words gave Zhao Qiuran chills.</br>
</br>
Although the murderous vibe was not directed at her, the vibe that she felt still made her hands and feet icy.</br>
</br>
Hell, this guy obviously doesn't look strong, how is he scarier than Death Claws.</br>
</br>
But this is bullsh*t right...</br>
</br>
With her scalp numb, Zhao Qiuran kept her hands up and nervously thought.</br>
</br>
She did not know Jiang Chen's identity. In her mind, the identity of the man in front of her should be at most the leader of a settlement. To destroy Pingan Street... just thinking of the heavy machineguns mounted on the giant wall made her unable to think of anything that could do this deed.</br>
</br>
"I still have a question, how did you escape?" Jiang Chen looked at Zhao Qiuran. "There are many ways to make an escaped slave die. I don't believe that the raiders who caught you didn't give you a shackle. Electronic collars, slavery chips, as far as the 'security measures' I know, there are already a lot."</br>
</br>
"There are many ways to put on shackles, and there are many ways to break shackles," said Zhao Qiuran.</br>
</br>
"For example?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Isn't it just a chip implanted in the spinal nerve?" Zhao Qiuran shrugged, "As long as the who implanted it unlocks it, then it's fine."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly nodded.</br>
</br>
Since she did possess spiritual abilities, through the means of mental intervention, she could make the buyers subconsciously lift the security authority on slavery chips.</br>
</br>
"I will remember that you helped me today. I owe you a favor." Holding her hands and taking a half step back, Zhao Qiuran said nervously, "Can you let me go?"</br>
</br>
"A favor?" Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head. "Do you think I need that?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran revealed a stiff expression.</br>
</br>
"So what will it take for you to let me go? Oath of loyalty? Crystals? Or say... sleep with you?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, I'm not interested."</br>
</br>
He waved his hand and gestured to Lu Fan and the others to put down their rifles, then paused. He stared at her for a moment to closely examine her.</br>
</br>
"You're unable to stay in Shangjing further. The Survivors Alliance won't let you go."</br>
</br>
"Do something for me and I can consider taking you to Wanghai."</br>
</br>
"You are a merchant fleet?" Zhao Qiuqi hurriedly asked, "Mercenaries as well? Can you really bring me to Wanghai? I can join you, believe me, my skills are pretty good."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, Lu Fan, and the guards all looked at each other and grinned.</br>
</br>
Just as Zhao Qiuran struggled to understand the situation, the guard next to Jiang Chen blew a whistle and joked.</br>
</br>
"Merchant fleet? Mercenaries? Unfortunately, we are none of those. We are the NAC and it is not so easy to join us."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Behind Jiang Chen, Zhao Qiuran felt she did not have enough brainpower.</br>
</br>
The NAC General?</br>
</br>
At first, she still did not believe what just happened, but when she looked at Jiang Chen deactivating the holographic camouflage, the respect the guards showed, and the twenty shiny K2 kinetic skeletons, she could no longer doubt his identity.</br>
</br>
I don't have anything right now, and I'm not worth being tricked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not tell her what he wanted her to do. Instead, he just asked her to follow him. Of course, Jiang Chen also told her that if she wanted to leave, she could leave at any time without saying goodbye. Just that the next time they meet, they would be strangers.</br>
</br>
The last two sentences were nonsense, Zhao Qiuran certainly would not leave.</br>
</br>
NAC was the perfect shelter, why would she leave?</br>
</br>
Not to mention, she just made an enemy of the entire Survivor Alliance and she feared her wanted poster would be posted on the four gates of Pingan Street the next day. Shangjing no longer had a place for her. Only the NAC could offer her protection.</br>
</br>
Being a lone traveler seemed to be unfettered but it was actually not a good profession. Except for those who really liked to be independent, most people did not become lone travelers by choice. This usually happened because they could not find an organization, or were unable to establish trust with other people.</br>
</br>
You could only rely on yourself.</br>
</br>
If possible, Zhao Qiuran also wished to join a mercenary group or merchant fleet.</br>
</br>
Of course, the premise was that people in the whole group don't have the idea of sleeping with her.</br>
</br>
After following Jiang Chen for quite a long distance, Zhao Qiuran looked down and thought of something.</br>
</br>
Just then, her cautionary senses came online.</br>
</br>
She stopped moving as she alertly looked around and cast out her mental web.</br>
</br>
The tentacles of the spirit extended as far as a kilometer outward. She suddenly found that two hundred spiritual seals had appeared and were concentrated. Judging from the unstable mental fluctuations, they were obviously not friendly.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Jiang Chen also stopped and asked.</br>
</br>
"There is an ambush in front." Zhao Qiuran narrowed her eyes and looked at the building about one kilometer ahead. "They're most likely after us."</br>
</br>
"How many people?"</br>
</br>
"Two hundred to two hundred fifty. It's too far and I can't see the exact number." Zhao Qiuran shook her head. "There is a park nearby, we can go through it and get rid of them-"</br>
</br>
"Prepare," Jiang Chen did not finish listening to her, and just gave an order to Lu Fan. Then he pointed to the building in front of him, "Remember to leave someone alive."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Lu Fan saluted. He left two guards to stay next to Jiang Chen and marched forward with the remaining guards.</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy?" Zhao Qiuqi looked at Jiang Chen as if he was a lunatic and had shock written all over her face. "I said, there are more than two hundred people! You don't know how many heavy weapons are waiting for you, and your first thought is to fight them?!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's lips displayed a disdainful arc but he remained unmoved. He simply gazed at the building one kilometer away.</br>
</br>
"You will soon know who is the lunatic."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1176: 18VS200!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Fifty thousand crystals!</br>
</br>
For the raiders, it was not a large sum, but an astronomical number!</br>
</br>
For fifty thousand crystals, even if it meant fighting with the Mother of the Death Claws, they would do it without hesitation, let alone ambush an unknown "small settlement leader".</br>
</br>
Tiger originally ordered to follow behind that person and wipe out his entire settlement. But in front of fifty thousand crystals, personal grudges seemed trivial.</br>
</br>
To be on the safe side, Tiger accepted his own subordinate's suggestion and changed the plan of following him to the settlement and then ambushing him.</br>
</br>
After all, he was not stupid. For someone who could afford to buy a card with fifty thousand crystals, he would take his safety as his top priority. If they went to his settlement and ended up discovering a few power armors, it would be problematic.</br>
</br>
So he adopted a conservative strategy. Take the person hostage first, get the card, and then torture him to obtain the location of his settlement before he came up with the next plan.</br>
</br>
Of course, although he was not stupid, obviously he was not the brightest either.</br>
</br>
He could not have never imagined that his enemy was not a leader of a settlement, but a warlord from the south.</br>
</br>
"One kilometer ahead...Fu*k, they spotted us."</br>
</br>
Next to the water tank at the top of the building, the man who was watching the street with a binocular snorted. Then, he immediately took out his walkie-talkie and reported the situation to his teammates preparing an ambush on the neighboring street.</br>
</br>
"We were spotted! Their people are spreading out. Follow them and don't let the fat meat escape!"</br>
</br>
As soon as they heard the fat meat that was going to enter their belly about to escape, the ambushing raiders could not sit still any longer.</br>
</br>
The raiders, who kneeled behind the bunkers, grabbed their rifles, loaded the magazines, and ran towards the target. The raiders disguised as scavengers pulled down their disguise and revealed the weapons underneath.</br>
</br>
"They can't get away."</br>
</br>
Hundreds of meters away, a fierce-looking man on a modified truck revealed a vicious smile and his yellow teeth.</br>
</br>
The fierceness radiated from his pupils. He pulled the intercom on the window and yelled into the team channel. "Listen up, the boss said whoever captures the leader of the fat meat will be rewarded five hundred crystals! Also, once we succeed, we can sleep with whoever we want in the clan until we can't even move!"</br>
</br>
"AWHOOOOOO!"</br>
</br>
They were howling like wolves, and the man sitting in the modified truck built on their raising morale.</br>
</br>
"If you want to be rewarded, get on the truck, and get ready to go! Let's let those meat know how the Tiger Clan chops heads!"</br>
</br>
A group of raiders dressed in various clothes walked out from the shadows and rushed to the modified trucks. They then put on plastic covers before climbing onto the truck, ready to fight.</br>
</br>
</br>
The engine's roar filled the streets, and ten modified trucks moved together to transport a group of vicious raiders towards the "Fat Meat".</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, there was a sudden explosion from afar.</br>
</br>
The raider standing on the top of the truck looked up at the clouds in the sky. At this moment, a black dot suddenly emerged from under the clouds and was quickly approaching them.</br>
</br>
"Look, look at it," he slapped another raider and exclaimed while pointing at the sky. "What is that?"</br>
</br>
No one answered him.</br>
</br>
Without the slightest indication.</br>
</br>
The orange-colored bullets hailed down in an instant.</br>
</br>
The raiders on the truck only had time to see a glimpse of the afterimage before they turned into mud under the rain of bullets.</br>
</br>
The Aurora-20 flew by, and the powerful 20mm machinegun fired a hailstorm of bullets, shredding the entire street.</br>
</br>
The man sitting in the truck only heard a homing noise. Before he could even think of what could be happening, he and the truck turned into dust.</br>
</br>
When the dust dissipated, mourning sounds ensued.</br>
</br>
The raiders who fortunately escaped climbed out through the burning steels, dragged their bloody corpses forward, or cried at the edge of the bullet craters</br>
</br>
The countless blank sights gazed out from the shadows of the street.</br>
</br>
It was already afternoon, and the most debilitating part of the zombie's day was almost over. Attracted by screams and explosions, the zombies limped into the messy battlefield and began searching.</br>
</br>
"Don't, don't come close to me!" A raider raised his rifle in horror, looking at the zombies beginning to surround him, he desperately tried to move backward. Then due to his fear, he temporarily forgot about the excruciating pain.</br>
</br>
Some raiders simply gave up, picked up their pistols, and pulled the trigger against their temple.</br>
</br>
The whole street turned into hell...</br>
</br>
"Fi... fighters?"</br>
</br>
Next to Jiang Chen, Zhao Qiuran was astonished as her mouth hung wide open and her gaze fixated on the dust in the distance.</br>
</br>
Although the Aurora-20 quickly pierced into the cloud again, with her dynamic vision and reflex, she still captured the afterimage of the fighter.</br>
</br>
She had roamed on the wasteland for several years. She had seen Death Claws, Mud Crabs, and all kinds of powerful and invincible mutants. However, it was the first time she saw fighters, something that only lived in the conversations of the Blue Skins.</br>
</br>
"Civilized people's weapons," Jiang Chen smiled and walked to a bench on the side of the road. He sat up, crossed his legs, and then slowly said, "I said, you will soon know who is the lunatic."</br>
</br>
When she looked at the man sitting on the bench, Zhao Qiuran gulped subconsciously.</br>
</br>
She asked herself how many times she danced on the fine line between life and death. She had encountered countless powerful lone travelers, mercenaries, and raiders. However, for the first time, she developed a deep fear of someone.</br>
</br>
Even the Mother of the Death Claws did not make her so scared.</br>
</br>
She once thought that there were two kinds of tyrants on the wasteland. One was the leader of a settlement, like Ding Liwei and Wan Peng that commanded thousands, and the other was the powerful lone traveler that could kill Death Claws with one shot.</br>
</br>
But now, the man in front of her refreshed her worldview.</br>
</br>
Even if the two types of tyrant stood in front of him, they would be minuscule, powerless.</br>
</br>
Just when Zhao Qiuqi was zoned out, Jiang Chen spoke again.</br>
</br>
"Don't stand there just like that, it takes time even to kill two hundred chickens." Jiang Chen patted the empty seat next to him. "Come here."</br>
</br>
She did not refuse.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran mechanically walked to Jiang Chen's side and sat down stiffly.</br>
</br>
Just as she restlessly sat down, Jiang Chen took out a lighter and lit a cigarette before speaking without any emotion.</br>
</br>
"You said you owe me a favor. Now is a good time."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran subconsciously asked.</br>
</br>
"How can I help?"</br>
</br>
"Can you not sense the spiritual mark?" Jiang Chen gestured the two guards next to him to spread out before taking a Rubik's cube out from his pocket. Then, he gently put it down on the bench, "From now on, look closely."</br>

</div></br>
At the moment when the air raid came, the raiders of the Tiger Clan were fully aware what just happened.</br>
</br>
They were not against a leader of a settlement at all, nor were they foreign mercenaries nor traders. They were actually up against the NAC that was feared by the entire Pingan Street! The great warlord from the Yangtze River Delta!</br>
</br>
Even the CCCP tanks must hide into the subway in their presence.</br>
</br>
The Tiger Clan was nothing in front of this behemoth!</br>
</br>
No, nothing was an overstatement.</br>
</br>
More than sixty people were gone almost instantly!</br>
</br>
Ding Lei hid in an abandoned building. He felt his hands and feet turning cold. He finally realized how foolish his promise to Tiger was to bring back the man that humiliated him.</br>
</br>
No, Tiger was the foolish one.</br>
</br>
How did they encounter this behemoth on Pingan Street just for offloading a trophy?!</br>
</br>
Behind him, the morale of the raiders began to waver, and many raiders were already slowly stepping back.</br>
</br>
No one was stupid. When faced with an invincible opponent, they couldn't think of any better options than fleeing.</br>
</br>
Dong Lei noticed the horror in the eyes of the brethren around him and his head suddenly cleared up.</br>
</br>
He could not wait any longer!</br>
</br>
Waiting meant an inevitable death!</br>
</br>
Dong Lei shouted as he picked up the rifle and fired against the ceiling to shake up the clan without any morale.</br>
</br>
"There are planes in the sky! Who can outrun planes? Hmmm? FU*K, a group of puss*es. Are you all scared of planes? If you want to live, follow me! Our only way to survive is to catch their leader and make them fear!"</br>
</br>
While he shouted, the people who were about to escape immediately woke up and recognized the situation.</br>
</br>
Dong Lei immediately rushed out.</br>
</br>
"Brothers! FOLLOW ME!"</br>
</br>
His judgment was quite accurate.</br>
</br>
However, he still underestimated the strength of the NAC General Guards.</br>
</br>
In a sense, in the rugged terrain of the ruins, the guards wearing the K2 kinetic skeletons were more deadly than the fighters hovering above the clouds!</br>
</br>
With more than one hundred raiders, Dong Lei quickly rushed through the empty streets, dashed into the narrow alley, and leaped towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, warningless gunshots were directed at him after he had sprinted just a few steps.</br>
</br>
From the shadows, the eighteen guards who were armed to the teeth were like ghosts that appeared out of thin air. The rifles in their hands spewed out deathly rays, completely disrupting the Tiger Clan's attack.</br>
</br>
"SPREAD OUT! SPREAD OUT! Don't be afraid, we have ten times more people!"</br>
</br>
Dong Lei rolled to the side and narrowly escaped a stream of bullets. He yelled at the top of his lung, then pulled the EMP grenade from his waist and threw it in the direction of the "ghosts".</br>
</br>
The EMP grenade did cause a brief disruption to their optical invisibility, but the effect was only brief. This group of grim of reapers, armed to the teeth, did not stop their slaughter because of this momentary delay. The defense and movement of the kinetic skeleton were also completely unaffected.</br>
</br>
</br>
The air was full of the smell of gunpowder, cement chips, and blood.</br>
</br>
Dong Lie pressed his body tightly against the bunker. Then, suppressing his fear, he peeked his head out.</br>
</br>
He saw with his own eyes that one of the most powerful brothers had his throat easily cut. Then he saw that the former lone traveler, nicknamed the "Little Gun King", was killed by stray bullets.</br>
</br>
WOOSH!</br>
</br>
A bullet flew just past his ear and scared him back into hiding.</br>
</br>
The gunshots echoed in the alley and bounced against the buildings.</br>
</br>
The raiders in complete chaos fired without order into shadows, retaliating against enemies they couldn't even see.</br>
</br>
The sporadic screams on the battlefield destroyed his last bit of courage.</br>
</br>
He only wished to escape, the farther the better!</br>
</br>
However, just as he was about to turn around and sneak away, he froze.</br>
</br>
A black muzzle was pressed against his forehead...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Consider it done."</br>
</br>
There was no accident as Lu Fan's good news came to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Good job," his index finger pressed lightly on the headset. Jiang Chen leaned on the bench and flicked the ash off of the cigarette. He then said, "Come back when you clean the battlefield. Right, you remembered to leave one alive?"</br>
</br>
"Of course," Lu Fan said with a smile, "and it's a big fish."</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter whether it's a big or small fish. As long it knows the way."</br>
</br>
Nonchalantly, Jiang Chen turned off the communication channel.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, a stream of bullets shot at him without warning.</br>
</br>
The sneak attack was about to succeed!</br>
</br>
Then the unexpected happened.</br>
</br>
Two meters away from Jiang Chen, the bullets seemed to hit a transparent wall, and only a layer of pale yellow ripples formed before the shield popped the bullets away.</br>
</br>
Even if she was prepared, Zhao Qiuran's heart was pounding furiously when she witnessed what just happened, and her fists in her pockets turned white because of how hard she was squeezing. It was not till she confirmed that the shield was bulletproof and could not be penetrated did her pounding heart finally calmed down.</br>
</br>
However, she was psychologically prepared as she knew Jiang Chen's plan. The ten uninvited guests in black suits who fired on the opposite side of the street saw the scene and almost exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"How is this possible!"</br>
</br>
The ten men in black narrowed their eyes and looked incredulously at the unharmed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
They disregarded the weird shield.</br>
</br>
They were wearing optical invisibility equipment and were equipped with life signal shielding devices. They also selected the moment when the NAC Guards team just finished the battle, and when Jiang Chen's defense was the weakest.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen seemed to have known that they would come and deployed this weird shield before they aimed at him.</br>
</br>
"You finally came out?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and threw away the cigarette butt still not burned out. He stood up from the bench. "I am very curious. If you didn't know my identity before, it's reasonable to follow me. Now that you know who I am, are you not afraid of bringing trouble to your master?"</br>
</br>
The man leading showed a menacing look as he raised his rifle and said with a sneer.</br>
</br>
"It's because we know that you are Jiang Chen, so there's more reason you should die."</br>
</br>
From the appearance of the fighter, they had already confirmed Jiang Chen's identity.</br>
</br>
However, this unexpected turn of the event did not cause them back down. Instead, it aroused their desire to kill. If the NAC General learned about the secret of Subway Line 0, their boss's plan for more than a decade would go to waste.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen must die!</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" As he examined the ten men in black with full of murderous vibe, Jiang Chen just smiled and gestured at the shadow next to him. "Since they showed up, take care of them too."</br>
</br>
Ten people thought there was an ambush.</br>
</br>
However, when they saw only two guards stepping out of the shadow, they all sighed with relief.</br>
</br>
"Just two people?" The man leading was not angry, but laughed instead. "Mr. Jiang, you view too highly of yourself."</br>
</br>
"Do I?" Jiang Chen shrugged and opened the holographic screen on his watch. He clicked on it a few times. "You think there are too few people? I think there're one too many."</br>
</br>
With such obvious mockery, the man's face turned completely gloomy. His rifles aimed at the two guards while a look of decisiveness appeared in his pupils.</br>
</br>
"You're asking for death!"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1178: Weapon Of The Civilized</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the triggers pressed down, bullets emerged from the muzzles!</br>
</br>
The man in the black suit was very clever. He did not choose Jiang Chen as the target. Obviously, the protective shield could not be taken down easily. At this moment, their biggest threat was the two guards in kinetic skeletons.</br>
</br>
Without any time to react, the spewing bullets instantly engulfed the two guards.</br>
</br>
Go to hell!</br>
</br>
The man in black roared in his mind.</br>
</br>
But just as he thought he succeeded; his pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>
Something was wrong!</br>
</br>
The bullet passed through the two guards as if they just hit thin air.</br>
</br>
The man in black's expression suddenly changed as he had a terrible feeling.</br>
</br>
However, before he had time to react, two high-explosive grenades landed within his men.</br>
</br>
The rumbling airwave instantly burst out and engulfed him and the nine people behind him in the flames of the explosion. Then there were a few short gunshots, and the people still alive were just about to return fire with their pistols when they were killed by bullets shot from both sides.</br>
</br>
After the guards put away the rifle in their hands, they came from the nearby building.</br>
</br>
As for the guards that were hit, they were nothing more than holographic images.</br>
</br>
It was very easy to recognize the difference up close, but the attention of the assassins was focused on Jiang Chen, and it was not till they fired their first shot did they realize something was off.</br>
</br>
However, it was already too late when they reacted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to the two guards, then turned around and looked at Zhao Qiuran next to him on the bench.</br>
</br>
"Is it over?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran nodded stiffly, then looked to the black Rubik's Cube on the bench before she gulped and asked.</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
"The weapon of the civilized."</br>
</br>
"..." Zhao Qiuran wanted to ask 'Can you speak in a language people can understand?', but when she considered the difference in strength, she chose to remain silent.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the Rubik's Cube on the bench, twisted it once, and then put it into his pocket. The faint yellow protective cover also disappeared.</br>
</br>
After the two guards searched the men in black, they returned to Jiang Chen and reported.</br>
</br>
"No identification was found."</br>
</br>
"No identification is required," Jiang Chen said expressionlessly, "I know who sent them."</br>
</br>
Originally, when he was in the Dorsett Hotel, he had decided to not bother with Wan Peng. After all, he wore a camouflage necklace, and the person who was sent by Wan Peng to "negotiate" with him did not recognize him. However, since he took off the camouflage necklace, the assassins who had followed him for a few kilometers still had no plans to stop, and thus made the situation worth pondering over.</br>
</br>
"What do you plan on doing with Wan Peng?" Zhao Qiuran asked.</br>
</br>
"Let's set Wan Peng aside, for now. He can't run in Pingan Street, and I'll let him pay when the time comes," Jiang Chen said, then looked at the other side of the street, where the guards had fought with the Tiger Clan, "Before that, there is still a small problem we have to deal with first."</br>
</br>
</br>
Not far away, Lu Fan had returned with seventeen guards.</br>
</br>
Except for some minor injuries, no one was seriously injured or killed.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan stood in front of Jiang Chen. He respectfully made a military salute and then gestured to a brother behind him.</br>
</br>
Soon, a guy tied up into a caterpillar was thrown onto the ground in front of Jiang Chen by the guard behind Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"What's your name?" Jiang Chen, with a smile, asked the frightened man.</br>
</br>
"Dong, Dong Lei..."</br>
</br>
While Dong Lei anxiously responded, his thoughts turned quickly as he desperately searched for a way to escape. However, he had exhausted all the options he could think of and none would lead to his escape. He could only pray Jiang Chen would spare his life after he learned the intelligence he needed.</br>
</br>
But was this even possible?</br>
</br>
Dong Lei thought in his mind with despair.</br>
</br>
"Do you know the way?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"What.. what do you mean?" Dong Lei gulped, and stuttered.</br>
</br>
"Take me to meet your so-called Brother Tiger," Jiang Chen replied.</br>
</br>
Since Dong Lei did not respond, Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and said with a sly look.</br>
</br>
"Why? You're unwilling?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not, of course not" Dong Lei shook his head rapidly as he squeezed out a reluctant smile, then he said incoherently, " Brother, no, daddy...one should pay one's own debt, it's all Brother Tiger's fault, can you... if I take you to see Brother Tiger, can you spare my worthless life?"</br>
</br>
Brotherhood? Loyalty?</br>
</br>
Brotherhood was only something they talked about when they drank, ate or slept with women. As for the latter, they were raiders to begin with, when did loyalty ever matter?</br>
</br>
When he rushed to Jiang Chen at the start, it was a desperate move to survive. Now that he admitted defeat, it was also an attempt to survive. As for his Brother Tiger, who cared about that idiot's life! Since he turned NAC into an enemy, he was already considered dead, who would be loyal to a dead person?</br>
</br>
Dong Lei just wanted to let Jiang Chen know everything he knew.</br>
</br>
However, he was afraid that Jiang Chen would feed him with bullets after he told the truth.</br>
</br>
"Are you negotiating with me?" Jiang Chen smiled at Dong Lei.</br>
</br>
"No, I don't dare." Dong Lei said in a panic. His tightly roped body twitched as he kowtowed desperately on the concrete floor. He cried and begged, "Please forgive me, General."</br>
</br>
"I'll give you three seconds. You only need to give me one response," Jiang Chen, unmoved by the crying Dong Lei, said emotionlessly, "Yes, or no?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the office on the top floor of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
Tiger was comfortably in his chair while he raised his legs on to the table and squinted at the clear sky outside the window.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he thought that the weather today was delightful, just like his mood.</br>
</br>
It had been an hour since Dong Lei set off with his boys.</br>
</br>
After a while, Dong Lei would probably be able to bring that person back.</br>
</br>
The thought of this made a cruel smile appear on Tiger's face, he subconsciously touched his unshaven face.</br>
</br>
How can I torture that guy?</br>
</br>
Whenever he thought about the shame at Hell Courier that night, he wanted to murder people to vent his anger.</br>
</br>
"Tsk, this can't work, it's too nice of me to just kill him like this," he drew the dagger from the table, held it in his hand, and played with it. Tiger looked out of the window and a bloodthirsty ray appeared in his eyes, then a sneer gradually formed, "I'll have to cut him hundreds of times and torture him slowly."</br>
</br>
He was already debating how he should seek his revenge.</br>
</br>
The revenge was not only for him but also for his bothers.</br>
</br>
If anyone could draw two cats on his face without paying the price, then how could he be the big brother in the future?</br>
</br>
At this moment, there was the sound of fast footsteps in the hallway.</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open, and he saw his henchman at the door, panting and holding on to the door frame.</br>
</br>
"You're back?" Brother Tiger put his legs down and stood up impatiently.</br>
</br>
But when he saw his little brother's face, he noticed something was wrong.</br>
</br>
His expression... doesn't seem like that of excitement?</br>

</br>
"You can go now," Jiang Chen said as they headed to the Tiger Clan, "Your favor has been paid to me just now."</br>
</br>
"You said you'll bring me to Wanghai."</br>
</br>
"I never promised that," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Listen, you have seen it just now, my abilities can still come in handy. Although you may have other ways, but..." But at this point, Zhao Qiuran stopped in embarrassment, and she didn't continue until after a while, "Uh, even without me, you can easily get rid of them, right?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her and didn't say anything, but the words "of course" were written in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran rolled her eyes and was about to mock him, but when the unobstructed words came to her lips, she swallowed them back abruptly.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw that she wanted to say something but was too afraid, he laughed and responded.</br>
</br>
"If you plan to go to Wanghai, you can certainly follow us. But I have to remind you in advance that we will only cover your accommodation, not your food."</br>
</br>
"No problem, I will still prepare the nutrient supplies myself." Zhao Qiuran nodded immediately, "It's already troublesome for you to take me there. If I eat your food, I'll be embarrassed by my own actions."</br>
</br>
"Oh really?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled meaningfully.</br>
</br>
He would never believe that in front of hot food, anyone would be able to down nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
Although he had not felt this feeling, he had heard Cheng Weiguo talk about it. At that time when the Fishbone Base had just been established, and the meals he served to the slaves were porridge, steamed buns, and white rice. But even then, everyone very much enjoyed the food.</br>
</br>
After people tasted actual food, no one was able to eat nutrient supplies anymore.</br>
</br>
In Cheng Weiguo's words, it was as bland as wax...</br>
</br>
Dong Lei silently led the way in the front, then he stopped at the corner of the highway, turned his head, and looked at Jiang Chen nervously.</br>
</br>
"It's… it's ahead. Dongcheng Hospital is around this corner. I didn't lie to you, the person you are looking for is inside.</br>
</br>
At this point, Dong Lei's expression was down. He knelt and started to kowtow without warning, and begged for mercy with tears.</br>
</br>
"Sir, Sir, I'm kowtowing for you. I beg you to spare my worthless life. Yan Xiaohu provoked you, it has nothing to do with me..."</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaohu was Brother Tiger's real name. Few people in the Tiger Clan knew about this as everyone called him Brother Tiger. Only Dong Lei and a few that "established the empire" together knew about this name.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand impatiently.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan understood as he reached out his hand to pull Dong Lei from the ground, and then kicked him on his ass.</br>
</br>
"Get out."</br>
</br>
Under countless mocking gazes, Dong Lei trembled and almost fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
Before he could even stand, he scrambled and fleed. He knocked over two trash cans along the way but didn't even dare to look back. He was afraid Jiang Chen would change his mind and capture him again.</br>
</br>
</br>
"You just let him go like this?" Zhao Qiuran asked as she fixated in the direction where Dong Lei disappeared.</br>
</br>
"He only has his life left, where can he go?" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran didn't take long to understand what he meant.</br>
</br>
Indeed, without even a gun, how far could he go on the zombies and mutants-rampant wasteland? What's more, he used to be a raider, and an infamous one too.</br>
</br>
Even if he did survive the mutants, any enemy he encountered could end his life.</br>
</br>
Even if he luckily survived, a life of misery not even comparable to the lowest refugees awaited him.</br>
</br>
"Okay, it's time to end all of this."</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen spoke, he looked in the direction of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
"Just go in like this?" Zhao Qiuran couldn't help asking.</br>
</br>
"How else?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked at the gate of the Dongcheng Hospital's courtyard, then said hesitantly, "They are considered the upper-middle level among the survivor settlements in Shangjing. There are thousands of raiders who worked for him, not only that, there are several engineers under him. They relied on parts purchased from the scrap market and created a few sets of power armors for him."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran paused and looked Jiang Chen before she continued, "I know your guards are very powerful, but this is their base after all—"</br>
</br>
"Who said I plan to send my guards in?" Jiang Chen said lightly.</br>
</br>
"Is it your...fighter?"</br>
</br>
"Not my fighter, but close."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked at Jiang Chen in a daze. She watched him turn on the holographic screen on his watch again, call up the map, and stretch out his hand.</br>
</br>
One finger was lightly placed on the position of the main building of Dongcheng Hospital, and a circle of particle blue ripples slowly swayed away from the location of his finger, like a sickle of death, and outlined a circle called death...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Inside the underground garage of the physician building behind the main building of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
It was the warehouse of the Tiger Clan, and it was also the place they used to keep their slaves. Generally, after they raided a settlement or a fleet, the men were killed directly, and the women were brought here.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, they were used as toys to vent their emotions and relieve stress and on the other hand, they were used as free labor to help them process some small parts that can be sold on Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
When the bad news of the defeat arrived, Tiger hid in here immediately.</br>
</br>
If the NAC was armed with fighters, this underground garage was undoubtedly the safest place. Based on the civil defense standards of Pan-Asia Cooperation before the war, the underground facilities of all state-owned units must reach the level of a quasi-temporary nuclear bunker.</br>
</br>
In other words, even if a tactical nuclear bomb of tens of thousands of tons was thrown in the hospital, he could stay in here harm-free.</br>
</br>
In addition, he gathered the remaining more than 500 predators, equipped all four power armors built from scrap parts, and several infantry guns raided from a military outpost. He established his position in front of the main hospital building as he prepared for the fight of death with Jiang Chen with his terrain advantage.</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open. Tiger subconsciously grabbed the gun on the table and the little brother who entered the door almost collapse to the ground in fear.</br>
</br>
"Brother, Brother Tiger, it's me, don't shoot!"</br>
</br>
"Where are they?" Tiger grabbed his little brother by the collar as he roared with uncertainty on his face, "How is the battle going? I said, don't retreat, keep your position!"</br>
</br>
Anyone could escape, he was the only one that could not escape.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult to imagine that once he lost his current position, he would die in the gutter somewhere the next day.</br>
</br>
Too many people wanted to kill him.</br>
</br>
There were always one or two fishes that slipped through the net. Every time he slaughtered a settlement, there were a few more people who wished to kill him. His only choice would be to escape from Shangjing to the south, then further south...</br>
</br>
However, he quickly rejected this idea.</br>
</br>
NAC was in the south, so now the choice was the northern wilderness? I'd die regardless!</br>
</br>
"No, it hasn't started yet." With his boss grabbing his collar, the little brother said nervously.</br>
</br>
Brother Tiger was taken aback.</br>
</br>
"Are they going to negotiate with us? Tell them! We can negotiate—"</br>
</br>
"Bo...boss," The little brother looked desperate, "They are just standing at the gate. They didn't come in, didn't speak, and they are just looking at us."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1180: The Power of One Shot!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Didn't fire? Didn't say anything?</br>
</br>
Just looking?</br>
</br>
Tiger's expression was blank, clueless of what happened, and he was completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Are they... are they afraid?</br>
</br>
However, this unrealistic thought appeared for two seconds before it was erased by an earth-shattering bang.</br>
</br>
BANG-</br>
</br>
The continuous and thunderous explosions came from the distance as if a giant beast has collapsed, and the entire land was shaken. Everything in the garage was shaking, the door, the table, and the people.</br>
</br>
After half a minute, the "earthquake" subsided.</br>
</br>
The boy who stood next to Tiger climbed out from under the long table and stared at the ceiling of the garage, muttering to himself.</br>
</br>
"Earth... earthquake?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Tiger did not respond, he just stood there in silence.</br>
</br>
With the look of horror written all over his face, he revealed despair that was never been seen before.</br>
</br>
The clothes, face, and hair that were originally clean were covered with the gray dust shaken off from the ceiling. The figure looked both lonely and weary as if he had aged a few decades in a matter of seconds.</br>
</br>
Just now, he suddenly remembered a legend.</br>
</br>
The legend of the NAC Order...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
East of Shangjing, above Qincheng, the glaring white light quickly disappeared.</br>
</br>
The 50kg shell had been fired and the recoil slowly pushed the giant airship back by more than ten meters.</br>
</br>
The distance of two hundred kilometers was instantly closed, and the shell precisely hit the main building of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
"BOOM"</br>
</br>
A deafening explosion!</br>
</br>
At the impact spot of the bomb, spider-like turtle cracks began to form along the wall, infiltrating inward, and then the entire structure collapsed! The steel skeleton shattered into pieces and collapsed along with the cement debris. The whole building looked like it was pushed by a big hand and fell like an avalanche.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked at the building that was immersed in the dust, she opened her mouth slightly, but this time she couldn't say a word.</br>
</br>
Even after five minutes, the thick dust did not dissipate.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, no one could escape.</br>
</br>
Looking at the rubble, and the dust cloud lingering above the ruin, Jiang Chen's lips opened, but he seemingly muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"50kg shell. Damn, I wonder if it possible to see the explosion from the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building."</br>
</br>
When the thick dust had almost settled, he turned around and looked at the guards behind him who were eager to fight.</br>
</br>
"Let's go take a peek inside."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
A uniformed roar.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan waved his hand, and the 19 guards behind him were divided into three teams. One of the teams guarded Jiang Chen. The remaining two teams were divided into two and circled to Dongcheng Hospital from both the north and south sides.</br>
</br>
Six guards stood around Jiang Chen, but he did not immediately enter the hospital. Instead, he looked at Zhao Qiuran.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Can you use a gun?"</br>
</br>
After she regained her clarity from being shell-shocked, Zhao Qiuran gulped and furiously nodded.</br>
</br>
"Yes, of course."</br>
</br>
Isn't this nonsense?</br>
</br>
How can a lone traveler not know how to use a gun?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to a guard next to him and pointed to the short-tube submachine gun hanging around his waist.</br>
</br>
The guard understood, took off his auxiliary weapon, and handed it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Catch."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran fumbled a few times in the air before she caught the gun. She stared at the submachine gun that Jiang Chen had thrown into her hand. She was in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Don't you want to prove your worth?" Jiang Chen smiled and raised his chin slightly toward the rumble. "Now I'm giving you a chance."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiutsn was moved as she gratefully looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
On the wasteland, a weapon meant trust, and giving a weapon meant recognition.</br>
</br>
Without another word, Zhao Qiuran responded to this trust with her action.</br>
</br>
After she loaded the weapon, her eyes locked on to Dongcheng Hospital, reawakening the fierceness of the wolf.</br>
</br>
It was the vibe unique to her, unique to a lone traveler that roamed the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with satisfaction as she looked over to the reawakened Zhao Qiuran. It was the vibe she possessed when he saw her at the auction, and only such a warrior has the value of being recruited. Previously, he was worried that he would scare her too much. Now it seemed that he had been overthinking.</br>
</br>
A rare Spiritualist, how could he just let her leave?</br>
</br>
But such a powerful lone traveler often worked like a double-edged sword. If he wasn't careful, he would hurt himself. He must use the carrot and stick strategy to teach her about how weak she is compared to the NAC, and if only she willingly let go of her pride to plead loyalty would he be able to use this double-edged sword effectively.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The loud gunshots echoed through Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
More than five hundred raiders were buried under the rubble.</br>
</br>
And the remaining hundred raiders were no match to the General Guards. Even if they were lucky enough to escape because they were not in the building, they had no chance against the guards surrounding them from three directions. These bandits who only bullied had no fighting chance.</br>
</br>
The four power armors they built were not useful at all.</br>
</br>
An RPG that dragged a trail of smoke easily penetrated a power armor fighting in the frontline.</br>
</br>
Equipped with the submachine gun in her hand and using the bunker to dodge while firing, Zhao Qiuran's combat prowess was not inferior to the guards.</br>
</br>
With the hope of Jiang Chen bringing her to Wanghai, she was eager to show her own value. This made life extremely difficult for the raiders hiding among the ruins. With the dual abilities of Mental Shock and Spiritual Imprint, Zhao Qiuran was not missing a single shot, suppressing the enemy so much that they didn't even dare to peek.</br>
</br>
The Tiger Clan was facing an inevitable defeat.</br>
</br>
Realizing their defeat, the raiders without much loyalty decided to flee.</br>
</br>
Someone deserted first, and soon there was a second deserter, and with the second one, naturally, the third one appeared. In less than ten minutes, the raiders who were still resisting instantly lost their morale. They cried and fled.</br>
</br>
With one foot on the cement pieces, Lu Fan symbolically fired a few shots in the direction of the escaping raiders.</br>
</br>
After he saw that he couldn't reach anyone anymore, he took the rifle in his hand and spat out toward the concrete tile next to him.</br>
</br>
"A bunch of puss*es."</br>
</br>
Just like that, the battle in Dongcheng Hospital soon ended.</br>
</br>
After they cleared the battlefield, the three teams of guards joined forces and gathered in the grass field of the hospital.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said as he looekd to Zhao Qiuran.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to leave it to you."</br>
</br>
"I will handle it."</br>
</br>
She took a deep breath, then closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
The tentacles of mental power spread around and wove into a net.</br>
</br>
Even with the life signal shielding device, it was impossible to cover the spiritual seal.</br>
</br>
Although her eyes were closed, her mind was clear. The spiritual seals hidden were like swaying candlelight, floating in the vast darkness, and completely visible.</br>
</br>
She ignored the "candlelights" that were about to extinguish under the rubble.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran pointed in the direction of the underground garage.</br>
</br>
"There are probably more than fifty people there."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan gestured to the guards around him and raised his rifle again.</br>
</br>
Looking at the garage located in the basement of the hospital, Jiang Chen revealed a sly smile.</br>
</br>
"It seems like we'll be meeting again."</br>
</br>
I wonder if those two cats are still on "Tiger".</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1181"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1181: The Darkness in the Garage</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the basement, Tiger constantly swallowed as he repeatedly rubbed the assault rifle grip, he stared nervously at the garage door.</br>
</br>
Just now, he used the remaining power in the spare nuclear fusion battery to start the emergency procedure for the garage.</br>
</br>
The leaded alloy door closed and sealed the entrance to the garage.</br>
</br>
It was also one of the civil defense projects. He was only praying that man would not be able to open the door and would just leave.</br>
</br>
By then, he could still...</br>
</br>
Looking at his subordinate's shivering beside him, Tiger only felt despair.</br>
</br>
It would be impossible to make a comeback.</br>
</br>
He would be thankful to just live...</br>
</br>
Just then, a bright light appeared on the alloy door.</br>
</br>
For the first time, Tiger felt hopeless when he saw a light in the vast darkness.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he heard a windbreaking sound.</br>
</br>
Tiger did not understand what happened before he was hit on the back of the head and fell forward.</br>
</br>
The hit made his eyes blurry in dizziness.</br>
</br>
When he realized what happened, the rifle in his hand was gone, and his boy, who always sucked up to him, was pointing his rifle at his head and full of viciousness.</br>
</br>
It was ironic, it was the first time seeing such a brave expression from the guy's face.</br>
</br>
Is this still the same guy?"</br>
</br>
Hey, Six, you're finally being brave?" Tiger bitterly smiled.</br>
</br>
"Shut up!" Crazy was written all over the man named Six. He used the rifle to poke the face of his former brother. "THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, you stupid fu*k! Why did you offend someone you shouldn't have! Now the Tiger Clan is fu*king done! We're all done!"</br>
</br>
"We?" Tiger laughed and looked at Six riding on his body. His eyes showed a hint of disdain. "The Tiger Clan has always been mine, when did it become "we". Six, have I been treating you too well?"</br>
</br>
With madness, Six continued to poke the face of his former brother with his gun.</br>
</br>
"FU*K, FU*K, why are you sh*t talking now."</br>
</br>
"Hehe, you don't even know how to say your last words. You're still useless even with death knocking at your door." Tiger shook his head.</br>
</br>
Originally, he was still a little scared, but when the stick landed on his head, he was over this whole situation.</br>
</br>
"Death?" There were panic and fear on Six's face. However, they were quickly replaced by madness. "I will not die, you're going to die! You've angered the NAC! As long as I hand you to them... I, I will not die!"</br>
</br>
"Haha," he looked at his pawn as if he was looking at an idiot, then he shook his head, smiling. "Whatever, I have lived an enjoyable life, so what if I go to hell!"</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he ignored the muzzle pressed against his face and grabbed Six's neck.</br>
</br>
Six was frightened, with the fear of Tiger taking back the weapon, his hands shook and he pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
Red and white matter sprinkled onto the ground.</br>
</br>
</br>
Tiger's hands dropped down and fell to the side, they marked the end of his dirty and sinful life.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, the alloy door was cut open, and the man standing at the door retracted the laser sword and looked inside.</br>
</br>
Six couldn't see the expression on his face, but he could guess that his expression would be no different than looking at an ant.</br>
</br>
"Big, big brother," Six looked at his big brother without a head in horror. Then, he looked at the people who appeared at the door and hurriedly tossed away the rifle in his hands. With a panicked and pleading expression, Six said incoherently. "Don't shoot, don't shoot, the person who started all of this is dead! It's me, yes! Yes, I killed him! I avenged you..."</br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
There was a second shot.</br>
</br>
Blood gushed out from his chest. The man named Six collapsed on the ground and made a muffled sound.</br>
</br>
"Too much nonsense."</br>
</br>
The smoke from the pistol faded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Tiger with his exploded head with a frown. He did not say anything else and walked toward the back of the garage.</br>
</br>
When he heard that Zhao Qiuran said that there were a lot of spiritual marks in the garage, he had already vaguely guessed what he would see inside.</br>
</br>
One foot kicked opened the half-covered door and a thick odor wafted into his face.</br>
</br>
Women in ragged clothes sat in front of the long table, processing used chips. When they saw Jiang Chen at the door, they just raised their eyes and looked numbly, then they lowered their heads and continued to mechanically operate the welding torch under the incandescent light.</br>
</br>
Others were squatting in cages, fixed on sinister toys, as their sight fixated on the floor or ceiling. Only a few had color in their eyes, and those the raiders had still yet to finish enjoying were chained to prevent them from suiciding or escaping.</br>
</br>
The dead bodies were thrown into the corner and sprinkled with formalin. The empty eyes were daunting. They seemed to exist to warn those who are lazy or those who want to escape.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was visibly shocked, but he did not say anything.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time he encountered this type of situation.</br>
</br>
"How are you going to deal with these women?" Zhao Qiuran followed Jiang Chen inside, waved her hand to keep the smell away of her nose, and asked with a frown.</br>
</br>
"What do you think is a good way?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran paused for a moment before her expression turned awkward.</br>
</br>
She was a lone traveler and always operated independently. She usually did not save strangers. What solution would she have?</br>
</br>
These people had lost their hope to live.</br>
</br>
Even if they were still alive, they were just like the walking dead in this world.</br>
</br>
Perhaps death would be a relief for them? But how many people would be able to free their pain without any psychological burden?</br>
</br>
Just as Zhao Qiuran was engrossed with her thoughts, Jiang Chen gestured to Lu Fan and then pointed to the women in the basement.</br>
</br>
"Get Li Wang to send two transport helicopters, and wait for the next transport of the airship to bring those people back to Wanghai."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Lu Fan saluted.</br>
</br>
Very early in the days, shortly after the end of the X2 bacterial incident, a traumatic sanatorium was set up in the Fishbone Base. It was specifically built for those who were traumatized by raiders, which were generally women.</br>
</br>
Although there were many beautiful women around him, he was very aware that the proportion of men and women on the wasteland had been seriously out of tune. Too many bachelors at any time was never a good thing.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, most survivors did not have a civilized mentality. As long as they were not mad or crazy, most survivors did not mind the past of these women. They would not reject marrying women that recovered from the sanatorium.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan, the director of the Sixth Street, was a great example.</br>
</br>
"You are too kind." Zhao Qiuran looked at these people with envy.</br>
</br>
"You are envious?"</br>
</br>
When she thought about what happened to these women, she shivered and shook her head. "How is that possible?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her and did not say anything more, then he looked at Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"That's that. Before the transport helicopters arrive, let's search here to see if there is anything worth taking away—"</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Without the slightest sign, the earth trembled intensely, causing debris to fall from the garage ceiling.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, who launched another bomb."</br>
</br>
As he held the wall to regain his balance, Jiang Chen cursed and patted the dust off his head.</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Just as he finished his sentence, there was an even louder explosion.</br>
</br>
This time the earth shook more violently, and everyone in the basement realized the seriousness of the situation.</br>
</br>
"An earthquake?" Zhao Qiuran glanced at the ceiling and said nervously, "I suggest we get out quickly."</br>
</br>
"It's not like an earthquake." Lu Fan immediately put his face down on the ground. "It was an explosion coming from below us."</br>
</br>
"From underground?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had to process this information before his expression gradually turned serious.</br>
</br>
For some strange reason, the explosion coming from the depths of the earth gave him an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
What are the Russians doing?</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The roar of the explosions came from afar as the shockwave shook the stained floor-to-ceiling windows ten kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Wan Peng focused on the rising dust and became silent.</br>
</br>
After a long time, he sighed.</br>
</br>
"That's NAC's electromagnetic pulse cannon?"</br>
</br>
This much destructive power with just one shot?</br>
</br>
I am afraid the wall of Pingan Street will not last more than a few rounds in front of this giant cannon.</br>
</br>
While he sent his condolences to the fool that angered NAC, Wan Peng took out a radio from the drawer and called his assistant.</br>
</br>
Soon, the office door was pushed open.</br>
</br>
A woman in a black suit walked to the front of Wan Peng's desk and bowed respectfully. Then she said.</br>
</br>
"Manager Wan, are you looking for me?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng asked.</br>
</br>
"Is there any news on the Men in Black?"</br>
</br>
"Men in Black" was a special unit that he secretly built ten years ago. It was directly under the command of Wan Peng and independent of the Sunday Club.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, the significance of this force's existence was only to search for pre-war facilities and to deal with some problems that were inconvenient to entrust to mercenaries and lone travelers. After the establishment of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance and the rule that no murders were allowed within the Third Ring Road, the organization shifted into a semi-intelligence organization.</br>
</br>
Black suits, optical invisibility, carbon nanobody armors, PK2000 Pan-Asia Cooperation rifles. With just a few dozen people, the organization possessed the combat ability equivalent of of over a hundred. In Shangjing, even the militia group must show respect to him because of the exact reason.</br>
</br>
Even Ding Liwei, the head of the militia group, was concerned about this trump card in his hand.</br>
</br>
"There is no news yet." The assistant shook her head and in her beautiful voice, "If there is progress, I will inform you as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
"Why is it so slow." Wan Peng frowned.</br>
</br>
If it were before, they would have already reported to him by now. They should not be this silent, without even a message.</br>
</br>
Last time, they had Old Luo already trapped in a corner, but they still managed to let him get away.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng snorted at the thought.</br>
</br>
The organization just changed an instructor and they're becoming more and more useless. They are fed with all kinds of resources, but they are less and less proficient with their skills.</br>
</br>
"Ask Lu Sen to come and see me," looked at his assistant, Wan Peng said with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The assistant quickly bowed her head.</br>
</br>
Intuition told her that the manager was in a bad mood.</br>
</br>
Without stopping, with the boss's orders, she rushed to the door.</br>
</br>
The assistant guessed right, Wan Peng's mood at the moment was not particularly joyful.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, his mood was just not particularly joyful.</br>
</br>
</br>
If he learned that the ten men he sent to capture the ID card were all dead, and they got him a big of trouble just before they died, would Wan Peng curse out?</br>
</br>
Soon, the door was pushed open again.</br>
</br>
"Boss," with an anxious look, Lu Sen hesitated before asking, "Are you looking for me?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng smiled and leaned back in the chair, looking at Lu Sen.</br>
</br>
"Explain to me how you train those people?"</br>
</br>
Lu Sen was sweating and so anxious he could not speak.</br>
</br>
"Ummm, umm..."</br>
</br>
"The last mission to capture Old Luo, you said that their equipment is not good enough. This time, to capture an unnamed settlement leader, and you fu*king used the carbon nano armor with optical invisibility and there is still no response." Wan Peng sneered, then put his legs on the table. "Come and tell me what's going on."</br>
</br>
"Ummm, boss, they are radio-silent during this mission. I don't know what is going on there. I promise you, I will report to you immediately when they come back."</br>
</br>
"Report?!"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng raised an eyebrow, and the anger in his heart brewed to just the right amount; the amount just ready to explode.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the floor began to rock violently.</br>
</br>
The cup on the desk tipped down and the hot water splashed directly on him. With the violent shaking, Wan Peng subconsciously hoped to dodge, but it was too late as he was flipped over on the chair.</br>
</br>
"Boss, be careful!"</br>
</br>
Lu Sen was quick to respond, as he immediately caught his boss.</br>
</br>
"AHH! WHAT THE FU*K." The hot water had splashed on his pants, and Wan Peng was grimacing while holding onto Lu Sen's arm, then he stood up, cursing, "What the fu*k is this? What are they doing downstairs."</br>
</br>
The shaking became more and more violent as if an earthquake was happening, rocking the entire Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Wan Peng's expression drastically changed.</br>
</br>
Not the people downstairs.</br>
</br>
The entire Pingan Street was shaking!"</br>
</br>
Is it?" Wan Peng had a bad feeling.</br>
</br>
Earthquake? Impossible! Shangjing is not in the earthquake zone!</br>
</br>
At this moment, he suddenly remembered that ten years ago, when he and Ding Liwei colluded to explode Line 35, something similar happened...</br>
</br>
This time his expression completely changed.</br>
</br>
As if the event just happened confirmed his speculation.</br>
</br>
Directly out the window, at the South Gate, in the center of the slum, a large piece of land protruded out of the ground by half a meter, the cement road shattered, and then it collapsed back down. The shockwave, like ripples, moved outward from the center in the direction of the giant wall.</br>
</br>
Swept by the shock wave, the shacks in the slum began to collapse like a small sail in a storm.</br>
</br>
If it was only half a slum, Wan Peng would not feel so bad.</br>
</br>
Those refugees werelike wild grasses, it would not matter if they died.</br>
</br>
What really made Wan Peng panic was that standing in the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, he could see that when the shock wave spread to the South Gate of the giant wall, the entire area sunk several meters.</br>
</br>
A corner of the towering wall had already fallen, and in the dust, it was slowly collapsing outward...</br>
</br>
The entire southern part of Pingan Street was turned into hell.</br>
</br>
At the same time, hundreds of meters deep underground, Yegor stood on the turret of the tank and laughed.</br>
</br>
The scars and wrinkles on his face fused and shook menacingly, highlighting his excitement.</br>
</br>
"Ha ha ha ha! FUN! FUN!"</br>
</br>
The gust of wind coming from the subway blew against his face, and even if he was a few kilometers away, he could still feel the heat in the air.</br>
</br>
"General, the radiation index in the subway is rising!" From the tank next to him, Sminov peeked out and yelled in the gusting wind, "Please go back into the tank!"</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was really afraid that his commander would get his head fried by the radiation.</br>
</br>
Although he also knew that with the injection of nano serum, this level of radiation is nothing at all.</br>
</br>
"Haha, this is great!"</br>
</br>
"Tank Battalion One, on my order!" Without any concern about the rising radiation value. Yegor's fist slammed on the turret and in the gusting wind, he shouted into his radio. "The treasure of Pan-Asia is in front of us! Throttle to the maximum! GET READY TO MOVE!"</br>
</br>
After that, Yegor sat back in the tank and covered the top cover.</br>
</br>
The sound of the tank tracks rolling forward began to echo in the subway. Under his command, a dozen tanks bearing the Soviet badge rushed along the subway line.</br>
</br>
But no one noticed that in the depths of the darkness, the unknown danger was preparing to make a move.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Oh my God!"</br>
</br>
"The wall! The wall has collapsed!"</br>
</br>
"FU*K, RUN!"</br>
</br>
"HELP! HELP, I'M STUCK!"</br>
</br>
"AHHHH! MY LEGS..."</br>
</br>
With the giant wall collapsing, the entire South Gate turned into living hell.</br>
</br>
The survivors in ragged clothes rushed out of the slums and ran into the street with horror written all over their faces; they completely paralyzed the traffic there. The rescue vehicles and the freight trucks that were fleeing to the city center were completely jammed together.</br>
</br>
Affected by the aftermath, the industrial area not far from the slums also suffered a considerable amount of damage. Workers hurriedly moved equipment from the factory buildings as they feared the structurally damaged buildings were going to collapse.</br>
</br>
The cultists who were moving to the East Gate from the stadium looked at the collapsed South Gate with horror. Xu Tiannan looked at the men next to him and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Go to the South Gate and see what happened there!"</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
As his subordinate ran towards the South Gate, the people on the street at the North Gate were also panicking because of the collapsed wall.</br>
</br>
Sura stood in the shadow of the street as he watched the fleeing crowds with indifference, then his figure quickly disappeared into the crowd.</br>
</br>
Not only did the huge wall collapse, but so did the wall in the minds of everyone on Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
A wall called a sense of security.</br>
</br>
Because of this explosion that occurred hundreds of meters below, the entire Pingan Street was boiling.</br>
</br>
After Ding Liwei learned the situation at the South Gate, he made a decision immediately.</br>
</br>
He immediately dispatched the militia group. While he enacted martial law in the city, he also allocated personnel to support the South Gate.</br>
</br>
More than a dozen modified trucks and police armored vehicles dispatched from the West Gate and went around the gap in the giant wall of the South Gate. The soldiers jumped down from the vehicles and blocked the entrance to prevent zombies and mutants from entering and causing even greater chaos. On the other hand, engineers were sent to rescue the people buried under the rubble...</br>
</br>
The militia captain Song Chenyu climbed up on the concrete rubble among the ruins of the wall. He gazed at the more active zombies outside as his expression gradually turned more serious.</br>
</br>
The gap in the wall was half a kilometer wide, and it was impossible to repair this gap in a short amount of time. Barbed wire or other separation walls were possible, but he doubted whether the temporary fortifications could make them sleep well.</br>
</br>
It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, less than two hours before it got dark.</br>
</br>
While the zombies looked slow now, once night arrived, even Death Claws didn't dare to stand in their ways.</br>
</br>
The most troublesome thing for him was that for zombies, the breath of the living was the perfect bait. The population of tens of thousands in Pingan Street was just like a bright light in the night sky. He could almost envision what would happen once darkness arrived.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Pull up the barbed wire! Be sure to close the gap before it gets dark! The rest of the people go to the warehouse and pull out all the weapons!"</br>
</br>
As he ordered the soldiers to set up a defense line, he also commanded troops to deploy firepower points to clear out the zombies that were close to the city wall.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, there was an exclamation.</br>
</br>
"Look! Over there! What is that!"</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu immediately raised his head and looked at the direction across the street.</br>
</br>
Soon, his pupils gradually enlarged with a look of horror.</br>
</br>
At the corner of the street, the zombies formed into groups of twos and threes as they stumbled forward and gathered in Pingan Street. Compared to the zombies that stood still on the street, while their movements were still stiff, they showed more aggressiveness towards the street.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was his illusion, but from a distance, he faintly saw a red light in the pupils of those zombies...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Like a gust of wind, the bullet rained from the sky and tore the zombies into pieces.</br>
</br>
"ROAR!"</br>
</br>
A series of wax yellow fat exploded. A Roshan covered its head with its stout arms and let out a painful cry.</br>
</br>
Although the 20mm cannon couldn't penetrate its solid fat, it caused it great pain and slowed it down. The plump body seemed to be scalded by a frying pan, and it looked a bit more hideous than before.</br>
</br>
The Aurora-20 raised its nose, returned into the clouds, and adjusted its position to prepare for a second round of airstrikes.</br>
</br>
The previous round of airstrikes cleared a vacuum area of zombies.</br>
</br>
However, it didn't take long for this vacuum to get filled by new zombies as they slowly gathered in groups and stubbornly moving their stiff legs towards the Physician Building in the hospital. On top of the building, there were dozens of figures.</br>
</br>
After the unexplained "earthquake" occurred, Jiang Chen took his guards and moved to the upper floor of the Physician Building.</br>
</br>
Along with them, there were also about fifty female slaves captured by the raiders. At this moment, these people squatted down beside the water tank on the roof without any life in their eyes. They did not have the slightest joy of regaining their freedom, only the confusion of their destiny. In order to prevent them from creating trouble, he also ordered two guards to watch over them.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the Physician Building, Jiang Chen frowned as he looked at the regrouped zombies.</br>
</br>
If it was just zombies, it would be much easier. But among the zombies, he also saw Spitters, Throwers, and even Roshans...</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, these zombies appeared in densely populated places before the war, like department stores and subway stations. But now, even in places like Dongcheng Hospital was surrounded by a group of dangerous zombies, which made the situation more intriguing.</br>
</br>
"It's getting dark."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up as the brightness was disappearing from the horizon, he then looked at Lu Fan next to him and asked, "How long before the helicopter arrives?"</br>
</br>
In order to prevent the CCCP air defense vehicles from sniping down the airship with the help of the subway line, AS Order redeployed to Bohai Bay near Qincheng, about 300 kilometers away from here, after it completed the deployment of the expeditionary force.</br>
</br>
As a medium-sized transport aircraft, Type-51 Transport Helicopter possessed very impressive load capacity and high stability, but speed was not its strong point. It would take at least an hour to get from Qincheng to Shangjing.</br>
</br>
And now, only half an hour had passed.</br>
</br>
"It's almost here," Lu Fan replied.</br>
</br>
"Where do you think these zombies came from?" Zhao Qiuran asked nervously.</br>
</br>
"I don't know," Jiang Chen shook his head and said seriously, "Intuition tells me that it must have something to do with the earthquake just now."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran secretly glanced at Jiang Chen, his eyes seemed to be saying, does this need intuition? Anyone can see it.</br>
</br>
It was from the beginning of the earthquake that the entire Shanghai seemed to have changed. The zombies that rarely roamed on the surface, like Spitters or Throwers, now appeared in clusters. This already explained the severity of the problem.</br>
</br>
There was just one thing Zhao Qiuran couldn't make sense of.</br>
</br>
Is there any necessary connection between earthquakes and zombies?</br>
</br>
Do zombies also have intelligence, and in order to avoid earthquakes, they all run to the surface?</br>
</br>
No, the safest place should be the subway. The Pan-Asia Cooperation subway is designed according to the specifications of a nuclear bunker. What can earthquakes do? The subway line was completely fine even though the buildings on the ground collapsed!</br>
</br>
Just as Zhao Qiuran contemplated, Jiang Chen opened the holographic map and started searching along the map.</br>
</br>
Soon, his eyes stopped at the subway station next to Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
After he examined the subway line of the station, he suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Right, speaking of it, is your ability useful on zombies?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran was taken aback for a moment, then she shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Are you talking about telesthesia? It's useless. Those zombies rely on instinctive actions, they have no consciousness at all."</br>
</br>
"So..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked thoughtfully in the direction of Pingan Street, but this time, he didn't speak again.</br>
</br>
Not far away, the horizon had faded into yellow.</br>
</br>
The shaky red Sun was about to fall at any time.</br>
</br>
Once night falls, the whole world would no longer belong to humans...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1184: Treasure Map</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After two rounds of airstrikes, the zombie flood surrounding Dongcheng Hospital subsided slightly, the only one Roshan remaining fell victim to 20mm machineguns.</br>
</br>
With its ammunition exhausted, the Aurora-20 hovered in the air, then returned in the direction of Qingcheng.</br>
</br>
Although the zombie flood subsided, no one showed any happiness.</br>
</br>
They all recognized that the situation would not last for too long.</br>
</br>
With darkness approaching, the zombies would rush to the area like moths rushing to a lamp.</br>
</br>
"Listen, I know that your guards are very strong, but the night is very long." Next to Jiang Chen, Zhao Qiuran looked at the street full of limbs outside the wall of Dongcheng Hospital and said, "You said there would be helicopters coming to pick us up, how many helicopters do you need to take more than 70 people at once? Or do you intend to leave these loots here."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked at the slaves who were sitting next to the water tank.</br>
</br>
"There will probably be two helicopters," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Two helicopters?" Zhao Qiuqi bitterly smiled, walked to the side, and then leaned against the railing on the top of the building. "Two helicopters, can take how many people?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said softly as he gazed at the zombies shaking their heads on the street.</br>
</br>
"Who said I'm leaving?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran took a few more seconds to process the information and looked at Jiang Chen inexplicably.</br>
</br>
"Then you called the helicopters..."</br>
</br>
"Reinforcement." Jiang Chen stopping gazing at the street and looked back at her. "I'm going to hold here. Do you have any good ideas?"</br>
</br>
"Hold here?" Zhao Qiuran looked at Jiang Chen, shocked and confused. "Why do you want to hold here? Is there anything else besides garbage?"</br>
</br>
"I just asked if you have any good ideas." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Well..." Seeing Jiang Chen did not intend to reveal his plan, Zhao Qiuran sighed and gave up the idea to question him further. She then pointed to the courtyard of Dongcheng Hospital. "You know, because of the existence of the Throwers and Roshan, hiding in a narrow building is not a good idea. My suggestion is that we build a fortification at the gate, keep most of the zombies out of the walls, and then eliminate large zombies like the Roshans."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin and nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about materials?"</br>
</br>
"Materials? They're over the place." Zhao Qiuran showed a smug look as she looked around to the ruins of the main building. "You just need to lend me some hands."</br>
</br>
She is indeed an experienced lone traveler.</br>
</br>
Although her equipment was a lot worse compared to Jiang Chen's guards, her survival ability was far superior to anyone from Jiang Chen's side.</br>
</br>
From the roof of the building back to the ground, everyone first cleared the zombies left in the courtyard.</br>
</br>
Then, under Zhao Qiuran's command, all the 19 guards except Lu Fan began to "move bricks".</br>
</br>
</br>
With the strong load-bearing capacity of the kinetic skeleton, the reinforced concrete blocks marked by Zhao Qiuran with a marker were moved to the door from the ruins of the main building, and then under her command, a bunker was somehow built.</br>
</br>
Not only was a movable door created, but there were holes left for shooting. To prevent the Throwers from tossing in baby bombs, she made a few forks out of steel and placed them in front of the shooting holes.</br>
</br>
The hospital wall itself was very high, as long as they manage to hold the main gate, at least from the main building to their current building, there was no need to worry about other zombies. They just need to be cautious of Roshan approaching their bunker. Or else, it should not be difficult to hold this place down.</br>
</br>
Just as Zhao Qiuran began to build a "tower", Jiang Chen took Lu Fan to the side and opened the holographic map on his watch.</br>
</br>
"I just said that we have to hold this place. Now I'm going to tell you why I am doing this."</br>
</br>
"Because Dongcheng Hospital is the entrance to Line 27?" Lu Fan replied before Jiang Chen spoke.</br>
</br>
"Not bad." Jiang Chen applauded and nodded. "You're making good progress."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan smiled and embarrassedly touched his forehead.</br>
</br>
After clearing his throat, Jiang Chen tapped on the holographic screen, and all of the more than forty subway lines in Shangjing were highlighted.</br>
</br>
"What do you see now?"</br>
</br>
"Shangjing Subway Map?" Lu Fan frowned.</br>
</br>
"This is a treasure map, one of which has an entrance to Subway Line 0, which is the treasure of the Pan-Asia Cooperation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out the card he won at the auction from his pocket. "The key is in our hands, but we are not the only holder of the key and opening the door with a key is not the only way to get to the treasure."</br>
</br>
"Now a group of robbers is underground, and they are choosing to use explosives to clear the way."</br>
</br>
"It was not an earthquake just now?" Lu Fan looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"There is no doubt that the Russians did it, and they used nukes. Only nukes could damage civil defense facilities to this scale. Also, they must have tactical nuclear bombs equivalent to at least 10,000 TNT." Jiang Chen put away the card. "If we followed DND rules, since there are dungeons and treasures, there must be monsters and traps. Obviously, the idiots blasted a passage with a nuke, but they also released some unwanted things."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan would like to ask what the dungeons, treasures, and DND rules meant, but seeing the General was so engaged, he put away those thoughts for now.</br>
</br>
"So... what should we do now?" Lu Fan asked.</br>
</br>
"What should we do? Of course, it is to find the treasure before everyone else, and at the very least before the Russians."</br>
</br>
"Is that our target?" Lu Fan forced a smile.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's fingers tapped on a few more points on the map, and the three subway lines, Line 35, Line 27, and Line 2, were separately marked.</br>
</br>
"Line 27 passes through the South Gate of Pingan Street and passes through Dongcheng Hospital. It is connected to Line 2 and Line 35 inside the Third Ring Road. Line 35 is the subway line where the Russians are located. Line 2 passes through Pingan Street, then heads east."</br>
</br>
"What are the mysteries of these three subway lines?" Lu Fan looked at the holographic map and frowned.</br>
</br>
"Line 2 passes directly below the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building. Use your imagination, what kind of subway line will pass under the political center of the Pan-Asia Cooperation?"</br>
</br>
When Lu Fan heard Jiang Chen's words, his eyes gradually brightened up, as if he had captured a hint in his head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not wait for Lu Fan to digest this information, he pointed to Line 35 and continued.</br>
</br>
"The only thing we can confirm now is that the Russians detonated the explosives on Line 35, not only blasting an entrance but also blasting a subway line stuffed with dangerous mutants and zombies. I'm afraid now, Lines 35, 27, and 2 are all packed with zombies."</br>
</br>
"How can we get in?" Lu Fan said with the skin on his head crawling.</br>
</br>
"We have power armors," Jiang Chen said, looking at Lu Fan. "And hence why I called reinforcements."</br>
</br>
Even with power armors, it would not be an easy task to create a path among zombies. But since he learned the secret of Line Zero, he would not let it slip away from him.</br>
</br>
"I still have another point I don't understand."</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"What are the DND rules?"</br>
</br>
"..." Jiang Chen looked at him silently and then looked away. "Forget about it."</br>
</br>
The atmosphere felt a little stuffy.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan touched the back of his head, forced an awkward laugh, and then nodded.</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay..."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before the sky turned dark, two Transport Helicopter-51s arrived at Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
In addition to the eight soldiers in power armors, two supply boxes filled with ammunition dropped down.</br>
</br>
Without staying too long, the two helicopters that unloaded were soon off again and flew in the direction of AS Order for the second batch of reinforcements.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked very calm when she saw the eight power armors, and the two helicopters disappearing into the horizon,</br>
</br>
At least on the surface, she was not as surprised as she was before.</br>
</br>
Since she already witnessed the fighter and the electromagnetic pulse cannon that lifted a building with just one shot, power armors and helicopters just did not seem as impressive. She was no longer shocked by the weapons she saw.</br>
</br>
She walked to the supply box and replaced her submachine gun with the more powerful Ripper rifle.</br>
</br>
Adjusting her grip on the rifle, it took a while before she finally strapped it behind her. Then she looked at Jiang Chen, impressed, "I am looking forward to my future life in Wanghai more and more."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"How rich do you have to be to put this rifle in the supply box like a cabbage. If you sell this in Pingan Street market, the twenty Rippers in your box would at least go for 100 crystals."</br>
</br>
"The more, the more worthless." When he picked up a rifle and a magazine from the box, he said casually. "And, I advise you not to expect too much. Or else you may become disappointed and blame me."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Zhao Qiu asked.</br>
</br>
"It's not easy to find a job at Sixth Street, at least for lone travelers."</br>
</br>
"I... I'm not working for you?"</br>
</br>
"Did I say I was going to hire you?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
After the bunker and the watchtower were built, the sky was completely dark.</br>
</br>
Twenty guards were divided into three groups. They each took turns patrolling around the bunker and the watchtower, looking for any approaching zombies.</br>
</br>
The rest of the people used dry branches and alcohol bottles and ignited a few campfires on the open space, trying to get some heat. Even the women who were rescued by Jiang Chen from the raiders got a few campfires set up for them while they sat numbly in the night.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because of the temperature of the fire.</br>
</br>
A lot of numb eyes began to have some warmth in them.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not notice this subtle change.</br>
</br>
Sitting in front of the fire, Jiang Chen was yawning out of boredom. He twisted open the cap of a nutrient supply while he thought.</br>
</br>
It would be perfect to have some barbecue and beer.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was just wishful thinking. They were not a military base of the NAC. Without a warehouse full of food to cover for him, even with his own confidants by him, he could not just conveniently take food out of the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Just as he was beginning to feel bored, a situation began to stir by the gate.</br>
</br>
</br>
He tossed away the empty tube, sat up, and patted his pants.</br>
</br>
"I will go and take a look."</br>
</br>
"I'm going with you!"</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen get up, Lu Fan followed Jiang Chen to the entrance of the courtyard.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the entrance of the hospital, a man in a leather armor stood on the street not far from the courtyard gate. There was also a worn truck parked far behind him.</br>
</br>
"Don't shoot! We are not malicious."</br>
</br>
The man carefully placed his gun on the ground, raised his hands over his head, and walked toward the main entrance of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
He was very nervous.</br>
</br>
Now that the sky was completely dark, God knows how many zombies were in the vicinity.</br>
</br>
"Who are you?" On the top of the bunker, Zhao Qiuran narrowed her eyes and pointed her rifle at him, "What are you doing here?"</br>
</br>
"I am a trader from Haizhou and I'm in the fur business. I can give you 10%... No, 20% of my goods. I just ask that you let me stay here until dawn." The man noticed Zhao Qiuran's vigilance and pleaded, "I swear, we are not malicious. When the day is bright, we will leave immediately. If you don't trust us, we can sleep in the corner."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran wanted to refuse, but Jiang Chen's voice came from behind.</br>
</br>
"Open the door and let them in."</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not want to say anything more to Zhao Qiuran and looked at Lu Fan instead.</br>
</br>
As his captain for many years, Lu Fan immediately understood Jiang Chen. He walked up to Zhao Qiuran and glanced at the man outside the door.</br>
</br>
"You can keep your goods. Our benevolent boss allows you to come into our asylum. But if you dare to have any other thoughts, I'll make sure you regret coming into this world."</br>
</br>
"No, not at all," The man said while sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
The fortifications were already built, and of course, the truck would not be able to enter, but zombies were only interested in people, so they just needed to park the vehicle away from the zombie's path.</br>
</br>
The man returned to the truck and ordered the four people that looked like guards to park the truck on the side of the road. Then he walked through the small door next to the bunker and entered the hospital. Immediately when they entered, they voluntarily handed over their weapons.</br>
</br>
Anyone who saw the eight power armors would have made the same choice.</br>
</br>
In front of the power armor, a rifle would be no different than a matchstick.</br>
</br>
The four trader guards were placed at the campfire near the gate, and the man in the leather armor followed Lu Fan to the campfire where Jiang Chen was.</br>
</br>
"What is your name?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Liu Wendi... Can I sit here?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
When the man sat on the opposite side of Jiang Chen, he noticed the women several fires away and curiously asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"They are your slaves?"</br>
</br>
"No, they're my loot," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
The man was clearly shocked by this response. He gulped and moved his butt back a little.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and did not explain further. He picked up a branch from the side and fiddled with the kindling in the fire.</br>
</br>
"Why didn't you go to Pingan Street? Are you not afraid of zombies or raiders?"</br>
</br>
"We also wanted to go to Pingan Street, but something happened there." Liu Wendi smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped fiddling with the fire and looked at him while he casually asked.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What happened there?"</br>
</br>
"The South Gate has collapsed."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused.</br>
</br>
"Collapsed? The South Gate?"</br>
</br>
Liu Wendi nodded repeatedly. He looked extremely bitter and powerless.</br>
</br>
"The gap is around half a kilometer wide. Half of the slums also collapsed. Now the entire Pingan Street is a big mess. The militia has placed Pingan Street under lockdown and is only permitting people to exit. No one can enter regardless of how many crystals they pay."</br>
</br>
He came all the way from Haizhou just to sell the fur on the truck to Shangjing hoping to profit before the winter. However, now the entire Pingan Street was under martial law, he did not know how long the situation would last.</br>
</br>
It was quite dangerous to leave the goods outside, even if the Survivors Alliance had a convention that does not allow people to kill people within the Third Ring Road, this convention had never been enacted outside the wall of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
He even made up his mind. If the situation did not improve, he would pull the goods back to Haizhou.</br>
</br>
As for the four guards who were barely equipped, they really did not make a difference.</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Liu Wendi took a nutrient supply from his bag and drank it with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
Just then, the roar of the engine came from afar.</br>
</br>
Liu Wendi looked up at the sky, and two glaring white lights beamed down. The sight made him almost throw away the nutrient supply in his hand as he immediately stood up from the ground.</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
"That?" Jiang Chen looked at the sky and smiled. "My helicopter."</br>
</br>
"Helicopter? Yours?" Liu Wendi felt that his mind could not comprehend this.</br>
</br>
"Yes. Right, I haven't told you my name yet," Jiang Chen tossed the branch into the fire, clapped his hands, stood up, and patted the ash off of his trousers. As if nothing happened, he said, "You can call me Jiang Chen."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1186: The Bloodshed Under The Wall</br>
</div></br>
</br>
This night in Pingan Street was destined to be a sleepless night.</br>
</br>
Pairs of hollow eyes, like the gaze of the Grim Reaper, focused on the bustling Pingan Street from the darkness. In a loud roar that broke the silence, they all turned crimson.</br>
</br>
The zombies began to move in hobbled steps. The pairs of skinny but powerful hands extended forward desperately, rushing toward the gap in the giant wall.</br>
</br>
"ROAR—"</br>
</br>
The screams resounded through the street and the rapid gunshots formed a slaughter symphony.</br>
</br>
The soldiers gritted their teeth and weaved bullet nets with machineguns and rifle bullets in an attempt to repel the zombies. However, a net could trap river waves, but not the rolling sea. Zombies were constantly falling down, but there were more zombies stepping over the corpses.</br>
</br>
They felt no pain and feared no death.</br>
</br>
Soon, on the empty street was filled with zombies rushing in. The frontline was forced to retrieve to the first barbed wires that were pulled along the street outside the giant wall.</br>
</br>
A cluster of flames flickered behind the line of defense. Like dying candles in the wind, they were ready to be blown out at any moment.</br>
</br>
"FU*K, there are too many of them!"</br>
</br>
Using a bayonet on a rifle to stab a zombie stuck on the barbed wire, a soldier in a chemical protective suit flicked the thick blood on the bayonet and pushed the bayonet forward again, piercing five more throats.</br>
</br>
"Use a bayonet! Stab them in the neck and face! Don't let them get stuck to the wires, FU*K! DAMMIT!"</br>
</br>
More and more zombies had ripped the barbed wires with their teeth and nails and were letting out hoarse roars at the soldiers.</br>
</br>
However, what really threatened the safety of the line of defense was not the tears, but the zombies that were increasingly crowding the barbed wires.</br>
</br>
Of course, they couldn't tear the strong steel wire, but they could crush the entire wall by sheer quantity!</br>
</br>
The firepower of the frontline soldiers became sparser. It was meaningless to shoot any more. The zombies in the front were dead, and they were pressed against the barbed wires by the zombies behind them like a meat shield. The engineers quickly stepped forward and threw heavy objects such as sandbags and garbage bags behind the iron mesh.</br>
</br>
However, everyone knew that this method couldn't stop them for long.</br>
</br>
The only thing that could completely block zombies was a huge wall, but the giant wall behind them had fallen...</br>
</br>
"Their offense is too fierce!"</br>
</br>
"Ammunition! I need ammunition! Get me the ammunition box!"</br>
</br>
On the tower, the machinegunners who were suppressing the zombies in the back stopped shooting and cursed at the logistics soldiers.</br>
</br>
"We have to wait a while for more ammunition. The supply car is on the way. You must hold on for a bit longer..." The logistics soldier said while sweating.</br>
</br>
"F*cking hold? How do I hold without bullets? Shoot you!?!"</br>
</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The supply of ammunition was not optimistic, and in less than an hour, the machinegun tower that was unleashing firepower became silent.</br>
</br>
Without the machine gun to suppress the zombies in the back, the zombies were getting more and more fierce.</br>
</br>
The barbed wires were already howling under heavy fatigue and many places were bent and screws were getting popped off.</br>
</br>
The soldiers stabbing at the rotten meat began to fear and retreated.</br>
</br>
On the wall that had yet to collapse, Song Chenyu looked at the situation on the front line and his eyebrows twisted.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he slammed his fist on the wall and he ordered the officer behind him.</br>
</br>
"We can't wait any longer, get the Kamikaze Squad to go."</br>
</br>
The expression of the officer who heard the order turned serious. He saluted and stood upright.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The deafening broadcast sounded.</br>
</br>
On the front line, soldiers wearing chemical protective suits began to evacuate from the edge of the barbed wires.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a group of people wearing armor shaped like football players passed by the retreating soldiers. They carried a chainsaw with both hands and stepped on the battlefield from behind the line of defense. The line of sight behind the tempered glass and iron mesh mask did not show the slightest fear, and their advancement did not show the slightest hesitation.</br>
</br>
They were all refugees from the slums.</br>
</br>
Before the armor was welded, they were injected with an agent that dissipated their fears.</br>
</br>
Behind them was a temporarily-built, two-people tall concrete wall and many places had yet to solidify. However, this seemingly unreliable wall was the last line of defense on Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
They must hold the line before the engineers build the third protective wall.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, everything they had accomplished would go to waste.</br>
</br>
"Prepare!"</br>
</br>
The barbed wires gradually collapsed.</br>
</br>
They stood in a row behind the barbed wire and like medieval knights, they raised the chainsaw in their hands.</br>
</br>
"KILL!"</br>
</br>
The growl seemed to dispel the fear in them, and the chainsaw in their hands pushed forward.</br>
</br>
At the same time, they pressed the switch.</br>
</br>
The roaring chainsaw spurred forward. Only brief contact was needed for a zombie to lose a limb.</br>
</br>
The minced meat and solidified blood danced in the air. Even survivors who were used to the cruelty of the world would vomit. However, the Kamikaze Squad members in hell showed only numbness in their eyes.</br>
</br>
For normal zombies, the row of hand-held chainsaws was far more effective than rifles, machine guns, and even mortars. However, the Kamikaze Squad was about to face a nightmare with the more dangerous "mutants"...</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
There was a scream. A skinny zombie flexibly clung to the head of a Kamikaze member. Its sharp claws pierced through the fragile guard's neckline within a single second. The stick-like limp penetrated his collarbone and pulled out the contents inside his stomach and intestines.</br>
</br>
In two breaths time.</br>
</br>
The cruelty of the death was abnormal, and the emotion of fear began to overwhelm everyone.</br>
</br>
Someone shouted.</br>
</br>
"It's a Night Demon!"</br>
</br>
Night Demon!</br>
</br>
As the name suggested, it was a zombie-type mutant that only appeared at night. Although its power and defense were not strong, its terrifying speed and aggressive attack techniques make it one of the most frightening zombies. It was considered even more fearsome than the Roshan.</br>
</br>
In particular, its ability to analyze weaknesses was insane as his claws could always find the most vulnerable places to penetrate.</br>
</br>
The line of defense formed by the "football team" was quickly folded like paper in front of the night zombies. Then they, along with their roaring chainsaws, drowned in the sea of zombies.</br>
</br>
Only ten minutes passed since the zombies broke through the barbed wires and collapsed their line of defense.</br>
</br>
While they were completely eliminated, the sacrifice of these cheap pawns still gained Pingan Street valuable time to consolidate its defense.</br>
</br>
The retreating soldiers stepped onto the protective wall, took the ammunition from the hands of the logistics soldiers, and began to fire from their machine guns on the shooting tower again. However, the still faced immense pressure because dangerous species were appearing in the zombie flood.</br>
</br>
Not just Night Demons, but also Roshans, and Throwers tossing infant bombs.</br>
</br>
Standing on the giant wall, Song Chenyu looked down at the battlefield with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a soldier ran up, breathless.</br>
</br>
"Report, reinforcements, reinforcements have arrived, and supplies have been successfully sent to the soldiers. The logistics department said that they are adding orders to the military factory, and the second batch of ammunition will be sent soon. Leader Ding has personally issued an order for us to hold on to the line of defense!"</br>
</br>
"Where are the NAC's reinforcements? Why are they so silent!" Song Chenyu said, gnashing his teeth.</br>
</br>
Also where is Leader Ding.</br>
</br>
As the leader, why isn't he showing his face during this critical moment!</br>
</br>
However, as a subordinate of Ding Liwei, these words could only be hidden in his mind.</br>
</br>
"I don't know, there seem to be zombies at the North Gate. They are now being surrounded..."</br>
</br>
"Don't they have planes!" Song Chenyu snarled.</br>
</br>
The soldier stuttered and was unable to provide a response.</br>
</br>
Why did the NAC not lend a helping hand at the juncture of this crisis?</br>
</br>
It was not something people at his level would know.</br>
</br>
Under the giant wall, the zombies were still frantically biting the defense line of Pingan Street Guards. Many mercenaries and hunters had also stepped onto the wall to aid the effort.</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu tightly clenched his fist as he fixated his sight at the endless waves of zombies.</br>
</br>
He could only pray that the last line of defense could last till dawn...</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1187: The Nonexistent Negative Twenty-first Floor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The elevator went straight down the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng stood in the elevator and looked at the floor number decreasing, gloom was all over his face.</br>
</br>
Bad news came from one after another.</br>
</br>
Sura was not caught, and the bodies of several Men in Black were found in the trash can outside North Street. The card that flowed out of the auction was not recovered, and the Men in Black sent out to pursue that card likely would not come back either. Now, the Russians had detonated nukes underground. Not only did they demolish the blockage that took them six months to build ten years ago between the intersection of Lines 35 and 27, but they also collapsed the giant wall that was over half-a-kilometer long.</br>
</br>
As the giant wall fell, Pingan Street was forced to be on the edge of survival.</br>
</br>
Even if it survived today, what about tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow?</br>
</br>
The tens of meters high wall was not built in a day or two. At the start when Leader Ding and the other Survivor Alliance heads joined together, the wall took them over six years to build. In addition, they only became prosperous after they completed this wall and moved into Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
Now, without interference, it would take more than half a year to fix this wall.</br>
</br>
If CCCP invaded them during this time...</br>
</br>
He could not wait any longer.</br>
</br>
Or, the leaders of the entire Survivors Alliance could not wait any longer.</br>
</br>
After voting, they unanimously passed Plan B-</br>
</br>
Start Line 0 ahead of time.</br>
</br>
If there was a powerful weapon of mass destruction inside, all problems would be solved.</br>
</br>
In the elevator, Wan Peng edited several short messages with his EP and sent it to his subordinates. He made detailed arrangements for all matters over the next three days.</br>
</br>
The elevator crossed the negative twentieth floor but did not stop, it continued down.</br>
</br>
After five minutes, the elevator finally stopped a few hundred meters below ground at the negative twenty-first floor not shown on the elevator.</br>
</br>
Yes, the well-known Pan-Asia Cooperation Building did not just have a negative twentieth floor. By pressing the floor in a specific order, an emergency evacuation procedure would be initiated. It would allow the key personnel in the elevator to move beyond the negative twentieth floor and into the negative twenty-first floor hundreds of meters below.</br>
</br>
The negative twenty-first floor of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building was located outside of Line 27. The subway could be accessed via a special passage not open to the public. The entrance to the legendary Line 0 was located inside Line 2!</br>
</br>
Wan Peng heard the secret of the negative twenty-first floor from a former senior official of Pan-Asia Cooperation before he boarded the ship. The news of the legendary Line 0 was also from the same person.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, even at his level, he was unable to learn about the contents hidden in Line Zero.</br>
</br>
</br>
Ten years ago, after he learned about the secret of the negative twenty-first floor, Wan Peng, Ding Liwei and the others discussed and immediately started the transformation of Line 27. They began moving explosives underground and it took a full six months to collapse the intersection of Line 27 and Line 35.</br>
</br>
Now, because of those Russians, their efforts from ten years ago were all in vain.</br>
</br>
After Wan Peng left the elevator, more than a dozen Men in Black waited at the door, and Lu Sen stepped forward half a step and respectfully said.</br>
</br>
"Boss."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng nodded to Lu Sen.</br>
</br>
"How are the preparations going?"</br>
</br>
"We're ready," Lu Sen replied.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng nodded and walked down the stairs.</br>
</br>
At the end of the stairs was a small platform. Next to the platform, there was an unnumbered mini version of maglev train.</br>
</br>
It was mini because it only had four compartments in total.</br>
</br>
At the door of the train, the man in the windbreaker was carrying a suitcase. From his impatient look and the way he constantly examined his watch, he had clearly been waiting for a long time.</br>
</br>
"You are late." Su Xiang said as he watched Wan Peng walk towards him.</br>
</br>
"Took a bit longer to get down than expected."</br>
</br>
"I hope that Leader Ding can wait for a bit longer," Su Xiang shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Well he has to wait regardless, the card is with me," Wan Peng said expressionlessly. "Don't talk nonsense, let's get moving."</br>
</br>
The group boarded the maglev train.</br>
</br>
The track that had been silent for many years was turned back on. The signal lit up.</br>
</br>
Soon, with the efforts of the two drivers, the train slowly moved and then began to accelerate...</br>
</br>
As he was sitting beside the window and staring at the darkness outside, Wan Peng suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Su Xiang, who sat across from him, asked.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, just that it is very interesting."</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect that the escape passage those bast*rd officials didn't get to use are now being used by us." When he stared into the unfathomable darkness, Wan Peng grinned.</br>
</br>
Soon, the train arrived at Line 2, and Wan Peng's unsettled heart finally relaxed.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was really afraid of the Russians who did not follow common sense and decided to create another hole in the wall of Line 27. If that happened, then it would not be Ding Liwei waiting for him, but the CCCP tanks.</br>
</br>
But now it seemed that his concern was irrational.</br>
</br>
Although he did not know where the Russian went, at least they were not on Line 2.</br>
</br>
However, just as he was completely relaxed, an alarm began to ring in the train, and the [Warning] logo replaced the speed on the holographic screen. With a series of deafening screeching sounds, the train suddenly slowed down and eventually stopped.</br>
</br>
Letting go of the tightly gripped handle, Su Xiang looked at the holographic screen and frowned.</br>
</br>
"Smoke detector?"</br>
</br>
"I'm going to see who smoked." Wan Peng stood up in a gloomy manner.</br>
</br>
"I'm afraid that no one smoked," Su Xiang quickly stopped him. He looked extremely serious. "Someone hacked into the smoke alarm system of the train and started the emergency braking procedure."</br>
</br>
At this time, the door opened, and Lu Sen came in, confused.</br>
</br>
"Boss, what's the situation?"</br>
</br>
"I wanted to ask you," Wan Peng said with gloom in his eyes, "Someone triggered the smoke alarm."</br>
</br>
Lu Sen was sweating and clarified.</br>
</br>
"Boss, the boys are all in their seats, no one dares to smoke now."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng did not respond but looked at Su Xiang.</br>
</br>
"What should we do now?"</br>
</br>
"Security permissions are in the hands of the hackers. If they can stop the train once, then they can stop it a second time. It doesn't make sense for us to stay here," Su Xiang sighed and stood up. "Let's walk. It's not far."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng nodded.</br>
</br>
It's the only solution.</br>
</br>
The driver tried to start the train for the last time, but it did not work.</br>
</br>
In desperation, the group had to abandon the train.</br>
</br>
The two Men in Black next to Wan Peng stepped forward, took out burning rods, and ignited them. The rods made the tunnel look less dark.</br>
</br>
Like this, the group walked along the magnetic levitation track line toward the other end of the tunnel.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, there was a sound of bullets being fired.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen was quick to react as he pushed his boss. A silver light passed through Wan Peng's previous position. He only heard Su Xiang's agonizing voice behind him as Su Xiang covered his chest before collapsing.</br>
</br>
Just barely missing death, Wan Peng's heart pounded so fast that it was about to stop.</br>
</br>
Due to the unexpected situation, and the two Men in Black immediately tossed their burning rods to the front. At the same time, they stood in front of their boss, took out two submachine guns from under their suit, and locked in.</br>
</br>
The burning rods spewed orange-red sparks. The sound of the rods burning was so clear in the empty tunnel.</br>
</br>
The silence of death lingered in everyone's mind.</br>
</br>
Just then, there were footsteps in front of them.</br>
</br>
A figure casually walked out from the dark tunnel before it stopped at the edge of darkness.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
"Who is it!"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1188"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1188: The Gunshots in the Subway</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In a dimly lit basement of Pingan Street, Greyhound's hands ​​left the keyboard as he breathed out a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
After more than ten hours of intense battle, he was on the verge of collapsing, and his clothes were already soaked in sweat.</br>
</br>
Breaking into the security system of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building was not an easy task. It was difficult even today when there had been no security personnel for over 30 years.</br>
</br>
Just then, he heard the voice of his old boss.</br>
</br>
"Brother, thank you."</br>
</br>
"No need, I can only do so much... In short, Luo, good luck."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
The communication was cut off and Old Luo came out of the shadows.</br>
</br>
Orange-red flames sparkled from the burning rods.</br>
</br>
In front of him was a group of men in black suits with automatic rifles in their hands. And the one surrounded by those men was one of his targets.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng, Manager Wan!</br>
</br>
"Who is it!"</br>
</br>
"Who is it?" At the edge of the light, Old Luo laughed and looked at Wan Peng with a sneer. "You've been looking for me for so long and now you don't know me?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's expression changed. He took two steps back, gestured to his subordinates, then he said with menace.</br>
</br>
"Get rid of him."</br>
</br>
Gunshots sounded at the same time!</br>
</br>
"Dadada—"</br>
</br>
Fourteen guns spewed out bullets simultaneously and created a bright web of fire in the dark tunnel.</br>
</br>
However, Old Luo just smiled. The moment the bullets appeared, high-pressure nitrogen gas spewed out and formed a gas wall in front of him.</br>
</br>
The bullets looked like they were in water. They rolled to the side in the shield made of high-pressure nitrogen and didn't even touch his clothes.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's pupils narrowed.</br>
</br>
When a Man in Black saw the scene, he immediately pulled out a grenade from his waist and tossed it in Old Luo's direction.</br>
</br>
Old Luo was unphased as he watched the grenade that was flying towards him,</br>
</br>
The scalpel-like dagger fell into his hand from his sleeve. He disappeared, then reappeared again. Before the grenade exploded, he had already disappeared from his original position.</br>
</br>
The moment he disappeared, Lu Sen's pupil suddenly shrank. He felt an ominous sign as he hurriedly raised his rifle.</br>
</br>
DING!!!</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, his hands felt an immense force that made his wrists numb.</br>
</br>
The slender dagger penetrated the side of the rifle and even cut off the metal muzzle!</br>
</br>
And then, the other Men in Black were not so lucky.</br>
</br>
Just listening to the muffled growl, the four men standing next to him fell backward. There was a dagger slit on their suits and bright blood flowers began blooming.</br>
</br>
"Back! Back! Defensive formation!"</br>
</br>
Lu Sen roared while throwing away the broken rifle and pulling out his pistol.</br>
</br>
After making sure Manager Wan was behind them, the Men in Black used their firepower to suppress the lightning speed Old Luo who rushed forward as they moved back.</br>
</br>
</br>
But it was obvious the bullets were not effective.</br>
</br>
In just two breaths of time, Old Luo closed the ten meters distance. Then two silver rays flickered and without being able to scream, two more fell.</br>
</br>
"AHH!!!"</br>
</br>
The silver ray appeared, and another Man in Black fell down as he held his throat.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen's scalp felt numb as he watched his men who died one after another,</br>
</br>
He was too fast!</br>
</br>
No, this speed was unhuman!</br>
</br>
CLANK—</br>
</br>
The sound of bullets being stuck.</br>
</br>
The gunshots suddenly stopped, and the terrifying silence lingered between the remaining three.</br>
</br>
The smoke of the muzzle dissipated, and a drop of cold sweat rolled down Lu Sen's forehead as he slightly retreated half a step.</br>
</br>
His struggle could be seen in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Do I... Do I have to use that move?</br>
</br>
Against the last pistol, Old Luo stopped stepping forward. His emotionless eyes scanned Lu Sen holding the pistol and stopped on Wan Peng. He then revealed a sly expression.</br>
</br>
"Is that all your men have got? And you want the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng unclenched his fists and looked directly at Old Luo. He was calmer as he responded.</br>
</br>
"How did you get in here?"</br>
</br>
"Do you still have time to care about this?" Old Luo raised an eyebrow and said with a sneer. "There is more than one entrance to the escape route. You, an ordinary person, could enter. How can a former Pan-Asia Cooperation Intelligence Agency personnel not get in?"</br>
</br>
"I see," Wan Peng nodded and looked at him. "But I still don't understand one point."</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"Why are you guys, always so annoying?" Wan Peng closed his eyes, squeezed this sentence from his teeth, and his voice was filled with irresistible hatred, "We are the ones that established order on this wasteland. We are the ones who saved the survivors who were struggling in the ruins, but you! You're just cowards who escaped from your mistakes! Why are you interfering with our choice!"</br>
</br>
Gazing at the cursing Wan Peng, Old Luo said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"An order is an order. There is nothing to explain. After 50 years, Line 0 will naturally open. It will reproduce the glory of Pan-Asia on this wasteland. That is the decision of the Pan-Asia Parliament. You don't understand so just obey."</br>
</br>
"Then you understand?" Wan Peng stared at him.</br>
</br>
"I don't understand," Old Luo shook his head. "There is no need to understand."</br>
</br>
Because an order was an order.</br>
</br>
Obedience was the duty of the soldier.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng was silent.</br>
</br>
After a while, he took a deep breath and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"Lu Sen."</br>
</br>
"...Roger, boss."</br>
</br>
Lu Sen responded with a grimace, and all the fear in his eyes disappeared.</br>
</br>
Dropping the pistol in his hand, his hands jerked forward.</br>
</br>
In an instant, his pupils turned into a crimson red.</br>
</br>
All his veins popped up, his bones cracked, and his muscles swelled at an incredible speed.</br>
</br>
"FEV virus?" Old Luo seemed to be intrigued by the changes of Lu Sen "I didn't expect that today, twenty years later, there is someone who can control the FEV virus. To be honest, you surprised me."</br>
</br>
Lu Sen's expression was vicious as he pumped his fists together. Cruelly, he said.</br>
</br>
"You will be even more surprised!"</br>
</br>
Suddenly, from his neck, a layer of darkness gradually covered his whole body...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
A sea of bones formed under the giant wall.</br>
</br>
The zombie's body formed a diagonal slope under the protective wall.</br>
</br>
The fire reflected countless distorted faces, and the soldiers standing on the protective wall desperately held onto the machineguns while they shot at the zombies rushing up. However, these zombies were like ants, impossible to completely eliminate.</br>
</br>
"The wall can't hold any longer! Where are the reinforcements? What? Two hundred riflemen are on the way. FU*K, where is our power armors? What? Not here? FU*K..." As he ended the communication, Song Chenyu anxiously looked at the battlefield under the giant wall with a hazy expression on his face.</br>
</br>
The reinforcements of the NAC did not arrive, and the officials of Survivors Alliance went missing. Now the power armors of the militia group had also disappeared.</br>
</br>
To save this mess, they could only rely on themselves.</br>
</br>
However, they still had more than six hours until dawn.</br>
</br>
His fists clenched, loosened, and clenched again...</br>
</br>
He slammed his fist on the wall, pulled the intercom system, and shouted.</br>
</br>
"DUMP THE FUEL! BURNNN!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1189: The Price of Reinforcemen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
SWOOSH!</br>
</br>
Above Dongcheng Hospital, two Aurora-20s crossed path for a brief second in the air before they whizzed away.</br>
</br>
The 20mm machinegun was like two hoes that ploughed the entire concrete street. Then two incendiary bombs were dropped from the air and exploded over the zombies. They engulfed the mess all over the ground in a sea of ​​fire.</br>
</br>
Liu Wendi watched the blazing fire in silence as he became completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Just ten minutes ago, when the flood of zombies rushed to the hospital, he thought he was dead.</br>
</br>
And now, he finally understood why Jiang Chen told him that help was unnecessary.</br>
</br>
Next to him, the four guards he brought shared the same expression. They were already prepared for the worst, to engage in direct combat with the zombies, but now their concern seemed excessive.</br>
</br>
The flames gradually extinguished. The zombies that were previously stopped by the burning flame took advantage of the fighters' time to resupply and swarmed in again.</br>
</br>
More than a dozen newly deployed power armors stood on the protective wall, and the minigun barrels spewed out violent tongues of fire as they created a dense firepower net that intertwined on the chaotic street. The rest of the soldiers also set up light machineguns and fired at the zombies at the entrance of the street.</br>
</br>
Rows of zombies fell down like wheat being harvested, but more zombies swarmed in one after another.</br>
</br>
"SHEEEK—"</br>
</br>
There was an awful sounding agony.</br>
</br>
With its huge belly, the zombie stopped stumbling, and pulled out a baby zombie that was making weird noises from its belly, spun him in her arm, and then tossed the baby to the bunker at the entrance of Dongcheng Hospital.</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
The baby zombie instantly exploded, and the corrosive venom burned the concrete and formed white smoke along with pungent smells. However, it did not hurt the guards behind the bunker.</br>
</br>
Just as the Thrower was about to throw a second baby bomb, blood blossoms exploded on its head as it fell down backward under inertia.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran's left foot stepped on the wall as she swung her hair, loaded the rifle, and continued to aim at the next target.</br>
</br>
Although the battle conditions inside and outside the courtyard wall were tense, everything was still under control.</br>
</br>
Not considering the power armors on the protective wall, on the AS Order more than two hundred kilometers away, the electromagnetic pulse cannon was locked and loaded and could fire at any second for emergencies. Also, two Aurora-20s were in the air to provide cover fire as they dropped incendiary bombs to clear the battlefield.</br>
</br>
Under such circumstances, it was almost impossible for zombies to break through the NAC defenses.</br>
</br>
What's more, most of the zombies were drawn to Pingan Street a few kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Behind the battlefield, engineers had built simple barracks.</br>
</br>
In the barracks, Jiang Chen was looking at the holographic map as he carefully examined the two subway lines.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although it had been determined that the entrance of Line 0 was in Line 27 or Line 2, the length of these two subway lines was not short, and it was still a mystery where the entrance was. The mysterious seller only auctioned the ID card used as the key, but he did not auction together the "treasure map".</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was phased out while he stared at the lines, a NAC officer walked into the barracks, stood next to Jiang Chen, and saluted.</br>
</br>
"General."</br>
</br>
"What's going out?"</br>
</br>
He withdrew his gaze from the holographic map, looked at the officer, and asked.</br>
</br>
"The front-line command on Pingan Street bypassed the Survivors Alliance and sent us a distress signal. It seems that their line of defense is almost broken." The officer reported.</br>
</br>
"Bypassed the Survivors Alliance and sent us a distress signal?" Jiang Chen frowned, "What is the reaction of the alliance?</br>
</br>
"There is no reaction," The officer shook his head. "According to reliable sources, after the wall collapsed, the senior leaders of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance headed by Ding Liwei and Wan Peng disappeared together, and even the power armor company of the Second Militia disappeared with them."</br>
</br>
"Disappeared?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately turned his head and moved his eyes back to the holographic map.</br>
</br>
When his gaze stopped on Line 27 that passed under the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, his pupils contracted slightly.</br>
</br>
He reached out, then clicked on the holographic screen and switched to the contact list. After he selected Li Wang, he put his hand on the headset and said in a deep voice.</br>
</br>
"The situation has changed, Immediately send reinforcements to the South Gate of Pingan Street."</br>
</br>
"In addition, I need a helicopter and a set of power armor."</br>
</br>
After he ended the call, Jiang Chen immediately looked at the officer.</br>
</br>
"You said, the troops of Pingan Street bypassed the alliance and sent us a distress signal?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." The officer nodded.</br>
</br>
"I want to get in touch with their frontline commander now, is there any good way to do so?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The fire gradually extinguished.</br>
</br>
Most of the zombie corpses piled up like a mountain were burned away, and the remaining ashes and residues turned into dust in the cold evening wind.</br>
</br>
The zombies that stopped because of the fire once again started to move as they swarmed toward the wall.</br>
</br>
There were constantly zombies falling down, and zombies constantly stepping on the backs of their predecessors with their arms extended towards the soldiers on the protective wall, scratching indiscriminately.</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!!!"</br>
</br>
With his rifle pointed at the zombie under the wall, a soldier pulled his trigger desperately, but his barrel was caught by a thin arm. He was pulled down from the wall and the protective uniform that he wore was like thin paper in front of the sharp claws as his life quickly faded.</br>
</br>
One by one baby zombies flew to the wall, to the guard tower, to the ground, and beside the soldiers, and from time to time someone fell in the highly corrosive acid.</br>
</br>
More than 2,000 defenders, plus more than 2,000 reinforcements from the militia, Sunday Club, and other survivors.</br>
</br>
However, now, there were less than two thousand people left.</br>
</br>
In order to fill the half-kilometer defense line gap, Song Chenyu had mobilized the survivors of Pingan Street for the third time, promised heavy rewards to the mercenaries and hunters, amd convinced them to deploy to the wall. As for if the Shangjing Survivors Alliance really possessed crystals after the ten million payment to NAC, he could no longer care.</br>
</br>
If they could not get through this current challenge, Pingan Street would become history.</br>
</br>
However, Song Chenyu realized in despair that even if the mercenaries and hunters joined the battle, it was still a drop in the bucket to the current situation.</br>
</br>
A very serious question was posed before him.</br>
</br>
The ammunition reserve was almost depleted.</br>
</br>
At this moment, there was a sudden roar in the silent night sky.</br>
</br>
Many people looked up, and then uttered surprised shouts.</br>
</br>
"Look! It's an airplane!"</br>
</br>
Countless desperate eyes gradually turned into joy of survival. The morale that had fallen to the bottom of the valley was once again reignited. Fear was swept away from everyone's heart, and the mercenaries and hunters who had originally planned to flee also picked up their courage and fired at the zombies.</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu looked at the sky, and his face was full of disbelief.</br>
</br>
Originally, when the messenger explained to him that the agreement reached between the senior officials of the Survivors Alliance and the NAC only applied to the CCCP, he no longer had any hope.</br>
</br>
Thus, he didn't expect the NAC to actually sent reinforcements!</br>
</br>
In his excitement, tears filled his eyes.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the communication request prompt sounded from his headset.</br>
</br>
He rubbed the corner of his eyes, and pressed the on button.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"I am General Jiang Chen of the NAC, if I guessed correctly, you should have seen reinforcements by now."</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu hurriedly said, "Thank you! Thank you so much! I represent all the survivors of Pingan Street——"</br>
</br>
"You don't have to say thank you, you know that it doesn't make much sense to us," Jiang Chen stopped him, and continued, "Our people can help you solve all the troubles in front of you, and even in the future. But you know, this is reinforcement outside of the agreement, and there is no free lunch in the world. We only promised to help you deal with the CCCP and did not promise to kill zombies for you."</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu swallowed, and he subtly noticed something was off.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, he stepped aside and said in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"The Shangjing Survivor Alliance Council is not here right now, I can't make a decision—"</br>
</br>
"No, you didn't understand what I meant," Jiang Chen shook his head, "I'm not asking about the opinions of the Shanghai Survivors Alliance, but the opinions of you and all your soldiers."</br>
</br>
"Join us, this is the only condition for you to get reinforcements,"Jiang Chen said without concealment.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1190: Carbonization!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the help of the swaying flame from the burning rod, Old Luo noticed the abnormal change on his body. His pupils suddenly shrunk, and his hands moved.</br>
</br>
Silver rays flickered and formed a net in the air as it flew to Lu Sen who had undergone an unexpected change.</br>
</br>
But Lu Sen did not attempt to dodge, he grinned cruelly instead and extended his hands forward.</br>
</br>
"Haha, it's too late!"</br>
</br>
DINGGGG!</br>
</br>
There was a series of clanging sounds, accompanied by a sound of metal being scratched. The silver rays seemed to be hitting a steel wall as they bounced off Lu Sen's body; they did not hurt him.</br>
</br>
A trace of caution appeared in Old Luo's eyes, and his original disdain was swept away.</br>
</br>
"Lead?"</br>
</br>
"It's carbonization!"</br>
</br>
Lu Sen laughed loudly, then he snarled. He dragged his enlarged body, and rushed toward Old Luo.</br>
</br>
"GO TO HELL!"</br>
</br>
With a punch that carried a huge air current, it blasted towards Old Luo with the agility that did not match Lu Sen's giant size.</br>
</br>
Old Luo seemed unphased. He quickly took two steps back and two silver blades rolled down his sleeves. He then threw them at Lu Sen's face.</br>
</br>
However, he obviously underestimated Lu Sen's strength.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen reached for the two flying blades and slapped them out of the air without any suspense, and then kicked up and landed directly on Old Luo's chest.</br>
</br>
"Omph"</br>
</br>
As if he was hit by a train, Old Luo made a muffled cry as he flew backward, like a broken kite, and smashed into the hard subway tunnel wall.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen menacingly smiled as he watched Old Luo on the ground. He pulled off his tightened shirt and revealed his darkened muscles.</br>
</br>
"Humans can't beat mutants."</br>
</br>
After a few dry coughs, Old Luo got up from the ground, shook his dizzy head, and looked at Lu Sen who was grinning menacingly. Two daggers slipped down from his cuffs, and the silver light danced and formed a hail of blades between his palms.</br>
</br>
Electric sparks jumped in his hair and crackled in the air.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, I'm not an ordinary person."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
BOOM!!!</br>
</br>
The fighter whizzed by from low altitude, and the cannon roared.</br>
</br>
Zombies were harvested one after another, and incendiary bombs soon followed.</br>
</br>
A Roshan roared and threw half-destroyed streetlamps, stones, and billboards into the sky. The Night Demon howled and fell in the rising flames.</br>
</br>
"Hold on! Reinforcements are coming soon!"</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu shouted into the headset that connected to the soldiers on the wall.</br>
</br>
Everyone regained their courage, inserted the bayonet into the rifle, stabbed the zombie who was stepping on the pile of corpses that rushed to the wall, and pulled the trigger towards the zombies swarming forward...</br>
</br>
On the other side of Pingan Street, dozens of modified military trucks and Tiger II tanks rushed out from the NAC military base. The top machine gun shot at the scattered groups of zombies, and the steel armor bulldozed the zombies moving in.</br>
</br>
</br>
The convoy was divided into two groups. Tanks and armored vehicles went around towards the North Gate, while another set of trucks carrying soldiers drove straight to the North Gate.</br>
</br>
"Open the gates!"</br>
</br>
The NAC officer connected to the communication channel of Pingan Street and shouted to the defenders on the towering wall.</br>
</br>
The defender at the North Gate hesitated and immediately asked the Survivors Alliance for instructions. However, neither Ding Liwei nor Wan Peng were there to make a decision.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Song Chenyu's order came. He said three words.</br>
</br>
"Open the door."</br>
</br>
The officer at the South Gate ordered the opening of the North Gate, which did not conform to the rules of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
However, the situation at the North Gate was now precarious, and the defenders could no longer care about the rules. What's more, it would be Song Chenyu's fault if anything happened.</br>
</br>
The city defense officer in charge of the North Gate stopped hesitating and ordered the gate to be opened.</br>
</br>
A line of trucks drove into Pingan Street. As the defenders on Pingan Street looked at the well-equipped soldiers on the trucks, their scalp felt numb. Obviously, they invited in a group of people that were difficult to mess with.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that the crisis at the North Gate was alleviated.</br>
</br>
It was just that now after they've come in, they were unlikely to leave.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Four transport helicopters flew by in the night sky, the vortex engines injected high-heat air stream and flew toward the giant wall.</br>
</br>
In the belly compartment of the helicopter in the front, eight power armors sat on both sides. Their tactical rifles exuded a fearful aura, and the bright steel armor had th words T-3 writtne in white paint.</br>
</br>
"Five hundred meters ahead, we are close to the wall of Pingan Street." The pilot turned his head and said.</br>
</br>
"Fly directly on to the wall."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
The helicopter climbed up and passed the endless zombies.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's sight was focused on the helmet screen, and after he clicked a few buttons, he connected to the helicopter wing camera.</br>
</br>
When he looked down from a height of tens of meters above, the dense cluster of hideous zombie heads swarmed together as they rushed towards the defense line one after another.</br>
</br>
If it is difficult to imagine this picture, imagine the Shangjing Railway Station during Spring Festival, just multiplied by ten folds...</br>
</br>
In the dark night sky, flames that flickered from the gaps in the wall were as fragile as candles swaying in the gusty wind. However, with the support of the NAC, the clusters of fragile flames seemed to be much stronger at this moment.</br>
</br>
The helicopter stopped on the wall.</br>
</br>
The width of the top of the wall was very narrow, and there was almost no place for the helicopter to descend.</br>
</br>
But that didn't matter, Jiang Chen was wearing a T-3 type at the moment, which was the so-called airborne type.</br>
</br>
A dozen black shadows jumped from the helicopter, and the four pairs of vortex engines behind them emitted blue flames that helped them to slowly land on the wall.</br>
</br>
Chenyu gulped down at the scene as he bit his tongue and walked forward.</br>
</br>
"Song Chenyu, the defense officer of the South Gate... Thank you for coming to support us."</br>
</br>
"You're welcome," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly as he opened the power armor helmet and shook his hand, "How is the situation?"</br>
</br>
"It's not optimistic, but it is much better than before," Song Chenyu said with a sigh.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and asked other questions.</br>
</br>
"I heard that the Shanghai Survivors Alliance Council disappeared together. Do you know where they went?"</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu was slightly stunned. He neither knew how Jiang Chen obtained this information, nor why Jiang Chen asked this question. However, considering the difference in the strength of the two sides, he hesitated and said.</br>
</br>
"I'm not very clear about the specific situation, but now the entire Pingan Street command system has become a mess. It has been more than four hours since the zombies flood, but until now only half of the reinforcements I have requested have arrived... Some people say that the top officials escaped from a secret passage. Of course, this is just a rumor."</br>
</br>
"The rumor is not important. The important thing is that these things have already happened, right?" Jiang Chen subtly smiled.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Song Chenyu had a bad feeling.</br>
</br>
However, thinking that he had already taken refuge in the NAC half an hour ago, a wry smile appeared on his face, and the bad premonition was driven out of his mind.</br>
</br>
"I have another question. Where did those officials appear last?"</br>
</br>
"Last?" Song Chenyu thought for a second, then he frowned, "They probably haven't left the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building... By the way, Guardian Sect's Xu Tiannan is setting up at the East Gate. You might as well ask him. He is one of the few senior leaders who has not gone missing, but he is generally quiet about the affairs of Pingan Street."</br>
</br>
"No need to ask him. By the way, do you have any subordinates you can trust?"</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Give him the defense duty of the North Gate temporarily, I need you to accompany me to do something," Jiang Chen said in a tone that could not be rejected.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?" Song Chenyu was in a daze.</br>
</br>
"I need you to go to the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building and find some people."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1191: The Battle Of Non-Humans</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Blue electric arcs began to spark out from Old Luo's arms. The silver ray between his fingers instantly liquefied when the electric arc passed through. Liquid began to flow out from his sleeves and formed into a shiny spear in his hands.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen's pupils shrunk, and in the eyes full of rage, there was the slightest anxiety.</br>
</br>
The implausible event that just unfolded in front of him was beyond his knowledge.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng, standing in the back, narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Liquid metal and hidden genetic code of electricity? Or... are you a modified human?"</br>
</br>
He heard about a form of liquid alloy that could undergo solid-liquid transformation under a certain voltage.</br>
</br>
"Who knows? Maybe it's magic? Spells? Not sure." Old Luo laughed, as he spun the spear in his hands, then he pointed it at Lu Sen who had transformed into a mutated human. "I am afraid this is not a simple carbonization. This layer of carbon is probably stronger than graphene."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng chuckled and his right hand hid in his sleeve, as if he was holding onto something.</br>
</br>
"Magic? Haha, a lame joke. Lu Sen, kill him!"</br>
</br>
"Roar!"</br>
</br>
The roar seemed to create sound ripples.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen ran to the maglev rail. Both of his hands grabbed onto the steel bars used to pin down the rails.</br>
</br>
With an angry low-pitched roar, the bolts on the steel bar popped off from the immense force. The concrete foundation underneath began to crack as the three-meter-long steel bar was yanked up!</br>
</br>
"Oh, interesting."</br>
</br>
With another spin of the silver spear, Old Luo swiftly dashed forward and aimed directly at Lu Sen's chest.</br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
CLANK!</br>
</br>
With the fierce spear penetrating through the air, it was met by a crisp clank. The steel bar and the silver spear clashed together, but then quickly separated again.</br>
</br>
Old Luo had a look of shock in his eyes, without stopping his next attack, he pushed the spear three times in a row, but received three "clanks" in return.</br>
</br>
The steel bar hundreds of kilograms in weight was spun by Lu Sen like a propeller. With a speed no inferior to his, Lu Sen dashed toward him. The furious stance was like a berserker and he used his steel bar as a battle axe!</br>
</br>
The situation seemed to have reversed.</br>
</br>
Old Luo was forced to defend and was caught in a downturn. In the violent attacks of Lu Sen, he could only move back in defense</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he seemed to have lost his balance, as if he had stepped on something, and then tumbled two steps back.</br>
</br>
Lu Sen did not let go of this opportunity as a viscous sneer formed. He swung the steel bar and knocked away Old Luo's spear, then he used the momentum to raise the steel bar above his head, then slammed down at the tumbling Old Luo!</br>
</br>
DUANG!</br>
</br>
The spear was bent significantly.</br>
</br>
His feet also seeped half an inch into the soil. Old Luo was forced to kneel on one knee as he used both hands to hold onto the spear to parley the thunderous swing.</br>
</br>
</br>
Blood rushed to his mouth and dripped out from the corner of his lips. He was not in the best state</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, where are you hiding now?!" Lu Sen laughed violently, exerting more force down.</br>
</br>
The outcome was determined!</br>
</br>
However, when he thought victory was inevitable, he did not pay attention to Old Luo's troubled face. Old Luo suddenly smiled as if his plan succeeded.</br>
</br>
"Why should I hide?"</br>
</br>
The blue arcs exploded. Before Lu Sen could react, the electric arcs rushed from the silver spear to the steel bar and into his arms.</br>
</br>
BUZZZZ -</br>
</br>
The jumping electric arc flowed through him, forcing every inch of his hair to stand up. With the same posture of swinging down the steel bra, Lu Sen collapsed stiffly on the ground, unable to move his body due to paralysis.</br>
</br>
Can't move!</br>
</br>
A drop of sweat dripped down from Lu Sen's forehead.</br>
</br>
Just when he was desperately trying to move his body again, he saw that Old Luo had already stood up with the support of the silver spear.</br>
</br>
"Go to hell."</br>
</br>
There was no nonsense this time, and the silver spear formed a beautiful mirage in the air.</br>
</br>
The electric arc danced at the tip of the spear. Like lightning, the spear penetrated the carbon layer and created a giant hole in Lu Sen's left chest.</br>
</br>
"AHHHH!"</br>
</br>
Blood gushed out from Lu Sen's mouth. His trembling hands moved to the spear in his left chest as disbelief widened his eyes. His swelled muscles could not move even a single bit.</br>
</br>
Impossible!</br>
</br>
He previously tested his own carbonization ability and it could resist bullets from an anti-equipment rifle! How could it be penetrated by a spear!</br>
</br>
"Off you go..."</br>
</br>
Muttering to himself, Old Luo stepped on Lu Sen's chest and his hand jerked backwards.</br>
</br>
The silver spear was pulled out from Lu Sen's chest. With blood gushing out two meters high, the mutated warrior, with his eyes wide open, slowly collapsed to the ground and no longer breathed.</br>
</br>
Old Luo took two seconds to catch his breath before he loosened his grip and the silver spear formed into countless droplets, returning to his sleeve.</br>
</br>
Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he turned around as his entire body wsa shaking, and looked at Wan Peng standing still.</br>
</br>
"Manager Wan, you're next."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
BOOM-</br>
</br>
The endless explosion, followed by tremors, came from under everyone's feet.</br>
</br>
The CCCP soldiers who were inspecting the ground and the walls inch by inch with detectors stopped their work and looked at the deep, dark end of Line 27.</br>
</br>
Yegor frowned and looked to the front on the tank turret.</br>
</br>
"That's the direction of Line 2," Sminov said. "It should have been from that direction."</br>
</br>
"Yes, and no."</br>
</br>
"Well?" Sminov looked at the commander in confusion.</br>
</br>
Yegor's battletested expression showed a shrewdness that did not belong.</br>
</br>
"Dear Comrade Sminov, try to recall the sound just now. Did you not notice anything odd?"</br>
</br>
Sminov looked at his commander, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Yegor shook his head and did not explain himself. He looked at the engineer soldiers outside the tank and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Check the wall on the right hand side!"</br>
</br>
"ROGER!"</br>
</br>
The engineer soldiers saluted and rushed in the direction pointed by Yegor. They took out the detectors and pushed them against the wall.</br>
</br>
However, after a while, the detectors did not show any abnormalities. The parameters all showed solid dirt was behind the wall.</br>
</br>
"Report, no abnormalities found!"</br>
</br>
Yegor sneered.</br>
</br>
"No abnormalities?"</br>
</br>
No abnormalities is a abnormality!</br>
</br>
The sound was clearly coming from right along the ground, but the wall did not transmit any sound. This sound insulation effect was superb, but why would there be a soundproof wall used in a subway tunnel buried under hundreds of meters? Are they worried about disturbing people?</br>
</br>
I am afraid there are other mysteries hidden behind this wall.</br>
</br>
Yegor waved and signaled an engineer soldier to walk up. Then he whispered a few words to him before gesturing.</br>
</br>
The engineer soldier immediately jogged forward, found a position on the wall, painted a large red cross with a marker, and then threw a burning rod on the ground before he quickly retreated to a very distant position.</br>
</br>
Yegor pressed on his headset as he looked at the red cross.</br>
</br>
"...All tank units, replace the ammo with bunker destructor, and aim at the target position."</br>
</br>
The muzzles of the twelve tanks moved slowly, aiming right at the red cross on the wall.</br>
</br>
"Three, two, one, fire!"</br>
</br>
With Yegor's order, twelve gun barrels fired simultaneously.</br>
</br>
The deafening sound of the cannons echoed in the tunnel, and the half-meter thick concrete wall collapsed and fell backwards.</br>
</br>
A hidden passage appeared behind the broken pieces of concrete blocks.</br>
</br>
With an ecstatic expression, Yegor smiled.</br>
</br>
Finally, I FOUND IT!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was brightly lit at the South Gate of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
After the four transport helicopters unloaded the power-armored soldiers, they immediately turned into gunships, using the heavy machine guns at its tail to fire at the dangerous species like Roshans and Throwers. They hovered around the edge of the battlefield.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the battlefield, NAC's armored forces bulldozed into the zombies, sent the packed zombies flying, flattened them under the tracks of Tiger IIs. The armored vehicles closely followed as they used the mounted machineguns to split the zombies into sections.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, after Han Junhua entered Pingan Street from the North Gate, she immediately took over the command of the defense area. She led the NAC soldiers onto the wall and took control of the second line of defense from the exhausted Pingan Street defenders.</br>
</br>
Then, she sent engineering robots to the construction site behind the second line of defense that replaced the builders of Pingan Street and took over the third line of defense construction with less than 50% completed.</br>
</br>
The survivors of Wanghai City were experts in dealing with the zombie floods.</br>
</br>
The zombies and mutants in Shangjing all concentrated in the subway, unlike Wanghai that radiated from the city center outwards. If Shangjing survivors' difficulty was easy, then the Wanghai survivors' difficulty was nightmare.</br>
</br>
Of the five thousand expeditionary forces, four thousand soldiers already entered Pingan Street, forming a stark contrast with the Pingan Street defenders with heavy casualties. NAC had an absolute advantage both in the quality and quantity of soldiers.</br>
</br>
Anyone could see that after tonight, the owner of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building would change hands.</br>
</br>
At this moment, below the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
More than a dozen Second Militia soldiers wearing Pan-Asia civil defense uniforms stood at the door, weapons loaded, and blocked anyone who attempted to enter the building.</br>
</br>
Those people included survivors attempting to leave the city, merchants and factor owners demanding an answer from the Survivors Alliance, and even their own that wished to report to the higher authorities.</br>
</br>
"Where is Leader Ding? What are they doing! Why haven't we seen them from the start?"</br>
</br>
"The South Gate can't hold on any longer! Open the North Gate and let us leave!"</br>
</br>
"Get your soldiers out of my factory! You robbers!"</br>
</br>
"Calm, calm down, we are also very anxious," Standing next to the soldiers, the mayor of Pingan Street with a bitter smile desperately tried to appease the survivors' emotions. However, it was futile.</br>
</br>
He was anxious. Now that Leader Ding and Manager Wan both disappeared. Could it be true that the officials of Shangjing Survivors all escaped from the tunnel?</br>
</br>
Just then, a team of power-armored soldiers pushed through the bustling crowd and walked in front of the militias.</br>
</br>
</br>
The militias on duty immediately stepped forward and stopped them.</br>
</br>
"Please stop, this is Survivors Alliance's forbidden zone—"</br>
</br>
"Move." Jiang Chen did not even look at him and said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Just then, several trucks drove into the small square in front of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, and soldiers with live ammunition jumped off the truck.</br>
</br>
Looking at the dozens of well-equipped soldiers and the power armors in front of them, the militia at the very front suddenly felt his scalp tingle. The mayor stepped forward and wished to negotiate. However, when Jiang Chen did not even want to open his helmet, the mayor could only turn his attention to Song Chenyu who stood behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu looked to the side and pretended not to see the mayor.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, if we remember correctly... we are allies?" The militia captain responsible for the defense went to the front and said to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Allies?" Jiang Chen laughed. "If Manager Wan can explain to me who the assassins that attacked me were, we can discuss the issue of allies at that time."</br>
</br>
The militia captain felt a clunk in his mind and he began sweating.</br>
</br>
Sent assassins to NAC's General? What was Wan Peng even thinking?!</br>
</br>
"Hmmm... Maybe we have some kind of misunderstanding?" The mayor said with a flattering smile, "I think Manager Wan is someone who understands the situation. How could he have done this?"</br>
</br>
"Misunderstanding?" Jiang Chen pulled up his holographic screen and pushed it to the mayor. "Do you recognize them?"</br>
</br>
It was a video.</br>
</br>
The ten Men in Black who were killed by Jiang Chen's guards were in the video.</br>
</br>
Sweat couldn't stop rolling down from the mayor's forehead. His thoughts turned quickly and he was just about to explain something to Jiang Chen. However, Jiang Chen obviously did not intend to give him an opportunity to do so.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter if you don't know. I will know when I ask Manager Wan."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to the soldiers behind him.</br>
</br>
The sound of the rifles being loaded changed everyone's expression. The survivors who were enjoying the scene began to move back. The dozens of militia soldiers who were in front of Jiang Chen were nervous and stared at their captain.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, if a fight really broke out, NAC would only be a minute away from walking over their bodies.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled at the militia captain, who had a stiff expression.</br>
</br>
"I will ask you again, move?"</br>
</br>
Although he said it in a negotiating tone, the minigun that began to rotate left no room for negotiation.</br>
</br>
The last force loyal to the Shangjing Survivors Alliance also chose to surrender.</br>
</br>
To be precise, this should actually be the second last. There was also another unit, the ace of Leader Ding, the power armor company, still loyal to their leader.</br>
</br>
A total of 100 P-series police power armors, after more than 20 years of continuous modification, had combat effective no inferior to the T-series power armor independently developed by Sixth Street. However, this force, like their leader, had disappeared.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen took control of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, NAC sent two hundred soldiers in. However, they searched the entire building upside down and did not find the whereabouts of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance officials.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan saluted in front of Jiang Chen and solemnly said.</br>
</br>
"Report, we did not find Ding Liwei, Wan Peng, and other officials."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
No one?</br>
</br>
Did they just disappear?</br>
</br>
"Every floor?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"We searched every floor, even the water tanks on the roof have been searched." Lu Fan shook his head. "Now the entire administrative staff of Pingan Street is under our control. However, so far, we have not gained any valuable information."</br>
</br>
"Only if we could use the Truth-telling Serum."</br>
</br>
Of course, it was just Jiang Chen's wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
In this world, unless it is a refugee from the slums, most survivors were injected with genetic vaccines. Even the least advanced E-class vaccines could strengthen the activity of neuronal cells, which offered resistance to the Truth-telling Serum.</br>
</br>
But then again, if the officials of the Shangjing Survivor Alliance really fled, or hid, they would not let these people know about their whereabouts. Even if everyone provided everything they knew, it would not lead them to Ding Liwei and Wan Peng.</br>
</br>
What to do?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's frown grew deeper.</br>
</br>
Just then, his sight fell on the camera on the wall.</br>
</br>
With a grin, an idea formed in his head.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1193"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1193: Follow The Hunter“s Path</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Where is he?"</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei frowned as he looked into the deep and dark tunnel.</br>
</br>
The trump card of the Second Militia, the renowned power armor company of Shangjing, stood behind him. The purpose of this unit built before the war was to maintain stability after the war. However, in terms of equipment configuration, it was based on the configuration of the Pan-Asia Army Infantry Regiment-level combat unit. Except for the lack of a support unit, the company was well equipped.</br>
</br>
The reason for this configuration was because experts from the Academy of Social Sciences determined that the war may last for twenty or even forty years until the end of the century. However, no one expected that the war of three years would have exhausted the last glimmer of hope of the civilized world.</br>
</br>
When they woke up, they were not faced with hungry refugees and violent separatists, but zombies and mutants. Equipped with advanced technologies from before the war, they swept the wasteland. Ding Liwei, with the aid of the power armor company, defeated the mutated humans force in Shangjing and facilitated the establishment of the Survivors Alliance.</br>
</br>
The wait was long, and when Ding Liwei began to feel impatient, a figure walked out from the dark tunnel.</br>
</br>
The moment the footsteps sounded, the rifles immediately aimed at the entrance.</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
When the searchlight was turned on to reveal the face, Ding Liwei's frown disappeared and he indicated to his subordinates to lower their weapons. Just as he was about to criticize why Wan Peng showed up so late, Wan Peng's poor state made him swallow his words.</br>
</br>
"You're finally... What happened to you? Where is Su Xiang?"</br>
</br>
"He can't come." Wan Peng wiped the blood from his mouth with his sleeve, and said with gloom, "We encountered some trouble on the way."</br>
</br>
His gray suit was completely ruined, and the left-hand sleeve was shredded into strips, and revealed the cuff of his white shirt. There were a few bruises on his face. From his unkept appearance, it was obvious that something terrible happened.</br>
</br>
"Russians?" Ding Liwei said with a stern look.</br>
</br>
"It's that idiot called Sura. Even till death, he wanted to press down Pan-Asia Cooperation's coffin." Wan Peng cursed, then spat out spit mixed with blood. "But we better hurry. As long as the Russians are not deaf, and they should have found out about the oddness of Line 27."</br>
</br>
"What about the card?"</br>
</br>
"On me." Wan Peng pointed at his chest.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei took a deep breath, looked back at his subordinates and made a gesture to his first officer, then he looked back at Wan Peng.</br>
</br>
"What are we waiting for?"</br>
</br>
Power armors took the lead, Wan Peng and Ding Liwei walked at the back of the team. There was no extra nonsense as the group continued to venture into the deep tunnel.</br>
</br>
The steel armors stepped on the concrete road, making loud crashing sounds and echoing in the empty tunnel.</br>
</br>
</br>
Soon they came to the end of the tunnel.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei raised his hand and everyone stopped.</br>
</br>
Right in front of them was a circular steel gate.</br>
</br>
Just like a huge gear, it was engraved at end of the tunnel, like a shield that guarded the last and biggest secret of Pan-Asia Cooperation.</br>
</br>
This secret should have been guarded for fifty years. According to its initial plan, it would reproduce the glory of Pan-Asia on this devastated land. However, with countless ill-intentions, the people who guarded it must unshackle its chains ahead of schedule.</br>
</br>
The two lines painted in white quietly engraved on the cold steel looked like the solemn and great dogma of the gods, carrying out the covenant of the Asian countries since the Cold War era.</br>
</br>
[Pan-Asia Cooperation, For the Glory of Our Ancestors]</br>
</br>
[Subway Line 0]</br>
</br>
Wan Peng stepped forward, took a deep breath and restrained the complex emotions in his heart. Then, he took out the dark green card from his pocket.</br>
</br>
However, when his hand touched the steel threshold, the tyrant felt a bit melodramatic.</br>
</br>
He looked back at Ding Liwei.</br>
</br>
"Are you ready?"</br>
</br>
"Do we have any other choice?" Ding Liwei grinned.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng nodded.</br>
</br>
"Makes sense."</br>
</br>
He pushed the card to the card slot on the gear.</br>
</br>
The earth trembled and the dust shook off the top of the tunnel.</br>
</br>
With a muffled and far-reaching bang, the gear slowly rotated. Like the wheel of history, it rolled the future into an unknown and destined direction...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Can you do it?" Jiang Chen squatted down next to Yao Yao and looked down at the string of characters flashing on the holographic screen, giving him an headache.</br>
</br>
"No problem! Leave it to Yao Yao!"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was sitting in the corner of Ding Liwei's office in the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building with a tablet in her hands. Her slender fingers were flying across the screen, and her clear pupils reflected lines and symbols unfitting of her age.</br>
</br>
From the moment when her hands touched the tablet, her soft and cute temperament disappeared. The petite body seemed to be possessed by the program and a savviness Jiang Chen had never seen before shone out of her eyes.</br>
</br>
They always said that men are attractive when they are serious. Could this also apply to women?</br>
</br>
Or, it's just the contrast...</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was seriously debating this notion due to boredom, Yao Yao pressed the last button. Her hands left the tablet as she leaned back against the wall. As she wiped off the sweat from her forehead, her lovely mouth showed a smile that spelled victory.</br>
</br>
"Done!"</br>
</br>
"Successful?! So fast!"</br>
</br>
"HUMPH, it's okay to be surprised," said Yao Yao, who raised her small chest, proud. She moved her fingers around before she pushed the holographic screen in front of Jiang Chen. "I got the security permission. The surveillance video is here... oh? Strange, why did the monitoring in the elevator go missing? Was it removed?"</br>
</br>
On the holographic screen, Wan Peng went into the elevator. With a look of astuteness, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"It seems that it's the elevator."</br>
</br>
The cameras of the entire building were in operation except for the camera in the elevator. Jiang Chen did not believe for a second that the elevator was fine.</br>
</br>
"I think so...wait, there are traces of intrusion in the security system," Yao Yao frowned. "The IP and device numbers are unknown. The intrusion time was one hour ago. Someone has entered the security system after getting security system permission, encrypted as a subsystem of 'conference room table and chair purchase record'."</br>
</br>
"You mean, someone invaded the security system of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building an hour ago?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"How is the technology of the other party?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Their ability should be comparable to mine." Yao Yao, with a serious expression, nodded. She then thoughtfully said, "But my hardware equipment should be better than his. After all, Lin Lin helped me upgrade it."</br>
</br>
If Greyhound heard that a girl who looked around 12-year-old said their ability was similar, perhaps he would suicide by hitting his head against a wall.</br>
</br>
But it made sense. Almost twenty years had passed since the start of the apocalypse. Other than survivors like Yao Yao without the need to worry about survival, who would spend time practicing their programming skills? It would make sense for the survivors that just woke up from hibernation, but for those that survived the Third World War, their professional knowledge had long disappeared.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter who intruded into the system," Jiang Chen said, "Is there a way to track where Wan Peng went?"</br>
</br>
"I was not able to before, but now I can," Yao Yao said, thrilled. Her fingers began flying on the tablet, "if we can't find footprints of the prey, then follow the footprints of the hunter. If the person that invaded the system has the same purpose as us, then we only need to track the clues left by him in the security system. We can definitely find something – FOUND IT!"</br>
</br>
Before she finished speaking, Yao Yao waved her fist in excitement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly peeked past her head and looked at the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"The correct use of the elevators in the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building! By using the specific search-through floor button, you can reach the negative twenty-first floor that does not exist! Then you'll find the emergency escape route of the Pan-Asia Cooperation officials..."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1194"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1194: The Last Place</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The elevator crossed the negative twentieth floor and headed deep down into the surface.</br>
</br>
Eight power armors were on the elevator as well as a girl carrying a tablet.</br>
</br>
Feeling that the elevator began to slow down, Jiang Chen looked behind him, unassured.</br>
</br>
"Follow me and don't run around, okay?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Yao Yao nodded nervously, but there was no fear in her eyes.</br>
</br>
After Yao Yao intruded the security system of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, she chased the previous intruder's footprints and took control of the elevator, then she deciphered the way to the negative twenty-first floor.</br>
</br>
The next steps were simple. Jiang Chen immediately ordered the power armor units to gather in the hall on the first floor of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building. Everyone was ready to go down the special passage directly beneath the building to track the whereabouts of the officials of the Survivors Alliance.</br>
</br>
Originally Jiang Chen planned to go down with a team.</br>
</br>
However, just as he boarded the elevator, Yao Yao raised her hand and courageously purposed to Jiang Chen to bring her along.</br>
</br>
At the beginning, Jiang Chen refused. However, under Yao Yao's insistence, he suddenly remembered what Lin Lin had said when he left, and he finally gave in.</br>
</br>
Just before going into the elevator, he had set rules with Yao Yao to ensure that she listened to him, otherwise he would make her go back up.</br>
</br>
The elevator stopped at the negative twenty-first floor. Jiang Chen raised his arm and gestured to the power armors behind him, then raised his weapon.</br>
</br>
The elevator door slowly opened, and the seven power armors behind him quickly entered the tunnel.</br>
</br>
However, the expected battle did not happen, and the dark tunnel was silent.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan and Jiang Chen exchanged eye contact, then Lu Fan brought the team downstairs. Just then, there was a repressed low-pitched roar from not far in the distance. In the pitch black darkness, there was an eerie sight full of bloodthirst.</br>
</br>
"Uhhh…"</br>
</br>
A flashlight was turned on, and zombies were standing next to the platform as they stared blankly at the light. There was a giant hole beside the wall of the small platform.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, these zombies entered through that hole.</br>
</br>
Looking at the zombies scattered around, Yao Yao turned pale and moved closer to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted Yao Yao's hand to comfort her as he examined the giant hole in the tunnel, he frowned.</br>
</br>
"It should be the Russians." Lu Fan said in the communication channel. "There is the smell of gunpowder in the air. They should have just blew this place up."</br>
</br>
"So, Line 27 is through this hole?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"That is what the map shows. We are now right beside Line 27," Lu Fan looked at the information on the holographic screen inside his helmet, "They were one step ahead of us."</br>
</br>
Obviously, after the Shangjing Survivors Alliance, the Russians conducted a carpet search of Line 27 and also discovered this special passage in which they conducted a "demolition".</br>
</br>
</br>
These zombies should have wondered here from Line 35 or other subway lines connected to Line 27. Fortunately, there were no dangerous species. They should be able to pass through.</br>
</br>
What worried Jiang Chen the most was how far Ding Liwei and CCCP went. If this was a race, then NAC was already falling behind.</br>
</br>
"Start Sliding Mode," Jiang Chen looked at the zombies below the stairs, "let's rush through this place."</br>
</br>
When Lu Fan heard Jiang Chen's words, it took him some time to process before he interjected.</br>
</br>
"General, I suggest we go together after the deployment of the power armor units. If we run into the Russians..."</br>
</br>
"We can't wait any longer." Jiang Chen kneeled down, and in the unexpected and repressed shout of Yao Yao, he princess lifted her. "I would rather run into a group of Russians with tanks than a group of Russians with Gundams."</br>
</br>
What are Gundams?</br>
</br>
Lu Fan took a moment to process.</br>
</br>
The General seemed to have said something inexplicable again.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan shook his head and threw his doubts to the back of his head.</br>
</br>
He already brought forward his opinions. If the general insisted on leaving now, he could only follow his order. As the Guards' Captain, following orders was his first task, even if he may not think it was a good idea...</br>
</br>
"This will feel bumpy, can you just resist for a moment?" Looking at the girl in his arms, Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Blinking her big eyes, Yao Yao nervously hid her hands in front of her chest before she nodded with certainty.</br>
</br>
"It's best to close your eyes if you can."</br>
</br>
Looking at Yao Yao obediently closing her eyes, Jiang Chen then looked at the zombies under the stairs and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
While the decision may lack strategic thinking, he had his own concerns.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen was not sure if Gundams really existed in the treasure of the Pan-Asia Cooperation, weapons of some kind would most likely be there. After all, the project was approved during the war preparation phase. Even considering the history of that time period, it was not difficult to imagine the things hidden inside.</br>
</br>
The sliding wheels popped out of the power armor's foot, and the vortex engines behind the power armor started to ignite.</br>
</br>
"Take off!"</br>
</br>
"Roger that!"</br>
</br>
Seven power armors circled Jiang Chen and created an arrow formation as they rushed down the stairs.</br>
</br>
Already attracted by the flashlight, the zombies now heard the roar of the engines and began to focus to their direction. In the pairs of black pupils, a crimson red color was slowly approaching.</br>
</br>
"ROAR!"</br>
</br>
The fearless zombies began to rush at the sliding power armors. They extended their thin arms at the power armor leading the formation. But quickly, they realized the foolishness of their decision.</br>
</br>
The zombies in front of Lu Fan were directly sent into the air. The power armors on the side unleashed bullets, suppressing the zombies rushing forward.</br>
</br>
The gusting airflow sent Yao Yao's hair flying as she buried her face against Jiang Chen's chest. The gunshots rang in her ear and made her close her eyes tightly...</br>
</br>
After what felt like a century, the gunshots gradually stopped, and the airflow began to slow down. Yao Yao finally opened her eyes.</br>
</br>
"You're safe." Gently patting Yao Yao's back, Jiang Chen looked at the long eyelashes that were stuck together and a smile formed on his face. He then looked at the zombies that were left behind and felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Switching to the private channel, Jiang Chen ordered Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"Get the people above to send a few engineer soldiers down to plug the hole."</br>
</br>
If these zombies were allowed to spread from Line 27, then the "Safety Passage" would not longer be safe.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Lu Fan responded with sharpness.</br>
</br>
Their journey did not have more twists and turns.</br>
</br>
Two power armors accelerated and led in the front, maintaining a high-speed sliding state. The group accelerated in the direction of Line 2.</br>
</br>
Looking at the looming light source in front, Jiang Chen used his spare hand to rub Yao Yao's hair.</br>
</br>
"Are you feeling okay?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Yao Yao carefully moved her face away from Jiang Chen's chest. Yao Yao then looked at the zombies that had long disappeared and said with lingering anxiousness, "That was scary."</br>
</br>
"I told you you should have stayed above ground. Should I send you back?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao shook her head and said seriously, "Sister Lin said to me when we called yesterday that if you are going to find Line 0, I need to be with you."</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin also knows about Line 0?" Jiang Chen wondered, "Why didn't she tell me before I came here?"</br>
</br>
"Sister Lin said that she was not sure whether it was a rumor or the real thing. Her understanding of Eden Technology is just the tip of the iceberg. But she also said that if Line 0 really exists, my ability will definitely help you." Yao Yao whispered as she leaned on Jiang Chen's chest.</br>
</br>
Is that so?</br>
</br>
He fixed his gaze on the girl in his arms and wondered if she could really help him, but more than that, he was concerned about her safety.</br>
</br>
Of course, Lin Lin may also be right. If the pre-war civilization built this, some things may not be solved by muscles alone. Yao Yao's computer skills may be his advantage.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought of this, the two power armors leading the team gradually slowed down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned, switched to the private communication channel and asked Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
Before Lu Fan could respond, the two power armors leading the way reported in the public channel.</br>
</br>
"General, someone is lying on the side of the tunnel..."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1195"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1195: The Train and Tanks</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The six power armors that trailed them slowed down and moved toward the source of light.</br>
</br>
There was a four-train-long maglev train in the middle of the track that had been abandoned there for some unknown reason.</br>
</br>
Not far from the maglev train, a man covered in blood was lying against the wall of the tunnel.</br>
</br>
He was not in the best state; his left arm seemed to be dislocated or broken. There was a pool of metal-like liquid beside his hand. Under the flashlight, it reflected a silver shine.</br>
</br>
The man noticed the gun pointed at him and responded with a grin before coughing out some blood. He used his right hand to help himself sit upright.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, oh? Another group of tomb thieves?"</br>
</br>
"Tomb thieves?" Jiang Chen snorted at the call, put Yao Yao gently on the ground, and walked over to him with a rifle.</br>
</br>
"General... This person is a bit weird," Lu Fan reminded.</br>
</br>
"I know, it's strange if he is not weird." Jiang Chen waved his hand and motioned him to not worry. He walked over to the man and said, "We meet again, Mr. Sura... or should I call you Old Luo?"</br>
</br>
Old Luo's eyes brightened for a second.</br>
</br>
"You're Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Back in "Hell's Courier", Old Luo saw through his camouflage, and Jiang Chen was not surprised that Old Luo recognized his identity.</br>
</br>
As the former intelligence personnel of Pan-Asia Cooperation, it would be odd if he did not have any special abilities.</br>
</br>
Yes, Jiang Chen suspected the man named Old Luo was the boss of Hell's Courier. The so-called "Strawman" was just one of the names he used before.</br>
</br>
"Cough, are you really Jiang Chen? I mean, you actually came down?" Old Luo looked so surprised that he even forgot his injuries and sat up straight. He gazed at Jiang Chen, full of curiosity, "Do you know what's ahead?"</br>
</br>
"I will know soon, but let's not talk about this now. I have something else to ask you," With a short pause, Jiang Chen looked at him and said, "I have been pondering for the last while, that day at the hotel was it you that tried to infiltrate my wrist-mounted computer."</br>
</br>
"Although not precisely true, you can interpret it as something I had done," Old Luo said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Then I will consider that you did it." With Old Luo's indifferent attitude, Jiang Chen was not angry. Instead, he took out a card from his pocket and shook it in front of him. "So, you auctioned this card?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Old Luo said calmly.</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Because I needed you to stop the Russians. However, the plan is always full of variables," Old Luo, who laughed at himself, said as he leaned his head against the wall. "I just didn't expect Wan Peng would have something hidden up his sleeves."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined him from head to toe.</br>
</br>
He had already guessed how he was injured.</br>
</br>
"Russians have gone to that side. Are you not going to hurry and chase them?" Seeing Jiang Chen was not speaking, Old Luo laughed, "By the way, remind you, there are twelve tanks waiting for you. You'd better bring more people."</br>
</br>
</br>
Then he shook his head again and laughed at a self-deprecating manner .</br>
</br>
"Haha, but once you bring enough people, this doesn't concern you anymore."</br>
</br>
"There is something I have never thought through," Jiang Chen focused on Old Luo lying against the wall and seemed to be muttering to himself thoughtfully, "If you're trying to obtain the secret of Line 0, your action doesn't seem to make sense. I am very curious, what do you want?"</br>
</br>
"What do I want? Hehe." Old Luo shook his head. "If I tell you, would you wait for fifty years before you open Line 0?"</br>
</br>
"Fifty years is too long." Jiang Chen shook his head and said emotionlessly, "And you don't have the chips to negotiate with me."</br>
</br>
"That's also true." Old Luo closed his eyes and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
Old Luo was seriously injured and he did not have much time left. But there was not the slightest fear for death, just the allegiance to the end of his mission.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew very well that the person who showed this kind of expression obviously did not intend to ask for help.</br>
</br>
But then again, for someone that wished to use him, even if he asked for help, Jiang Chen never planned to save him.</br>
</br>
Let him rot here.</br>
</br>
Rot with the coffin of Pan-Asia Cooperation together...</br>
</br>
"What should we do?" Lu Fan went to Jiang Chen, with seriously. "If he is telling the truth, then in the front—"</br>
</br>
"He is telling the truth," with his brows twisted together, Jiang Chen thought for a moment and then said, "We have to gamble."</br>
</br>
"Gamble?" Lu Fan said.</br>
</br>
Without explaining to Lu Fan, Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Can you make the train move again?"</br>
</br>
"Let me try."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao agilely jumped into the maglev train and took out the tablet from behind her back.</br>
</br>
With her back bent, she searched underneath the seats before quickly finding an interface for connection. She then pulled out a cord and attached the tablet to the train.</br>
</br>
Then Yao Yao sat on the floor as she began to work with the tablet.</br>
</br>
Dazzling code flashed through the holographic screen like countless spells.</br>
</br>
In just ten minutes, everyone, including Old Luo without any desire to live, look astonished. The train previous locked by the virus in the smoke detector system started to move again!</br>
</br>
"Get on."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand at Lu Fan and boarded the train with the power armors.</br>
</br>
However, after boarding the train, he realized another very serious issue.</br>
</br>
"Who knows how to drive?"</br>
</br>
The public channel was silent, and Lu Fan and the guards' expression all looked awkward.</br>
</br>
Obviously, no one learned how to operate this thing.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Yao Yao raised his hand.</br>
</br>
"I have already activated smart driving mode. We don't need someone to move this thing."</br>
</br>
The smug look on her face was the joy of finally helping her beloved big brother.</br>
</br>
After the magnetic rail was charged, the train floated up by half an inch and began to accelerate.</br>
</br>
"Can you turn off the lights?"</br>
</br>
"No problem." Yao Yao's fingers tapped on the tablet, and all the light sources on the train were extinguished.</br>
</br>
The train continued to accelerate.</br>
</br>
"General, there are CCCP tanks in front..."</br>
</br>
"I know."</br>
</br>
"Then..."</br>
</br>
"Did I not say it?" Jiang Chen looked at Lu Fan with a hint of lunacy in his eyes, "It's time to gamble."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The CCCP tanks made squeaking sound as they moved forward steadily through the tunnel leading to Line 0.</br>
</br>
On the tank, Yegor frowned.</br>
</br>
Just now, he began to feel the wind blowing from behind him.</br>
</br>
"Wha's that sound?" Sminov looked behind his back and muttered to himself. "Is it that train just now?"</br>
</br>
Train?</br>
</br>
Yegor's pupils suddenly shrank, and his fist slammed on the top of the tank and yelled into the headset.</br>
</br>
"Park! Turn the turret and aim at that train!"</br>
</br>
Train? Where is the train?</br>
</br>
Responding to this inexplicable command, the gunners were only stunned for a second before they quickly reacted. They turned the turrets and aimed behind them—</br>
</br>
However, their reaction was still a beat too slow.</br>
</br>
Cruising on the magnetic levitation track at a speed close to the speed of sound, the maglev train whizzed past, leaving only a mirage to the CCCP tanks. Just as they turned the turrets, the maglev train previously stalled was already in front of them.</br>
</br>
Yegor growled.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
"BOOM!"</br>
</br>
Twelve explosions ensued.</br>
</br>
At the same time, everyone in the train was clenching on!</br>
</br>
With several loud bangs, the orange-yellow trajectories just missed the train and exploded against the wall in the tunnel.</br>
</br>
These loud noises were stretched by the incredible speed of the train and were almost instantly left behind along with the cloud of dust from the explosions.</br>
</br>
The short train was like a fly. Hitting a fly with a tank in the dark was nearly an impossible task without measurements in advance.</br>
</br>
Although they escaped, Jiang Chen did not dare to let his guard down for a moment. He tightly held Yao Yao while docking down underneath the seats.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as the turrets fired, bullets hit the train, leaving a series of cracks on the window.</br>
</br>
The train already flew by, and the machine gunners on the tanks stopped their pointless shooting.</br>
</br>
Yegor revealed a gloomy expression as he fixated on the direction where the train had disappeared, .</br>
</br>
His fist slammed against the tank as he shouted.</br>
</br>
"Everyone, FULL THORTTLE!"</br>
</br>
"ROGER!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1196: The Terminal Station of Line 0</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"So, the legendary Subway Line 0 is just an underground city?"</br>
</br>
As he stepped onto the concrete road covered by dust, Ding Liwei used the light scattered down from the skydome while he scanned through the dark streets.</br>
</br>
Surprise was the emotion in his eyes, but behind the surprise, there was more disappointment in his emotion.</br>
</br>
He was originally looking forward to a particular weapon hidden here, at least one powerful enough that it could get rid of CCCP and NAC.</br>
</br>
But so far, disregarding any weapons, it was just towering high-rise buildings and empty streets.</br>
</br>
This kind of scene was too common in the wasteland. If he must state the difference between the Shangjing above ground, then it must be the lack of zombies, mutants, and ugly nuclear craters.</br>
</br>
No, certainly not just these...</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's gaze carefully searched between the buildings on both sides of the street, for fear of missing a trace of detail.</br>
</br>
"Or a city-sized fallout shelter. We just don't know why there's no one in this fallout shelter." Wan Peng's eyebrows were also written with disappointment. His looked away from the faded billboards as he muttered to himself, "Something must be wrong."</br>
</br>
More than one hundred P-series police power armors walked down the streets, and there were no other sounds.</br>
</br>
High-rise buildings stood side by side, a prosperous scene, but at the moment they felt as depressing as tombstones, without the slightest sign of vitality. A dozen-kilometer-long maglev track spanned from above and divided the entire city into two.</br>
</br>
Although no one lived here, it was indeed a city.</br>
</br>
It was true no matter how you looked at the situation.</br>
</br>
As for why Pan-Asia Cooperation decided to build such a city below Shangjing and why it had to be sealed for 50 years, no one knew. Or at least the person that knew was no longer on the planet...</br>
</br>
If they did not come down from "above", just standing here, it did not feel like the city was a kilometer under the surface.</br>
</br>
The city's distant area was covered by a thick layer of gray which caused the entire city to be surrounded by what looked like morning mist. Behind the mist, there seemed to be some sort of light source; a faint gleam that pierced through the mist and was sprinkled on to the streets.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that although located deep underground, the light was surprisingly sufficient, similar to cloudy days on the surface</br>
</br>
The only flaw was that the distant grey gave off a depressing feeling.</br>
</br>
"If I found this 'heaven' fifteen years ago, why build a wall? I would have just directly placed Pingan Street here. That would have saved us so much trouble." Wan Peng's eyes were fixated on the dead street as he grunted and said in a self-deprecating manner.</br>
</br>
"It's not too late. Do you want to pick a place to stay in?" Ding Liwei looked at him and said, grinning.</br>
</br>
"I'll pass. I was just joking."</br>
</br>
</br>
Although the place did not have any zombies or mutants, and without the need to worry about excessive radiation that would lead to growing another hand, it would not be long before people go insane in this kind of environment.</br>
</br>
Just then, noises were heard in the distance.</br>
</br>
It was not loud, but in this quiet city, it was conspicuous.</br>
</br>
Everyone stopped and looked at the sky.</br>
</br>
"What is that sound?" Ding Liwei frowned, opened the magnifying function on the eyepiece of the helmet, and fixed his eyes on the magnetic levitation track that spanned the city. Then, doubt appeared in his eyes. "That is not our train?"</br>
</br>
"Obviously." Wan Peng also noticed the anomaly in the sky and looked up at the track. "It seems that after I abandoned the train, someone repaired it."</br>
</br>
"Who is in the car?"</br>
</br>
"Not our people," Wan Peng shrugged and said.</br>
</br>
That was enough information.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei did not speak, but gestured to the soldiers behind him and then pointed to the magnetic levitation track.</br>
</br>
Four power armors walked up and took out rocket launchers, locked on the magnetic leviathan track in the air, and pulled the trigger simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Four white smoke trails formed from the launchers as they locked in on different locations, seconds later, four rockets flew directly towards the magnetic levitation track.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The entrance to Line 0 was already open.</br>
</br>
The train did not stop at all and whizzed past the gear-shaped gate.</br>
</br>
After passing through the hole, the road narrowed abruptly, and the train continued in an unknown direction.</br>
</br>
Still pondering on how much longer the ride would take, a shimmer of light appeared in front of them.</br>
</br>
The train darted out of the dark tunnel, new scenery expanded before them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gradually became shocked when he looked down through the window of the train.</br>
</br>
Just below the train was a futuristic-looking city!</br>
</br>
Towering high-rise buildings stood below and straight streets neatly organized the city. Jiang Chen made a rough estimate that the underground city was at least the size of a district in Shangjing. On the conservative side, it could fit at least one million people.</br>
</br>
The train quietly moved along the track suspended in the air.</br>
</br>
It took a while for Jiang Chen to absorb the astonishment in his mind. He exclaimed while looking out the window.</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect the end of Line 0 would be a city."</br>
</br>
"Yeah," Lu Fan said, while he also shared Jiang Chen's shocked emotion.</br>
</br>
"Right, where will this train take us?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Ah? Let me see..." Yao Yao's fingers quickly tapped on the tablet a few times, took a few glances at the holographic screen, and nodded seriously. "It should be in front of us soon. We will arrive at the terminal within ten kilometers. There is an elevator there, we can go—"</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Without the slightest sign, the train moving at high speed seemed to be hit from the side as everything in the train was tossed to the other side.</br>
</br>
Four explosions and four missiles hit the track one after another!</br>
</br>
In the deafening screeching sound, the track suspending in the air swayed like noodles, and the steel cables hanging from the track broke apart one after another. Soon, the track that lost its load-bearing structure began to fall.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gritted his teeth as he was tossed to the other side. He grabbed Yao Yao, who was flying in the air, in the heat of the moment.</br>
</br>
The train completely lost its power. Gliding down the inclined track, everything on the track was in a weightless state. In order to grab Yao Yao, Jiang Chen lost his balance during a downward turn of the train and was thrown to the rear, crashing through rows of seats and rolling from the front of the train to the back.</br>
</br>
Finally, the train completely left the track and nose-dived into the city.</br>
</br>
"JUMP! JUMP!"</br>
</br>
In the communication channel, Jiang Chen shouted. He used his back to block the incoming debris. Then holding Yao Yao with his left hand, he used his right hand to smash against the door, creating a dent in the aluminum door.</br>
</br>
Without stopping, Jiang Chen gritted his teeth, adjusted his posture, and supported the ceiling with his right hand. He looked at the already deformed door and stepped on it with all his force.</br>
</br>
CLANK!</br>
</br>
It was effective. The door flew out and disappeared quickly. The violent airflow poured in, scratching the steel armor.</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, Jiang Chen hugged Yao Yao in his arms and jumped out of the train. Along with the debris, they fell toward the city of high-rises...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1197: Thank You For Using Eden Technology</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The steel tracks broke one after another, and the suspending cables continued to collapse. The steel fragments mixed with concrete debris hailed down from the air.</br>
</br>
Instead of immediately turning on the vortex engine, Jiang Chen kept gliding down, using the debris as cover to move toward the edge of the city.</br>
</br>
While gliding, his eyes were locked on the ground, searching for any potential incoming missiles.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, no missiles headed his way.</br>
</br>
When the altitude dropped to 500 meters, Jiang Chen took a deep breath, and the vortex engines ignited with a full thrust to halt the fall.</br>
</br>
"BOOM!"</br>
</br>
Both feet planted deep into the ground, and the impact wave hitting the ground blew dust and gravel a dozen meters away, formed cracks along the surface of the road.</br>
</br>
When he looked down at Yao Yao, he was relieved.</br>
</br>
The lovely face was obviously startled, but fortunately, she was not hit by flying debris.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the mask on the helmet and looked at Yao Yao, "Are you okay?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's soul seemed to have returned to her body. Lying in Jiang Chen's arms, she looked into his concerned eyes and nodded firmly.</br>
</br>
"I'm good."</br>
</br>
"Phew," looking at the girl's courageous expression, he smiled softly. Then he looked at the other side of the street. He took a deep breath before his seriousness returned. "It's not safe here, we have to get out of here as soon as possible. You have to hang on for just a while longer."</br>
</br>
Although he was not attacked when he fell, he was not sure whether or not Ding Liwei's people saw him. If they were on their way to his landing spot, every second they stayed where they were would increase the dangerousness of the situation.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Yao Yao tightly grabbed onto the nylon buckle on the power armor, then she pressed her face on Jiang Chen's chest and closed her eyes. Her gentle voice had a hint of tenacity, "Yao Yao is prepared!"</br>
</br>
"Hold on tight."</br>
</br>
The sliding wheels popped out and the vortex engines reignited its blue flames, pushing the power armor toward the other side of the street.</br>
</br>
While maintaining high-speed movement, Jiang Chen opened the communication channel and established contact with Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"...Where are you?"</br>
</br>
"We have three people here, in... in a building? DAMMIT! Someone is nearby..."</br>
</br>
There were chaotic gunshots on the other side, occasionally accompanied by one or two explosions and the sound of broken glass.</br>
</br>
Obviously, Lu Fan encountered Ding Liwei's force, and there was no doubt it was the Second Militia's power armor company!</br>
</br>
According to the information provided by Song Chenyu, the power armor company was made up of a full hundred people...</br>
</br>
"Their people... there are too many power armors!"</br>
</br>
"Don't directly engage with them! Can you retreat?" Jiang Chen said immediately.</br>
</br>
"We should be able to retreat. The P-series has one less set of vortex engines! Where should we reconvene?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Where should we reconvene?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen just wanted to report a position but realized that he did not have a map here.</br>
</br>
"...just pick a direction first. I will provide a gathering place immediately!"</br>
</br>
"Just pick a direction?! O…kay!"</br>
</br>
As soon as the communication ended, Jiang Chen was about to release the reconnaissance drone, but a series of red dots flashed on the radar. These red dots were separated into three groups, from three directions, they surrounded him, blocking all directions of escape.</br>
</br>
The enemy had already discovered him.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!" He cursed in a whisper.</br>
</br>
Immediately, he stopped the gliding momentum of the wheels and turned a corner at a forty-five degrees angle. He rushed straight up the stairs in front of an office building and smashed through a locked front door. He then retrieved the wheels before running upstairs.</br>
</br>
Stopped at the top floor, Jiang Chen picked an office and broke through the door.</br>
</br>
"Wait for me here, I'll be back soon."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left Yao Yao in the office. He looked at her eyes, and after leaving some serious instructions, he walked out.</br>
</br>
In the hallway outside the office, Jiang Chen turned on the life signal detection radar, and his eyes locked on the series of red dots.</br>
</br>
Based on the flashing red dots, at least 20 power armors were in the building. There were four or more located in each of the four directions of the office building.</br>
</br>
The equipment of both sides was all the best available in the 22nd century. Once an enemy entered the vicinity, they were all each other's hunters and prey. It was impossible to escape unless Jiang Chen was familiar with the terrain.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, in a battle happening on an entirely foreign battlefield, both the hunter and the prey, were completely clueless. It was already difficult not to get lost, let alone escape the pursuant.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recognized the situation and decided not to run</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, it would be almost impossible to escape the pursuit of a group of power armors while holding a person.</br>
</br>
It was better to get rid of the troubles while no one was around!</br>
</br>
"If you really miss me, let me make your dream come true."</br>
</br>
With a murderous vibe, Jiang Chen swung his right hand and tossed out two drone hives from the storage dimension. Dozens of Hummingbirds emerged from the drone hives and formed several attack formations in the air. The muzzles underneath the drones exuded a deadly reflection.</br>
</br>
Then, four Reptile drones and four Python drones were also placed into the battlefield, and together with the Hummingbird drone attack groups, they rushed toward the floor below.</br>
</br>
In the modern world, these drones would be enough for him to sweep the victory.</br>
</br>
But in the apocalypse full of technology, it would be too arrogant to think these drones could eliminate a group of power armors.</br>
</br>
But with a few nuclear grenades, a few plasma bombs, he certainly could stand a fighting chance...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
What to do?</br>
</br>
Being left in the office, Yao Yao looked around anxiously.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen did not say anything to her, she had already vaguely guessed that the Second Militia was after them. And the reason why he decided to stop running and enter this building was most likely because of her.</br>
</br>
As soon as Yao Yao thought that she had become his burden, tears quickly began to roll down her face.</br>
</br>
I came… came to help him, but...</br>
</br>
Using her sleeves to wipe her teary eyes, Yao Yao bit her lower lip and began to search the office she was in.</br>
</br>
Just then, her eyes suddenly lit up.</br>
</br>
Near the wall, she found an interface of the data line.</br>
</br>
Sitting next to the desk, Yao Yao quickly took out her tablet and placed it in her lap. She pulled the dusty data cable off the desk and attached it to her tablet.</br>
</br>
Looking at the line [Connection Successful] on the screen, the little girl shook her fist in excitement.</br>
</br>
It works!</br>
</br>
Although she did not know if she could help, she must try!</br>
</br>
As her fingers began tapping at lightning speed and lines of codes started to flood the holographic screen, muffled explosions started ringing in her ears. Soon sweat began to form on her forehead as she desperately tried to calm her nervous heartbeat.</br>
</br>
[Data transfer is complete, acquiring permission...]</br>
</br>
Faster!</br>
</br>
Her little fist clenched tightly as she looked at the progress bar on the holographic screen and began praying.</br>
</br>
Finally, there was the melodious sound.</br>
</br>
An instant look of joy reflected through her lovely big eyes but it was quickly replaced by shock.</br>
</br>
The line of words that appeared on the screen was...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1198: The Encounter Battle Inside The Tunnel</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The elevator doors opened and a row of NAC soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons marched out. Almost instantly, the elevator door closed as soon as the last soldier's heel stepped out. Then, the elevator moved back to the negative twentieth floor.</br>
</br>
Just like this, the elevator moved between the negative twentieth and the negative twenty-first floor. In just half an hour, NAC deployed 100 power armors, 500 soldiers, and 40 engineer soldiers to the tunnel under the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
Under the firepower of the power armors, the zombies wandering at the station were quickly eradicated. The engineering soldiers at the rear brought pieces of machinery forward and began to repair the concrete wall.</br>
</br>
As the bayonet was pulled out from the head of a Night Demon, Zhang Zhuo pressed the headset on the helmet and reported it to the ground command center.</br>
</br>
"...The zombies in the subway station have been cleared... Yes, dangerous species have been spotted, and we're not ruling out that more dangerous species are moving to the area."</br>
</br>
"Immediately repair the tunnel," Han Junhua ordered. "Also, mobilize the power armors immediately. You must catch up to the general in the shortest possible time."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
After the communication ended, Zhang Zhuo gestured to his vice-captain behind him. After the vice-captain jogged to him, he ordered.</br>
</br>
"I'm delegating to you the task of building the defense line. I will bring the force to support the general."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The vice-captain saluted.</br>
</br>
"Be meticulous, this is a direct order from the chief of staff! You must make no mistakes!" He patted his subordinate on the shoulder and reminded one last time. He then handed over the authority of the infantry to the vice-captain, turned around and walked toward the assembled power armors.</br>
</br>
All the preparations were complete. Zhang Zhuo was prepared to order the force to advance into the deep tunnel, but from the direction of Line 27, some tremors shook the earth.</br>
</br>
"What's that sound?" Zhang Zhuo frowned as he looked toward the direction of Line 27.</br>
</br>
His first officer was also confused as he pinpointed the direction.</br>
</br>
"Judging by the sound, it doesn't sound like zombies... I will send someone to take a look."</br>
</br>
The first officer ordered into his headset.</br>
</br>
Soon, two scouts were sent out and they jogged in the direction of Line 27.</br>
</br>
However, just after crossing the broken concrete wall, the two scouts stopped. Fear was seen from the reflection inside their tactical helmet...</br>
</br>
Without the time to even say a word, the roar of the explosion filled the tunnel!</br>
</br>
With a loud explosion, the two scouts were turned into pieces in the raging shrapnel...</br>
</br>
Zhang Zhuo's pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>
A dreadful thought suddenly appeared in his mind.</br>
</br>
It's the CCCP tanks!</br>
</br>
Without time to hesitate, Zhang Zhuo decisively shouted in the communication channel.</br>
</br>
</br>
"TAKE COVER! PREPARE TO FIRE!"</br>
</br>
He didn't need to remind the team. Immediately when the explosion happened, the engineer soldiers abandoned the pieces of machinery in their hands and retreated to the back. At the same time, the soldiers who were resting immediately began seeking cover.</br>
</br>
The power armors that had been assembled also scattered around, leaning against the concrete bunker inside and outside the station.</br>
</br>
Zhang Zhuo glanced at the hole in the tunnel. He pulled out two burning rods from the waist of the power armor and threw them toward the broken wall.</br>
</br>
The orange-red flame illuminated the dark battlefield.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, a tank painted with snow camouflage drove across the broken concrete wall. Without the slightest omen, the menacing muzzle fired at the NAC soldiers.</br>
</br>
"BOOM!"</br>
</br>
A high-explosive round fired not far from Zhang Zhuo and the flying shrapnel scratched against the power armor, making a screeching sound. Fortunately, the shot was fired aimlessly, causing no casualties.</br>
</br>
Through the cover provided by the shot, the soldiers wearing winter clothes rushed out from the rear of the tank.</br>
</br>
Shouting "For Mother Russia", the soldiers fearlessly rushed towards the NAC.</br>
</br>
"OPEN FIRE!"</br>
</br>
In the deafening roar, Zhang Zhuo raised his tactical rifle and unleashed bullets first.</br>
</br>
Rifles were placed onto the bunker one after the other as bullets began to fire at the charging Russian soldiers.</br>
</br>
The sound of the bullets hitting the tank rang throughout the tunnel and the soldiers rushing out from behind the tank were also shot, falling one after another. Their blood splashed across the battlefield and dyed their snow camouflage paint bright red...</br>
</br>
Soaring bullets flew just above their heads as the NAC soldiers leaned against the concrete bunker and reloaded. Then, they continued to aim at the soldiers flooding out from the tank.</br>
</br>
Looking at the corpses that fell one after another in pools of blood, and the ones continuing to advance, seemingly unafraid of death, his scalp felt numb as he cursed.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, are these Russians trying to reincarnate?"</br>
</br>
"I suspect these are fake Russians..."</br>
</br>
The soldier who was next to him felt something was off, but he could not pinpoint the abnormality.</br>
</br>
The battle was in a stalemate.</br>
</br>
With CCCP soldiers charging relentlessly, they eventually ripped a hole in NAC's firepower and established a foothold north of the subway station.</br>
</br>
The first tank already rolled into the subway station, and the second tank ensued.</br>
</br>
Then, the soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons began to join the CCCP front. These soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons were far superior to those of the "Kamikaze soldiers" in both accuracy and firepower.</br>
</br>
Obviously, these soldiers were the core strength of CCCP.</br>
</br>
The NAC, which possessed a terrain advantage, was starting to lose its grip on the battle.</br>
</br>
But the good days of the Russians were about to end.</br>
</br>
When Han Junhua sent the forces down, she certainly considered the possibility of encountering CCCP tanks. After all, the team that Jiang Chen encountered was obviously not the full force of the CCCP. Precisely because of this, not only was cement used for wall building sent down, but also the Scorpion Anti-armor RPG!</br>
</br>
When the second tank bulldozed through the broken wall, the Scorpion RPG finally arrived.</br>
</br>
The soldiers behind cover set aside their rifles as they accepted the RPGs from the comrades in the rear. They put the rocket launchers on the shoulder, unlocked the safety, and locked onto the tank beside the wall.</br>
</br>
"Go to hell!"</br>
</br>
With a repressed, low-pitched, roar, the Scorpion RPG dragged an orange-colored tail flame and smashed directly onto the surface of the tank...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"...CCCP armored forces appeared in the tunnel, we're under attack! I REPEAT! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!"</br>
</br>
In the ground command center, Han Junhua expressionlessly nodded after she listened to Zhang Zhuo's report in front of the map. Her emotion did not waver by the slightest.</br>
</br>
"Got it."</br>
</br>
Ending the communication, Han Junhua looked up to the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
What emerged in front of her was the three-dimensional composition blueprint of a CCCP tank.</br>
</br>
The Polar Bear KV-9 tank was built with a high-density alloy composite steel with a strength similar to Grade-A Steel in PAC standard. The main gun was either 58mm or 75mm-calibre. Based on the length of the barrel, the KV-9 was either the support type or the attack type.</br>
</br>
The heavy armor had almost no weakness. Even the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon could not stall the tank. Even without the annoying Wanderer's Tank Meissner effect armor, it was still a tough opponent.</br>
</br>
Of course, there were certainly ways to deal with this type of tank.</br>
</br>
It was not without reason the KV-9 was dispatched to Uelen. Because of the extra-thick armor, the overly compact design for increased maneuverability resulted in a poor tank cooling system, and the tank crew wass almost sitting directly on the engine.</br>
</br>
A few simple incendiary bombs may be more effective than Scorpion rockets.</br>
</br>
Just two minutes ago, she had already issued an order to the expeditionary army. A fully armed "incendiary" unit was already sent to the minus 20th floor.</br>
</br>
Turning off the hologram, Han Junhua's eyes locked on the map on the command desk.</br>
</br>
Fixing her sight on Line 2, she whispered in her heart.</br>
</br>
Please make it...</br>
</br>
For some unknown reason, her cold heart inexplicably trembled.</br>
</br>
She pressed her hand against her chest and frowned.</br>
</br>
However, just as she wanted to reflect on what she was feeling, the feeling seemed to have slipped away like sand through her fingers. It was as if she never felt it...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1199: Power of The Nuclear Grenade!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"BOOM!"</br>
</br>
A face-sized hole formed as the shell penetrated through the cement wall.</br>
</br>
Two grenades exploded in a narrow corridor.</br>
</br>
The five police power armors that rushed into the stairs were caught off guard by the sudden attack.</br>
</br>
The tumbling heatwave smashed the flower pot, sending wood chips, mud, and shrapnel flying, leaving countless scratch marks against the steel armor.</br>
</br>
However, a power armor was still a power armor, and it was unrealistic to think grenades could eliminate the well-trained militia. They tumbled behind cover and the five P-type power armors pulled out their tactical rifles and pointed to the opposite side of the corridor.</br>
</br>
"This is Team A, we have encountered the target."</br>
</br>
"Approved for firing, take him out," Ding Liwei ordered viciously.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
"Is this really a good idea?" Wan Peng asked.</br>
</br>
"Since we already stepped over the line, do you want to sit down and negotiate with him?" Ding Liwei snorted and looked at the sky. "I hope what is hidden in this city is worthy of our bet."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng smiled without refuting, but he thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
You still don't know, but thanks to my intelligent subordinates, I already stepped over the line yesterday afternoon.</br>
</br>
They were grasshoppers on the rope of no return.</br>
</br>
Compared with the two behemoths: CCCP Frontier Defense and NAC, the power they possessed were no different than the power possessed by grasshoppers. Since Jiang Chen already appeared here, then the NAC soldiers likely already entered the city and controlled the entire Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
Now they must bet all their chips on the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation. If the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation left to his people was rich enough, they may have a chance of turning back the tide...</br>
</br>
After receiving the order to fire, the 20 power armors grouped into four teams and immediately rushed in the direction of the explosion.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Team A which was first under attack began to push forward.</br>
</br>
However, the attack formation consisting of 20 Hummingbird drones suddenly appeared from the corner and unleashed fierce firepower from their flank.</br>
</br>
At first, they were caught off-guard and immediately retreated to cover. However, when they found that the drone's small-caliber ammunition only made sounds without any damage on their armor, their previously tense state disappeared.</br>
</br>
Seeing these bullets could not even break the armor's defenses, the militia leading had a disdained smile and gestured to his comrades behind him.</br>
</br>
"Prepare the EMP."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
A soldier pulled an EMP grenade from the nylon buckle on his waist. Another soldier leaning behind cover pulled out the fuse and was about to throw the grenade, but the 20 Hummingbird drones were collapsing directly on them.</br>
</br>
Looking at the homing drones converging on them, the soldier in front felt something peculiar, but he could not explain the reason.</br>
</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he noticed a slight difference in the group of drones.</br>
</br>
A drone was not equipped with a muzzle, but an item the size of a can. He could not explain what it was, but the instant he saw it, the fear of death overwhelmed him.</br>
</br>
"GET DOWN—"</br>
</br>
Roaring with all his strength, the militia soldier immediately dropped to the ground.</br>
</br>
However, in front of the nuclear grenade, what could being on the ground do?</br>
</br>
The glaring white light suddenly filled the entire space. The lava-like blast melted the steel, blew away the concrete wall, and ravaged the entire floor. On the multi-story office building, it created a giant hole around three floors in size!</br>
</br>
Nothing remained of the five people in the center of the explosion...</br>
</br>
"FU*K! Is that idiot crazy?"</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong pushed the concrete pieces off of his body, dragged himself up with the help of his rifle and struggled to stand up from the ground.</br>
</br>
As the captain of the 20 power armors, when the explosion occurred, he was on the seventieth floor and took his soldiers in the direction of Team A. However, the sudden explosion actually collapsed the floor above him and almost buried the entire team there.</br>
</br>
He did praise the quality of the construction of the Pan-Asia Cooperation civil defense project, as even after an explosion that size, the building was perfectly intact.</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong felt his scalp tingle as he looked down at the dazzling height outside the broken wall.</br>
</br>
"Team B and C report the casualties."</br>
</br>
"Team B is fine."</br>
</br>
"Team C is fine."</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong breathed a sigh of relief after he received the two reports.</br>
</br>
It seemed that although the explosion made a loud noise, the damage was lackluster in comparison.</br>
</br>
As for Team A, he did not even bother asking. No one would have responded even if he asked...</br>
</br>
"Captain, what do we do now?" From the ruins, another soldier shook his dazzled head and asked.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k do you mean?" Luo Xiaoyong pulled the tactical rifle and looked at the collapsed ceiling of the upper floor, then cursed. "Follow me!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt the tremor of the explosion under his feet as he stood at the entrance of the safety tunnel on the eightieth floor, turned off the holographic screen with nothing but white flickers and switched to another screen.</br>
</br>
He just used 20 Hummingbird drones and a nuclear grenade to take out five power armors.</br>
</br>
"Are there still fifteen left?"</br>
</br>
With more power armors appearing in the drone capture screen, he sneered.</br>
</br>
Although he was vastly outnumbered, he did not show any sign of fear.</br>
</br>
When he left Yao Yao in the office, he also left the Rubik's cube Lin Lin gave him to the little girl.</br>
</br>
With the protection of the small Holy Shield, Yao Yao's safety was no longer a concern.</br>
</br>
Now, without any worries, he could finally unleash his full force.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
[Thank you for using Eden Technology]</br>
</br>
After obtaining administrator rights, Yao Yao successfully bypassed the security program and entered the database. When she opened the database file, her bright eyes gradually showed a trace of shock.</br>
</br>
"What are these..."</br>
</br>
Muttered to herself, Yao Yao trembling finger opened the folder named [No. 005].</br>
</br>
A pop-up window appeared in the center of the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
[No. 005, National Experimental Project]</br>
</br>
[Summary: The Virtual City Plan (discarded) was changed to an artificial intelligence project after consideration by the Strategic Science and Technology Development Committee.</br>
</br>
Goal: Incubation of Advanced Artificial Intelligence, AI number X71291</br>
</br>
Project Progress: Unknown</br>
</br>
Backup data: ...]</br>
</br>
As soon as she saw the words "Advanced Artificial Intelligence" and "No. 005", Yao Yao suddenly recalled a memory from a long time ago.</br>
</br>
The virtual world that Brother Jiang Chen once entered seemed to be called Fallout Shelter 005...</br>
</br>
However, [No. 005] was just the tip of the iceberg in this database. Of the hundreds of files stored here, the largest number was 728.</br>
</br>
Among all the experimental projects, some had been completed, some had been in progress, and some had failed. All of the experimental projects had one thing in common, and that was, these projects were national projects authorized by the Pan-Asia Cooperation Strategic Science and Technology Development Committee.</br>
</br>
And, because of the particularity of the experimental content, they were all not disclosed to the public...</br>
</br>
Her line of sight moved along the directory of the database. When Yao Yao saw the word [#000], her heart began pounding faster.</br>
</br>
However, just as she was about to open the folder, the tremor of the explosion that shook the entire building pulled her attention back from these files.</br>
</br>
"Ah, let's not bother with these anymore..."</br>
</br>
The thought that Brother Jiang Chen may be in danger made Yao Yao close the database directory after she clicked download.</br>
</br>
She gently bit her lips, fingers quickly tapped on the tablet, and her heart pounded wildly. Lines of codes flashed across her bright pupils. Her pretty face, full of concern, reflected off of the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
At the moment when Jiang Chen and the Second Militia's power armors engaged in battle, Yao Yao obtained monitoring authority of the building and prayed silently in her heart.</br>
</br>
Please be okay...</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1200"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1200: One Against Twenty!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Twenty to one.</br>
</br>
Their disparity in numbers was even more evident in a confined space. Luo Xiaoyong originally thought that it would be easy to eradicate that T-3 Power Armor, but he faced the cruel reality. He did not even encounter it face to face before he already lost a team.</br>
</br>
Very good, the current advantage is fifteen to one.</br>
</br>
They still possessed an absolute advantage, but he was no longer as certain.</br>
</br>
"What was the explosion just now?" A militia soldier glanced at the half-destroyed wall, still shaking from the explosion.</br>
</br>
"The radiation value has risen sharply... Maybe they have blown up a nuclear fusion core? Or a tactical nuke."</br>
</br>
"Hell, NAC's power armor all carry tactical nukes?" Another soldier cussed.</br>
</br>
"Shut up and concentrate." Luo Xiaoyong said, "Attention all team, disperse formation. Team B, use the safety tunnel to get above him. Team C, attack from the stairs in the hall and Team D, follow me."</br>
</br>
"ROGER!"</br>
</br>
"MOVE!"</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong gestured forward, clenching his hands. He led the soldiers from the side and moved toward the stairs.</br>
</br>
The P-series power armor was designed for police use with the ultimate purpose of maintaining security at protest sites. While its anti-armor capability was lackluster, it possessed the outstanding anti-personnel ability and light weapon protection ability.</br>
</br>
In contrast, the T-2 was designed as an airborne power armor that required a high degree of maneuverability, hence sacrificed its armor thickness, which was significantly inferior to the P-series. Based on the T-2 power armor, the Sixth Street's self-designed T-3 type also inherited this feature. This limitation was not improved until the T-4 type designed for surface combat.</br>
</br>
Therefore, while the P-series was designed for police work, its combat ability was not inferior compared to the T-3 power armor.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this fact, Luo Xiaoyong was confident enough to surround Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, his subordinates were about to pay the price of their life for his self-confidence.</br>
</br>
After receiving its order, Team B immediately started charging through the safety tunnel.</br>
</br>
However, just as they were about to reach the seventieth floor, they made intimate contact with Jiang Chen's cannon.</br>
</br>
That's right, cannon!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, at the entrance of the safe tunnel, was holding a Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon four meters long!</br>
</br>
The T-series power armor did have the function to attach an external cannon, but where did this cannon come from?!</br>
</br>
The soldiers still on the stairs had no time to understand the situation before the electric energy filled in the capacitor was instantly released!</br>
</br>
The anchoring device was activated, thus there was no need to aim. Jiang Chen directly fired the cannon at the power armor at the very front. The blinding electric arc instantly disappeared from the cannon as the 5kg shell instantly penetrated all four power armors like a skewer, and catapulted them out of the building along with the wall behind them.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let go of the cannon in his hands and then fluidly pulled the tactical rifle wielded at his waist and fired at the lucky militia that managed to survive. But unfortunately, the armor of P-series was surprisingly thick as the bullets shredded the armor, but did not finish the soldier inside.</br>
</br>
The soldier was dazzled by the bullets raining from above. He desperately clawed his way out of the building as he activated the descending device to escape.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not pursue him. He picked up a Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon from the ground and deactivated the anchoring device. He looked at the bottom of the stairs and murmured to himself.</br>
</br>
"Is there still ten left?"</br>
</br>
Judging by the loudness, the sound of the explosion should have already reached the other people and they should be here now.</br>
</br>
Putting the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon back into the storage dimension, Jiang Chen took out the tablet connected to the drone hive and set its attack path. Then he followed the way the militia came up and went down the safety tunnel.</br>
</br>
"We lost contact with Team B."</br>
</br>
As five new red crosses appeared on the command interface, Luo Xiaoyong only felt an uncontrollable anger burning in his chest as he gnashed his teeth. He could not wait to tear Jiang Chen apart and feed him to the zombies to vent his hatred.</br>
</br>
Those ten soldiers were his intimate comrades. They began to train together before the war and were selected into the Second Militia Group of Shangjing as a post-war reserve army in hibernation chambers.</br>
</br>
They survived the zombie flood, resisted the nuclear winter, destroyed the mutants, and eliminated the cannibal tribes, but they ultimately fell here! A loss of this scale was unprecedented, and the Second Militia Group could not bear this kind of loss!</br>
</br>
"This is Team C, we have successfully reached the target area... Fu*k! We're under attack! It's Reptile and Python drones! Damn, how does NAC have all these!?"</br>
</br>
The Reptile drone was a well-known fire support platform for the Pan-Asia Army, and the Python drone was renowned as an attack drone that even NATO feared. And now eight of them, and countless Hummingbird drones were closing in on them!</br>
</br>
It was easy to distinguish from the chaotic gunshots that Team C was in trouble.</br>
</br>
"Team C, retreat!"</br>
</br>
"Received, retreating… AHHHH—"</br>
</br>
The communication tone was rudely cut off.</br>
</br>
As he fixed his sight at the three red crosses that lost communication on the command interface, Luo Xiaoyong's eyes were bloodshot and they widened in rage.</br>
</br>
The militia in Team D cautiously watched their surroundings, on the alert for any possible shadows.</br>
</br>
The team full of confidence now began to fear.</br>
</br>
Yes, fear!</br>
</br>
They did not understand the entire situation. They were chasing a T-3 power armor, at most a negligible girl, but now a tactical nuke exploded, an electromagnetic pulse cannon fired, and even Reptile and Python drones popped out of nowhere...</br>
</br>
They did not know what was waiting for them.</br>
</br>
However, what they knew was... they did not want to think.</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong's anger was completely detonated.</br>
</br>
So far, he did not even catch a glimpse of Jiang Chen and already half of his force had been wiped out.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k you, you are a fu*king turtle. Are you not the NAC General? Anyone can hide!" Roaring into the empty hall, Luo Xiaoyong fired into the shadows, screaming in rage, "Come and fight me! I'll only use one hand"</br>
</br>
However, as he spoke, he heard footsteps from the side.</br>
</br>
Then, a voice rang out.</br>
</br>
"I just heard that you want to fight me?"</br>
</br>
All eyes focused on the voice</br>
</br>
From the shadow, it was Jiang Chen that made them suffer!</br>
</br>
After reading what just happened, Luo Xiaoyong cursed.</br>
</br>
"Fight your a**!"</br>
</br>
He raised his tactical rifle and all five power armors pulled the trigger simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was already prepared as he activated his nitrogen armor calmly.</br>
</br>
The turbulent air scattered, and the orange-yellow trajectories looked like broken toothpicks that were deflected to the side.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh as he saw the muzzles spitting bullets and examined the lacquered black armor illuminated by the fire.</br>
</br>
"I knew it would end like this."</br>
</br>
As he finished his sentence, he pressed the button on the tablet...</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1251: Seeking for Death</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Ares deployed its parachute the moment it entered the atmosphere. It crossed the distance of tens of thousands of kilometers before it landed safely on the Mars surface and created a wave of dust.</br>
</br>
The buckles on the cushion seats popped open and the astronauts stepped down.</br>
</br>
Everyone cheered in excitement when they finally felt gravity.</br>
</br>
"We have succeeded!"</br>
</br>
"Successful landing! NICE!"</br>
</br>
"...!"</br>
</br>
Ten minutes ago, they were staring at the radar in fear, afraid that Celestial Trade may accidentally launch a missile toward them. But unexpectedly, Celestial Trade did not interfere with them. They did not even communicate with them and just watched them land in silence...</br>
</br>
It was too strange.</br>
</br>
Did they not detect us? But how is that possible!</br>
</br>
In the midst of joy, Bris also grew uneasy.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he felt that the people from Celestrial Trade were watching them. They silently watched with neither surprise or astonishment, but mockery and sly, as if they were watching a drama...</br>
</br>
I hope it's just my illusion.</br>
</br>
Bris shook his head and forced a smile. He celebrated with his teammates and blended into the jubilant atmosphere.</br>
</br>
The radio transceiver extended on top of Ares and aimed at the satellite on the orbit. The signal would be relayed to mission control back on Earth via the satellite .</br>
</br>
Because of the few minutes of communication delay, everyone only could say one sentence.</br>
</br>
Bris grabbed the radio and exchanged a look of excitement with his teammates, he took a deep breath and changed into a serious expression, then he pressed the button and looked at the lens.</br>
</br>
"Calling Mission Control, this is Ares. We have landed successfully!"</br>
</br>
While Bris still had a lot to say, when he saw the exhilarated state from his teammates, he ended the communication and handed the radio to the nearest teammate.</br>
</br>
"We have succeeded! We have succeeded!" The beautiful astronaut with blonde hair got in front of the camera and shouted with enthusiasm. "We are on Mars now! The desert looks like it's on fire, this is probably the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in my life."</br>
</br>
"The weather here is very sunny, and we are fortunate that we have not encountered a sandstorm," said the Jewish astronaut, "This is a good start. God will bless us and the UA."</br>
</br>
"I feel like I'm back in my hometown. It's like the desert there! But it's cold here. The temperature outside is only minus 50 degrees Celsius. Fortunately, there is heat in Ares, hahaha..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Communication resources were quite valuable, leaving everyone with only a short half minute. In less than five minutes, eight astronauts all extended their wishes to their hometown far away.</br>
</br>
The video would be broadcasted by major TV stations across the country so that everyone in UA would share this exciting moment.</br>
</br>
In the end, Bris turned off the camera, compressed the video, and clicked send.</br>
</br>
</br>
Then, several energetic people in the team immediately became rowdy.</br>
</br>
"Kane, take out the champagne from the fridge! We have to celebrate this great moment! Hahaha!"</br>
</br>
"Let's hold off the celebration. Let's decide who will be the first one to set foot on Mars?"</br>
</br>
"Same rule, we're drawing straws!"</br>
</br>
"Drawing straws? Wait for me to wash my hands first..."</br>
</br>
Bris smiled at the scene with how thrilled his teammates were,</br>
</br>
Though for some odd reason, the uneasiness in his heart was getting stronger and stronger.</br>
</br>
Before he came, he did a lot of homework.</br>
</br>
The mainstream view of the UA biology community believed Devil Worms' threat was only poorly-constructed propaganda made by Celestial Trade to monopolize Mars colonization. Devil Worms would not attack unless they were attacked.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, why did Celestial Trade only attack this year when they already landed a long time ago? If it was not for the fact that they drilled down and poked a hole in the Devil Worms' nest, why would the bugs living in the mantle attack the surface?</br>
</br>
As long as you don't ask to be attacked, you won't be attacked.</br>
</br>
It was NASA's advice to these pioneers.</br>
</br>
However, these were only speculations in UA's biological community.</br>
</br>
No UA citizen participated in Devil Worm's research. Even the most knowledgeable scientists only viewed Devil Worms behind a glass.</br>
</br>
Is the habit of insects on Mars the same as the insects on Earth?</br>
</br>
This is really hard to say.</br>
</br>
After all, there are no insects on the planet that are bigger than humans.</br>
</br>
Just as Bris debated this in his mind, the draw already ended.</br>
</br>
The lucky winner was a skinny man.</br>
</br>
His name was Sean and he came from California. When he found out that he won the draw, he almost jumped in excitement.</br>
</br>
He headed to the buffer cabin, then put on the heavy spacesuit with the help of his teammates. After confirming that the data of the spacesuit was normal, he took the star-spangled flag solemnly from his captain Bris. He watched the inward door close, the outward open, and then gently jumped out toward the desert.</br>
</br>
In Ares, Bris prayed and opened the camera. Several other teammates also rushed to take out their phones and other camera equipment to capture and commemorate this great moment.</br>
</br>
When his feet landed on the side, Sean carried the flag and waved to his teammates behind him.</br>
</br>
When he saw the raised thumbs, he turned around, full of emotions, as he marched to the sand dune where he would place the star-spangled flag.</br>
</br>
Ten meters left.</br>
</br>
The flag of the UA will fly on Mars.</br>
</br>
The monopoly Celestial Trade has on Mars will end...</br>
</br>
Just then, he suddenly felt a tremor below his feet.</br>
</br>
"Is it an earthquake?" Sean frowned.</br>
</br>
He was a geologist who conducted extensive research before this mission. In his memory, the geological environment of Mars was quite stable; to the point that it seemed like a dead planet. There was no volcanic activity nor tectonic plate shifts. How could an earthquake happen?</br>
</br>
"Is it a sandstorm?"</br>
</br>
As he muttered, he still took a step forward.</br>
</br>
However, his foot did manage to come down-</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Without the slightest omen.</br>
</br>
A 20-meter-long giant worm crawled out from the ground and sent the astronaut into the air.</br>
</br>
It was too late to even scream as its sharp mandibles already crushed together with lightning speed, snapping him in half. His guts and flesh flew freely in the air and soaked the dry and barren land with fresh blood.</br>
</br>
"AAHHHH!"</br>
</br>
The people inside Ares screamed. Some people stood there in silence, completely traumatized by the scene they just witnessed. Some people started to vomit. Some people sat down and whispered Amen...</br>
</br>
Bris slowly put the camera he was holding down as he stared in front of him blankly. He watched the Devil Worm skillfully suck the flesh and blood out of the spacesuit and move its countless legs. His lips quivered in fear and he was unable to say a single word. He forgot to turn off the power on the camera.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time they saw Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
On their way to Mars, they saw photos of Devil Worms from mission control and were told not to irritate them and not to approach their nests.</br>
</br>
However, it was their first time seeing a Devil Worm that moved...</br>
</br>
What scared and puzzled them the most was that they did not do anything.</br>
</br>
Why did the monster stalk them?!</br>
</br>
In the synchronous orbit, TS Expedition captured the cruel scene.</br>
</br>
The captain of TS Expedition stared coldly at the bug in the scene and repeated the situation to the Space Command Center.</br>
</br>
Soon, a detailed report of the entire accident was placed on Jiang Chen's desk.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1252: Into the Bug“s Mouth</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Mission Control.</br>
</br>
The room was in complete chaos.</br>
</br>
Just ten minutes ago, they interrupted the national broadcast on Mars. Soldiers were deployed to maintain the order outside the launch center and yellow tapes were set up at the door to stop the eager reporter waiting for the news as the entire center was locked down.</br>
</br>
"...this is Ares! We need backup! God...they, the bugs! They are hitting our spaceship!"</br>
</br>
"Hell, don't they not attack?"</br>
</br>
"We may have fallen on their nests... the hull has suffered 11% damage, damn it!"</br>
</br>
Pieces of information came back intermittently from Ares, tens of millions of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Bolden stared at the screen in complete shock.</br>
</br>
He could not believe everything happened so unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
Also stunned were the scientists invited by the Advanced Projects Agency of the Department of Defense, the biology professors from Harvard, and the researchers at SpaceX's Mars Colony Project team... including Martin Karplus who was rejected by Celestial Trade in Coro City, and Michael Levitt on behalf of MIT.</br>
</br>
Almost all the well-known experts in the biology community were here.</br>
</br>
They had vowed to the NASA consultants that the Mars creature, after three billion years of evolution, already lost its digestive ability of mammals when the organisms on Mars went extinct. They would not attack for no apparent reason.</br>
</br>
The reason why Devil Worms attacked the Celestial Trade colony was because of the hostile actions of Celestial Trade… In short, those Xin citizens deserved it.</br>
</br>
However, now, Devil Worms used the death of Sean to slap everyone's face.</br>
</br>
They not only ate people.</br>
</br>
But they used a cruel way to devour their prey in front of everyone...</br>
</br>
"God." Along with a group of high-ranking officials, Secretary of Defense Carter went into the lounge next door to the mission control and swallowed all this information down. "Today will be the darkest day in UA's space history."</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade warned us about the dangers of those Mars species... DAMNIT! Who said these things are mild and cute, and there is nothing wrong if we don't touch it!" NASA Director Bolden punched the table.</br>
</br>
These eight astronauts were the treasure of NASA. The amount of money spent on them was no less than Ares itself.</br>
</br>
Training an astronaut was much more expensive than training a fighter pilot. They not only had to master how to operate the more complex spacecraft, but they also possessed a lot of natural science knowledge to deal with unexpected situations.</br>
</br>
"What should we do now?" The Capitol consultant looked at Bolden. "How can I explain this to the president in two hours?"</br>
</br>
"...proactively clarify to the media?" Secretary of Defense Carter suggested. "No... If we let them know that our astronauts were killed simply because of our error in judgment, we will be crucified by the media."</br>
</br>
"There are still seven people alive...we have to find a way to save them," Bolden said with paleness.</br>
</br>
</br>
"How can we save them?" Carter was amused by Bolden's words, but he could not laugh. He bitterly said. "Do you think this is Iraq? Or Afghanistan? The people that have surrounded us are terrorists? If so, I would immediately send the SEAL team to extract our citizens and go home."</br>
</br>
"You can only go to Celestial Trade."</br>
</br>
The entire lounge suddenly turned silent.</br>
</br>
The deputy director who said this immediately closed his mouth. He peeked at several of his peers and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
"First, buy time from the media, then discuss with Celestial Trade. If you can convince them to take our astronauts to their colony..." The more Bolden said, the less confident he sounded.</br>
</br>
Before the launch, Celestial Trade warned about the dangers of the Mars species. However, they not only disregarded the warning but also thought that it was a smoke bomb released by Celestial Trade. They thought they were using insects that would not actively attack mammals to obstruct their "Mars Plan."</br>
</br>
But now...</br>
</br>
They paid the price for their stupidity.</br>
</br>
"I can only find a way to solve this through diplomatic channels," Carter said.</br>
</br>
The ball was kicked to the secretary of state... But it was not directly related to him. The Advanced Project Bureau of the Ministry of Defense only participated in the design of the Ares VI engine, but did not participate in the entire launch project.</br>
</br>
And the reason why he stood here was just to leave his mark on this historical moment.</br>
</br>
It was just a pity that the mark he left was not a positive one...</br>
</br>
"In short, we need to calm the media. I will talk to them. Just say that Mars encountered solar wind. The contact between the ground command center and Ares has failed. It will take a while to receive communication," the Capitol consultant said.</br>
</br>
"I'll speak with NASA staff. This is confidential," Bolden glanced at several senior officials and said.</br>
</br>
"I'll go explain to SpaceX," said the Deputy Director of NASA.</br>
</br>
As long as they could convince Celestial Trade, the safety of the seven astronauts would be guaranteed.</br>
</br>
It would be up to the secretary of state to guide the conversation.</br>
</br>
However, the door of the lounge was pushed open, and a man in a NASA uniform ran in, panicked.</br>
</br>
The conversation that was full of state secrets was suddenly interrupted.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter? Lippmann," Bolden frowned in dissatisfaction as he stared at the man who ran in. "What's wrong? Don't you know to knock?"</br>
</br>
"Bad news!" Lippmann's breath was out of rhythm as he was panting heavily. He held onto the door frame and looked at Bolden with an ugly expression, "Washington Post, Los Angeles Daily, Wall Street Journal, and CBS... are all outside the launch center. They are demanding us to explain this incident immediately!"</br>
</br>
"Explain?" Carter frowned. "Explain what? Are they not outside?"</br>
</br>
As he scanned around the the senior figures in the lounge, Lippmann's eyes widened. "You don't know?"</br>
</br>
"Know what?" The Capitol advisor heart suddenly sank, and he immediately rushed to Lippmann's side and clutched onto his shoulders. "What happened outside? Tell me!"</br>
</br>
You actually don't know?</br>
</br>
Lippmann smiled bitterly, took out his iPhone X, and stuffed it in the advisor's hands.</br>
</br>
"Go see yourself."</br>
</br>
The Capitol advisor quickly took over the phone, and Carter, Bolden, and the others all gathered around him.</br>
</br>
It was a Tweet.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was news retweeted by a well-known blogger along with the blogger's comments on the news...but that was not the issue.</br>
</br>
The moment they saw the news headline.</br>
</br>
Everyone turned pale.</br>
</br>
The news headline said...</br>
</br>
[Shocking! The UA manned rocket that landed on Mars actually encountered them...]</br>

</br>
[Shocking! The UA manned rocket that landed on Mars actually encountered them...]</br>
</br>
[Frightening! The UA President is enraged because...]</br>
</br>
[Men went silent after reading this, women cried after reading this...]</br>
</br>
"What are these headlines?" Jiang Chen tossed the drafts on the table and laughed, "I told you to add some fire to the situation and you guys came up with these things?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, we recently acquired a promising company," Ning Jianhua, CEO of Future Technology, touched his nose in embarrassment. "I found their editors too creative, so I just moved them to the marketing department… The clicks are pretty high, aren't they?"</br>
</br>
Ning Huajian seemed to realize the informality and coughed to change the subject. He pulled out a few sheets from the stack of documents and pointed to the headlines. "In fact, there are also normal headlines. These came from the communication department of Future Technology..."</br>
</br>
[From the latest aerial photo from TS Expedition, the NASA Ares is suspected to be besieged by Mars creatures...]</br>
</br>
[The unfortunate victims of a sloppy Mars Plan...]</br>
</br>
[According to a senior official in Celestial Trade, Celestial Trade made cautious suggestions to the UA on the dangers of Devil Worms on Mars Plan...]</br>
</br>
These headlines were more normal, at least they explained the beginning to end of the entire incident.</br>
</br>
When Ares entered Mars' synchronous orbit, TS Expedition found the group of "smugglers." After Jiang Chen heard Kelvin's report, he shared the same opinion with Kelvin, which was to disregard them.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, when they were busy inserting their flag, the tragedy happened.</br>
</br>
Because of the delay in communication, Celestial Trade's Space Command Center even received the intelligence five minutes ahead of UA.</br>
</br>
When Kelvin addressed to Jiang Chen that Ares was trapped, Jiang Chen immediately ordered Future Technology's North America subsidiary to release the images captured by TS Expedition before the government censored the information.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, through the Xin Embassy in the UA, Celestial Trade sent the high-definition aerial footage captured to the Capitol and media.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know what kind of damage this tragedy would cause on the country's national confidence and its cohesion, especially when the entire country was closely following the Mars landing. However, he was sure that the government would come to him.</br>
</br>
To ask for help from Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
After he dismissed Ning Jianhua, Jiang Chen sluggishly leaned back against his chair.</br>
</br>
Of course I'll save them.</br>
</br>
After all, I'll do it for humanitarian reasons.</br>
</br>
Except that it's not cheap to feed another seven people in the colony. What kind of benefits should I ask for when the Capitol called?</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen began to seriously consider this issue, the phone on his desk really began to ring.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was not the Capitol, but his friend in B City...</br>
</br>
"Mr. Loki, what has caused you to call?" Jiang Chen said with a smile when he saw the name on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Haha, my old friend, I'll put aside the small talk for now. I have something important to discuss with you," Loki said with excitement in his tone. After he paused for a brief second, he continued, "I know what you are thinking, but please listen to me first. This failed Mars Project is a great opportunity for us!"</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen looked at the holographic screen quietly, then waited for Loki to continue.</br>
</br>
"Now the entire UA is paying attention to this incident! You should know what I mean," said Loki.</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jiang Chen replied.</br>
</br>
It's about the seven astronauts trapped on Mars.</br>
</br>
They are now shivering in the broken Ares, waiting for people to save them.</br>
</br>
"If this incident is handled well, it can reverse the tense diplomatic relationship between the UA and Xin, and even completely change the country's view of Celestial Trade. Since you have agreed to our plan already, I assume you are not going to be our enemy forever and return the world to the Cold War Era."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen shrugged without much emotion and said indifferently, "We have always been committed to maintaining good relationships with other countries, but the Capitol seems to have always regarded us as a thorn in its eye."</br>
</br>
"That's because it's Hill, and she represents the military-industrial complex!" Loki said seriously. "But we are different. If you have studied history, you should know B City Consortium and you share the same perspective. For example, former President Kennedy, his decision represented, to some extent, our opinion. For example, the space program, the Nuclear Weapons Reduction Treaty, and the withdrawal plan that was not completed even after he was assassinated..."</br>
</br>
Loki seemed to know some information about the death of President Kennedy, but he did not plan to go further into the unrelated issue.</br>
</br>
"You know, we have always opposed the return to the Asia-Pacific strategy and have supported the UA in joining the Earth Defense Alliance. As long as Joseph Kennedy rises to power, the first thing he will do is honor his seventh campaign promise! Unconditionally join the Earth Defense Alliance. "</br>
</br>
Having said this, his tone shifted from being serious to excited.</br>
</br>
"This event of Ares is an excellent opportunity. If we strategize correctly, it can be our chip to win against Morgan Consortium and win against over Kerry! Just let Joseph Kennedy be the lobbyist, as long as you cooperate..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen debated for a moment. His fingers crossed on his right knee, then he spoke.</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Can a candidate conduct a diplomatic visit on behalf of the country? I remember that Mr. Kennedy is only a senator. Would it not be considered… overreaching and interfering with national affairs?"</br>
</br>
"In principle, it doesn't work," said Loki. "But as long as we plan it accordingly, there can be exceptions. Mr. Kennedy has another identity. He and Bris, the captain of Ares, are alumni, and they are both honorary members of the alumni association. If he visits Celestial Trade with the identities of B City University Alumni Association, the friend of the victim, and a senator, no one can make irresponsible remarks about his visit."</br>
</br>
"Then..." A plan formed in Jiang Chen's head as he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Then the future president of the UA and the president of Celestial Trade will have a wonderful meeting," Loki also smiled and shared the same sentiment. "The hands of the two giants will come together to push down the iron curtain over the Pacific Ocean, and welcome the future of human civilization!"</br>
</br>
This idea sounds pretty neat.</br>
</br>
If it can be achieved.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thoughtfully nodded as his fingers gently tapped on his knee.</br>
</br>
To push a dove, or at least a weak hawk (1) candidate onto the throne of the president was already one of the strategic priorities of Celestial Trade, Future Group, and Ghost Agents. Throughout history, President Kennedy was the famous weak war hawk president of the Cold War era...</br>
</br>
Since the Kennedy family was part of the B City Consortium's interest coalition and the B City Consortium was not involved in the military-industrial industry led by Morgan and Rockefeller, then the political views of Kennedy should not be too drastically different from his grandfather's.</br>
</br>
Should he go all in on Joseph Kennedy and gamble on a dovish president to push UA into his alliance?</br>
</br>
Or should he use this chip to threaten the ill-fated Hill government in exchange for the benefits that can be realized immediately?</br>
</br>
In fact, he did not need to choose.</br>
</br>
The answer was obvious.</br>
</br>
"What's your opinion?" Loki asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's fingers uncrossed, as he seemed to make up his mind and responded gently.</br>
</br>
"You'd better keep your promise."</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Loki replied in a serious tone.</br>
</br>
"Then get your dealers to deal the cards," Jiang Chen held onto the armrests and stood, he looked into the holographic screen and said pleasantly, "If you want to play, bet big and we'll call."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1254: Friendship? Transaction?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Three days passed since the Ares Incident.</br>
</br>
The UA Secretary of State paid a diplomatic visit to Xin and met with Celestial Trade's Space Head, Kelvin… In fact, they originally wished to meet Jiang Chen, but Jiang Chen refused on the basis that he was on vacation.</br>
</br>
Vacation.</br>
</br>
It was a good excuse.</br>
</br>
In short, Kelvin assumed Jiang Chen's role and euphemistically expressed the difficulty of the rescue to the visiting UA Secretary of State. For example, Ares landed directly above the Devil Worm's nest. If the rescue may cause the astronauts on Ares to be killed or injured, Celestial Trade would be unable to take the responsibility.</br>
</br>
In short, we can't save your people!</br>
</br>
While the Capitol was furious with Celestial Trade's stance, there was no other solution.</br>
</br>
After all, no agreement was in place between the two countries. Offering assistance would solely be on the grounds of humanitarianism.</br>
</br>
Of course, considering the economic and trade relations between the two countries, Kelvin did completely rule out the idea of a rescue and left an opportunity for the Capitol to be persistent.</br>
</br>
For example, in a private meeting with the UA Secretary of State, Kelvin subtly hinted that there was room for negotiation, it was just the price lacked sincereness. Perhaps a further discussion with your president would change the outcome...</br>
</br>
With disappointment, the UA Secretary of State ended his three-day diplomatic visit to Xin.</br>
</br>
Then, what happened next was even more interesting.</br>
</br>
The UA Secretary of State just returned home and immediately the media began to criticize the Capitol.</br>
</br>
Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, all joined force and accused the Hill government of being incompetent and questioned the ability of the new secretary of state...</br>
</br>
The sway in public opinions surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Originally, he thought that the media would attack Celestial Trade on this issue and label him with a few "cold-blooded" and "selfish" titles. However, he never expected the Capitol to be in the eye of the storm?</br>
</br>
But it didn't take long for him to read the situation.</br>
</br>
Hill's newly appointed secretary of state encountered a wall at Celestial Trade, just enough to demonstrate the difference in ability compared to the former secretary of state. Now, only three hopeful candidates remained within the Democratic Party for the March primaries.</br>
</br>
Kerry obviously did not have knowledge of B City Consortium's agreement with Jiang Chen. Since the opportunity was right; Kerry and his supporters would certainly not give up the chance to attack Hill.</br>
</br>
However, just according to the plan, what happened next completely surprised Kerry and the Morgan Consortium behind the scenes...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Coro City Airport.</br>
</br>
A plane from B City International Airport landed on the runway.</br>
</br>
The plane came to a complete stop.</br>
</br>
</br>
A man in a black suit, accompanied by two bodyguards and a journalist, walked off the plane with a confident smile.</br>
</br>
Of course, he did not use his money to charter this private flight. It was impossible for a senator to have this kind of money.</br>
</br>
However, after all, he represented the B City University Alumni Association to visit Xin. The fund under the association naturally covered the expenses of his business trip. Once the money was coated under the fund's name, it was much easier to operate.</br>
</br>
The man took a few steps toward the VIP Tunnel. When he saw the man at the entrance, his eyes suddenly lit up and he extended his hand; his smile was as warm as the lovely spring breeze.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Joseph Kennedy." Jiang Chen smiled and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"It's my honor," Joseph enthusiastically shook Jiang Chen's hand and laughed. "I have long heard of your name,"</br>
</br>
"Your Mandarin seems to be good?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, I earned my tuition working at a Chinese restaurant. I not only speak fluent Mandarin but also I know how to make spring... spring rolls," Joseph gestured with his fingers the shape of the spring roll. "It's the kind filled with stuffing."</br>
</br>
"Haha, then I certainly want to try it," Jiang Chen joked. "But I guess your boss was not a good teacher, because that thing is actually called dumplings."</br>
</br>
The atmosphere of the meeting was quite friendly, especially since both parties shared a mutual intention.</br>
</br>
The two walked all the way out of the airport, and the reporter behind him held the camera all the way until they got on the extended Luer outside the airport.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the reporter was part of the B City Consortium and understood what can and can not be filmed.</br>
</br>
Any news about the visit, regardless of the newspaper or TV station, would have to be sourced from this reporter. It would avoid the possibility of Kerry and Hill's campaign team altering facts behind the scenes.</br>
</br>
In addition to the silent reporter, Jiang Chen noticed that the two sunglasses-wearing bodyguards behind him also appeared to be deadly.</br>
</br>
For comparison, they were just slightly weaker than the guy named Johnson who protected Carmen Rothschild. They were either retired SEALs or retired Deltas.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the B City Consortium was much aware of the curse of the Kennedy family and put heavy emphasis on his protection.</br>
</br>
"Is the itinerary set?" Inside the vehicle, Jiang Chen looked at Joseph and smiled. "Let's talk about it, how can we cooperate with your election."</br>
</br>
"Is there a golf course?" Joseph smiled. "My skills are not bad."</br>
</br>
"I have one at the foot of Mount Fuji, but I don't go very often." Jiang Chen laughed along.</br>
</br>
Land in Coro City was scarce to the point that farmers wished they could build farms into the ocean. So there was no land to build a golf course in the country. Jiang Chen didn't think it was necessary to chase the trend on something he did not enjoy.</br>
</br>
"What about volleyball or table tennis?" Joseph asked.</br>
</br>
"Either is good," Jiang Chen and pleasantly. "If you want to play volleyball, I recommend Heart of the Sea, the beach volleyball there is the highest quality I have ever seen."</br>
</br>
The so-called high quality of course referred to something specific.</br>
</br>
Only those who stay in a five-star hotel or held a membership card were allowed to enter the venue. The entire beach was the most beautifully decorated coastline of the city. Because of this, rich people around the world always gathered on the beach, and naturally, beautiful women with different skin colors...</br>
</br>
That "type" of beach volleyball.</br>
</br>
"Haha, then the guest will follow the host." Joseph chuckled along.</br>
</br>
He was not concerned about the destination of the trip.</br>
</br>
As already discussed, his purpose of the trip was to establish a friendly relationship with Jiang Chen and to showcase this friendship to the UA people.</br>
</br>
Regardless of what he did in Xin, or what deal he made with Jiang Chen, only two sentences would appear in the headlines of the media tomorrow.</br>
</br>
To save his alumni, Senator Kennedy, on behalf of the B City University Alumni Association, visited Xin to break the ice.</br>
</br>
Their talk made significant progress and Jiang Chen promised that Celestial Trade will rescue the trapped astronauts to further strengthen the friendship between the two countries.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Mars.</br>
</br>
Two weeks had passed since Ares got trapped.</br>
</br>
Every day, Devil Worms would crawl out from underground and circle around the Ares. They used their sickle-like mandibles to touch the spacecraft a few times before they disappeared back into the desert.</br>
</br>
Although the mandibles could not break the titanium hull of Ares, the psychological pressure on the astronauts was enormous. Especially whenever they recalled the bloody scene when their teammate, who trained with them, was devoured alive, and the fact that only a spacesuit remained...</br>
</br>
This desperate atmosphere permeated in the 30 square meters space.</br>
</br>
Five days ago, the communication module was damaged. Ares had completely lost contact with the satellite. It was like a traveler who lost their way in the desert. The traveler could only blankly stare into the endless desert and countdown the passing days.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, their supplies were sufficient to maintain for one year. The issue was, if they could not deploy the solar panels as soon as possible, they would soon face an electricity shortage.</br>
</br>
This was a serious problem.</br>
</br>
Without electricity, it meant no water or oxygen.</br>
</br>
Every day, the astronauts were drunk and treated the next day as doomsday.</br>
</br>
"How is the negotiation between the headquarters and Celestial Trade?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know... but no one has shown up, I'm afraid there is still no agreement."</br>
</br>
"Damnit, have we been abandoned?"</br>
</br>
"God bless, Amen..."</br>
</br>
Bris sat in the corner of the cockpit and listened to the desperate voices of his teammates, he licked the corner of his mouth and stuffed the whiskey bottle into his mouth.</br>
</br>
Helpless.</br>
</br>
Probably the only word that could describe his mood.</br>
</br>
If it were one week ago, he still had hope that Celestial Trade would send people to rescue them from hell. But now that a week had passed by, they did not even see the slightest sign of rescue.</br>
</br>
He was about to give up on this unrealistic idea.</br>
</br>
The drunken Jewish astronaut sat down beside him, burped, and muttered something hard to distinguish.</br>
</br>
"How much electricity do we have?"</br>
</br>
"Probably enough to last till next Wednesday."</br>
</br>
"Hell..." The man cursed and shook his head. "Do you know what I am thinking about right now?"</br>
</br>
"What are you thinking?" Bris snorted.</br>
</br>
"I'm thinking," The man burped, put up a finger and said in his drunken tone, "If we die of suffocation, would it be considered suicide or homicide?"</br>
</br>
"... Is there a difference?"</br>
</br>
"In my belief, if you suicide, you can't go to heaven." The Jewish man looked to Bris, revealed a bitter grin and raised his glass. "My dear captain, I only want to ask you for one thing. Put some extra sleeping pills in the dinner tonight..."</br>
</br>
"Then I would have fulfilled your wish but I would go to hell with such sins on my hands?" Bris pressed his hands on the floor and stood up. While he was wobblingly, he said, "Don't even think about it..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"What are you going to do?"</br>
</br>
"Deploy the solar panels."</br>
</br>
"You are crazy," the Jewish man grinned. "Those things are outside."</br>
</br>
"I'm serious."</br>
</br>
In the astonished and blank looks of his teammates, Bris tossed the bottle into the trashcan, raised his groggy head, and headed to the stairs.</br>
</br>
He could not wait any longer.</br>
</br>
If death was evitable, he would rather die with dignity.</br>
</br>
Although the bloody scene made him tremble whenever he thought about it, he was relieved when he realized that death was only a moment of pain.</br>
</br>
"Don't be like this, you're seeking your own death!"</br>
</br>
The man sitting in the corner of the wall reached out and grabbed Bris' arm.</br>
</br>
Bris jerked away and entered the password on the door without saying a word, and then he stepped into the buffer cabin.</br>
</br>
Outside, the sandstorm began to pick up.</br>
</br>
He was not sure whether the sandstorm would reduce the Devil Worms' perception but now was the perfect time.</br>
</br>
As long as he doesn't get blown away...</br>
</br>
After Bris checked the airtightness of the spacesuit, he put his hand on the suitcase-sized toolbox.</br>
</br>
The buffer compartment opened, and yellow sand gusted. Bris took a deep breath and was about to jump into the desert where death might be buried, when he suddenly saw a black outline in the dim horizon.</br>
</br>
He was stunned.</br>
</br>
He took a few hard wipes of his helmet.</br>
</br>
This time, it was clearer.</br>
</br>
His pupils gradually enlarged and magnified the hint of hope that lit up.</br>
</br>
"...God."</br>
</br>
It's reinforcement!</br>
</br>
Reinforcement from Celestial Trade!</br>
</br>
He almost gave up!</br>
</br>
At the same time, astronauts in Ares also found out about what was happening one kilometer away.</br>
</br>
"What's that?"</br>
</br>
"It's Celestial Trade's fleet!"</br>
</br>
"It's our rescue! Hahahaha! They must have come to save us! We don't have to die now!"</br>
</br>
The cheers erupted in Ares.</br>
</br>
Although it felt odd cheering for their competitor, they regained their hope of life. Who bothered debating this point in the heat of the moment?</br>
</br>
The outer door of the buffer compartment closed and the inner door opened.</br>
</br>
Everyone dragged their drunken bodies and hurriedly put on their spacesuit.</br>
</br>
Outside Ares.</br>
</br>
A missile fired into the desert.</br>
</br>
The scorching fireball exploded five kilometers underground and filled all the holes and tunnels. At least five Devil Worms inside were completely engulfed by the flame while the rest fled away from the heat source.</br>
</br>
The burn of the missile suppressed the Devil Worms and using this moment, two armored vehicles rushed to Ares' cabin and extracted the seven astronauts one by one. Then before the Devil Worms underground realized what had happened, they quickly withdrew from this area.</br>
</br>
Bris was still stunned inside the armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
Everything that happened ten minutes ago felt like a dream.</br>
</br>
This was considered difficult?</br>
</br>
Although he should show joy at this moment because he was saved, he could not.</br>
</br>
He felt cheated.</br>
</br>
It felt like the pain and suffering they had to endure this week was all fake...</br>
</br>
However, he could not complain.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade saved them, and his savior was sitting right in front of him.</br>
</br>
The reality felt surreal!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the journey back, Bris did not communicate with the Celestial Marines sitting across from him. First, he lacked the energy to, and second, the other party obviously did not intend to small chat with him.</br>
</br>
When the armored vehicles were approaching the colony, Bris used the sight glass on the side of the vehicle to look at the behemoth.</br>
</br>
The cuboid fortress looked like one foot of God stepping into the sands of Mars. Ares felt minuscule, like an ant, in front of it. It was not even comparable to the colony's brine desalination pump...</br>
</br>
In shock, Bris also showed a hint of bitterness.</br>
</br>
Perhaps from the beginning, landing on Mars was the wrong choice.</br>
</br>
Even in 50 years, it would be difficult for NASA to catch up and close the gap with Celestial Trade. The difference in funding of the two sides was immeasurable, and the current technological gap was even more insurmountable.</br>
</br>
And Celestial Trade managed to achieve profitability with its space technology, and has built a bridgehead on Mars of this size...</br>
</br>
Perhaps they are human's hopes?</br>
</br>
Bris shook his head and drove the idea he shouldn't have out of his head. He then followed the Marines into the hall.</br>
</br>
A man stood in front of them.</br>
</br>
Judging from the powerful temperament, he should be the leader here.</br>
</br>
Looking at these battered UA citizens, Hong Zewei's mouth moved slightly and he said.</br>
</br>
"Who is your captain?"</br>
</br>
"It's me." Bris stood up and hesitated for a moment, then sincerely thanked him, "Thank you for helping."</br>
</br>
"You are welcome," Hong Zewei said without much emotion. "Celestial Trade is a responsible enterprise and shoulders the future of mankind. Even if it is in humanitarian consideration, we will not leave you there. I hope you don't complain that we came too late, after all, we needed to develop a combat plan and to analyze the depth of Devil Worms..."</br>
</br>
Bris was confused, but he still nodded.</br>
</br>
After the man that appeared to be the governor of the colony spoke, Bris hesitated for a moment and asked him what he was most concerned about.</br>
</br>
"When can we return to Earth?"</br>
</br>
"It may not be until next year's regular flight to Mars commences. We cannot specifically start the engines of TS Expedition just for you," Hong Zewei shrugged. "But you don't have to worry, we have plenty of food and fresh water here, and some things you can relax with. I'll get people to arrange rooms for you and register ID cards. Except for the fact that you have no authority to update Twitter, and no work, you are the same as everyone else in the colony."</br>
</br>
Bris nodded. "Thank you..."</br>
</br>
He was very satisfied with being alive.</br>
</br>
As for staying here for a year, it may not be a bad thing.</br>
</br>
"You're welcome," Hong Zewei said softly. "That's all. I suggest you take a shower first and change into some clean clothes... and then take some hangover pills. If there is still some time left, you can take a nap. But remember in three hours, there will be dinner and an interview."</br>
</br>
"Interview?" Bris asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Hong Zewei shrugged. "We must let the outside world know that you have been rescued, and we didn't accidentally kill another man. Also, you must want to let your family know about your current state. I hope that you can cooperate."</br>
</br>
Bris nodded and didn't think much of it.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether the other party's salvation is sincere or not, they ultimately saved them from the hands of the reaper.</br>
</br>
Even just for retribution, he would fully cooperate with their interviews.</br>
</br>
Just that Bris didn't imagine that the gratitude and tears he showed in the interview would become a political chip in the hands of a candidate.</br>
</br>
And this chip would become the last gram to tip the balance in the primaries...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1256: It Can“t Get Worse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There was no doubt that the rescue was successful.</br>
</br>
When the interviews showed images of the rescued astronauts speaking emotionally with their families, they deeply touched everyone who was concerned about Ares.</br>
</br>
On Twitter.</br>
</br>
On Facebook.</br>
</br>
It was a topic discussed on every major social media platform in the UA.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade may not be as evil as the Capitol described them to be."</br>
</br>
"Maybe there were misunderstandings between us, maybe the Capitol should explain this?"</br>
</br>
"Thank God, anyway, peace is good..."</br>
</br>
"Joseph Kennedy is great!"</br>
</br>
"The Ares incident once again reflected the incompetency of our political system. From NASA disregarding Celestial Trade's warning, to the failure of the secretary of state to reach an agreement with Celestial Trade on the rescue, to the Capitol blaming Celestial Trade for disregarding human life… to finally, a senator saving the seven astronauts."</br>
</br>
"It was a terrible term, but fortunately it's over!"</br>
</br>
"President Kennedy was the president that received the highest approval rating in history... I hope that Kennedy is as wise as his great-grandfather."</br>
</br>
To summarize the incident, Joseph Kennedy visited Xin and started volleyball diplomacy with Jiang Chen. He finally succeeded in "convincing" Celestial Trade and became friends with Jiang Chen himself. Celestial Trade sent troops and successfully rescued the astronauts from Ares.</br>
</br>
It was widely analyzed that if Joseph Kennedy is successfully elected as the president of the UA, he would be able to repair the increasingly tense diplomatic relations between the two countries, restore Hill's failure of returning to the Asia-Pacific and space strategy, and dismantle the iron curtain between the East and the West, while finally lead the country and the world in a better direction...</br>
</br>
"We were played!"</br>
</br>
Morgan was immersed in thoughts while he stared at the newspaper on the table.</br>
</br>
He envisioned a variety of scenarios, but he did not think B City Consortium would work with Future Group.</br>
</br>
After the fall of the Freemasonry, the WASP Alliance lost an enemy. Wall Street was completely under Anglo-Saxons' control, whch gave Morgan an illusion that he replaced Rothschild as the financial world emperor.</br>
</br>
No, not an illusion.</br>
</br>
If he added his assets with the assets divided up from Rothschild and then converted it into dollars, he would indeed be the richest man in the world.</br>
</br>
However, now, he suddenly realized that he seemed to have underestimated the man on the other side of the ocean.</br>
</br>
"You mean," Morgan looked at the man standing at his desk and softly said, "We lost?"</br>
</br>
He was the finance manager in Kerry's campaign, and also the insider of Morgan in Kerry's team.</br>
</br>
The support rate of Kerry and Joseph was originally similar, but because of the Ares incident, the fine balance had now tipped to Joseph's favor.</br>
</br>
</br>
The man's expression was stiff as he nodded.</br>
</br>
"If there is no turning point, the victory of the primaries has been decided."</br>
</br>
According to the latest poll after Ares incident, Joseph's party support rate rose from 27% to 39% today. This number was already quite shocking. After all, in addition to the three most promising candidates, there were several other candidates who also have their own supporters.</br>
</br>
Unless...</br>
</br>
Unless another "curse" fell upon the Kennedy family...</br>
</br>
The thought quickly appeared in his head, but immediately faded.</br>
</br>
Morgan shook his head and threw the idea to the back of his head.</br>
</br>
Assassinating Kennedy would be simply looking down on the intelligence of the population. Especially now, in a different era, without a Bay of Pig incident as the lore, it would be easy to kill someone, but it would be hard to come clean.</br>
</br>
What's more, although the strength of the B City Consortium was relatively weak, it was still a force to be reckoned with. Now the security forces around Kennedy would be close to the level of the president.</br>
</br>
After all, the candidate they brought up seemed to be one step away from the office.</br>
</br>
He sneered.</br>
</br>
Morgan reached out and pressed a few buttons on the phone. He called his "old friend" Rockefeller.</br>
</br>
The phone rang twice.</br>
</br>
It was a familiar and annoying voice.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me," Morgan said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
There was a cheerful but aged laughter.</br>
</br>
"Haha, my old friend, I was just betting with my wife and saying that you would definitely call me."</br>
</br>
"It seems that your gamble paid off?" Morgan's tone was sarcastic.</br>
</br>
"No," Rockefeller shook his head and said calmly. "The ending is always unexpected, isn't it?"</br>
</br>
In contrast to Morgan, Rockefeller and his allies in the Middle East initially put their chips on Hill. However, since the confrontation on the Pacific during the second half of last year, the Hill government seemed to have an unlucky streak. Rockefeller could only feel helpless with the result.</br>
</br>
He did not have any hope for the primaries since the start of this year.</br>
</br>
"Yes? It seems that even the luckiest will lose sometimes." Morgan laughed.</br>
</br>
"What about you? Have you won?" Rockefeller asked with slyness in his tone.</br>
</br>
"No, so I found you," Morgan sighed and hid the sarcasm in his tone. "Let's work together."</br>
</br>
"Work together?" Rockefeller raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
He could guess what Morgan would say next.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Morgan said directly. "If Joseph Kennedy comes to power, it is a nightmare for the military-industrial complex. In order to counter the pressure of the new Cold War Era, we must station more troops in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, not pushing for reconciliation. The UA has always been, and can only be a bald eagle, not a dove."</br>
</br>
"So you want to add another accident to the cursed history of the Kennedy family? With all due respect, this may be a terrible choice." Rockefeller shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No, no, my old friend, am I such an irrational person? There is still a general election after the primaries! Although we have lost the primaries, we can continue to bet on the general election!" Morgan said with a sneer.</br>
</br>
"That person is difficult to control. Although he does not have as much wealth as you and I, he absolutely does not lack money." Rockefeller shook his head. "And listen to his campaign, representing the interests of all the UA workers? Kill Wall Street? How is he a Republican? He is clearly a Dem—"</br>
</br>
"But he is a hawk! That's enough!" Morgan's hand slammed onto the table and he said firmly, "You and I know what the core of our interests is. I would rather a pig to sitting in that position than having Joseph Kennedy in the office!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1257: Three Outcomes</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The result of the Democratic Party's primaries was decided. The 41% support rate gave Joseph Kennedy an commanding victory.</br>
</br>
In flowers and applauses, Kennedy walked to the stage and waved to his supporters. Then, he shouted in his compelling and convincing voice.</br>
</br>
"We are standing at the crossroad of history. On our left is an abyss and on our right is a cliff. There is only one path we can take, which is straight forward, forward, and forward! The future of our family, our country, our entire humanity is there."</br>
</br>
In the cheers, he continued to shout loudly.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your vote. You have chosen me and I will stand with you."</br>
</br>
"All errors will be corrected!"</br>
</br>
"Thank you..."</br>
</br>
The members of the Democratic Party stood on the side of the podium and also applauded.</br>
</br>
Regardless of win or loss, whether regretful or not, they stood there with grace.</br>
</br>
Even Hill and Kerry, who were defeated in the primaries, gave their applause.</br>
</br>
After all, the lens of the media would undoubtedly reserve a close-up for them.</br>
</br>
Hill's expression was calm, but it was better to say that she was relieved.</br>
</br>
Kerry showed the slightest unwillingness to accept such a failure. At this moment, there was nothing to say. He could only vent his dissatisfaction in the applause to make his failure not look so embarrassing in front of the media.</br>
</br>
No one expected the fact that Hill not only hurt herself, and also hurt him as a result. This ultimately led the black horse, Joseph Kennedy, to snatch the victory.</br>
</br>
According to their next arrangement, the party would now work together. If Joseph was elected, he may be able to continue as the secretary of state...</br>
</br>
Kerry shook his head and sighed in his mind.</br>
</br>
Perhaps, he really did not have what it takes to be the president?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The same month.</br>
</br>
The Republican primaries was also decided.</br>
</br>
Another black horse won, but to some extent, it was expected.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the unreserved statements, or the motivating campaign promises, he gained a huge support rate among the blue-collars.</br>
</br>
He cussed Bush, whose father and brother were both presidents, to the point that he decided to withdraw from the election, he laughed at Rubio for his inability to satisfy his wife… every debate made the audience in front of their TVs laugh.</br>
</br>
There seemed to be no reason not to vote for him.</br>
</br>
On the day of the last speech before the primaries in March, he had already won the primaries as no rivals stood beside him on stage.</br>
</br>
Standing in front of his supporters, Trump waved his hand and fixed the microphone.</br>
</br>
He first thanked his supporters and reiterated his campaign platform.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he felt that the lack of opponents was too boring. He threw away the speech prepared for him and directed his attack at Joseph Kennedy, who was in the limelight.</br>
</br>
</br>
"...I know you think of Mr. Kennedy as a hero that saved the astronauts. Don't doubt, I am equally grateful for his contribution and for his efforts to save seven families."</br>
</br>
"However, have you ever thought about why he can convince the man? What trades have they reached? You haven't thought about it, they haven't told you, and we don't know." He exaggeratedly widened his eyes, spread his hands, and looked at the supporters.</br>
</br>
"I don't think the compromise of selling the nation's interest can bring long-lasting peace," Trump lifted his right hand and allowed his middle finger and thumb to sway together, as he revealed his signature move. "Even it can, I think that is also false! It is wrong!"</br>
</br>
"The UA president should give priority to the interests of its people!"</br>
</br>
"If I am elected president, I will definitely push the UA to join the Earth Defense Alliance, make our due contribution to the defense of extraterrestrial civilization, and end the situation that UA space companies are discriminated against on commercial aerospace projects... but there is one premise, I will definitely bring benefits to our people!"</br>
</br>
The atmosphere was once again ignited.</br>
</br>
The national flags waved under the stage and the cheers and applause echoed.</br>
</br>
Trump raised his hand, he smiled and nodded as he looked at the supporters under the stage with satisfaction,</br>
</br>
He knew that the words he had just said would definitely be criticized by the media.</br>
</br>
But he didn't care.</br>
</br>
You understand politics.</br>
</br>
I'm an expert at marketing.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In Xin across the Pacific Ocean, a general election came to an end.</br>
</br>
The general election system adopted by Xin was different from the UA election across the sea. The election began in the middle of last year. Without the party system, the person that received the most support from the Xin people would become the president.</br>
</br>
Standing on the lawn in front of the presidential palace, Zhang Yaping, dressed in a suit, walked to the rostrum.</br>
</br>
A dense crowd gathered in front of him.</br>
</br>
As early as an hour ago, his supporters had already gathered.</br>
</br>
The huge crowd even overflowed from the lawn onto the roads and blocked the traffic in front of the presidential palace.</br>
</br>
In order to maintain order at the scene, Celestial Trade sent a battalion of troops, dispatched armored vehicles and helicopters, assisted the police in arranging isolation lines, maintained order on the scene, and alerted to possible emergencies or even terrorist attacks.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping stopped for a moment and reminisced about what has happened over the past four years, before he adjusted the microphone, and put on a confident smile.</br>
</br>
His voice was very calm. There were no confrontational words, no exhilarating cheers, and everything seemed natural.</br>
</br>
"Before we start, please look down at the lawn under our feet."</br>
</br>
"Four years ago, we were here, and we ended the tyranny of President Edward, and led this country back on the right track."</br>
</br>
"After four years, we have become the most enviable country in the world."</br>
</br>
"History has already evaluated our choices, and I believe this evaluation must be positive. We have used our limited land and resources in just four years to complete a feat that most countries would need forty years or even a century to complete. Our GDP growth rate is also a miracle in world history."</br>
</br>
"You chose me and I will respond to your trust."</br>
</br>
"I assure you that in the next four years, Xin will remain the most advanced country in the world! It is still the place of hope in the world! We will be stronger and go further! And the lawn we are stepping on Is the starting point of all this, and the center of the future world, and even the entire solar system!"</br>
</br>
Passionate cheers and thunderous applause erupted in front of the presidential palace.</br>
</br>
The military band played the national anthem and raised the national flag.</br>
</br>
Looking at the rising flag, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Just four hours ago, he had received news from Bernice from the far away UA.</br>
</br>
The primaries were decided.</br>
</br>
The result was the same as the Xin election.</br>
</br>
As expected.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1258: Moments of Relaxation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The night the primaries ended, Jiang Chen sent a congratulatory message to Joseph Kennedy, who had become the candidate for the Democratic Party and who was preparing for the November election.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Mr. Kennedy, or should I say, future president." Jiang Chen pleasantly said, "You are one step closer to the Capitol."</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your help," Joseph said, flattered.</br>
</br>
"You're welcome. I hope that after you become the president, you can still remember the help we provided."</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Joseph reassured. "I will push for the UA to join the Earth Defense Alliance immediately, and withdraw the strategic bombers and missile systems deployed in Guam. Diplomacy through peace has always been my agenda. The era of diplomacy through power has passed. At the start of this term, the UA government will focus more on the future rather than focusing on something meaningless."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard Joseph's words, he smiled pleasantly.</br>
</br>
"Then I look forward to your first diplomatic visit after you're elected."</br>
</br>
After some more small talk, Jiang Chen hung up.</br>
</br>
In the next few months, B City Consortium would be responsible for the rest of the poker game. His opponent would be the billion-dollar real estate developer, backed by his "Twitter Empire". It would not be easy for Joseph to win the battle, but with the support of the consortium, it should not be an issue.</br>
</br>
After the call, Jiang Chen went to the kitchen, took a bottle of champagne out of the fridge, and went to the balcony in his pajamas.</br>
</br>
It was deep in the night; the sea glowed under the pristine moonlight. The trees swayed in the nightly breeze and gave off a feeling of peace and tranquility surreal to the bustling world.</br>
</br>
Feeling the sea breeze, Jiang Chen opened the bottle with his thumb and put the bottle close to his lips.</br>
</br>
The cold liquid washed away a lot of the dryness in his chest.</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at?"</br>
</br>
Natasha walked to Jiang Chen, unscrewed the vodka bottle, and leaned against the railing as she downed a sip.</br>
</br>
"Just getting some fresh air." Jiang Chen laughed and glanced at the bottle in her hand, then he jokingly said, "Are you not afraid of damaging your head if you drink hard liquor all day long?"</br>
</br>
"Is this hard liquor? For us, this is only a beverage." Natasha's lips turned into a beautiful curvature as she proudly raised her chest and glanced at the champagne in Jiang Chen's hand, "You, on the other hand, only women drink that kind of 'juice'. Isn't that too boring?"</br>
</br>
"Is it?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and disregarded her "provocative" look. He cast his gaze on the distant horizon and pretended to sigh. "You don't understand."</br>
</br>
"Don't understand?" Natasha stopped the bottle in mid-air as she frowned in confusion, "Don't understand what?"</br>
</br>
"Drinking is a way of life," Jiang Chen held the bottle in his hand and whispered, "Alcohol is like life, other than the spicy taste, there are other tastes also enjoyable..."</br>
</br>
</br>
Natasha rolled her eyes as she listened to Jiang Chen's narration.</br>
</br>
"I find you are becoming more and more talented in acting."</br>
</br>
"Not at all." With the bottle close to his mouth, Jiang Chen looked at the grinning Natasha and laughed, "Do you want to compete?"</br>
</br>
As soon as Natasha heard the word compete, she suddenly looked at Jiang Chen with vigilance.</br>
</br>
"Compete in what."</br>
</br>
She still remembered what happened last time.</br>
</br>
"It's better than..." His eyes turned slightly and stopped on the vodka in her hands. Then with a discreet grin, he said "Who is better at drinking? Drinking vodka."</br>
</br>
"Drinking vodka?" Natasha stared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen smiled and nodded.</br>
</br>
Natasha was suspicious about the idea.</br>
</br>
She didn't think she would ever lose in this competition.</br>
</br>
But she had a hunch that this guy must have some ulterior motives.</br>
</br>
The more she thought about it, the more she believed her hunch was right.</br>
</br>
After knowing each other for so long, she discovered this guy always hid something in his sleeves!</br>
</br>
"Afraid?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow as he continued to escalate the tension.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible." Natasha's eyebrows suddenly rose and her eyes met Jiang Chen's provocative gaze. Her beautiful eyes narrowed as she placed her arms on the railing and raised her chin slightly, she jokingly said, "Are you sure you want to drink vodka with me? Don't blame me for destroying your stomach."</br>
</br>
Are you kidding me!</br>
</br>
The blood of the Slavs was half blood and half alcohol.</br>
</br>
How could she lose more than the amount of alcohol?</br>
</br>
It's impossible to lose!</br>
</br>
Not to mention it's vodka.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Looking at Natasha's confident look, Jiang Chen nodded again and said with a smile, "Since you are so confident about winning, then let's play a game again. The person that lost..."</br>
</br>
"... Wait, wait, let's just drink, why do we have to play games?"</br>
</br>
As soon as she heard a game, Natasha felt somewhat nervous. She was not afraid of losing, but her body reacted physiologically to those two words.</br>
</br>
"Are you afraid?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Afraid?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen repeatedly provoked her again and again, and finally completely irritated her.</br>
</br>
"You're asking for it," Natasha said with menance in her eyes. "If you lose, I will make you run around naked on the beach in front of your house."</br>
</br>
This punishment was extremely harsh</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen really walked around the beach naked, he would definitely make international headlines for a week.</br>
</br>
Of course, Natasha did not really intend to honor this punishment.</br>
</br>
She just wanted to punish this bad guy and let him realize how unwise he was to annoy her.</br>
</br>
"No problem," Jiang Chen smiled and touched his chin while he looked at the beach. Then he thoughtfully said, "I will definitely not let you go since I will be the loser if that happened."</br>
</br>
"Hey, at least you have some conscience." Natasha grinned.</br>
</br>
"What about this?" Jiang Chen snapped his fingers and moved his gaze towards the lawn downstairs before an evil smile gradually formed. "If you lose, walk around the lawn downstairs..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen got closer to Natasha's ear and told her the evil idea with a voice that only she could hear.</br>
</br>
The pretty white face gradually turned red, then became completely white, before it was covered in redness again.</br>
</br>
"You!" Natasha gritted her teeth at the sly expression on his face, before she viciously said, "...good, very good! As long as you don't regret it..."</br>
</br>
How could this guy say such perverted things!</br>
</br>
So infuriating!</br>
</br>
She swore that this time she would not spare him.</br>
</br>
"Be rest assured, I never lie."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed, put down the champagne in his hand on the wooden table and looked at the door of the balcony and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha, help us get a box of vodka from the cellar. There is a girl here who is way too overconfident and wants to have a drinking competition with me."</br>
</br>
"Who are you saying is overconfident?" Natasha was not convinced.</br>
</br>
Ayesha leaned against the doorway of the balcony. She sighed and shook her head before she turned to walk up the stairs.</br>
</br>
She knew what Jiang Chen was going to do.</br>
</br>
If he used the storage dimension, even industrial alcohol could not make Jiang Chen pass out.</br>
</br>
Tonight, the big brainless fool is going to be suffer.</br>
</br>
To be honest, she didn't really understand.</br>
</br>
If Natasha didn't enjoy being "bullied" by him, why would she try to get into a situation like that?</br>
</br>
"What a waste."</br>
</br>
With the thought in her, a faint red hue covered her face as she muttered under her breath. Then, the girl headed down to the cellar.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"...give me the alcohol, I can drink more..."</br>
</br>
"That's enough. Let's call it a tie! A TIE!" Jiang Chen snatched the bottle from Natasha's hand as she was about to take another swig.</br>
</br>
He really did not want her to drink anymore.</br>
</br>
It was the first time he encountered someone that treated vodka like beer.</br>
</br>
If he allowed her to continue to drink like this, he would have to call an ambulance...</br>
</br>
"NOOO! I can drink! Bring me the alcohol... oh..."</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, Natasha suddenly stood up and rushed toward the bottle in Jiang Chen's hand before she pushed him onto the ground.</br>
</br>
There were a series of bangs, and the wooden floor was full of displaced items.</br>
</br>
On top of Jiang Chen, Natasha muttered drunkenly while she reached for the bottle in Jiang Chen's hand. "How can I lose... impossible."</br>
</br>
Terrible drunk!</br>
</br>
He looked speechlessly at Natasha who hung herself onto him before Jiang Chen turned to Xia Shiyu with a desperate look. However, he only received a cold stare in return.</br>
</br>
"I still have to work tomorrow...you should rest early. Don't stay up too late."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, who was wrapped in a bathrobe, sighed and disappeared at the intersection of the balcony. She left Jiang Chen behind.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then turned to Ayesha.</br>
</br>
The facts were simply despairing.</br>
</br>
Even the most gentle and obedient Ayesha, also subtly looked away; she pretended to be sightseeing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could not help but feel the negativities of this world.</br>
</br>
But to be honest, the softness pressing against him felt good.</br>
</br>
Especially the vibrant red lips, the hot air that was puffing onto his face, and the slightly intoxicated breath. At this moment, she was like a delicate red apple, ripe and delicious.</br>
</br>
It wouldn't be so bad to maintain this position?</br>
</br>
Just as this idea settled into Jiang Chen's mind and he began to relax the muscles on his shoulders, he suddenly had a bad feeling.</br>
</br>
He looked at Natasha, who started to pant heavily, and suddenly thought of something. His expression changed dramatically, and he desperately wanted hold her by her slim shoulders. However, Natasha, completely wrapped around him like an octopus, pinned him down.</br>
</br>
"Wait, wait, WAIT… Hold on, wait for me to get up, I will take you to the bathroom, don't – FU*K!"</br>
</br>
It was too late!</br>
</br>
"vomit—"</br>
</br>
Right on top of Jiang Chen's chest, the delicate red lips spilled everything without warning.</br>
</br>
Because the picture was too gruesome, it was not suitable to be described.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who sat on the side with her arms crossed, had an "I thought so" expression on her face. She nodded as she was pleased with the decision to not intervene.</br>
</br>
In general, Natasha had never gotten drunk, at least in Ayesha's memory.</br>
</br>
But if she did get drunk.</br>
</br>
Then she would let go of everything...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was absent, she would often grow furious at Natasha over this fact, especially for someone who enjoyed cleaniness...</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The next day, Kelvin reported back with additional information. Celestial City's Lab made new progress on the research of the Devil Worm's egg.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sluggishly finished breakfast and left with dark circles under his eye. Xia Shiyu drove him to the company.</br>
</br>
His beautiful assistant prepared a cup of coffee for him. Jiang Chen, who sunk into the chair, yawned profusely as he called Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Soon, Verdell Taylor's face appeared on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
The chemist and biologist from Frankberg was indeed an intelligent guy. Since he already made quite a number of amazing discoveries on Devil Worms that contributed significantly to the progress of the research, he was now elected as the person in charge of the whole project.</br>
</br>
Without any small talk, Verdell Taylor reported to Jiang Chen about the latest research progress on the eggs.</br>
</br>
"...they have a very short incubation period. The hatching process is only four to six weeks. We found a larva in these eggs that is about to end its incubation period. Now it is being cultivated in an artificial incubator. If everything goes smoothly, we will get the Devil Worm's larva  in a week."</br>
</br>
"How long does it take for a larva to grow into an adult?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"With sufficient organic matter and suitable temperatures, the theoretical estimate is twenty weeks. They will grow to two meters and can already begin to prey. After every ten weeks, they can grow 0.8 to 1 meter, and they will enter the growth stagnation period after their length reaches 15 to 20 meters."</br>
</br>
"What about their life expectancy period? How long can they live?" Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"By combining previous analysis with DNA analysis, they can theoretically survive up to fifty years," Verdell Taylor said earnestly. "They can go to sleep in extreme environments, slowly replenish oxygen in the blood, and reduce oxygen and organic consumption. They spend 80% of their time sleeping and 10% of their time hunting."</br>
</br>
Fifty years?</br>
</br>
Eradicating this species will not be easy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen bitterly smiled and asked.</br>
</br>
"What about the other 10%?"</br>
</br>
"Mating." Verdell Taylor shrugged.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Is there any good news?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, this is what I have to report next." Verdell Taylor nodded, and there was a glimmer of smugness in his eyes. "We found that Devil Worm's vocal cords are abnormally developed during the embryonic stage when we studied the larvae specimens. However, it is strange that adults do not rely on sound to transmit information but uses its tentacles and secretions that are normally contracted in the abdominal cavity."</br>
</br>
Because he couldn't understand, Jiang Chen quietly waited for Dr. Verdell Taylor to continue.</br>
</br>
"Later, after careful study, we found an organ in their body that is comparable to the 'Seismometer'!" Verdell Taylor's voice was mixed with a hint of excitement. "We have observed this phenomenon on bats, but its function is obviously more powerful!"</br>
</br>
"Using this special organ, they are very sensitive to the frequency and azimuth of shock waves. They can even discriminate the speed and direction of the prey through frequency changes! It is with this ability that they can easily lock in the position of prey and oxygen supply layers several kilometers deep."</br>
</br>
"Is this good news?" Jiang Chen smiled and said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Verdell Taylor nodded affirmatively while still excited, "Only by knowing them can you know how to deal with them! After studying the larva, we have successfully found the shock frequency that is most easily captured by them. It is now being tested by frontline scientists. If our conclusions are finally proven to work, we can artificially create this 'noise'."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes suddenly lit up.</br>
</br>
He already understood what Dr. Verdell Taylor wanted to say.</br>
</br>
If Devil Worms relied on shock waves, sound waves and other forms of vibration to identify the prey, then as long as they could artificially create the waves, it meant they could blindfold Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
With this thought in mind, Jiang Chen also began to feel the same excitement.</br>
</br>
Due to the proliferation of Devil Worms, the work of the colony was now almost completely stagnant. Even soldiers, without the protection of armored vehicles, did not dare to venture out. Not to mention the exploration rovers, as well as the reconstruction of the destroyed farm.</br>
</br>
Now, a simple and effective method was almost in front of him!</br>
</br>
"As long as a shock wave generating device can be built, it can constantly emits shock waves to the bottom of the colony..."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Verdell Taylor nodded and said with certainty. "This is what we imagined in the experiment! We only need to find the most sensitive frequency to Devil Worms and then use this to turn the colony into a 'blind spot'!"</br>

</br>
After the conversation with Verdell Taylor, the assistant walked in and placed a cup of fragrant coffee on his desk.</br>
</br>
"I have already added sugar, please drink it slowly." With a charming smile, the assistant said gently, "Is there anything else?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing... um, can you please send these documents to CEO Xia's office?" Jiang Chen looked at the documents that had been signed on the table and passed them to her. "Let her... Ha, please ask her to send the file coded N101 file for Future Heavy Industries to my mailbox."</br>
</br>
Because he was too sleepy, Jiang Chen couldn't stop yawning.</br>
</br>
When his eyes met with the grin of the assistant, Jiang Chen immediately knew what she had in mind, so he stared back.</br>
</br>
The girl immediately hid her smile and lowered her head. She held onto the documents and secretly spat out her tongue before she left the office in quick steps.</br>
</br>
He looked at the closed door, smiled and shook his head. Then he sipped on the coffee.</br>
</br>
"Not too bad."</br>
</br>
He put aside the slightly hot coffee and opened the holographic computer on his desk.</br>
</br>
Soon, an email was sent to his computer via Jean.</br>
</br>
[No. N101, Security Level S]</br>
</br>
The content recorded in this email was the highest level of confidentiality for Future Heavy Industries. However, the information won't be confidential in a few days because the world would soon learn the contents contained in this email.</br>
</br>
When he clicked open the email, the pale blue lines emerged from the holographic screen, and a three-dimensional image was interwoven in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Suspended in the air was a long and magnificent ship. The streamlined hull gave off an unparalleled sci-fi vibe. The giant engines that occupied the entire rear of the ship and the frightening guns located in the front all fulfilled a young boy's dream.</br>
</br>
The ship looked like something from a movie.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was not model from a movie.</br>
</br>
At this moment, at the shipyard outside of Celestial Trade, the million-ton ship named "Envoy-class" entered the final commissioning stage.</br>
</br>
With his fingers extended, Jiang Chen gently clicked on the figure of the starship, and the transparent text box immediately appeared beside his hand. A line of light blue text emerged in the form of a textbox and the parameters of the starship were detailed in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
[</br>
</br>
Envoy-class Starship.</br>
</br>
Ship Name: Unnamed</br>
</br>
Tonnage: One million tons.</br>
</br>
Main Weapon: Mass Accelerator (located at the head of the ship, capable of installing electromagnetic catapult carrier, can be used to launch electromagnetic acceleration mass shells.)</br>
</br>
Sub-weapon: None.</br>
</br>
Staff: 2000 Personnel.</br>
</br>
Main Engine: One Lightning 01 Engine (nuclear fusion engine with magnetic constrain nuclear fusion technology, located at the rear of the ship, providing longitudinal thrust for the entire starship in cruise mode.)</br>
</br>
</br>
Secondary Engine: Two Shuttle 09 engines (the improved version of the original Shuttle 07 engine, using ion propulsion technology, located at the front and rear section at the bottom of the starship, providing omni-direction thrust for the starship in non-cruising mode.)</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Completion: 100%</br>
</br>
]</br>
</br>
In accordance with the plan developed by the Earth Defense Alliance Committee, this Envoy-class starship did not mount any weapon module except for the mass accelerator almost the same length as the hull, located at the axial position of the ship.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that the tonnage of the Envoy-class starship could outclass an entire aircraft carrier battle group.</br>
</br>
Unlike marine ships, starship allowed for more creativity in design. As long as the strength of material permitted and the engine power was sufficient, without considering the cost, Future Heavy Industries could double the tonnage of the starship, but it would be unnecessary.</br>
</br>
The significance of the "Envoy-class" was mainly to achieve a breakthrough from zero to one. The ship would be the training ground for the officers and combatants of the future Earth Defense Alliance fleet. The current tonnage would be more than sufficient for this task.</br>
</br>
What's more, increasing the tonnage to the starship would not necessarily have a positive impact on the combat effectiveness. The key was to use every inch of space available to maximize the power per tonnage.</br>
</br>
Therefore, future million-ton class starship would be based on Envoy-class and further modified. Once the design was optimized, the tonnage would be increased to the next threshold.</br>
</br>
It was also the direction Jiang Chen gave to Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
"Jean, search in the database for me. Look at how long until the completion of the Envoy-class," Jiang Chen leaned back against his chair and said to the air.</br>
</br>
The signal light of the watch flickered, and the holographic appearance of Jean appeared beside his hand.</br>
</br>
A stream of data flashed through Jean's pupils, and she quickly replied.</br>
</br>
"Based on the latest information on file, the main engine circuit review has been completed. Only the last two inspection steps are needed. It is expected to be officially completed in mid-April."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about Future Military? How is the progress on the weapon module?"</br>
</br>
"...searching..."</br>
</br>
Another stream of data appeared.</br>
</br>
Soon, a list was presented to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When Future Heavy Industries built the fleet, Future Military was also busy working.</br>
</br>
From missile launchers to ship-borne electromagnetic pulse cannons, to weapons such as high-power laser beams beyond this era, even plasma torpedoes that were still in the experimental stage... Any weapons that Pan-Asia Cooperation once thought of, Jiang Chen established corresponding projects.</br>
</br>
Although based on the plan of the Earth Defense Alliance, this first-generation starship was designed for training and designing purposes with no weapons installed. But when necessary, the starship could be fully equipped with weapon modules that rule the Solar System.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen appreciated the results of Future Military, there was a knock on his door</br>
</br>
His index finger swiped in the air, and all the holographic screens and three-dimensional images were gathered together. Jiang Chen then looked to the door.</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open, and a rare guest, Dr. Amos, came in.</br>
</br>
"Is there something you need?" Jiang Chen looked at him in surprise.</br>
</br>
"It's about Project 071." After he grabbed a chair, Amos sat down. It seemed that he felt that he was a bit too casual as he looked at Jiang Chen apologetically and asked, "Umm, you don't mind right–"</br>
</br>
"Of course not, just sit down." Jiang Chen laughed. "Compared to the small details, I'm more fascinated with what you discovered."</br>
</br>
"I found the lost drone."</br>
</br>
"You found it!?" Jiang Chen looked at him, astounded, as he immediately sat up straight.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Amos nodded and said seriously. "Not just that. I also found some special things in the ruins through the drone. Perhaps those things can explain why we encountered those monsters on Mars."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Mars colony.</br>
</br>
Near Mine 071.</br>
</br>
Near the long-abandoned mine, there were a few new tire marks.</br>
</br>
Two armored vehicles and a reinforced engineering vehicle were parked by the sand dunes about 100 meters away from the mine. The overturned rover was not far away, and traces of the Devil Worms' bite marks were still visible on the chassis.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai looked out the window, then pressed a button on his helmet and got in touch with the coordinator on the Expedition.</br>
</br>
"...we have reached the target area, requesting airstrike support."</br>
</br>
"This is the Expedition, the airstrike request has been approved, please place the airstrike beacon within 30 seconds."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Soon, the top cover of an armored vehicle popped open, and a soldier leaned out half of his body, took a flare gun, and pulled the trigger at the dune on the other side.</br>
</br>
The red beacon plunged into the sand dunes and transmitted coordinates to the missile that was falling from the synchronous orbit.</br>
</br>
Soon, a black spot that dragged a long flaming tail gradually appeared in the sky.</br>
</br>
Before the black spot became clear, the soldier got back into the vehicle and closed the top cover with force.</br>
</br>
"BOOM——!"</br>
</br>
The tremor was sent up from the ground into the vehicle.</br>
</br>
The howling gravel blew the sands hundreds of meters away and covered the entire convey with a thick layer of sand.</br>
</br>
Soon, from deep underground, there was another muffled noise.</br>
</br>
The bursting flame engulfed all the tunnels inside and completely flushed out the area.</br>
</br>
The convoy continued to move forward for about ten meters.</br>
</br>
The engineering vehicle stopped first. The staff inside operated the robotic arm, took out a four-meter-long pyramid, and placed it on the sand. The two armored vehicles surrounded it while the electromagnetic pulse cannon on top carefully watched the surrounding for possible threats.</br>
</br>
Their task today was very simple.</br>
</br>
There was a total of four pyramids that must be pushed into the ground, then their mission would be completed.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure this thing is really useful?" Inside the vehicle, Zhang Hai looked through the sight glass and watched the mechanical arm slowly push the pyramid into the ground inch by inch, as he couldn't be convinced by the usefulness of this action.</br>
</br>
"It is useful in theory."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang, who sat across from the Marine Corps Captain, looked at the tablet in his hand, and while he browsed the manual data on the screen, he casually responded, "They are like bats at night, and all we have to do is get a few high decibel speakers, bury them into the ground, and make noise into the ground ten kilometers below without interruption for 24 hours. If I am those bugs, I will definitely not want to stay here."</br>
</br>
Celestial City Research Institute explained that the latest task of the front-line researchers was to find this frequency through trial and error.</br>
</br>
</br>
These pyramids were originally used to survey and map the geological information of the mantle circle. After several researchers' modification, they turned into a seismic wave transmitter used to make "noise" at different frequencies.</br>
</br>
The nuclear fusion battery built into the "pyramid" could work till next year. The next step was to throw a life signal detector into the mine to detect the Devil Worms nearby. Therefore, they could detect the frequency of noise those bugs responded most violently to...</br>
</br>
In addition, in order to prevent the bugs from destroying them, the construction vehicle also had to reinforce a few steel bars.</br>
</br>
It's that simple?" the Marine Corps soldier next to Zhang Hai asked with clear uncertainty in his tone.</br>
</br>
He was a newcomer named Koenig, an immigrant from Italy, with the rank of corporal. He served as a commando in the team and replaced the wounded Sergeant Miller.</br>
</br>
When they were on the Expedition, they used the training program in the Phantom helmet to simulate combat with the Devil Worms. In the simulation training, they were taught that any contact with the ground was fatal.</br>
</br>
"It's that simple." Wang Qiang replied without much change in his emotion while his fingers quickly clicked on the tablet, he then looked at Zhang Hai, "Can I trouble you to move closer to there? There may be solar wind outside, my signal is terrible."</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
Zhangh Hai pressed on his helmet and ordered the soldier driving, and soon the armored vehicle drove next to the engineering vehicle.</br>
</br>
The four-meter-long pyramid had been completely submerged in the sand, and only a platform less than a foot high was visible on the surface. In order to prevent this thing from being completely buried under the sand, the engineering vehicle also inserted a Xin flag on top of the platform as a marking</br>
</br>
"Are you done?"</br>
</br>
When Zhang Hai saw the robotic arm that started to retract, he asked Wang Qiang.</br>
</br>
"One is not enough, we need about four," Wang Qiang set the parameters on the tablet, and then pressed the start button, "We need to enclose the mine into a square, and then emit shock waves at the same time. We will use it collect the data.</br>
</br>
"This thing is really that useful? Are you sure? I don't feel any change at all." Koenig doubted his remark.</br>
</br>
"Because it emits ultrasonic waves, and because you are standing on top of the shock wave, the impact you'll feel is at most your heart rate becoming half a beat faster," Wang Qiang pursed his lips, then he put away the tablet. "If you stand directly under it, you will feel what is worse than death."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the first underground floor of Future Building.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen walked out of the elevator, he followed Dr. Amos and they made their way to the lab.</br>
</br>
"After you were in a coma that day, I lost the connection with the drone. At first, I thought the drone was broken, but then I thought about it, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong. If the memory of Gaia civilization used our drone as a springboard to communicate with you, there is no reason it would destroy the drone."</br>
</br>
"So?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"So, I wonder if the Gaia civilization made a small modification to the communication frequency of our drone's communication chip through some special means. After all, our research on Klein particles is only at its infancy, but their technology was quite mature. If you want to plug the USB into a computer before 1994, you have to make a conversion interface or simply upgrade the hardware."</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos took out his ID card from his pocket, swiped it on the door and welcomed Jiang Chen in, "Sure enough, after more than a month, I found the frequency... Honestly, I was so close to giving up."</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos walked up to the computer, tapped a few times on the touchpad, opened the holographic screen, and showed a PowerPoint presentation ito Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Jiang Chen asked with a slight frown.</br>
</br>
"Another piece of memory, but what I found is somewhat different from the one you encountered." Amos shrugged. "It's very short. If you saw is a history of that world, then this is just a diary. Or memoir. After reading it, I made a slide show based off of my memory."</br>
</br>
"A diary?" Jiang Chen looked at the image on the holographic screen and asked, "Whose diary?"</br>
</br>
"The last Gaia," after a pause, Amos continued, "The one who died in that ruin."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
My neighbor left.</br>
</br>
He left the key to me before he left.</br>
</br>
Now I'm the last Gaia to guard the tomb of our civilization.</br>
</br>
When I die, our civilization will officially end.</br>
</br>
There is still a "Flower of Memory" in my hand, and it has only a trace of energy left, but I think I may be able to leave something for myself...</br>
</br>
Perhaps the latecomers will be confused as to why we went from prosperity to extinction.</br>
</br>
I have thought about this question countless times, until I took this last Flower of Memory in my hand, I finally understood the problem.</br>
</br>
It is not disaster, but despair, that destroyed our civilization.</br>
</br>
When the apocalypse arrived, hundreds of millions of our people died in front of us.</br>
</br>
Some died from the disaster itself, but more died from our vulnerability to disasters.</br>
</br>
We have considered thousands of possibilities, including immigration to the still infant earth and flying to further galaxies to continue our civilization. I believe that we can survive on the unknown land, but in the end, we chose to leave a tombstone that still contained our last dignity.</br>
</br>
Very unexpectedly, I felt somewhat liberated to have such an ending.</br>
</br>
Maybe I have some regrets as I can't smell the wonderful fragrance anymore nor can I sense the intoxicating spiritual rhythm anymore... But this is just a regret for my remaining 3,000 Mars days, not for our civilization itself.</br>
</br>
There is no regret for our civilization.</br>
</br>
Maybe this ending is not so bad after all?</br>
</br>
In the last moment, we chose the most democratic way of voting to decide our own destiny.</br>
</br>
It was probably the fairest vote we have ever had.</br>
</br>
The result was a unanimous agreement.</br>
</br>
Everyone chose to stay.</br>
</br>
We placed the key on the spacecraft and watched it go.</br>
</br>
Ironically, we obviously never placed hope in the cold starry sky. But at this moment, we imagined that one day there will be another spirit, or soul, to write our story in another language...</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Like a poem."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made an evaluation after reading through the memory.</br>
</br>
"The popular narrative method of Gaia civilization was not in the form of words, but to communicate directly through the spirit. I believe that you have experienced that feeling, the feeling is not easy to describe with words, I just wrote it down based on my memory." Amos shrugged. "But the most critical part is not the beginning, but the ruins he mentioned about."</br>
</br>
About the ruins?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned slightly and looked at Amos.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Their ruins are divided into three parts, part of which is the living area, which is the part you had seen. The second part, is the database which can be opened by the key, and the data inside is stored in a kind of flower called 'Flower of Memory'."</br>
</br>
After Amos said that, he had a rare look of eagerness.</br>
</br>
"If I didn't guess wrong, that should be the thing we encountered! It can connect directly with the spirit of a person, and then directly input the knowledge stored in it into a person's brain! God... I dare to say that if this is unearthed, scientists all over the world will go mad!"</br>
</br>
</br>
Transfer knowledge directly through the spirit, or neural connection?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes showed a moment of shock.</br>
</br>
It works like this?</br>
</br>
It was not like he did not see anything similar, for example, the virtual reality learning system readily available in the apocalypse could also achieve rapid literacy. However, the mechanism of this system was only to extend the time in the virtual reality system to allow the user to experience a deep sleep state of two hours or more in a real time of one hour.</br>
</br>
In the deep sleep state, people's knowledge acceptance would accelerate while the load on the brain would be reduced to a minimum...</br>
</br>
However, a premise still existed for this particular learning method, that was, people must spend the energy to learn.</br>
</br>
According to Dr. Amos's description, the Flower of Memory could completely abandon the learning process, rather, it could teach through empowerment. It would be similar to the idea described in martial arts or Xuanhuan novels in the passing of power... You're too weak? No worries, let me give you tens of thousands of years of cultivation!</br>
</br>
"You mean, that Flower of Memory can turn an idiot into a scientist?"</br>
</br>
"That is too much of an exaggeration. Even if ordinary people possessed the memories, it would be useless if they can't digest them. However, if you let a scholar with a certain foundation, or at least someone with scientific thinking, touch the Flower of Memory, he or she undoubtedly will become the most knowledgeable person in the world! Because that person will inherit the knowledge of a higher civilization! Even if it's only a part of it!" Amos gazed directly at Jiang Chen and his eyes bloomed with enthusiasm. "So, I'm confident to say that, this, once unearthed, will make scientists around the world go mad!"</br>
</br>
No physical object could withstand more than three billion years of time, perhaps hadron materials could, but only one existed after all. Therefore, the Gaia civilization chose to store all the memories of its own civilization in the Flower of Memory. It doesn't possess any physical existence, but rather used the spirit of an organism as a vessel.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen grew more confused.</br>
</br>
So, what is the Flower of Memory?</br>
</br>
Why can it exist for more than three billion years?</br>
</br>
Perhaps this question can only be answered when the ruins are uncovered.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen returned from his thoughts and exchanged eye contact with the zealous Amos. Then, he suddenly realized something and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, after the ruins are unearthed, I'll definitely reserve one for you," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
He patted Amos' shoulder and responded to his hope and fanaticism.</br>
</br>
Amos looked gratefully at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, I really don't know how to thank you."</br>
</br>
"Don't thank me, your contribution to Future Group is worthy of this reward," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Judging from the description of the Flower of Memory of the Gaia civilization, there must be more than one. After all, the legacy of civilization could not be simply inherited by one person, not to mention that a person's brain could only hold so many things.</br>
</br>
After all, it was a technology from a civilization that dug through the core of a planet and its advanced nature should not be doubted. While not all technologies could be beneficial to human, even the tip of the iceberg would be enough to allow a little-known scientist stand at the top of the field.</br>
</br>
Therefore, it should not benefit any outsiders. Jiang Chen simply did not intend to disclose this at all.</br>
</br>
As a distinguished researcher of Future Group, a part of the Flower of Memory should be his.</br>
</br>
"Right, you said that the ruins are divided into three parts, what is the third part?" Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"The third part is the specimen library." Amos replied with a positive tone.</br>
</br>
"The specimen library?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Yes, and it's a specimen library that was damaged," Amos nodded. "If my guess is accurate, the Devil Worms we met on Mars escaped from the specimen library. Other than that, according to that memory, in dealing with the apocalypse, the Gaia civilization scientists synthesized an oxygen-producing fungus that can grow in extreme environments, but for some unknown reason, the project was never completed."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, the oxygen-producing fungus specimen we found on Mars is..."</br>
</br>
"It may be an unfinished product. Of course, this is just my guess," Amos shrugged. "They have been in disrepair. The spores of the oxygen-producing bacteria have spread from the specimen library to the outside world. They have adapted to Mars through the evolution of hundreds of millions of years and modified the atmosphere. Later, the species such as Devil Worms ended their hibernation, left the damaged specimen library and created the current underground ecosystem."</br>
</br>
"...that is to say." Jiang Chen suddenly had a bad feeling.</br>
</br>
"I'm afraid it's not just Devil Worms and oxygen-making fungus. There are a lot of things we haven't seen before," Dr. Amos took a deep breath. "In fact, I thought it was odd, but how much luck does a food chain need to sustain through hundreds of millions or even billions of years of evolution?"</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1263: Variables</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Not just Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
There could be other species deep in the mantle.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried to search for figures other than Devil Worms in the memory of the Gaia civilization, including the species that Gaias were trying to get rid of, but unfortunately, the light ball did not contain any of the names?</br>
</br>
But it made sense.</br>
</br>
If human civilization one day had to set up a tombstone for itself, it would probably not spend too much ink on the irrelevant topics. Or at most, use powerful creatures like tigers or lions to prove itself to the future civilization on how the human civilization stood out among the species and came to the top of the food chain.</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos's findings were included in the database, labeled as the highest confidential level. and tagged as a part of Project 071. After he hesitated for a second, Jiang Chen decided not to disclose the details of these species to the researchers in the Devil Worms research team.</br>
</br>
After all, he couldn't explain why he could be so sure that there were Mars creatures other than Devil Worms, on the planet tens of millions of kilometers away in the absence of specimens,.</br>
</br>
It was related to the memory of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
The memory of the Gaia civilization was classified the top secret within Celestial Trade, even more confidential than the Klein particles...</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen left Dr. Amos's lab, he returned to the office.</br>
</br>
His assistant reported that while he was away, President Zhang Yaping's assistant had been here.</br>
</br>
"President Zhang's assistant? What is he looking for?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"He left a letter. I put it on your desk," his assistant replied respectfully.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen found the letter of his desk, glanced through the letter, then placed it at the corner of his table.</br>
</br>
It was an invitation letter.</br>
</br>
Tomorrow evening, in the banquet hall of the Heart of the Sea, there would be a national celebration dinner. The protagonist was the Liberal Party Leader, the first president of Xin, Zhang Yaping. The purpose of the dinner was to celebrate the victory of the election campaign, to thank his campaign sponsors, and to communicate with the different sectors and communities within Xin.</br>
</br>
To be able to attend a banquet of this level, the person must be a political figure at least in the cabinet minster and parliamentary speaker level. In addition, outstanding entrepreneurs, representatives from communities, and even international bankers... were all part of the guest list. With the current international influence of Xin, Jiang Chen would not even be surprised if a leader of another country showed up.</br>
</br>
As a supporter of President Zhang, Jiang Chen naturally would be present to support him.</br>
</br>
After all, for those eligible to be invited to the banquet, they all understood what happened behind the scene.</br>
</br>
They understood who is the biggest winner of this election.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After work, Jiang Chen returned home.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was about to take a shower when he found Natasha was at the entrance of the living room. She looked at him, somewhat embarrassed.</br>
</br>
After she woke up from the hangover, Ayesha had told her what had happened last night. This included her drunken state, and how she puked all over Jiang Chen...</br>
</br>
"Hey, sorry about last night."</br>
</br>
Natasha blushed, crossed her arms before she scratched her cheeks in awkwardness and looked away.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about it." Jiang Chen rolled his eyes and put on his slippers.</br>
</br>
What else could he say?</br>
</br>
After all, he was partially to be blamed for what happened last night. If it were not for the fact that he tried to tease her, nothing would have happened.</br>
</br>
But to be frank, he did not expect she would suddenly get so serious and refuse to admit defeat even after being so drunk...</br>
</br>
Natasha saw how quiet Jiang Chen was and revealed an awkward smile as she said shyly.</br>
</br>
"Also, I remember you said that it was a draw, right?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Without caring for the girl that constantly bothered him about who actually won, Jiang Chen went and took a shower</br>
</br>
After he changed into pajamas, Jiang Chen came out of the bathroom. Since there was still time before dinner, he went to the office.</br>
</br>
As he walked in, he saw Ayesha waiting for him on the sofa in the room. So, he walked over with a smile and sat beside her.</br>
</br>
"The Morgan Consortium and the Rockefeller Consortium may have joined forces." Ayesha took out a document she was holding and placed it nicely on Jiang Chen's knees ,then she gently rubbed off the water droplets on his neck.</br>
</br>
"Joined forces?" As he enjoyed Ayesha's caress, Jiang Chen was intrigued by the document in his hand as he flipped open the first page, "I thought they were out."</br>
</br>
"They would rather have a person who claims he will kill Wall Street come to power than to accept a dovish president," Ayesha whispered. "This is the original words of Penny, she obtained the information from the informant."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the document and his expression began to turn serious.</br>
</br>
Morgan and Rockefeller joined forces?</br>
</br>
He probably had a hunch. Morgan bet on Kerry, and Rockefeller kept the chip on Hill as always. The two consortiums were both members of the military-industrial complex. The victor in the gamble would only affect the distribution of interests.</br>
</br>
Obviously, theMorgan and Rockefeller believed that if Joseph Kennedy rose to power, it would inevitably affect their common interests. After all, Mr. Kennedy mentioned a lot of issues concerning the UA military, defense budget, and diplomatic strategy.</br>
</br>
And the military-industrial complex was unwilling to concede on these issues.</br>
</br>
"Be prepared for the worst." Jiang Chen sighed and said after a moment of thought, "Even if Joseph came to power, I'm afraid there will be resistance. We must guarantee that at all time, the initiative is on our side."</br>
</br>
Ayesha sat quietly and waited for Jiang Chen's instructions.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation in South America?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Which element are you referring to?" Ayesha tilted her head and asked.</br>
</br>
"Global Power Grid," Jiang Chen responded. "It has been more than a year and our salesmen has just cracked the door to Ecuador. The transmission corridor to Brazil is still not open. I want to know about the progress on that side."</br>
</br>
Ecuador may be the only country in South America willing to open its doors to Celestial Trade, because Celestial Trade more than once hinted at the possibility of another space elevator on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Considering the particularity that space elevators could only be built on the equator, Ecuador had a natural competitive advantage.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, the country coveted the huge economic benefits that the space elevator would bring, and on the other hand, the country also faced many challenges such as energy shortage. Ecuador naturally did all it could to court Celestial Trade by giving land, policy, money… well, they did not have money.</br>
</br>
Since last year, the UA exported nuclear power technology to South American countries to contain Celestial Trade's plan to promote the Global Power Grid. Since the UA historically had a strong influence in the region itself, the cable that Celestial Trade built across the ocean to Ecuador, could not gain any distance further to Brazil on the east.</br>
</br>
Peru and Colombia were two big mountains that blocked the passage, and these two countries were traditional UA allies. So, of course, they chose to side with the UA.</br>
</br>
"This year is the year of the UA election. In the past, the UA typically adopted a conservative policy in the election year. This is our opportunity." Jiang Chen's fingers tapped on the arm of the sofa, "If, Colombia and Peru continue to maintain a non-cooperative attitude, I allow you to use special means."</br>
</br>
The special means referred to the act of providing weapons to the anti-government armed forces, providing funds to the opposition, and so on. This also included any means that may lead to a war in the country.</br>
</br>
"We are supporting Joseph Kennedy. Is it okay to do this at this time?" Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"No problem, just don't let the UA know what we're doing underneath the table." Jiang Chen laughed. He took out an invitation from his pocket and handed it to Ayesha. "Do you have time tomorrow night? Join me for a banquet?"</br>
</br>
"Isn't Sister Xia Shiyu here? She is more suitable than me to attend such an occasion..." Ayesha's expression looked slightly odd as she didn't know why Jiang Chen changed the topic.</br>
</br>
She attended a dinner once with Jiang Chen, but she did not participate in other ones after that one time.</br>
</br>
The restrictive feeling of the gown made her feel very constrained and uneasy, and she was not good at drinking or chatting. Even if she attended, she could not offer any help since she often remained silent.</br>
</br>
"Because we have to solve this problem as soon as possible." Jiang Chen shook the document in his hand, "and the best way to solve the problem is at the banquet tomorrow."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1264: That Is Not My Hometown</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the top floor of the Heart of the Sea, the semi-open arc dome was brightly lit.</br>
</br>
It was the most luxurious banquet hall in the entire Xin, and it usually hosted the most prestigious events of the country. In addition to state banquets that were usually sponsored by Future Group, private functions or business functions must pay a daunting twenty million Xin New dollars to rent the venue.</br>
</br>
Based on the current international influence of Xin and the Earth Defense Alliance, the banquet held here at this moment was probably one of the most influential events in the world. It was even comparable to a state banquet of the Capitol. Perhaps the dishes available were not the finest delicacies, but outside the dinner itself, the decisions made at the event dictated the future direction of the world.</br>
</br>
"Haha, President Zhang, congratulations!" A man in a suit came forward and congratulated him.</br>
</br>
"It seems that God is destined to let Xin continue to prosper, because every citizen of Xin has made the right choice." In a black evening gown, a representative of a community raised her glass with a smile and offered her congratulatory words.</br>
</br>
President Zhang smiled humbly to the praising words and leaft the most graceful image he could to the honorable guest. However, the corner of his mouthed curved up and the flush on his face showed off the proudness in his mind.</br>
</br>
This victory came very easily and could even be described as expected.</br>
</br>
However, even knowing this point, the little vanity in people's minds was still fulfilled.</br>
</br>
Who would have thought that the person who lived in exile in New Zealand four years ago turned out to be the revolutionary leader of Xin, and he was pushed to the throne of the president?</br>
</br>
Of course, obviously not everyone was satisfied with this result.</br>
</br>
The oppositions that were invited stood at the corners of the banquet hall. They gazed at Zhang Yaping, who received all the compliments in the world, with envy and jealousy in their eyes. They whispered and mocked.</br>
</br>
"You just found the right person. What's there to be proud of."</br>
</br>
"Just a puppet..."</br>
</br>
"Humph! When I become president, the first thing I'll do is to end the monopoly of Future Group on Xin's economy. The second thing I'll do is to take back the national defense and intelligence power from Celestial Trade. An enterprise is running the country, how dare…" The more extreme voices were gnashing their teeth while spewing their political aspirations to the members of their party.</br>
</br>
Occasionally, the guests that heard their words would just laugh and joke.</br>
</br>
"That's why you will never be president."</br>
</br>
The man's face turned red with anger, but he looked away instead.</br>
</br>
Obviously, when he said these words, he also clearly knew that.</br>
</br>
As long as Xin continued to prosper, these claims would only be a reality in his dreams…</br>
</br>
In addition to the few complaints, the main theme of the entire banquet was positive and uplifting.</br>
</br>
</br>
The melodious symphony echoed in every corner of the hall, and the courteous waiters walked through the seats to pour wine to the goblets on the long tables.</br>
</br>
There was commotion at the entrance of the banquet hall from time to time, and the guests in the banquet hall would cast their attention to the door from time to time.</br>
</br>
In addition to those that were important and distinguishable, the ambassadors of some superpowers, the ministers of a member state of the Earth Defense Alliance, the generals and presidents of the vassal states of Moro, Country F, and Madagascar were all invited... ...</br>
</br>
To the visiting guests, the people welcoming and the people being welcomed were all quite grand. Since the visit would set the foundation for the two countries' diplomatic relations for the next four years, the extravagance was justified.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Kerry." Looking at the man who just entered hall, Zhang Yaping's expression looked slightly surprised, but soon he smiled naturally and extended his right hand, "it's an honor of the UA to have such an outstanding secretary of state like yourself."</br>
</br>
"Thank you," Although Kerry was not pleased with such praise, he still responded with a smile. "On behalf of the UA government, I congratulate you on your election. I hope to work with you to safeguard the peace of the world in the next four years, and cooperate in a wider field..."</br>
</br>
After he finished the lines he wanted to say, Kerry smiled and politely bowed to President Zhang. The crowd applauded around him as he let go of President Zhang's hand and walked into the hall.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the elevator to the banquet hall, Jiang Chen gently held Ayesha's hand. He looked at the bustling crowd, as well as the anchors stopped by the police and army on the lawn outside the floor-to-ceiling window, then recited.</br>
</br>
"If Paradise be on this earth, Damascus 'tis and none but she;</br>
</br>
If in the heavens, from her derives its air and its amenity."</br>
</br>
"Are we not going to solve the South American problem?" Ayesha awkwardly twisted her petite body in the evening gown, looked at the crystal high heels, and whispered, "What does it have to do with Damascus."</br>
</br>
"International issues have never existed in isolation. These two problems can actually be solved together." Jiang Chen shrugged and pointed from the floor-to-ceiling windows at a man being escorted in headscarves through the parking lot. "Did you see it? That is the king of Saudi Arabia. He should have a glamorous princess next to him, but he did not bring her"</br>
</br>
"What does he have to do with us?" Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course, in simple terms," ​​Jiang Chen laughed, "We solve the Syrian problem for Russia, and the KGB will 'replace' the president of Colombia for me. I just happen to be friends with someone in the Middle East who can introduce me to a Syrian General and provide a shortcut in avoiding the UA's military informants at the Persian Gulf."</br>
</br>
Because of the Ares incident, the relationship between Xin and the UA suddenly took a ninety-degree turn from a state of cold war to an ambiguous relationship. How long this relationship could last would be dependent on the next person giving orders in the Capitol.</br>
</br>
During this time, the UA would not be on the aggressive front with Celestial Trade, but Celestial Trade should also not agitate the UA. Maintaining this relationship with Joseph Kennedy until his accession to the throne could perhaps add another member to the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
The option to avoid war should be the preferred option.</br>
</br>
Not to mention...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and smiled at Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"And, don't you want to help your hometown?"</br>
</br>
Holding onto Jiang Chen's arm, Ayesha shook her head gently and smiled softly.</br>
</br>
"That is not my hometown, your shoulder is where I belong."</br>
</br>
The gentleness hidden in the sapphire-like eyes, even inadvertently touched, made his heart melt.</br>
</br>
However, in the unreserved gentleness, Jiang Chen still could not feel eased.</br>
</br>
When he first pulled her away from that desert, took off her tattered headscarf, and brought her into a secularized society, it allowed her to enter another world she had only seen in fantasies. It also converted her to atheism...</br>
</br>
However, even after so many years, she did not completely heal from the trauma of her hometown</br>
</br>
After all, it was too much for a fifteen year old girl to see her parents die, and then get decapitated by militants  in front of her. She traversed through hunger, disease and death… The word cruel is pale compared to what she experienced.</br>
</br>
She always chose to forget about her past and instead, filled the missing part of her heart with a tall, confident figure.</br>
</br>
For five years.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not intend to remind her of those bad memories. He just wanted to do something for her.</br>
</br>
Even with the power of the Gaia civilization, he could not bring back the dead.</br>
</br>
Perhaps a peaceful and prosperous hometown could make her feel a little better.</br>
</br>
It was also the only thing he could do for her.</br>
</br>
Now, the time was ripe.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen caressed her brown hair, approached her ear, and said softly.</br>
</br>
"Just consider it as something for me."</br>
</br>
The little hand gently covered the warm big hand. Her eyelids were half-closed as she nodded meekly.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It had been three years since their last meeting, and Yerif appeared more mature.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the beard or his face, everything was quite different from the handsome prince before, and he seemed to be getting a beer belly.</br>
</br>
The old king was aging day by day, and he, the crown prince, was gradually being pushed forward as the representative of the country to the world. As he worked to become a qualified heir, the edges and corners on him were gradually being erased through all the different meetings and negotiations.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see, my dear friend!"</br>
</br>
Yerif greeted Jiang Chen with open arms and gave him a warm hug.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see," Jiang Chen smiled, and gestured to the room next to him, "Please this way."</br>
</br>
There were many people in the banquet hall, which was not suitable for discussions.</br>
</br>
Before they entered the banquet hall, Jiang Chen invited this old friend to the reception room downstairs in the name of catching up.</br>
</br>
"I'm taking a big risk in doing this for you." Yerif gestured to the bodyguards next to him and motioned them to stand at the door. After the door was closed, he lowered his voice and said, "You don't understand the grievances between our sects. If you have understood, you should know that we and the Syrians have feuds. We wish that Bassar would step down immediately, instead of supporting him and his stupid teachings with the Russians."</br>
</br>
Although Saudi Arabia and the UA were reluctant to admit it, they were the perpetrators that gave both monetary and weaponry support to the "monster", IS, in Syria.</br>
</br>
But it did not matter?</br>
</br>
This was a decision made by the Saudi royal family and it did not mean Yerif agreed with this.</br>
</br>
"But I think you will be an enlightened king who will bring some different changes to your country and your world. You should be very clear that any religion will eventually usher in secularization. If you can't adapt to this new age, then you will be run over by the wheels of time,'' Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
"I don't want to talk about faith with an atheist," Yerif said sternly, "and my father."</br>
</br>
"If I offended you, I do apologize," Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew very well that although the young prince Yerif was a Sunni like his royal family, he was more enlightened. For example, he never put a headscarf on his princess when he hosted parties abroad and he could sit here with a heresy without faith and chat, or even become friends.</br>
</br>
This may be related to his early experience of studying abroad, or it may be due to frequent contacts with some Western capitalists.</br>
</br>
In short, he and Jiang Chen had no obstacles in communication.</br>
</br>
It was also the reason Jiang Chen was willing to be friends with him.</br>
</br>
"...Listen, you refused to let us build a temple here, and even used a... a tree that can produce oil to crush our oil prices. In short, you and your company are not popular in the Persian Gulf, at least not you're not welcomed by the royal family. If your freshwater was not irrigating the gardens of our holy city, my father would not send you an ambassador as a sign of friendship like he is now," Yerif stared at Jiang Chen and said.</br>
</br>
</br>
"So what?" Jiang Chen smiled, as if he didn't take what he had said seriously, and said emotionlessly, "If you stand on my side, we may be able to make your desert into a grassland."</br>
</br>
Turn the desert into a grassland?</br>
</br>
Yerif was obviously taken aback.</br>
</br>
"...what you said is true?"</br>
</br>
"For us, this is not a difficult task. Or, do you think it is more difficult to grow grass on the deserts on Earth than it is to grow grass on the seabed or even on Mars?" Jiang Chen subtly showed off his achievements before he continued, "Don't digress. We can wait until you become king to discuss the matter of 'terraforming Earth'. We are now discussing another issue."</br>
</br>
Yerif controlled his breathing, leaned back against his chair, and quietly waited for Jiang Chen to continue.</br>
</br>
"I have a batch of weapons in my hands and a group of well-trained South African mercenaries. I need you to help me send them from the Persian Gulf into Syria and ensure me a supply channel that can travel from the Persian Gulf to the Syrian border. Don't say it's impossible, I know you have your ways," Jiang Chen said seriously as his eyes fixated on Yerif.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries that came out of the Madagascar slums were cheap cannon fodder. They were the historical legacy left behind when Celestial Trade competed with the Freemasonry for control of Madagascar. They were contractors in Celestial Trade's corporate military system.</br>
</br>
They were well trained and large in number. Even without a kinetic skeleton, they were a force to be reckoned with.</br>
</br>
"But why should I help you? What can you do for me?" Yerif spread his hands and smiled, "Money? You know I don't need that thing."</br>
</br>
At the negotiating table, especially at this level, friendship was not enough to be a bargaining chip.</br>
</br>
And Jiang Chen did not expect to let him do this favor based on the favor of creating a "robot" for him in the first place. After all, as Yerif said, he would take a big risk, to the point that if this leaked, he would risk being exiled by the royal family. If it weren't for that favor, he would probably not be sitting here in the first place.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and slowly said as he looked at Yerif.</br>
</br>
"I can give you the bottom line. The mercenary group I plan to send to Syria is about ten thousand people. They are proficient in using drones and are good at operating various modern vehicles. Originally, these people worked for Arrow but were later incorporated by us to fight against Freemasonry. After the Syrian problem is resolved, I have no plans to continue to support these people. I can transfer them to you."</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand people?" Yerif also laughed, then shook his head. "What can ten thousand people do? I advise you not to get involved in the desert. No matter what deal you made with the Russians, it was a wrong decision."</br>
</br>
Ten thousand people; all of them infantry.</br>
</br>
If it were the orbital airborne soldiers of Celestial Trade, the proposition could still be a discussion, but based on Jiang Chen's tone, these ten thousand people were both without the protection of kinetic skeleton nor the support of main battle tanks. To throw them into this swamp known as Syria, they probably wouldn't even make a splash.</br>
</br>
You know, the regular army of Bassar exceeded three hundred thousand.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen maintained his confident smile after Yerif finished his sentence.</br>
</br>
"Then what if I told you that the combat power of these ten thousand people is comparable to fifty thousand?"</br>
</br>
The room suddenly became quiet.</br>
</br>
Yerif's fingers clasped tightly onto the armrests, he gulped and looked at Jiang Chen suspiciously.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible. How sure can you be sure that their combat effectiveness is comparable to fifty thousand people?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing is impossible." Jiang Chen shrugged. "These people once served in Arrow of the Freemasonry, and later accepted our reorganization. One is the most powerful military company in the old era, and the other is the most powerful private military force in the new era. These ten thousand people are not mobilized soldiers or volunteers drawn from the reserve. They are a group of monsters with power compared to special forces. Their hands are blood-stained by soldiers only as powerful as them, and not from unarmed civilians."</br>
</br>
In order to avoid revealing their identity, this group of foreign mercenaries would not be equipped with kinetic skeletons.</br>
</br>
But even without the kinetic skeleton, they still possessed the genetic vaccine!</br>
</br>
A shot of E-grade genetic vaccine was compared to a mini superman after half a month of physical training. Even without the kinetic skeleton, their reaction and survivability were far superior to that of the ordinary person. Other than the regular force of Celestial Trade, there was no other force on Earth that could field an entire infantry division with special forces.</br>
</br>
Yerif was silent.</br>
</br>
From the outside world, he was a supporter of the Sunni, but deep in his heart, he did not agree with this status quo. As Jiang Chen said, secularization was the ultimate future of all beliefs. Dubai next door was the perfect example, even with the pitiful amount of oil, it was more prosperous than his hometown.</br>
</br>
However, change was not that simple.</br>
</br>
Even as the crown prince of the country, or even as the future king, he could not have free reign in his country. He could be playful, incompetent, or spend all the money with the royal family, but if he dared to start a religious revolution in the country, the army that supported the religion would even turn their weapons on him and push his uncle or brother to the throne.</br>
</br>
The condition that Jiang Chen offered was very attractive.</br>
</br>
A division of mercenaries.</br>
</br>
After they solved the problems in Syria, this powerful force would become a private force loyal to him only.</br>
</br>
If he wished to push for change in his country, then he would need a force absolutely loyal to him. And this force would be supported by Celestial Trade, which would become his biggest trump card to bring change for his kingdom.</br>
</br>
And, a group of heretics that didn't question right or wrong, and never hesitated in the killing was his best choice...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With a bright smile on his face, Yerif shook Jiang Chen's hand and then exited the room.</br>
</br>
Ayesha walked up to Jiang Chen and asked him in a whisper.</br>
</br>
"It's over?"</br>
</br>
"Almost. At least half of it is done," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Why don't we send the mercenaries of Madagascar directly to South America? Their capability is enough to sweep Colombia." Ayesha said. "Getting involved in the Middle East may touch the sensitive nerves of the UA more."</br>
</br>
"This involves a problem of adapting to the local conditions. Compared to South America, the chaos in the Middle East is more suitable for us to intervene without reservation." Jiang Chen shook his head and said softly, "If you send them to South America, we probably can't even hide a brigade, let alone a division. We will turn a peaceful country into hell under the eyes of the international community."</br>
</br>
"And the Russians will not?" Ayesha rebutted.</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Jiang Chen smiled. "The KGB left a rich political legacy in South America in the Soviet Era. Venezuela will help them with their plans... At least that's what Natasha said."</br>
</br>
"And, the most important thing is that we can solve both problems at the same time."</br>
</br>
"Our Global Grid Plan is not just for South America. The entirety of Europe is waiting for us to tackle it. Now, our submarine cable has crossed India and landed in the UAE. It's only a matter of time before it enters Saudi Arabia. A troubled land is in front of us. After we cross there, we can then finally cross the intersection that lead to Constantinople and Paris."</br>
</br>
"Russia can't freely operate in the Mediterranean. However, we may just have the conditions to help them solve this problem once and for all. In exchange, Russia can help us solve the troubles of South America. So, for both of us, all of our troubles are solved. This is fair," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Yes, this is fair.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The melodious and elegant symphony reverberated in the banquet hall. As more and more guests entered, the atmosphere of the banquet gradually rose to a peak.</br>
</br>
When the appetizers were removed from the tables, a dazzling array of food was served, followed by resounding exclamations that could be heard from time to time in the hall.</br>
</br>
"This is probably the most luxurious banquet I have ever seen," A man in a suit sat at the long table and looked at the palm-sized omelet on his plate and exclaimed from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
After the omelet was cooked to golden perfection, it was placed on top of the fried potato and sprinkled with ten ounces of caviar. The small portion meant it could be finished in just a few bites, but the price tag was as high as one thousand dollars. Just the color and shape made people drool, and it was no doubt a masterpiece made by a 3-star Michelin chef.</br>
</br>
Food could make people high.</br>
</br>
This sentence was not a joke at all.</br>
</br>
In addition to this palm-sized omelet, there was also a small bowl of soup served to the guests.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the thick, golden-like broth, there were a few strands of chicken breast floating on the surface. A tiny, thin slice of mushroom floated on the creamy soup. If the person did not recognize the ingredients, they would most likely scorn at the soup. Isn't this just chicken soup? How can this be considered a Michelin dish with just some butter added to increase the thickness of the soup?</br>
</br>
However, when the soup was served to the guests, it caused quite a stir.</br>
</br>
Not because of anything else, but because the tiny piece of mushroom slice floating on the soup was the world's most expensive mushroom - giant white truffle!</br>
</br>
The price of this ingredient was difficult to determine because it was basically an auction item. The most recent transaction price was 307,000 pounds for a total of 1.1 kilograms. Now, the auction item along with previously auctioned items were made into a truffle chicken soup and then served to the guests in exquisite porcelain bowls...</br>
</br>
The white truffle floating on the broth was only the size of a thumb.</br>
</br>
But the value of this piece was much more than the soup itself.</br>
</br>
Even Yerif could not help but feel excited.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade is simply too rich!</br>
</br>
It was not that he hadn't eaten this kind of food. There was no food in the world that he hadn't tried before. But even he would not serve over a thousand guests a dish with ingredients costing up to a couple hundred thousand pounds.</br>
</br>
A beautiful little card was placed on the plates and labelled the food ingredients. No matter whether or not the guests recognized the ingredients, they could all enjoy the knowledge of what they were eating...</br>
</br>
Sitting at the table, even Kerry was astonished by the series of high-quality and expensive ingredients.</br>
</br>
A government supported by the nouveau rich. Even a state banquet can be so lavish.</br>
</br>
However, he did not display this astonishment. After all, he represented the UA government. What's more, the state banquet was never about the food, but rather, the diplomatic achievements that can be achieved at the banquet.</br>
</br>
Kerry glanced at his watch, moved his focus away from the dazzling food collection, and began searching the room.</br>
</br>
He was looking for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, so far, even with the food served, and he did not see the man appear at this place.</br>
</br>
"Late?"</br>
</br>
Kerry frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
He felt something was off, but he could not tell where the hunch came from.</br>
</br>
It was not just him that felt the same way. Many people's eyes moved subtly to search for Jiang Chen. Without a doubt, the most worthwhile person in the entire event was the man who did not show up yet.</br>
</br>
Many people had already thought about their plan; how to naturally approach and talk to him. Many well-known and shrewd actresses were planning on creating an unexpected but beautiful encounter. It would be even better to ask him for a dance.</br>
</br>
What's more, a rich man with a big belly was debating how to subtly introduce his daughter, who did not look like him at all, to that man.</br>
</br>
However, the most anxious was Zhang Yaping.</br>
</br>
He felt awkward.</br>
</br>
There was only five minutes left before the start of the banquet.</br>
</br>
If it was someone else, he could leave the person aside and leave the main entrance to go somewhere else. However, it was Jiang Chen that had yet to arrive. Even if he offended all the guests, he could not leave that man out at the door.</br>
</br>
Many of his opponents were looking at him to see how the situation would turn out.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping pulled his assistant aside and whispered to him.</br>
</br>
"Can you call and ask why he is not here yet?"</br>
</br>
"I have already asked. The security guard in charge of the parking lot told me that Mr. Jiang arrived half an hour ago." The assistant was also anxious, but his reaction was not as obvious.</br>
</br>
"Half an hour ago?" Zhang Yaping hurriedly asked, "Where did he go? Or did he already enter the banquet hall from the side door?"</br>
</br>
"I heard that he and his old friend have been talking for a while, and he should be here soon—"</br>
</br>
Before the assistant could finish, two figures appeared at the main entrance.</br>
</br>
The assistant opened his mouth and quickly pulled at the sleeve of the president while lowering his voice. Then he said in a voice full of joy.</br>
</br>
"They're here."</br>
</br>
At the moment that Jiang Chen stepped into the venue, he clearly felt that all the eyes were gathered on him.</br>
</br>
He nodded with friendliness to the guests in the venue. He looked at Zhang Yaping, who was walking toward him, and extended his hand apologetically.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I'm a little late."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"You're finally here." Zhang Yaping shook Jiang Chen's hand and revealed a relieved smile.</br>
</br>
"Hopefully I'm not late?" Jiang Chen smiled apologetically.</br>
</br>
"No, there are still two minutes before the dinner starts. Please, come this way." Zhang Yaping gestured toward the venue behind him and then led Jiang Chen inside.</br>
</br>
The dinner started on time.</br>
</br>
After the main courses, there were desserts, cold drinks, champagne, and red wine. As the rhythm of the symphony gradually became more melodious, it marked the start of the ball. The waiter took away the empty plates and placed bottles of champagne on the long tables.</br>
</br>
The guests left their seats one after another and went after their target. Whether it was just for a dance, or for a contract worth tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, or a chance to reach their dream, or just a one night stand...</br>
</br>
All the needs of the upper class could be fulfilled here.</br>
</br>
At the center of the venue, Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha, who was on his left, with a gentle smile. She was moving the cherry on top of the ice cream with a silver spoon in boredom.</br>
</br>
Although the dance had already begun, he did not intend to go mingle. For one, he was not interested in being surrounded by a large group of people, and for two, in his position, it was no longer necessary to deliberately make friends.</br>
</br>
He had two purposes for attending today's event.</br>
</br>
One, to agree on the deal with Yerif, and two, to appear here.</br>
</br>
Now, he achieved both of these goals.</br>
</br>
Just then, a white man in a suit sat down on his right-hand side, took a glass full of wine, and said.</br>
</br>
"Can I sit here?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen looked at Kerry with some surprise.</br>
</br>
He remembered that just a month ago, the secretary of state was someone else. He didn't expect this guy to renege from Hill's camp and participate in the party's primaries, but now, he once again returned to Hill's camp.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen did not have a lot of goodwill toward the UA government, he felt highly about the ability of the secretary of state.</br>
</br>
"You are very surprised?"</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jiang Chen smiled. "I didn't expect you to return to the position of secretary of state immediately, instead of being sent to somewhere for retirement."</br>
</br>
"That's because you don't know the Capitol." Kerry took a sip of the wine and seemingly hinted at something.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen shrugged. "Maybe. Just like you have never known us."</br>
</br>
Kerry smiled and placed the glass on the table.</br>
</br>
After a pause, he looked at Jiang Chen and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"When did you get on the same boat as the B City Consortium?"</br>
</br>
"As early as two years ago. We had extensive cooperation in the freshwater business. They also helped Future Bank go public in the UA." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Don't pull this on me, you know what I mean." Kerry's lowered voice was mixed with a trace of hoarseness, and the hoarseness revealed a hint of reluctance and unacceptance, but he cleverly hid all of this behind an indifferent expression, "To be honest, if you didn't help, we wouldn't have even considered that little guy as a contender..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Is it really good to talk about your candidate on this particular occasion? Mr. Secretary of State?" Jiang Chen laughed and said innocently, "And what do you mean, did my hacker hack your voting machine? Or did you outsource the election to my company without me knowing?"</br>
</br>
"Don't act stupid." Kerry shook his head. "Do you know what you got yourself into? You are against a giant interest group, a military-industry complex that was established before the outbreak of World War One—"</br>
</br>
"Giant?" Jiang Chen also picked up the glass and smiled slyly when he heard what Kerry just said. "Is it bigger than Rothschild and his Freemasonry?"</br>
</br>
Kerry opened his mouth, but no words came out.</br>
</br>
"My attitude has always been clear. If you are willing to cooperate, we are happy to open the door, just as we have worked with the Rothschild family before." Jiang Chen shook the red wine in the glass and stared at the bloody red liquid before he whispered, "But if you still think that you are the center of the world, hold the belief that everyone must surrender to you, and you wish to continue to go down the wrong path..."</br>
</br>
With one hand holding her delicate and beautiful chin, Ayesha, who was stilling playing with the cherry out of boredom, stopped. Kerry sensed the sudden change in the atmosphere and quickly glanced the girl on the other side before he swallowed his words.</br>
</br>
The wine in his hand tilted slightly as if it made some kind of announcement, then Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
"We'll just get rid of it."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"...a creamy ice cream made from twenty types of cocoa is surrounded a thin layer of delicate curd. Small pieces of truffle chocolate are sprinkled on top and the entire thing is placed in a fine crystal cup. I once tried it in a high-end restaurant in New York, but that one was slightly smaller compared to this. The cost was about 17,000 dollars, and I needed to book two days in advance... Do you not want to try this?" With a charming smile on his face, the man in a white suit revealed his white teeth and courteously spoke to the woman next to him.</br>
</br>
A beautiful woman with an oriental face stood facing him. She was in a pale yellow evening gown, dignified yet elegant, and the soft ribbon gently wrapped in front of her waist added a touch of brightness to the fullness in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
Although the standards of beauty remained different between the West and the East, some things remained the same.</br>
</br>
However, the beauty who stood there showed a glimpse of impatience or repulsion.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I have no appetite," Liu Yao shook her head and said.</br>
</br>
"No appetite? That is a big problem," Felix smiled and gracefully extended his right hand. "Maybe you need some exercise, like dancing with the rhythm of the music. Beautiful lady, do I have the pleasure to be your partner?"</br>
</br>
"No need," Liu Yao refused.</br>
</br>
The graceful smile froze on his face, and a hint of anger appeared but also disappeared quickly in Felix's eyes. His emotions were hidden behind his dark green pupil.</br>
</br>
"I haven't introduced myself yet. That's my mistake."</br>
</br>
Felix retracted his hand, took out a business card, and placed it between his two fingers.</br>
</br>
"I hope you can think about it again. This is my business card. I'm the manager of Warner Bros. Asia. I've been focusing on the South Asia market, hoping to discover some promising talents for the parent company." Felix passed the card in front of Liu Yao and smiled. "If you are interested, I can take you to Hollywood. You have the ability to become famous around the world."</br>
</br>
He understood female stars too well, especially Asian actresses.</br>
</br>
Hollywood movies had been doing all they could to enter the Chinese market, but the second and third-tier stars, or even premium stars, had been desperately trying to get into Hollywood, even just for two seconds on the red carpet.</br>
</br>
Countless women packaged themselves to his bed for this opportunity.</br>
</br>
However, Liu Yao simply felt angry and thought it was comical when she saw the name on the card.</br>
</br>
Just as her lips formed a curvature, and she was ready to take his business card and toss it into the trash can, a woman in a black evening gown walked in their direction.</br>
</br>
When Felix saw the person, his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1268: Can I please invite you for a dance?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Emma stopped beside the two. She first looked at Liu Yao, then looked at Felix. She had an idea as to what happened before she sneered at the sight.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Felix, let me guess, you're fooling people again with your business card, am I right?"</br>
</br>
"What do you mean by fooling? Please pay attention to your words, Ms. Watson." His hooked-nose pointed directly at Emma as a hint of disgust quickly flashed across Felix's eyes.</br>
</br>
A typical movie star would not be qualified to speak to him like this, but Emma was different. She somehow managed to become the brand ambassador for nutrient supplies. Despite Future Biology not being a core asset within Future Group, she was still under the Future Group umbrella.</br>
</br>
Among the second-tier stars in Warner Bros' portfolio, she was the only untouchable one.</br>
</br>
He could offend anyone but Future Group.</br>
</br>
After all, Future Technology was starting to replace Industrial Light and Magic in Hollywood. VR filming technology not only could save on cost, but the box office of VR theatres became one of the most dominant channels for film producers.</br>
</br>
Of course, even if he did not dare to offend the giant corporation behind her, it did not mean he could not scold her.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong? Ms. Emma, do you want to ask me for a dance?" Felix sneered. "I heard that the Women Rights Organization that you're a part of is discussing removing you, is that true? I heard that it's accusing you of being a bit*h hiding under the symbol of Social Justice Warriors, and actually worked for a boss who did not respect women's rights."</br>
</br>
As an executive of Warner Bros., he knew Emma's pain points. In her early years, in order to brand herself into a "model woman with high education qualifications", she even put aside her acting career under the advice of her agency, and frequently advocated for equal rights, and even spoke on behalf of an organization at the United Nations...</br>
</br>
However, her branding could be described as a failure, or rather, she did not synchronize her perspective with the person responsible for "branding" her. A voice of doubt always existed that questioned if she truly advocated for equal rights since the end of Harry Potter.</br>
</br>
"Felix, let's not discuss my issues. You should worry about your situation first," Emma took a deep breath and watched Felix with a grin, "Before you try to hit on someone, why not try and learn about the other person's background?"</br>
</br>
Felix's expression changed slightly, and then he stared directly at Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
After a closer examination, this woman seemed familiar.</br>
</br>
But he could not recall why she looked familiar.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he could not distinguish the difference between Asian faces like most international executives sent to Asia. Other than extremely popular celebrities with distinctive features, or those he worked with frequently, he could rarely recognize someone immediately.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, may I ask you for your name?" Felix barely maintained his calmness as he politely asked Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Liu Yao."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao...?</br>
</br>
Never heard of it... wait.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Felix's expression changed drastically and droplet of sweat started to appear on his forehead.</br>
</br>
When he was sent to Asia, he heard a rumor. A film invested by Future Technology held a premiere at Nippon, and the son of a real estate mogul tried to force himself onto an actress.</br>
</br>
He didn't know what happened in the middle, but he did hear about what happened in the end. The real estate company worth trillions of Yen vanished. Both the father and son were thrown into jail. The rumor also said the Sumitomo Consortium was behind the scene, and Sumitomo was the biggest partner of Celestial Trade's energy export project...</br>
</br>
Sweat dripped down from Felix's sideburn, he swallowed down and finally understood the situation he got himself into.</br>
</br>
The CEO of a trillion Yen company was uprooted overnight, and as an executive of a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, what was he worth.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao may be that man's...</br>
</br>
Without paying attention to Felix, who left after he was scared by his own thought, Liu Yao looked at Emma Watson with slight confusion.</br>
</br>
Although she knew some stars in Hollywood, their interactions were limited, and they at most spoke a couple of sentences.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No need, it was nothing," Emma smiled and slightly raised her goblet. "If he continues to bother you, you can tell me. This is my card."</br>
</br>
Continue to bother me?</br>
</br>
Liu Yao did not think that the man would dare to bother her after learning about her identity.</br>
</br>
But she graciously accepted Emma's kindness.</br>
</br>
Because they worked together in the same field, and previously cooperated together in the film co-invested by Warner Bros. and Future Group. After exchanging business cards, they went to the side to chat.</br>
</br>
One lady had a face of an angel and the figure of a vixen while the other possessed the temperament of a noble British princess. The two beautiful women standing together naturally attracted the attention of countless people, but no one came to interrupt them.</br>
</br>
After all, at this type of event, there were only a few idiots like Felix. The majority of the people here would use their brains to think about the potential cost of their behavior.</br>
</br>
The two got along surprisingly well.</br>
</br>
The topic quickly changed from the entertainment industry to gossips. Then the topics quickly changed to themselves.</br>
</br>
The fact Liu Yao bluntly admitted that she was Jiang Chen's lover caught Emma by surprise, but she did not comment on it.</br>
</br>
She was not surprised by Liu Yao's identity as it was no longer considered a secret. She was most surprised about how open Liu Yao was. The average person would refrain from discussing this topic, and Emma was also very considerate in not discussing this topic, but Liu Yao did not seem to mind and directly acknowledged this fact.</br>
</br>
"Don't you want to dance with him?" Looking toward the center of the banquet hall, Emma asked.</br>
</br>
"No need." Liu Yao gently shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Because the reason why I'm here is to see him, and I have already done that." Liu Yao smiled.</br>
</br>
"And that's enough?" Emma asked.</br>
</br>
"That's enough."</br>
</br>
Emma's expression revealed her confusion, but she did not say anything more.</br>
</br>
"To be honest," Liu Yao looked to the center and let out a sigh and whispered. "I thought about trying to catch up to him a long time ago, but what I didn't expect was that he had already gone an unreachable distance."</br>
</br>
Perhaps in her mind, she enjoyed her life in Wanghai in the past.</br>
</br>
However, she was also very aware.</br>
</br>
It would be impossible to go back to the past.</br>
</br>
Emma bid farewell with her as the ball approached its end.</br>
</br>
Standing alone on the side of the dance floor, while enjoying the champagne in the glass, Liu Yao quietly admired the men and women, hugging. She revealed a sweet smile. From time to time, someone would come forward and invite her to dance, but she rejected the invitation one after another, until when the last song began to play, and the ball was gradually coming to an end.</br>
</br>
She returned back to the hall.</br>
</br>
The figure sitting at the long table was gone.</br>
</br>
No longer searching, Liu Yao sighed, and headed out with the crowd.</br>
</br>
The sea breeze blew in through the windows of the corridor. In the distant sea, the waves splashed and the Moon had cast its cool and beautiful light into the quiet night.</br>
</br>
Immersed in the beauty outside, she did not pay attention to her path and accidentally bumped into someone.</br>
</br>
She let out a shout.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao, who lost her balance, fell backward.</br>
</br>
Just when she closed her eyes and thought she would for sure get hurt, one arm wrapped around her lower back.</br>
</br>
Their chests were almost stuck together, and the tip of her nose could even feel the warm airflow.</br>
</br>
With a frown, the blushing Liu Yao was about to become enraged, but she then noticed the face belonged to that man...</br>
</br>
She could no longer suppress her tears.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful lady, can I please invite you for a dance?" His empty hand gently combed back the hair in front of her forehead. With his eyes fixated on the beauty in his arm, Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1269: A Path Ou</br>
</div></br>
</br>
How could he not know that Liu Yao came?</br>
</br>
Although he did not send the invitations, every name that entered through the border at Coro Airport would appear in the Ghost Agents' server. What's more, Liu Yao's name was on the protection list of the "foreign dignitaries". When her name appeared on the entry list, Ayesha told Jiang Chen immediately.</br>
</br>
When the dinner was about to end, Jiang Chen left first to set up his "ambush".</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen brought Liu Yao into the presidential suite at the Hilton Hotel downstairs and shut the door behind him. The two hugged together at the entrance against the cabinet on the wall.</br>
</br>
"Where did Ayesha go?" With her back against the wall, Liu Yao was panthing and her eyes quickly swept across the room. When she responded to the invasive eyes staring at her, she asked with a little hoarseness. "Wasn't she still here with you?"</br>
</br>
"She went back to have some time off."</br>
</br>
"Time off?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, I will be here for the next three days," Jiang Chen said while smirking.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao understood the meaning of the smirk. She lowered her head and whispered.</br>
</br>
"My flight is tomorrow morning."</br>
</br>
"Then cancel it," with one hand slammed on the wall, and the other hand gently lifted her delicate chin, Jiang Chen had an irrefutable tone, domineering, "My private jet can send you back."</br>
</br>
"You're bad," Liu Yao escaped the restless fingers and slammed her head on Jiang Chen's chest. Her cheeks were red but there was a joyous smile on her face. She said in a spoiled voice, "Be careful, I'll call the police and say you're illegally detaining a famous celebrity."</br>
</br>
"Go, the police station in Coro belongs to me. I want to see who is going to catch me." With that same smirk, Jiang Chen said, "Right, I just happen to miss a pair of handcuffs and a whip, they can send them to me."</br>
</br>
"Why do you want those things?" Backing up against the walls, Liu Yao acted afraid.</br>
</br>
"Of course to interrogate you," his index finger was gently placed under her gorgeous face as he said softly, "Why didn't you tell me before you came? I could have picked you up."</br>
</br>
"I," She gently gasped and suppressed the feelings that were about to overflow, then whispered, "I wanted to give you a surprise."</br>
</br>
Staring into her captivating eyes, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"The police officer concludes that you are lying."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you say before that you couldn't recognize whether my words were true or false?"</br>
</br>
"You also said that that was before," Jiang Chen acted mysteriously and closed his eyes. "But now, an ability of mine suddenly awakened, called Mind Reading. It can tell me if you're lying."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao covered her mouth as she giggled, then charmingly rolled her eyes and teasingly said, "Then why don't you just read my mind? Why bother interrogating?"</br>
</br>
"Because I want to hear you say it."</br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the room was becoming more and more lucid.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Come and work in Xin?"</br>
</br>
Liu Yao shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"My current state is good."</br>
</br>
"Really?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"You already have a lot of wives, but you only have one lover," She gently placed her jade-like fingers against Jiang Chen's heart, and sweetly smiled, "At least I have a unique place there."</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen fixated into her watery eyes full of emotion, he sniffed the jasmine scent in her hair and then quietly said.</br>
</br>
"You'll make me feel guilty."</br>
</br>
"Shouldn't you feel guilty? You bad person..."</br>
</br>
Her arms wrapped around his neck and she pulled the face that she longed for everyday closer.</br>
</br>
Her red lips moved down along the side of his head before her teeth gently nipped at Jiang Chen's ear lope. It was like tasting a jelly as her tongue explored the soft outline.</br>
</br>
She felt the heat pressed against her thighs.</br>
</br>
Her warm breath blew into his ear as she whispered out the words she had always wanted to say.</br>
</br>
"Feed me..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the ball, Yerif returned to the hotel in Penglai by yacht.</br>
</br>
Lying flat on the lounger on the roof, Yerif enjoyed the massage by the beauty behind him; his eyes gradually closed as he was no longer focused on the bustling night. With his muscles relaxed, he began to appreciate the skillful massage.</br>
</br>
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</br>
</br>
This sentence came from a book written by a pagan, which he happened to read when he was studying abroad.</br>
</br>
However, no matter how many times he recalled this phrase, it always gave a different understanding each time.</br>
</br>
If the sentence was applied to his country today, changing the "dust" into "sand" shall vividly state the fate of the desert kingdom.</br>
</br>
Oil prices continued to fall, even without Future Biology's oil crops, the breakthrough in shale gas forced oil production into a strange circle - "the more they extracted, the more there are; the more they extracted, the poorer they become."</br>
</br>
In some countries, it was not so evident, but a few years ago, many countries whose oil prices were regulated by the market, showed that the price of one liter of gasoline was cheaper than one liter of mineral water.</br>
</br>
A very ironic reality.</br>
</br>
The "black gold" that once stirred the exchange rate and futures markets had fallen.</br>
</br>
The unfinished buildings in the desert had already illustrated many problems, and the ambitious plan to build a second Dubai was no longer feasible. How long could the black gold support the extravagance of the Saudi royal family? Even Yerif, who was enjoying all of this, was uncertain.</br>
</br>
But he was convinced about one point.</br>
</br>
That is, if they don't want to become like their neighbors in the north, they must learn from the neighbors in the east.</br>
</br>
With that thought in mind, Yerif's eyebrows furrowed together and his fists closed shut.</br>
</br>
They must change.</br>
</br>
Before the world forced them to change.</br>
</br>
"Did I hurt you?"</br>
</br>
The beauty massaging asked softly.</br>
</br>
"No." His eyebrows relaxed as Yeirf smiled, "You can use a bit more force."</br>
</br>
"Okay," the beauty smiled, and used more strength. "In fact, you can be more relaxed."</br>
</br>
Yerif licked the corner of his mouth without speaking, then closed his eyes once again.</br>
</br>
When he heard the price of Jiang Chen's offer, he immediately agreed to it, but he still felt hesitant about the dangerous deal.</br>
</br>
Ten thousand mercenaries.</br>
</br>
For the chaos in Syria, it was only a small number.</br>
</br>
However, for him, it was not a small number.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was right, he did in fact have connections with key people in Syria. A general who was loyal to President Bashar and a Russian businessman who only recognized money. In partnership with these two people, he could easily send a batch of fuel processed into finished products and weapons bought from Western countries, passing through the Saudi border, through the Jordanian Eastern Corridor, into the hands of the Syrian government forces, in exchange for US dollar on overseas private accounts. Although his family was very rich and never mistreated the soon-to-be-king, every expense was recorded and no money truly belonged to him.</br>
</br>
It was this reason he felt constrained developing his own force. Disregarding training mercenaries, the property in Penglai and the yacht in his private dock were all under the name of the royal family.</br>
</br>
His father's time was running out, and some things must be prepared early.</br>
</br>
He let out a sigh, then picked up the satellite phone from the table next to him and made a "you can stop" gesture to the beauty behind him. He turned over and called a number.</br>
</br>
The phone quickly went through.</br>
</br>
A low, hoarse voice picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
"Oh? The respected future King of Saudi Arabia, you will take the throne soon. At that time, everything in Saudi Arabia will belong to you. Are you still lacking pocket change?" There was suppressed laughter from the other side.</br>
</br>
After a few moments of silence, Yerif said.</br>
</br>
"Let's discuss a deal."</br>
</br>
"Now the government forces are well equipped, they'll not be willing to pay a lot of money to buy fuel and weapons from you. I suggest you wait patiently."</br>
</br>
"This time we are not smuggling fuel and weapons," Yerif said.</br>
</br>
The man hesitated, then asked.</br>
</br>
"What is it then?"</br>
</br>
"People."</br>
</br>
"People?" The man's eyes narrowed slightly. "How many people?"</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand people," Yerif said. "And their equipment, supplies."</br>
</br>
There was a gasp on the other side of the phone, then there was no response for a long time.</br>
</br>
Yerif waited quietly.</br>
</br>
He was well aware that his partner from Russia would be afraid and be hesitant, but he would not refuse the dollar. He felt more than once that the man was more similar to the Jews than the Russians.</br>
</br>
"What's the offer?" Sure enough, the man asked.</br>
</br>
"We have been working together for so many years, you should know how much money I have in that account," Yerif said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Originally, this "private money" was to be used to establish his own force to help him stabilize the country after his succession, and to ensure the reform and implementation plan could be carried out smoothly. Now, it seemed that he no longer needed that much money.</br>
</br>
Just like the man said, after he took the throne, the entire country would belong to him.</br>
</br>
As long as he could sit on that seat.</br>
</br>
"You didn't touch a penny?" The man was shocked.</br>
</br>
"You can interpret it like that." Yerif nodded. "If you do this for me, successfully, I can give you half of the money in that account."</br>
</br>
Instantly, the man's eyes turned red.</br>
</br>
Greed.</br>
</br>
Almost without any hesitation, he accepted.</br>
</br>
"Deal!"</br>
</br>

</br>
Good times were always short-lived.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen spent the three days traversing between the streets of Coro with Liu Yao. He took her to all the attractions across Xin to re-experience the ever-changing country.</br>
</br>
Because of the holographic camouflage system, both of their appearances were modified so that they would not need to worry about reporters. It was also one of the few times Jiang Chen once again experienced his past way of living.</br>
</br>
"What do you think of this place?"</br>
</br>
"...It's hard to make the connection with the small island it was a few years ago." On top of the cliff, looking at the high-risers in the distance, and the countless magnetic levitation vehicles moving, Liu Yao sighed and expressed her heartfelt feelings, "It feels like I'm living in a dream."</br>
</br>
"Will you stay?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao smiled back with sweetness, but didn't respond, instead, she tipped-toe and kissed him on the lips, then winked playfully.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood the meaning behind the kiss. He just smiled and no longer mentioned this matter.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen sent her away at the airport.</br>
</br>
As he gazed at the Gulfstream G650 accelerating into the horizon, he moved his mouth, then touched his lips. After he stood still for a moment, he then left with his bodyguards.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
A week had passed since the banquet, and soon it was mid-April.</br>
</br>
The election of Xin had already ended, and the Zhang Yaping government smoothly transitioned into the next four years. At the same time, the UA election was now in the fierce debate period. Joseph Kennedy was already prepared to use his conservative approach against Trump's aggressive attack.</br>
</br>
He understood that it would be bewildering to even think that he could win with words.</br>
</br>
So no matter how Trump attacked him personally in the debate, his response was just a calm smile.</br>
</br>
If he could not display the aggressive side of the voters, then he should demonstrate his tolerance and calmness.</br>
</br>
It was extremely effective. Although the strategy did not allow him to gain an advantage, he was not put in a disadvantageous situation... Though he would curse out in the lounge after every single debate…</br>
</br>
According to the latest polls, Mr. Kennedy's poll was slightly higher.</br>
</br>
Already excluded from the election campaign, the Hill government's policies had gradually become conservative.</br>
</br>
In any case, she stood with the Democrats.</br>
</br>
"We are winning," Loki said in excitement on the phone. "According to the latest polls, we are only one step away. If everything goes smooth, the victory in November will belong to us!"</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen grinned and leaned back in his chair, then he quietly spoke. "According to the information we have collected, Morgan seems to have joined forces with Rockefeller with the plan to push Republican's candidate, Trump, onto that position... Are you really able to withstand the pressure of going against Rockefeller and Morgan who almost have complete control of Wall Street?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"You know too?" Loki was somewhat surprised.</br>
</br>
"We have been paying attention to the situation in your country." Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Since the fall of Rothschild Bank, the Jewish forces were completely eradicated from Wall Street, and Wall Street welcomed a unified stage that had not been seen for more than a century. However, this kind of unification was only superficial. If the external pressures disappeared, the internal struggles would intensify.</br>
</br>
Originally because of the Jewish Consortium, the Anglo-Saxon family had to be united, but now this external cause disappeared. Although Celestial Trade remained a threat, its "aggressiveness" was low in comparsion.</br>
</br>
The conflict of interests was forcing the WASP alliance to gradually split.</br>
</br>
This election was nothing more than a poor excuse...</br>
</br>
"The actions of Morgan and Rockefeller are also somewhat expected," Suppressing the joy in his tone, Loki sounded more serious, "But we have kept the risk under control. The security level of Joseph Kennedy was upped to the level of the president, and their chance of assassination is almost zero."</br>
</br>
"Need us to help?" Jiang Chen smiled. "Our bodyguards are world class."</br>
</br>
"No need," said Loki as he shook his head with a smile. "If our candidate's private bodyguards become Celestial Trade's Orbital Airborne soldiers, our story will appear on the headlines of the Washington Post the next day. "</br>
</br>
That makes sense.</br>
</br>
That is the correct political choice to make</br>
</br>
How could a presidential candidate use a foreign mercenary as a bodyguard? Especially if it was the "notorious" Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
After their conversation ended, Jiang Chen looked at the clock on the wall. It was dinner time, so he went to the living room.</br>
</br>
Natasha came in just as Jiang Chen sat down on the sofa.</br>
</br>
She also brought back news from Russia.</br>
</br>
According to her, the KGB began its operation in South America. The CIB caught onto their actions, but did not manage to collect sufficient evidence, the counter-measurement was to strengthen the security of the Colombian president.</br>
</br>
The panicking Colombian president shut himself in the room, reduced travel, and also mobilized a brigade to the nation's capital.</br>
</br>
The well-trained Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, entered the country from Venezuela and began to push forward from the northern provinces of Colombia. At the same time, an assassination plan to hunt down the president was also in full swing.</br>
</br>
From six months to at most a year, the opposition party would force the Colombian president to step down with the support of the KGB and the Venezuelan government.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Yerif also sent good news from Saudi Arabia...</br>
</br>
"The people on the Russian side have already started, what about you? My father asked me to bring a message to you, why haven't they seen any movement?" Natasha asked while swaying her beautiful blonde hair. She sat down across from him while she drank a cup of freshly brewed coffee; she was already in her pajamas.</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand mercenaries have been assembled in Madagascar. Once the insiders in Saudi Arabia clears the route, we can ship them in a cruise and then disembark them on the coast of the Red Sea. We can pass through Saudi Arabia territory without anyone knowing."</br>
</br>
It was the safest route.</br>
</br>
Apart from this route, only two other routes remained. One option would be to bypass South Africa and cross the Strait of Gibraltar from the west coast of Syria. The other option would be to pass through Turkey. The former risked being discovered by the NATO fleet, and the latter wasn't even an option to begin with. Turkey was one of the supporters of the opposition in Syria.</br>
</br>
"Is it okay to only have this many people?" Natasha thought while sipping her coffee. "I thought you would use your orbital airborne brigade."</br>
</br>
"You and someone asked the same question," Jiang Chen shrugged and shook his head. "To deal with a bunch of fools, orbital airborne troops are not necessary. Our 'reserves' are more than enough. As for the number of people, you'll see once they arrive."</br>
</br>
"Since you are so confident," Natasha smiled, put down the coffee cup, and said, "Our Air Force can support you after the operation begins."</br>
</br>
"Then please." Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Although it wouldn't matter, it was a good jesture regardless.</br>
</br>
"So, can you give me a rough timeline? I have to respond to my father," Natasha said.</br>
</br>
"October." Jiang Chen opened his watch and glanced at the calendar on the holographic screen as he said nonchalantly, "The closer the date to the UA election, the less risk and resistance we face."</br>
</br>
"October... Well, that's my answer," Natasha said.</br>
</br>
"Right, there is one more thing. You can also inform the Kremlin," Jiang Chen looked at Natasha who was on her way upstairs.</br>
</br>
"What?" Stopping on the stairs, Natasha looked back.</br>
</br>
"We have named the million-ton ship Enovy-class, so we won't refer to your opinion."</br>
</br>
"Just this?" Natasha rolled her eyes. "I thought you wanted to tell me that you already built it."</br>
</br>
"That's the third thing I'm going to tell you," enjoying her surprised expression, Jiang Chen grinned. "On May 7th, remember to let your people know to attend Envoy-class Starship's ceremonial ship launching."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1271: The Prologue to the New Era</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the beginning of May, there was a sudden spike in the number of journalists and passengers heading to Xin.</br>
</br>
To be precise, there was an increase in the number of people travelling to Celestial City.</br>
</br>
As for the reason, it was because Celestial Trade made an announcement a few days ago-</br>
</br>
[The million-ton Envoy-class Starship is officially launching as part of the Earth Defense Alliance on May 7th...]</br>
</br>
A million-ton starship!</br>
</br>
Many people felt dizzy when they heard the news.</br>
</br>
Especially those in the aerospace field.</br>
</br>
The Ares VI engine that sent the Ares to the Mars orbit in a month's time already marked the peak of NASA's cutting-edge space technology. However, it didn't take long for Celestial Trade to launch a million-ton starship.</br>
</br>
The gap was drastic.</br>
</br>
Although Celestial Trade and the Earth Defense Alliance jointly announced the construction plan of a million-ton starship long ago, even the members in the Earth Defense Alliance were skeptical about if Future Heavy Industries could build such a ship.</br>
</br>
After all, the heaviest aircraft carrier weighed around 100,000 tons.</br>
</br>
Take the Eisenhower nuclear-powered aircraft carrier as an example. Its stunning length was already seen as a feat. According to the data released by the UA military, in the event of a disaster, the deck space could accommodate up to 10,000 people while maintaining combat effectiveness.</br>
</br>
Ten Eisenhowers connected from end to end...</br>
</br>
People expressed that they couldn't even imagine the size of this starship.</br>
</br>
Since their imagination was not enough.</br>
</br>
So they must go take a look.</br>
</br>
Thanks to this, Celestial City's hotels were completely booked up, even for the cheapest inns. Even Xin, under the space elevator, welcomed a booming period for its tourism.</br>
</br>
"We're currently at the original site of Celestial City's Zero Gravity Shipyard. Now this place has been transformed into four small shipyards by Future Heavy Industries used for the production of Stingray X-1. The production equipment for Seagull-class has been transferred to a free-standing shipyard outside the city."</br>
</br>
Standing by the window of the shipyard corridor, a BBC reporter asked the cameraman to point the camera at the "H"-shaped shipyard space station outside the window, then the reporter continued to speak.</br>
</br>
"...now the independent shipyard outside the city is completely closed. We have not yet obtained permission to enter the shipyard. This is probably the nearest place to Envoy-class in Celestial City, but it is not open to the public for the time being. If you are watching our program in Celestial City, you can head to the open sightseeing platform in the gravity-free section and use the telescope there to take a peek at the shipyard..."</br>
</br>
At this moment, the reporter suddenly exclaimed and pointed to the direction of the shipyard.</br>
</br>
"...look over there!"</br>
</br>
</br>
From the distance, an eerie blue arc flashed, like a bright star in the dark and mysterious universe. On the sightseeing platform one kilometer away, the passengers standing under the transparent dome burst into exclamations and whistles.</br>
</br>
The main engine was shut, and the two secondary engines on the bottom ejected two eerie blue rays backward.</br>
</br>
With the two bursts of flames pushing it forward, the black dot representing Envoy-class slowly sailed through the distance of tens of kilometers, and displayed its mighty figure in front of the world!</br>
</br>
From the faint light reflection from Earth, the black steel exuded a cold and fierce vibe.</br>
</br>
The steep hull was like a dagger that pierced the darkness with its light and broke the silence of the universe.</br>
</br>
Attempting to close his widened mouth and swallow down his shock along with his saliva, the reporter in front of the window, seemingly using all his energy, opened his trembling mouth once again. He explained to the audience waiting in front of TVs and computers.</br>
</br>
"...unbelievable, unbelievable... I can't find another suitable word in my poor lexicons to describe the shock in me at this moment. I believe that even if you are separated from the scene by tens of thousands of kilometers, through the screen of only a few inches, it's not difficult for you to understand the shock at this moment," He said emotionally as he looked at the gradually clear outline and the magnificent hull.</br>
</br>
"Envoy-class starship, with a net weight of one million tons, built by Future Heavy Industries, will be delivered to the Earth Defense Alliance on May 7, 2020. As the first starship of the Earth Fleet, it will travel to and from Oort Cloud(1) and Celestial City for crew and officer training missions."</br>
</br>
"From today, our history has once again opened a new page,"</br>
</br>
Online.</br>
</br>
Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, Wechat, and Future 1.0...</br>
</br>
All the contents on social media were about the same message.</br>
</br>
"HOLY! Celestial Trade is really going to the next level!"</br>
</br>
"Yes, they are already at the next level. They're about to venture out from the solar system!"</br>
</br>
"Built by Future Heavy Industries! My god, honey, take a look at our robot, I think the Future Heavy Industries logo is on it!"</br>
</br>
"Wait! The doll… no, the maid robot is made by the same company as the Envoy-class?! "</br>
</br>
"What's the fuss? You can open any electronics and as long as it contains graphene, it is likely to be manufactured from the New Malaysia Special District."</br>
</br>
Of course, in addition to the worship of Celestial Trade's technology, people felt aspired.</br>
</br>
Although this million-ton starship was not directly related to people's lives, surprisingly, the launch of the Envoy-class ignited the enthusiasm of the people to immigrate to Xin, just like the magnetic leviathan technology and the city drone system.</br>
</br>
"Is it too late to immigrate to Xin?"</br>
</br>
"What's the point of being a marshal, I want to go become a soldier in space! It'd be so cool to serve on that starship."</br>
</br>
"I don't know if the space volunteers are still recruiting? This is an urgent question!"</br>
</br>
"Sigh, I knew I should have bought a house on Coro Island four years ago. I heard that now the price at the city center has skyrocketed, and the threshold of immigration is extremely high. The simplest is probably to go through the route of space volunteers. But at the same time, you must check the 'Subject to colonial immigration adjustment'..."</br>
</br>
"What's so bad about now? If you go to Mars, you don't have to pay for food or rent. Maybe in a dozen years, you won't even be able to buy a shack on it."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
At the same time that people around the world were paying tribute to the Enovy-class starship, the side of the harbor built at the gravity-free section of the city was now emptied for the arrival of this "envoy". Representatives from the member states of the Earth Defense Alliance, together with the crew members and officers of the Earth Fleet who were about to board the ship, all stood by the entrance of the dock boarding passage...</br>
</br>
(1) Oort cloud: Sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, first described in 1950 by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 au.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"The Envoy-class starship has a net weight of one million tons. Its main engine is a high-power nuclear fusion engine, with its secondary engines utilizing ion propulsion technology. Its maximum cruising speed, in theory, can reach one-thousandth of the speed of light. The relative distance of 100 million kilometers, the starship can reach Mars in a week in cruise mode." Jiang Chen stood in front of the window in the control tower as he gazed at the magnificent celestial ship; he looked proud.</br>
</br>
Now the relative distance between Mars and Earth was still around tens of millions of kilometers, but by the beginning of the second half of this year, this distance would exceed the 100 million kilometers range.</br>
</br>
Aside from the LightSail that could in theory reach one-fifth the speed of light, the Envoy-class would be the largest and fastest manned spacecraft in human history.</br>
</br>
It was a glory to be able to witness this very moment.</br>
</br>
Not to mention he was the chief designer that personally made this project from just drawings into a reality.</br>
</br>
"This is too massive..." Lu Hao stood beside Jiang Chen as he also examined the Envoy-class. After a long silence, he finally let out a sigh. "I'm afraid that only the Ford-class aircraft carrier along with all the ships in the battle group connected form end-and-end can be comparable to its length."</br>
</br>
As the admiral of the Hua National Navy, the former captain of the Nanning destroyer, he had seen many ships in his lifetime and even went to inspect the Liaoning aircraft carrier. He vaguely remembered that the last time he made a similar remark was when he participated in the UA Pacific Joint Military Exercise as an observer where stood on top of the deck of the Eisenhower nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
It was also the time when he was firmly convinced that that he must do everything to convince his superiors to develop nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.</br>
</br>
Today, many years later, he once again felt the same way.</br>
</br>
But more than his feelings, he did not know how he could catch up. Celestial Trade's effort to help allowed all member states to make rapid progress in aerospace technology. Now, at least in the field of space mining, the member states could independently complete mining missions without the need for Future Mining's technology consultants.</br>
</br>
However, compared to the development of Celestial Trade, the word rapid must be placed inside quotation marks. Since compared to Celestial Trade's leap forward, their progress was like a snail crawling.</br>
</br>
When he thought of this, he cursed at the politicians in Wanghai countless times in his mind.</br>
</br>
How stupid do you have to be to force such a talent to leave?</br>
</br>
But it was only an afterthought.</br>
</br>
"Is it big?" Jiang Chen laughed, narrowed his eyes as he examined the starship once again. "It's indeed big, but in our space defense plan, this is not the biggest ship."</br>
</br>
</br>
"How much bigger can a ship get?" former ESA Director Anthony Leibniz, a representative from EU, stared at Jiang Chen, and asked incredulously, "You mean, this is not the biggest?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen said with certainty. "The Envoy-class is only a million tons. There will be a Constitutional-class, Lord-class, and Emperor-class... Our ultimate goal is to build a billion-ton starship, capable of hosting 100,000 crew members and allow one hundred percent material circulation inside the starship with sufficient energy."</br>
</br>
Looking at the dumbfounded expression of the representatives, Jiang Chen smiled and said in a joking tone.</br>
</br>
"Of course, we still have to do this step-by-step. With our current progress, the million-ton class is more than sufficient. By the time we finally achieve our ultimate goal, we'll probably have all turned into dust..."</br>
</br>
Everyone laughed in good faith.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"The Envoy-class starship has the same meaning for us as the first aircraft carrier. The purpose is to gain experience and lay the foundation for the future construction of a large-scale fleet. The only attack weapon on the starship is the mass transmitter that runs through the entire ship's hull, mainly used to launch Stingray X-1."</br>
</br>
With 2,000 soldiers on board, all officers and soldiers were ready to set sail.</br>
</br>
The soldiers already received six months of adaptive training at the Moon Military Base and understood their role on the starship. A thousand of the soldiers were reserve officers and crew members of Celestial Trade while the remaining thousand were "volunteers" from the Earth Defense Alliance member states.</br>
</br>
The allocation of the thousand spots involved a series of heated debates around the negotiation table. After all, it was the first battleship of the Earth Fleet, even an ordinary crew member would become an officer or instructor in a few years</br>
</br>
These future officers represented the future status and voice of the member states in the Earth Fleet, or even in the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the number of spots within the first crew was vitally important.</br>
</br>
Because of the many secrets involved, the ceremonial ship launching of the Envoy-class starship was very simple, far simpler than the original shipyard completion ceremony and construction ceremony. Future Heavy Industries CEO, Yang Guanglei, represented the shipyard and handed over the information of the starship, the portfolio of various certificates, and a contract to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Then the representatives of the member states signed the contract in turn, and military uniforms and certificates were given to the soldiers waiting for boarding. The national anthems of the member states played in series, and the national flag of each member state was first placed in the boarding bay and sent abroad the Envoy-class starship.</br>
</br>
Immediately afterward, the officers waiting to board the ship lined up and entered the starship through the electromagnetic track.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, I started my career in the Army, or I really would want to follow them," Wu Changfeng said with emotion while the officers boarded.</br>
</br>
"Even if you wanted to, I wouldn't send members of the Earth Defense Alliance on the starship." Jiang Chen laughed, then said with a relaxed tone, "Although not on the front line, you play the role of commander. Each of your decisions will impact the life and death of everyone on the battleship."</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng shrugged and joked.</br>
</br>
"If we can live to the day of the battle."</br>
</br>
"You will," Jiang Chen gently said with a confident but mysterious smile.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen's wristwatch began to ring.</br>
</br>
It was Kelvin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen excused himself and walked aside. Then he put in the Bluetooth headset into his ears, opened the holographic screen, and picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
Kelvin did not attend the ceremony today as the excavation work of Mine 071 already reached the most critical stage. As one of the project leaders, he must be in the space command center.</br>
</br>
A call from him was not a good signal.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, Kelvin's first words made his hunch into a reality.</br>
</br>
"Project 071 encountered a special circumstance." Kelvin gulped and without giving time for Jiang Chen to ask any questions, he quickly articulated, "Our Marines were attacked by an unknown underground creature when we reached a depth of ten kilometers... and the creature was not the Devil Worm!"</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1273: Ultrasonic Fence</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Last month, the research institute at the colony and Celestial City lab determined the appropriate frequency through collaboration.</br>
</br>
The modified seismic wave excitation device would continuously transmit seismic waves of twelve different frequencies to create a "blank domain" with a range of ten kilometers underground. In this blank domain, Devil Worms would be unable to determine their direction and unable to distinguish the surrounding and surface conditions, while also experiencing strong discomfort.</br>
</br>
The experts in the lab named the invention Ultrasonic Fence.</br>
</br>
Twelve seismic wave excitation devices were deployed around the colony to form an ultrasonic fence. Now, with the colony as the center, the ten kilometers radius became a restricted zone for Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
Thanks to this, the stagnant work around the colony finally restarted.</br>
</br>
Under the command of Captain Hong Zewei, the engineering team repaired the riddled hydroponic plantations and pastures damaged by Devil Worms. At the same time, based on the plan of the Space Command Center, the first automatic steel plant was built on Mars.</br>
</br>
There was no need to build mines to mine iron ore on Mars.</br>
</br>
There were iron ores all over the place on Mars.</br>
</br>
It was an incredibly true statement.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult to smell the distinct scent unique to rust when one scooped up a cup of sand.</br>
</br>
With the raw materials just beneath it, the newly built factory would only require sand to be dumped into the boiler to produce batches of steel products. The waste slag was mostly silica, which could be further processed into glass or concrete building material.</br>
</br>
Part of the steel produced was used for constructing the colony, while the other part was made into rebar and stainless steel plates to reinforce the surface of the colony.</br>
</br>
Yes, steel on Mars was cheap enough to be used as floor tiles.</br>
</br>
The engineering team responsible for the construction first drilled steel reinforcements into the ground, then they poured cement to create a concrete foundation before a layer of high-strength stainless steel alloy was placed. With the reinforcement measures in place, even if a drill grew on the Devil Worms' head, they would be not be able to penetrate through the ground below the colony.</br>
</br>
Although the ultrasonic fence did exist, the thought of countless Devil Worm tunnels below their feet still made people feel comfortable. Even as an extra protection mechanism, the alloy flooring was absolutely necessary.</br>
</br>
In addition, concrete's ability to insulate sound would effectively block out the ultrasonic waves under the ground and reduce the impact on the colonists' health.</br>
</br>
Other than iron ore, the geology team Wang Qiang discovered a carbon mine with a considerable amount of reserve in a crater located ten kilometers away from the colony. This natural carbon mine seemed rare on Earth due to the oxidizing environment but appeared to be very common on Mars.</br>
</br>
</br>
Relying on the graphite produced by this carbon mine, the colony was self-sustainable and thus did not need to depend on imports from Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Both the steel plant and the graphene plant were built, and now only two tasks remained from the headquarters. One was to establish a base station near the equator for the construction of a space elevator, while the other was Project 071.</br>
</br>
Celestial Marines established an operational base above Mine 071. The construction team reinforced the base with concrete and steel. The base was equipped with machine guns, communication base stations, accommodation camps, and garages.</br>
</br>
In addition, the engineering team's drilling rig also drilled a tunnel around Mine 071 that allowed armored vehicles to move underground. The tunnel was also reinforced to prevent Devil Worm from damaging the structure.</br>
</br>
The tunnel down five-kilometer deep was a test of the construction technology of the engineering team. However, the team already experienced many similar challenges. After more than a month of hard work, the rig finally reached the edge of the ruins of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
Their next step was to continue to drill down around the ruins to create a spiral passage. After the team determined the level of the Gaia civilization database, it would then dig into the remains.</br>
</br>
"This is Team A, we have arrived at the edge of the unknown area."</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai followed behind the rig and reported the situation to the headquarters as he examined the map on the holographic screen inside the helmet.</br>
</br>
"Move forward."</br>
</br>
"Roger." Zhang Hai switched to the team channel, raised his rifle, and aimed at tunnel in front of him. "All combat units, high-density life signal detected in front, we are about to enter the danger zone. Protect the rig, open safety, firing permitted, move."</br>
</br>
The rig continued to advance forward and the engineering vehicle behind it pushed screws into the tunnel while also poured quick-drying concrete to strengthen the tunnel. Marines followed closely and aimed with their Gauss rifles and cautiously moved forward.</br>
</br>
If Devil Worms were to appear from one direction, then it must be in front of the rig.</br>
</br>
When the drill bit broke through a rocky surface, the rock in front of them collapsed and revealed a large space. The rig stopped and the soldiers on both sides immediately approached the empty area, but there was no trace of Devil Worms in the hollow formation.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai walked to the nearby wall and opened the tactical flashlight to check along the wall. He found the red rock and the fungi clusters that grew on the surface.</br>
</br>
It was no doubt that the oxygen supply layer.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai signaled the soldiers behind him, then carefully retreated into the reinforced tunnel. Just then, a solider accidentally discovered a strange egg.</br>
</br>
The dark green egg was around half-person tall. Under the flashlight, a layer of colorful spots was visible under its oily film. It seemed to be contracting and swelling to an unknown rhythm.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was irritated by the light of the flashlight, its swelling speed seemed to increase.</br>
</br>
"What is this?" With his rifle aimed at the egg, the soldier pressed it on his helmet, took a few photos and sent it to the team channel. "Captain, we found something odd here."</br>
</br>
"A Devil Worm egg?" Looking at the image on the holographic screen, Zhang Hai frowned slightly and walked up. "No... Let the rig stop."</br>
</br>
The drill rig stopped drilling forward.</br>
</br>
Soon, Zhang Hai reconnected with the headquarters.</br>
</br>
As soon as the communication was connected, the headquarters asked.</br>
</br>
"What happened? Why did the rig stop?"</br>
</br>
"Report, this is Team A. We drilled through a hollow formation, where we found a lot of fungi, and a strange egg... probably an egg." Looking at the agitated follicle, Zhang Hai sent those photos to TS Expedition.</br>
</br>
"This is the headquarters. We have received the information and are sending researchers to the target area for sampling. Please wait there."</br>
</br>
"Roger." After the communication ended, Zhang Hai signaled to the soldiers to the sides of the rig.</br>
</br>
Before the researchers arrived, they would establish a simple line of defense here.</br>
</br>
"What do you think this is?"Koenig whispered in the channel as he nervously aimed at the egg.</br>
</br>
"I don't know. Maybe it's a mutated Devil Worm? Or maybe it's a new species that we have never seen before? To be honest... since we already saw Devil Worms before, even if God himself stood in front of me, I would not be surprised."</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai listened to the conversation of his teammates as he looked at the egg.</br>
</br>
The egg seemed to be an exposed heart, pulsating based on a special rhythm.</br>
</br>
For some strange reason, the more he stared at that egg, the more he felt a strong sense of uneasiness...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1274: Underground Encounter</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The sound of the engine's roar sounded behind them.</br>
</br>
An armored vehicle parked not far away from the drilling rig and a field researcher in a heavy protective suit jumped down with a toolbox.</br>
</br>
"Look, Santa Claus is here." A Celestial Marine blew a whistle and then joked in the communication channel as he watched the researcher walk to them, struggling to maintain his balance.</br>
</br>
Santa Claus.</br>
</br>
A nickname Celestial Marines gave to the field researchers.</br>
</br>
The reason was that the field researcher did look like a Santa Clauses with a big belly after they wore the red protective suit. Of course, while the name was an inside joke, it did not carry any derogatory meaning.</br>
</br>
When the researcher reached Zhang Hai, he asked calmly.</br>
</br>
"Where is the sample?"</br>
</br>
"Just at the front there." Zhang Hai pointed to the direction where Koenig stood. "Be careful, we are not sure if it is dangerous."</br>
</br>
"We know better than you how to identify the dangers of living species."</br>
</br>
The researcher left in heavy steps as he moved toward the tip of the drill.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai nonchalantly responded and looked at the researcher moving toward the drill. He raised a middle finger in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Captain, I feel that the frequency of its pulse seems to be getting faster."</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai heard what Koenig said and frowned at the message.</br>
</br>
"You sure?"</br>
</br>
"Uhhh, maybe?"</br>
</br>
"Our 'expert' will tell us once he takes a look." Another Marine soldier joked, but the rifle pointed to the front showed his alertness.</br>
</br>
From MLL Island to now, the soldiers stationed here were considered the elites of Celestial Trade. Whether the opponents were humans or Martian species, they could proudly proclaim themselves as battle-tested soldiers. Due to their history of past successes, they would be extra cautious in every mission, so that this mission would not become their last mission...</br>
</br>
The researcher stopped next to the egg. He dropped his toolbox on the ground and created a ripple of dust from the ground.</br>
</br>
"Yo, be gentle." Koenig, a few steps behind him, quietly reminded him. However, after the researcher glared back at him, Koenig shrugged and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
The researcher skillfully took out some instruments from the toolbox. He first attached the two ends of the wire to the egg and then tapped on the screen around his arm.</br>
</br>
"Its vital signal is stable... the bioelectric current is weak."</br>
</br>
After muttering this sentence to himself, he took out a nanoneedle from the toolbox and then inserted it into the beating egg.</br>
</br>
For some odd reason, the instant the needle was inserted into the gg, Zhang Hai's eyebrows quickly jumped a few times. But he ultimately resisted the urge to stop the researcher and forcibly convinced himself to believe in the choice of the expert.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, or the researcher was indeed experienced, he smoothly extracted a test tube of green liquid from the egg.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Highly acidic liquid. It may contain some corrosive bacteria?"</br>
</br>
The researcher looked at the liquid in the test tube and said to himself.</br>
</br>
Then he shook his head, stuffed the test tube back into the toolbox, and took out a razor-shaped scanner.</br>
</br>
The scanner could simultaneously emit two kinds of strong and weak penetrating rays, scan the external structure and internal structure of the object, and form a simple three-dimensional view. The tool was a powerful enhanced version of the "ultrasound tool". However, because of the high level of radiation and the possibility of trace amounts of radiation, the tool was only suitable for use on non-humans.</br>
</br>
The scanner was aimed at the egg, and the researcher opened the holographic screen inside his helmet.</br>
</br>
"Hmm... let me see what you are."</br>
</br>
While muttering to himself, he pressed the switch of the scanner.</br>
</br>
The three-dimensional composition view was presented on a holographic screen, and these images were simultaneously transmitted back to TS Expedition orbiting around the synchronous orbit.</br>
</br>
Looking at the transparent carcass that was abnormally large inside the pulsating egg, the researcher's eyebrows were locked into a serious frown.</br>
</br>
"What is this…"</br>
</br>
"When can we leave here? I have a bad feeling it is not very safe here." Looking at the researcher who was busy with the egg, Zhang Hai could not help but remind him, "If you are still uncertain about certain things, I suggest that you first spray it with a cryogen, then put it in the specimen box and bring it back to the colony's isolation room..."</br>
</br>
"You don't have to teach me how to sample," the researcher said standoffishly as he stood up. "Before we are certain about its vital signs, using cryogen may completely stop its vitality."</br>
</br>
"So, can we start sampling now?" Koenig asked. "I feel the same way as the captain. This stuff gives me an ominous feeling."</br>
</br>
"Yes," the researcher coldly responded. Then he took a fire extinguisher-like item from the toolbox and pointed it directly at the egg.</br>
</br>
It was the cryogen used for sampling. Unlike the injectable inhabitant necessary for the hibernation chamber, the cryogen was designed for external use.</br>
</br>
A click of a button and the white spray covered the surface of the egg.</br>
</br>
However, the researcher frowned.</br>
</br>
It may be his illusion but the speed at which the egg pulsated seemed to be getting faster.</br>
</br>
"Does low temperatures accelerate their life activities in a short period of time to generate more calories to maintain normal life activities?"</br>
</br>
The researcher vaguely remembered this discovery as he prepared to increase the output of the cryogen.</br>
</br>
For a moment, the egg suddenly shrank to the extreme.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai's brows jumped without warning, almost out of reflex, he rushed to the side and shouted in the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"FALL—"</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
The egg suddenly burst and green droplets splattered out like countless green arrows. The powerful hailstorm of arrows launched at the drill and the Celestial Marines nearby. The researcher closest to the egg was directly hit by the shockwave of the explosion and sent directly into the drill. Koenig not far away from him was also covered by the green droplets.</br>
</br>
The deafening explosion echoed in the tunnel and reverberated through everyone's eardrums. The powerful explosion was still clear and audible even on Mars where gas density was extremely low.</br>
</br>
But the more horrible thing had yet to happen.</br>
</br>
"AHHH!"</br>
</br>
The researcher struggled to climb up from the ground. The part that was drenched in green liquid seemed to be on fire as white smoke appeared.</br>
</br>
He desperately wanted to wipe off the liquid on his body, but soon his eye began to widen and hr was gradually covered in blood...</br>
</br>
"His spacesuit is damaged. Help him quickly and put him in the vehicle! Koenig! DAMMIT!"</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai cursed, took two quick steps, grabbed the researcher's collar, pulled him to his side, and then took out a gel spray to repair where the spacesuit was broken.</br>
</br>
The jelly-like gel paste was stuck to the spacesuit, repairing the damage. The bloodshot in his eyes began to disappear, but so did the color in his eyes. If it was not for the life signal detector still detecting his life activities, Zhang Hai was about to pronounce him died.</br>
</br>
On the other side, the seriously injured Koenig was rescued by his comrades and dragged back from the edge of death.</br>
</br>
"Take them back to the vehicle... call the command center! We have two people injured here, a researcher, and a Marine soldier! Repeat, we have two people injured here..."</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, there was a fierce scream that came from the distance.</br>
</br>
Cold sweat instantly covered Zhang Hai's forehead.</br>
</br>
He dragged the unconscious researcher in one hand and raised the rifle in his other hand as he vacated the area.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, a monster that he had never seen before, crawled into the tunnel from the front side of the rig...</br>

</br>
Celestial City, the gravity-free section of the dock.</br>
</br>
It was the midst of the ceremony of the Envoy-class starship, however, Jiang Chen, who was speaking to Kelvin, showed a gradually tense expression.</br>
</br>
"...the Marines we sent underground were attacked by unknown Martian creatures...not the Devil Worms. Three Marines were killed, two soldiers and a researcher were seriously injured." Kelvin took a deep breath and transferred a video file to Jiang Chen's phone. "This is the recording of the battle."</br>
</br>
[Transfer completed]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen checked behind him to ensure that no one was around before he clicked play.</br>
</br>
In the picture, Celestial Marines were engaged in a fierce exchange of fire against the Martian creatures that suddenly appeared.</br>
</br>
A Marine soldier grabbed a researcher's back while he used a Gaussian rifle to return fire.</br>
</br>
The Martian creature that was hit screamed in pain as green blood splattered. It tried to dodge to the side while also creating space of its kind. At the same time, it sprayed corrosive acid with its menacing giant mouth.</br>
</br>
The intensity of the battle made the video extremely shaky.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly pressed the pause button.</br>
</br>
The picture was fixed on the giant, terrifying mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen zoomed in, then zoomed in further before he fixed his sight on the creature.</br>
</br>
Powerful feet, long tail with barbs, a fusiform-shaped head, arms extended forward and sharp claws; the appearance of the creature looked explosive and lethal. The crustaceans on its back were lined up like a heavy cavalry armor.</br>
</br>
All of a sudden, Jiang Chen's pupils shrank.</br>
</br>
He felt like the appearance looked familiar.</br>
</br>
Not from the apocalypse, nor in the memory of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
It came from the memory of Gliese 581g!</br>
</br>
Yes, that's right!</br>
</br>
The bugs that first fought with the Brahma looked exactly like this!</br>
</br>
But why?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's head was filled with countless questions.</br>
</br>
He did not understand why the opponent that the Harmony civilization once faced, now appeared on Mars.</br>
</br>
After some careful thought, the way the Devil Worms attacked was almost identical to the bugs that sieged the Brahma colonists. The only difference may be that the bug Brahma encountered was bigger than the Devil Worm, and its back was dotted with a quartz shell...</br>
</br>
A coincidence?</br>
</br>
But it was too similar.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned as he tried to piece the puzzle together.</br>
</br>
Kelvin saw that Jiang Chen did not respond, so he tried to get an answer.</br>
</br>
"President?"</br>
</br>
Kelvin's voice reminded Jiang Chen that he was still on the call.</br>
</br>
No longer stuck in his thoughts, Jiang Chen turned off the holographic screen, and immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
"Wait for me at the command center. I will come over immediately."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone and returned to the dock to quickly inform Wu Changfeng and the other people at the boarding entrance about his early departure. Then, he rushed to the command center for Project 071.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he arrived, everyone in the command room was running in circles.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked next to Kelvin and asked with a sense of urgency.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation on the front line?"</br>
</br>
"It's not optimistic... We have a drilling rig stuck underground. Fortunately, the people inside the rig has been evacuated in time. The seriously injured researcher is still in critical condition, another seriously injured researcher is now in stable condition," Kelvin responded as his expression looked tense and serious.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and then asked.</br>
</br>
"What about the situation inside the tunnel?"</br>
</br>
"The tunnel is currently occupied by the unknown Martian creature. We are building a database for this creature... Yes, what should we name this monster? Do you have any ideas?" Kelvin asked.</br>
</br>
"...just call them the Corruptors."</br>
</br>
"Corruptors? The name seems fitting since they do spit out highly corrosive acids which can corrupt anything." After a pause, there was a look of disbelief on Kelvin's face. "The most amazing thing is their eggs can explode when irritated by external stimuli, and the explosion is not weak either..."</br>
</br>
"How powerful is the explosion?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Close to half a ton of TNT, with corrosive damage. This can have miraculous effects in a small and confined space," Kelvin said.</br>
</br>
Half a ton of TNT?</br>
</br>
The number was not daunting, but just like Kelvin had said, it would be surprisingly effective inside a tight corridor</br>
</br>
More importantly, the target area was too close to the ruins of the Gaia civilization. In order to avoid damage to the remains, even dealing with the eggs must be exercised with caution, let alone thinking about the possibility of using powerful missiles.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The alarm rang at Mine 071 on the desert.</br>
</br>
The moment the battle broke out in the tunnel, the people in the entire operation base moved.</br>
</br>
All the non-combatants boarded the Mars rover for orders. Fully-loaded armored vehicles rolled out from the garage and moved toward the tunnel. When the armored vehicle carrying the wounded left the tunnel, an attack formation formed by four armored vehicles headed into the tunnel.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the tunnel, the attack formation engaged in a fierce exchange of fire with the Corruptors who attacked back.</br>
</br>
However, the acids not only could corrode through spacesuits and aerospace exoskeletons, but they even corroded through the vehicle armor.</br>
</br>
A white mist formed on the surface of the armor, and the green acid seemed to be boiling as white bubbles formed. Fortunately, the composite armor was still superior in being corrosion resistant. Especially after analyzing the blood vessels of Devil Worms, the scientists at Future Heavy Industries designed a corrosion-resistant gel.</br>
</br>
The gel could quickly condense into a high-viscosity colloid in a low-pressure environment. It could be used to repair a damaged spacesuit in an emergency, effectively shielding the corrosion of organic acids, and to a certain extent greatly improve the survivability of front-line forces against Martian species.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, the battle ended in a draw.</br>
</br>
The Corruptors in the depths of the tunnel were like floods. After the vehicles entered the tunnel, the electromagnetic pulse cannons on top of the armor vehicles did not stop for a single moment.</br>
</br>
The high-speed projectiles caused havoc in the tunnel, accompanied by rocket explosions from time to time. While the exchange of fire happened between the two sides, the broken concrete wall finally gave in and the tunnel collapsed into several sections.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the armored vehicles evacuated in time and prevented any further tragedies.</br>
</br>
"DAMMIT, did we not build an ultrasonic fence?"</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei frowned as he looked into his holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"The ultrasonic fence is only effective against Devil Worms. It is clear that we have driven away Devil Worms, and now another group of bugs have occupied the nest that once belonged to them," a scientist coughed first, then responded to Hong Zewei.</br>
</br>
"Can you figure out the ultrasonic frequency that gets rid of these... Corruptors?" Hong Zewei immediately asked.</br>
</br>
With Project 071 dragging on for almost a year and was finally about to come an end, the sudden unexpected change made him extremely irritated. He was most concerned about the possibility that the Corruptors would behave like Devil Worms and target the colony...</br>
</br>
"It's feasible in theory, but it requires us to understand their body structure to a certain degree." The scientist shrugged. "It takes a lot of specimens, and it's even better to have a few eggs..."</br>
</br>
Even better to have a few eggs?</br>
</br>
What do you think this is?</br>
</br>
Free refill for coffee?</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei bitterly smiled in his mind and turned his sight to the colony outside his window.</br>
</br>
The red desert had been replaced by alloy flooring, the new steel factory was pumping out white mist, and the graphene dome on the farm had a green sheen that was faintly visible. The colony was growing; they could not accept another rebuild.</br>
</br>
If these Corruptors intend to win in numbers, it would definitely be a disaster for the almost undefended colony on the surface.</br>
</br>
His clenched fists loosened as Hong Zewei clicked on the holographic screen twice and ordered the engineering team.</br>
</br>
"All ongoing projects must be stopped. All engineering teams immediately commence wall construction. We will surround our colony with concrete walls!"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1276: A New Body</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Mars colony experienced a similar encounter to the Brahma.</br>
</br>
As Celestial Marines descended down, the "Aboriginals" underground gradually began to reveal their sharp claws. Devil Worms from the start, now the Corrupters that could spit acid and tear their prey with their sharp fangs.</br>
</br>
What's next?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know; no one in the world knew.</br>
</br>
All news related to the Mine 071 site was suppressed by Celestial Trade. All the participating Marines were interviewed after the entire incident to cover up the Devil Worm Incident near Mine 071. Because the incident did not involve Future Mining, the treatment of this incident was much easier compared to the previous time, and did not even attract the attention of the international community.</br>
</br>
As for the family members of the soldiers who died, of course, they all received a considerable pension. Although money wouldn't make up for the pain of losing their loved ones, it could at least make those still alive live a little better.</br>
</br>
"What the Mars Colony needs is not reinforcements, but solutions."</br>
</br>
"The problem is what is the solution?"</br>
</br>
"We need specimens, more specimens! Only by understanding their structure can we defeat them!"</br>
</br>
"It is not difficult to defeat them. No creature can resist electromagnetic pulse cannons and flames. The problem is ... there are too many of them."</br>
</br>
There were constant arguments in the conference room. However, despite the fierce discussions, the senior executives of Project 071 had yet to come up with any feasible solution.</br>
</br>
Specimen, more specimen.</br>
</br>
This may seem easy to say, but collecting specimens of Corrupters, which lived together in groups, would be much more difficult compared to collecting specimens of Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
This underground creature did not seem to be good at digging, at least its digging speed was far worse than that of Devil Worms, which could be described as swimmers of dirt. On the other hand, however, they were more intelligent, especially at "planting" oxygen-producing fungi.</br>
</br>
For these reasons, their area of activities underground was limited and restricted.</br>
</br>
Some even speculated that it was likely that the Corruptor's lair was located near the ruins of the Gaia civilization. What the Celestial Marines unearthed was only their new lair. After all, the ultrasonic fence eradicated the Devil Worms in this region, which created a vast, inhabited zone for Corruptors free of their potential natural enemies.</br>
</br>
The meeting came to an end temporarily.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went into the lounge and poured a cup of coffee for himself, then he sat down.</br>
</br>
A problem had bothered him for the past few days.</br>
</br>
Why the monster he saw in the memory of Harmony civilization appeared in Mine 071 on Mars. If he remembered correctly, the source of these Corruptors was the specimen bank of the Gaia civilization. However, based on the memory of the Gaia civilization, they did not travel that far.</br>
</br>
</br>
"... All three factions had stations established on Mars before the war. The cause of the Third World War was due to the economic crisis of 2150, the Gaia civilization 3.7 billion years ago, Gliese 581g ..."</br>
</br>
He gently tapped the edge of his cup and fixated his eyes on the white mist. Jiang Chen began to sift through the information his head.</br>
</br>
Inside the mist, he had a feeling.</br>
</br>
He was very close to the truth.</br>
</br>
The door of the lounge opened, and Ayesha walked to him in light steps.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled when he felt the tender hands around his shoulders, then closed his eyes, and relaxed his muscles as he leaned back.</br>
</br>
"Comfortable?"</br>
</br>
"It's great."</br>
</br>
Her lips formed into a happy arc.</br>
</br>
"Have you been busy?"</br>
</br>
"Well, troubles always come together," Jiang Chen sighed softly and said in a joking tone, "Sometimes I wish I could divide myself into three people. One stays on the synchronized orbit, and one resides in Coro Island."</br>
</br>
As for the other one, even if Jiang Chen didn't mention it, Ayesha knew he referred to the world torn by war.</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, Jiang Chen suddenly remembered the number X71291 he had picked up from Subway Line 0.</br>
</br>
I wonder if Lin Lin made any progress.</br>
</br>
If it can help, I think many things would be a lot easier...</br>
</br>
Probably?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Ahhchoo!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin in a white loab coat sneezed as she rubbed her slightly red nose and put the welding torch in her hand aside.</br>
</br>
"Who is thinking of me..."</br>
</br>
She muttered in a low voice; she then quickly tapped the holographic screen a few times.</br>
</br>
Looking at the parameters on the chart slowly stabilizing, she let out a sigh. Lin Lin looked at the "artwork" on the operating table and a proud smile formed. Her small chest raised slightly as she bragged to the empty room.</br>
</br>
"Hm, it is indeed a masterpiece of mine. It already possesses one-tenth of my beauty ... no, one percent."</br>
</br>
Just as her little nose was about to rise to the sky, a voice interrupted her gloating.</br>
</br>
"Hmph, what a weak body."</br>
</br>
The "artwork" lying on the operating table had opened her eyes, and was looking at the proud Lin Lin with its pale pupils.</br>
</br>
The white and flawless skin was enough to make all women in the world envy. The perfect arms and calves seemed to only exist on porcelain dolls. The smooth golden hair scattered down like a waterfall at dusk, and the hazel eyes radiated a pristine and angelic vibe. Every parts came together perfectly to create an elf girl that should only exist in an oil painting.</br>
</br>
"Shut up," Lin Lin glared at her with her hands on her hips, "Do you know how long it took me to make this body for you?"</br>
</br>
"Well, it's not too bad I guess..."</br>
</br>
The girl ignored the infuriated Lin Lin and said the sentence without any fluctuation in her emotion. She got up from the operating table and jumped onto the ground.</br>
</br>
She walked to the mirror and nodded. Then she said in an impolite tone.</br>
</br>
"Lend me the lab for two days."</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"This body is too weak, I need to make a more convenient body for myself." The girl said as if the lab belonged to her.</br>
</br>
"A more convenient body?" Lin Lin frowned suspiciously. "What do you want to do?"</br>
</br>
She was not afraid X71291 would erase the restriction placed on her, since the so-called restriction was not on her body. Her core remained in the apocalypse, on the quantum computer that was moved from Subway Line 0 to Wanghai and was currently guarded by heavy military presence. And other than quantum computers of the same size, there was no other place in the world that could store her presence.</br>
</br>
As for what controlled her body, it was just a chipset equipped with a Klein particle transmitter.</br>
</br>
In other words, if she did anything unpleasant, either Jiang Chen or Lin Lin could shut down her "brain" immediately.</br>
</br>
Although X71291 indicated that she was not interesting in making such meaningless tasks, basic precautions were still necessary.</br>
</br>
AI is a double-edged sword.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen deeply believed the statement.</br>
</br>
If he used it well, maybe it would be like what X71291 had said, it'll help him increase his odds by 1%.</br>
</br>
But if he used it ineffectively, he would not be surprised if anything else happened…</br>
</br>
"If the host's life signal stops, my self-destruct program will start, right?" The girl said, without showing any emotion in her voice.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Because it was agreed upon, Lin Lin simply admitted to this point. "Just like what we agreed at the beginning, protecting Jiang Chen's security is also one of your obligations. If something goes wrong, whether or not if it is related to you, we will destroy you. "</br>
</br>
The young girl nodded and spread her two small arms.</br>
</br>
"So, what can you expect me to do like this?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's expression was a little awkward.</br>
</br>
Obviously, she also realized the problem.</br>
</br>
Except for the titanium alloy skeleton, this body was just a cute little girl. Disregarding basic combat power, she should be thankful if this body did not attract any strange weirdoes.</br>
</br>
"What weapons do you need? Electromagnetic pulse cannons? Gamma rays? Or ordinary thermal weapons? I'll add it now ..."</br>
</br>
"No need, I can do it by myself." The girl shook her head. However, inside her indifferent pupils, there was an emotion that made Lin Lin enraged.</br>
</br>
That look...</br>
</br>
Is definitely a mockery of her superb skills!</br>
</br>
However, while Lin Lin was angry, she did not know how to refute.</br>
</br>
After all, it was mockery directly from an advanced artificial intelligence...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1277: Set Sail!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
More than a week had passed since the Envoy-class launched.</br>
</br>
After a short break, the starship named "SS Origin", set off from Celestial City.</br>
</br>
The passengers waiting on Celestial City witnessed the shocking scene again.</br>
</br>
The engine located on the bottom of the starship emitted an eerie blue glow that provided thrust for the starship, it slowly drifted away from Celestial City.</br>
</br>
"The orbital parameters have been corrected."</br>
</br>
"The reactive nitrogen shield is operating normally."</br>
</br>
"Confirm star path safety."</br>
</br>
"All non-fleet personnel should enter the hibernation chamber."</br>
</br>
"The engine is confirmed to be normal, preset power to 10%, ignition is ready."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Inside the bridge, reports came one after another.</br>
</br>
The brain of the ship was located here, and the bridge also served as the nerve center of the entire ship. All information were collected in this location and all orders were issued out from this hub.</br>
</br>
The captain stood at the back of the bridge. His cold and determined eyes stared straight ahead.</br>
</br>
On the large holographic screen directly in front of the bridge, a star map that covered the entire solar system unfolded. The orbits of all observable objects were marked in detail in this star map.</br>
</br>
A green arc marked the route of SS Origin connected Earth to Mars. SS Origin would orbit for one-fourth around the high Mars orbit before the starship set off to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, then it would sail through the deep space directly to Kuiper Belt. SS Origin would then cruise on the edge of the Solar System, perform training, scientific research, and exploration tasks issued by the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
From this point on, loneliness would become their shadow that constantly lingered with them. Until the starship receive the order to end the mission, returning to Earth was a distant dream.</br>
</br>
However, they were already mentally prepared for this. Even if they would never be able to come back, they did not hesitate when they stepped on board.</br>
</br>
Whether it was for their motherland or for the common future of human civilization...</br>
</br>
"Captain." The final procedure before departure was completed. The deputy captain approached the captain, and performed a Celestial Trade Navy salute. "Waiting for orders."</br>
</br>
Captain nodded, picked up the microphone from the command table, and ordered with might.</br>
</br>
"Ignite!"</br>
</br>
From Celestial City, in the deep and eerie universe, the two clusters of blue glows that held SS Origin gradually extinguished.</br>
</br>
Instead, there was a brighter ball of flame.</br>
</br>
The flame, like a small Sun, suddenly radiated from the end of the ship's hull, emitted dazzling white light, and formed layers of heat waves behind it.</br>
</br>
Deuterium imprisoned by a strong magnetic field collided violently with Helium-3, and at this moment all the light and heat generated by nuclear fusion were gathered into a bundle by the huge melting furnace. The force pushed SS Origin to the distant starry sky at an incredible speed.</br>
</br>
</br>
Like a second sunrise.</br>
</br>
The dazzling white light instantly blinded everyone.</br>
</br>
When their eyes reopened again, the emotions that bloomed in each pupil was all, without exception, shock and excitement.</br>
</br>
The passengers that stood in Celestial City waved their arms, and sent the starship off with cheers, whistles, and the flashes of the camera. People all knew that it would become a star in the darkness, and eventually disappear.</br>
</br>
The workers of Celestial Shipyard, the astronauts working in the space station, and the people busy around Celestial City all stopped their work at this moment. They looked out the window or into the holographic screen as departed SS Origin. Their face all shared the same excitement and pride.</br>
</br>
At the same time that SS Origin ignited, bright fireworks bloomed over Penglai. In this digitized city of the future, every holographic screen belonged to Future Group and every broadcast was playing the incredible scene.</br>
</br>
People, regardless of race, nationality, religion, gender, were all watching this in front of their TV... They all cheered for the same reason, prayed for the same dream, blessed for the same name.</br>
</br>
Of course, the Internet gave the strongest response.</br>
</br>
Three days before the departure of SS Origin, the three keywords "Origin", "Envoy-Class Starship" and "Earth Fleet" emerged as the top ten most searched words of every major search engines. And when Celestial Trade's official website annouced its launch, major TV and online media broadcasted the ignition of the fusion engine, the name "Origin" overtook the popularity of any scandals and became the most searched keyword!</br>
</br>
There was no background music.</br>
</br>
There was no post editing.</br>
</br>
But even so, the scene that looked like a second Sun rising was imprinted in everyone's eyes and soul. It was like a flame had ignited from deep inside the bone marrow, dissipating all the darkness and fear that people once had against extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
Videos of the ignition went viral. The comment section of Celestial Trade's website was bombarded with comments.</br>
</br>
"So... that is a nuclear fusion engine?"</br>
</br>
"That is the Envoy-class Starship of Future Heavy Industries?"</br>
</br>
"So big... I can't describe it any other way."</br>
</br>
"Will such a big ship be able to fly out of the Solar System?"</br>
</br>
"I wonder if this thing can win against an aircraft carrier battle group ..."</br>
</br>
"As a UA citizen... well, I don't know what to say."</br>
</br>
"I don't know if this can fly to the Gliese 581, but in theory it should only be a matter of time?"</br>
</br>
"Long live Celestial Trade! Long live the Earth Defense Alliance! The Earth Fleet will win!"</br>
</br>
"The Finnish people sends our congratulations on the successful launch of the Earth Fleet, we will defeat those 20.5 light years away, and revenge the dead Finns and British soldiers who died by Lake Inari ..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Celestial City, Space Command Center.</br>
</br>
With both hands behind him, like most people on Celestial City, Jiang Chen was also looking at the "Sun" disappearing in the distance.</br>
</br>
On his right-hand side, countless holographic screens were unfolded, and the real-time reports of SS Origin were summarized by Jean and presented in front of him.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't read them at all.</br>
</br>
Without even thinking, he could guess the reports.</br>
</br>
Everyone was astonished.</br>
</br>
To be honest, even Jiang Chen himself was astonished by the scene when the Envoy-class set sail.</br>
</br>
Although the scene was emulated countless times in the VR system, actually witnessing the launch was the most shocking experience he ever had.</br>
</br>
An idea suddenly appeared in his head.</br>
</br>
Brahma, Zheng He, and the space colonization ship that disappeared in the void along with its name ... even the starships that symbolized the most advanced forces before the apocalypse, were probably not as astonishing?</br>
</br>
After a short while, Jiang Chen shook his head and denied this unrealistic thought.</br>
</br>
Although Future Heavy Industries absorbed the technologies of Pan-Asia Cooperation at an incredible speed, he must acknowledge that the gap between the two was still there.</br>
</br>
Not to mention, in the case of a damaged space elevator, the ability to launch a colony ship vertically from the atmosphere would be an impossible task for Future Heavy Industries. This demanded extremely high requirements for the material strength, engines, and shield technology of the starship.</br>
</br>
At present, SS Origin was equipped with a reactive nitrogen shield to protect itself against the meteorite, and the main engine used the simple, crude and efficient fusion engine. The "Holy Shield" system used in Wanghai may be able to see a breakthrough soon, but the warp drive engine was still far from becoming a reality ...</br>
</br>
But he could be proud of one thing.</br>
</br>
Looking at the universe outside the floor-to-ceiling window, Jiang Chen smiled</br>
</br>
He had heard a little about the history of that world from Lin Lin</br>
</br>
On that timeline, the time point Pan-Asia Cooperation took this great leap was at the end of the 21st century...</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1278: Who will dominate the next century?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The front page of a newspaper was the pristine blue planet.</br>
</br>
Below the Earth was a hand that emerged out from darkness, and that hand was firmly holding onto the planet.</br>
</br>
A face could be barely made out from inside the darkness.</br>
</br>
The face was youthful, and other than that, there was no other memorable characteristics. However, even the person with the worst ability to identify someone would recognize this face… as long as the person was not out of touch with the times.</br>
</br>
The headline below the picture was very ambiguous.</br>
</br>
[Who will dominate the next century?]</br>
</br>
Now, this piece of newspaper, along with many similar ones, were placed on the table of the president's office.</br>
</br>
"What do you think," Hill swept the newspapers aside, then rubbed her sore brows before she looked to her chief of staff, "of that Envoy-class Starship?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The chief of staff did not speak. Instead, together with Secretary of Defense Carter, they silently looked at Bolden who stood next to him.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he got everyone's attention, Bolden took a deep breath and made the tough statements.</br>
</br>
"Our scientists have solved the design problems of large space station counterweights, and now the only difficult problem to solve is the materials."</br>
</br>
"How long will it take?" Hill asked Bolden as she stared into him.</br>
</br>
"Conservatively, 20 years, but maybe a little longer ..." Bolden said with awkwardness in his tone.</br>
</br>
"This is not the same as what you said last time." Carter looked at Bolden and said in a somewhat aggressive tone. "When we met half-a-month ago, you said that you could solve the technical difficulties on the space elevator by 2040 at the latest. You even said that you could build at least one elevator for the nation and connect it to the synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
"You can't blame all this on us." Bolden argued, "If Obayashi Gumi did not cancel the joint research and development agreement with us, the time required could be reduced by at least half."</br>
</br>
"Obayashi Gumi?" Hill frowned, she looked at Secretary of State Kerry, who had not spoken, then said. "This name sounds familiar."</br>
</br>
"A company controlled by Sumitomo Foundation. It announced in 2014 that it could complete the space elevator in 2050, and there was reliable news that they had been working on related technologies since 2010." Kerry paused for a moment, glanced at Bolden with confusion in his eyes, he frowned. "I remember Sumitomo Foundation has been actively participating in our International Space Station program and has worked closely with NASA and SpaceX for a long time. Why ..."</br>
</br>
"It's Celestial Trade," Bolden said. "They convinced them to give up on the space elevator program. It's likely they gave them a promise? You know Obayashi Gumi's main focus is construction. Maybe Celestial Trade has contracted out projects on Mars or the Moon to them? Anyway, they have now paid the penalty. "</br>
</br>
</br>
"Those ungrateful wretches..." Carter cursed under his breath.</br>
</br>
"They have always been ungrateful wretches, and we should have been mentally prepared," Kerry said with a sigh.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the room suddenly turned quiet, Bolden coughed, and added.</br>
</br>
"... Fortunately, we have found another company. Now, we are cooperating with Thoth Technology from Ontario, Canada. Their research on the pressurized tower reached a height of twenty kilometers three years ago. As long as there are breakthroughs in high-strength graphene materials, we have a great opportunity to catch up."</br>
</br>
However, the most problematic issue was the high-strength graphene materials.</br>
</br>
There were many types of graphene materials and this type of material was similar to steel. Although many materials could be considered as steel, steel produced by different materials, different forging processes, and different temperatures could produce vastly different properties.</br>
</br>
The same applied for graphene.</br>
</br>
Although Celestial Trade had registered nearly a hundred patents for nearly ten types of graphene materials used for semiconductors in the world, they had kept the materials related to aerospace and military fields in complete secrecy. Celestial Trade rarely even exported the finished products, let alone register for patents.</br>
</br>
The office was silent again.</br>
</br>
Graphene.</br>
</br>
The damned graphene.</br>
</br>
No one had ever thought that a material that could be produced by sticking two tapes together could create an impossible obstacle for a superpower.</br>
</br>
"Isn't there any good news?" Carter, in a distressed state, asked.</br>
</br>
The completion of the Envoy-class starship created the most pressure for the Minister of Defense.</br>
</br>
He couldn't imagine what could pose a threat to that behemoth.</br>
</br>
Missiles? Cannons?</br>
</br>
Let's not kid ourselves.</br>
</br>
Using missiles in the synchronous orbit to hit satellites is a completely different task than trying to hit battleships.</br>
</br>
Bolden spoke again.</br>
</br>
"Actually... there are some good news."</br>
</br>
Everyone once again focused on Bolden.</br>
</br>
"What good news?" Hill asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"Google-X Labs is ready to join our program."</br>
</br>
"Google-X?" Kerry frowned. "Didn't they abandon the space elevator program six years ago?"</br>
</br>
As early as 2014, Astro Taylor, the head of Google-X Labs, announced the termination of the space elevator project at the TCD, as well as portable jet engines, hoverboards, and other items that usually appeared in science fiction.</br>
</br>
"They did announce the termination of the project..." After a moment of silence, Bolden said, "But they promised to help us on the high-strength graphene project and break through the technical blockade of Celestial Trade."</br>
</br>
Although it was something to be content with, everyone showed a self-deprecating and wry smile.</br>
</br>
Technical blockade?</br>
</br>
Why did the term feel so familiar...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Celestial City.</br>
</br>
In the conference room of the Earth Defense Alliance headquarters, representatives of member states sat around the conference table and had just finished discussing the next development phase of the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
The room was in a relaxed atmosphere. Even the most serious representatives were grinning because of the success of SS Origin.</br>
</br>
"... I know you must be excited, but please keep a cool head before you get too excited. From the standpoint of the Chair of the Alliance Committee, I have to remind you that it is too early to pop some champagne. Our opponents are strong." At the conclusion of the meeting, Jiang Chen stood up, looked around the table, and used this sentence to end his speech.</br>
</br>
Although he said this sentence in a joking tone, he was serious about what he had said.</br>
</br>
Confidence was good.</br>
</br>
When the Finland Incident was determined to be linked to the extraterrestrial civilization, the world was filled with panic, and even the global economy took a hit as a result. Organizations such as Doomsday Church, Noah Ark Foundation, and all sorts of odd organizations appeared.</br>
</br>
Against the extraterrestrial civilization that was already at their doorstep, other than Jiang Chen who received the news first, no one was optimistic that the human civilization could survive an invasion.</br>
</br>
After all, it was only a Mother Nest left in the tundra without much life left. Even with the powerful Celestial Trade Orbital Airborne Brigade, it took a lot of effort to clean up the aliens in the Mother Nest. Even now, the area was designated as a military restricted area, jointly controlled by the Finnish military and Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Now, with the powerful, imposing starship floating in the universe, no one would doubt that the eventual victory belonged to the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
Honestly speaking, Jiang Chen also did not doubt this fact .</br>
</br>
But he won't take it lightly either.</br>
</br>
Although the development of civilization should not be simply measured by time alone, at least from the perspective of world history, ancient civilizations may not be able to defeat young civilizations, even though the former tends to have a great advantage in the early stage ... but Jiang Chen was uncertain that the million-ton starship could be used as the standard for "late stage".</br>
</br>
Confidence was good.</br>
</br>
But arrogance was a poison.</br>
</br>
He would not be optimistic about the outcome, not at least until the breakthroughs in warp drive and antimatter.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1279: Tide of Insects</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The truth proved that Hong Zewei made the correct choice.</br>
</br>
The second week after Corrupters were discovered at Mine 071, more than 500 Celestial Marines stationed nearby had to abandon the base of operations and evacuate from the vicinity.</br>
</br>
These bugs were very clever. They knew that penetrating the tunnel with their head was just asking to be killed by Celestial Marines, so they used the tunnels left by Devil Worms, went around the base, and launched a flank.</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the TS Expedition that continuously monitored the life signal near Mine 071 and alerted the stationed troops to withdraw when the bugs crawled to five kilometers underground, the force would have been caught by surprise.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, these Corruptors were not as sensitive to sound waves as Devil Worms, so the soldiers and engineers stationed there were able to withdraw in time.</br>
</br>
The specimens were also brought back to the base.</br>
</br>
Although it was not easy, the Marines still managed to get a few.</br>
</br>
In addition to more than a dozen intact specimens, they also captured four larvae!</br>
</br>
The four larvae were undoubtedly a pleasant surprise for the base that lacked specimens.</br>
</br>
The four Corruptors larvae were kept in separate vials and stored in isolation rooms.</br>
</br>
The smallest one was the size of an adult's palm, while the largest was the size of a washbasin. They were minified Corruptors, except they did not spew venom. Unlike Devil Worm larvae, the small size did not weaken their aggression, instead, it made them more dangerous and lethal!</br>
</br>
Researchers placed a bull into the same vial. In less than a second, the bull was attacked by the Corruptor, and its head was penetrated by its sharp tail. While the Corruptor ate the bull, it demonstrated an astounding digestive ability, as half of the bull was devoured in three short days.</br>
</br>
In these three days, the size of the Corruptor grew almost exponentially. It grew from palm-sized to half-a-meter-high, and it could spray traces of corrosive acid.</br>
</br>
Based on this trend, in the case of sufficient organic matter, it would grow to the size of an adult Corruptor in less than a month.</br>
</br>
"Twenty larvae in a single birth, each as big as a washbasin ... God, can you imagine it the size of the thing when it becomes an adult!" A researcher in a white coat used his hands to demonstrate the size of the Corruptor as he kept shaking his head. "The experimental environment here is too crude. We must immediately ship the specimens to Celestial City for further research."</br>
</br>
"How long will it take for them to grow up?" Hong Zewei frowned as he examined the restless little thing under the glass cover.</br>
</br>
"I don't know," the researcher shook his head and looked at the bull skeleton inside the glass cover. "This can't be used as a reference. There should be no such rich organic matter for them to grow underground. Sample No. 3 that is consuming oxygen-producing bacteria has a growth speed of only one-tenth of this one. "</br>
</br>
</br>
"How many bugs are still hidden in this damn desert," Hong Zewei cursed fiercely.</br>
</br>
"I don't know if you noticed it," the researcher said after pondering for a moment, "but every time we encounter a new trouble, it's because of Mine 071 ... I'm curious what's buried inside."</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei processed the information, then frowned, and became deep in thought.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, the alarm on the wall interrupted his train-of-thought.</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei immediately looked to the alarm, then rushed towards the entrance of the institute.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The sirens rang inside the colony and the entire colony was rattled.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Celestial Marines demonstrated their combat abilities. In less than half a minute, the equipped soldiers rushed to the front door from the hallway, opened the storage box, and wielded the kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
With their clips locked in, Zhang Hai loaded the Gauss rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
"What's happening outside?" A woman with curly hair walked up and tried to stop Zhang Hai, "There is something else besides the Devil Worms, right? Or you won't build the wall ... "</br>
</br>
"No comment," Zhang Hai answered coldly. Then he buckled the last button of the tactical helmet, pushed the woman away, and jogged to the buffer chamber.</br>
</br>
The woman wanted to say something but was stopped by Brace standing next to her.</br>
</br>
"Enough, Jenny, calm down first." Looking at his teammates, Brace shook his head.</br>
</br>
"But ..." Jenny looked at the captain anxiously. "They must be hiding something from us! I had this feeling when they built the wall, now—"</br>
</br>
"Yes, they are hiding something from us," Brace shook his head, with a bit of helplessness and self-deprecation in his smile. "Don't forget that we are in their house now. If you continue to try to get to the bottom of everything, maybe our right to call our family each month will be deprived."</br>
</br>
The woman named Jenny closed her mouth and stopped talking. She looked at Brace with a stiff expression, nodded, and then looked down with a dejected expression.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
"Great." Brace said standoffishly while he watched the soldiers leave,</br>
</br>
His only wish was to return home.</br>
</br>
Hopefully Celestial Trade's trouble would not affect them.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Outside the colony, the Corruptors rushed out of the tunnel behind the dunes, poured onto the colony's wall and formed a black tide of insects.</br>
</br>
As soon as Zhang Hai stepped on the alloy floor outside, the commander's voice sounded in his ear.</br>
</br>
"Insect tide is approaching, immediately bring your people onto the wall!"</br>
</br>
"Roger," looking at the coordinates of the zone sent to the holographic map, Zhang Hai reached down and pressed his hand on the helmet to switch to the squad channel. "Attention everyone, immediately go to the wall. Open your safety, freely fire!"</br>
</br>
"Roger that!"</br>
</br>
The armored vehicle rushed up the firing platform on the wall from the slope, and the gun at the top pointed at the insects surging like a tide as powerful bullets unleashed.</br>
</br>
After rushing onto the wall, Zhang Hai gestured his comrades next to him, then leaned against behind the corrosion-resistant alloy plate that served as cover. He began to return fire.</br>
</br>
These bugs were smart, at least they were more clever than the Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
The formation of their charge was very loose, and they rushed in waves which effectively reduced the hit rate of the soldiers. While the bugs moved forward, some insects were spraying acids, while other insects were charging under the cover of the acid.</br>
</br>
From time to time, some soldiers were sprayed by the acids and were pulled down by medics for treatment.</br>
</br>
After dodging a stream of acid, Zhang Hai gritted his teeth and raised his rifle. He unleashed the last few bullets in the clip against those nasty bugs, then took a clip from his comrade and inserted it into the rifle.</br>
</br>
When he watched the continuous tides of insects flow out from behind the dunes, his eyebrows twisted together and he cursed under his breath.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, where did these bugs come from ..."</br>
</br>
He didn't know if it was his illusion, but he felt as if an eye was watching them.</br>
</br>
Every time they make a little progress on Mine 071, troubles would ensue.</br>
</br>
A coincidence?</br>
</br>
He didn't think so.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1280: Eavesdropping</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the Earth Defense Alliance meeting, Jiang Chen and Kelvin were escorted by Celestial soldiers to the express train of the Space Command Center.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation in the Mars colony?" Jiang Chen asked Kelvin as they sat down in the first-class cabin.</br>
</br>
"SS Origin has departed six days ago and will reach Mar's orbit at this time tomorrow at the latest. By then, our new weapons and reinforcements will also arrive on Mars, which should help us gain a certain advantage," Kelvin replied.</br>
</br>
On the way to the Kuiper Belt, SS Origin would use Mars' gravity to adjust its direction, and at the same time test SS Origin's orbital docking performance.</br>
</br>
Because it was on the way, Celestial Trade attached Future Military's newly designed weapons and equipment suitable for the Mars environment to the external warehouse on SS Origin. Once the ship entered the orbit, it would drop it down to the surface.</br>
</br>
"Where are the specimens?" Jiang Chen asked, "How long will it take to return to Celestial City?"</br>
</br>
"The first batch of specimens were loaded onto the rocket last week and will arrive at the latest the day after tomorrow... shall we notify our allies?" Kelvin responded.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen contemplated for a while, he said, "Once the specimens have arrived, let's keep this information confidential for the time being. I will select some scientists from Future Biology to form a Corruptor research project group, and then discuss whether to disclose the information to our allies."</br>
</br>
Kelvin nodded. "Okay, then I'll make the necessary adjustments."</br>
</br>
The express train quickly arrived at its destination.</br>
</br>
After the train made a full stop, the two went to Project 071 Department at the Space Command Center together.</br>
</br>
It was a coincidence that just before the two men stepped through the command room, Kelvin's assistant passed a document into his hand.</br>
</br>
Kelvin glanced over the file and started to frown.</br>
</br>
A moment later, Kelvin put away the file, looked at Jiang Chen, and smiled wearily, "One bad news, one good news, which one do you want to hear first?"</br>
</br>
"...let's start with the bad news."</br>
</br>
"The bad news is that our colony on Mars was under siege by bugs," Kelvin replied.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched intensively when he heard this.</br>
</br>
"... what about the good news?"</br>
</br>
There was a smile on Kelvin's face, "The good news is that we have prepared the wall in advance. With the support of TS Expedition, our army blocked the bug's assault."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slowly let out a long breath of air, looked at the holographic screen directly in front of the command room.</br>
</br>
On the satellite image sent from the TS Expedition, the sand outside the colony was stained an unhealthy dark green by the blood and saliva of Corruptors. Broken limbs were scattered everywhere. However, the situation of the soldiers on the wall was not optimistic either as many people's equipment was damaged by the corrosive acid.</br>
</br>
</br>
The bugs already managed to scale the wall and collide with Celestial Marines. Fortunately, the Corruptor's close combat capabilities were nowhere near that of the Devil Worms. While the battle was dangerous, Celestial Trade managed to win because of their defensive fortifications and the support of the TS Expedition.</br>
</br>
After examining the casualty assessment on the screen, Jiang Chen was silent for a while before he suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Don't you find it strange?"</br>
</br>
Kelvin hesitated for a moment, then followed up.</br>
</br>
"You mean..."</br>
</br>
"Every time we make progress at Mine 071, the troubles just seem to be after us," Jiang Chen said while he looked at Kelvin. "It's as if we have a pair of eyes watching us,"</br>
</br>
"Watching us?" Kelvin gave a slight nod, and then laughed, "Do you mean, the trouble we encountered is because of someone?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't answer. Instead, he folded his arms in front of his chest, stared into the holographic screen, and no longer spoke.</br>
</br>
He suddenly realized a possibility ...</br>
</br>
But he was not sure yet.</br>
</br>
He could only verify his guess the next time he returned to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Outside the Mars colony, the billowing dust rolled up almost a thousand meters above the ground and formed a sand wall that covered the sky outside the colony.</br>
</br>
Just five minutes ago, dozens of mass bombs dropped from the sky and flattened the dune outside the colony. It created a crater of several meters wide in the desert. Three high-explosive missiles blasted inside the tunnel five kilometers underground and successfully curtailed the attack of the Corruptors.</br>
</br>
Taking advantage of this momentary gap, the Celestial Marines fighting on the wall successfully repelled the Corruptors that already scaled onto the wall.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai stood behind cover and looked at the swarms that were starting to retreat. He breathed a sigh of relief and lowered his rifle.</br>
</br>
The soldiers withdrew from the wall, medics walked around the battle scene, and researchers in protective suits were escorted by the rover to recover specimens. If casualties and wasted ammunition were not considered, in a sense, this attack was a harvest for Celestial Trade. For at least a year, they would no longer struggle to fulfill the items on the sampling list from the command center.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai reported the team's casualties to his superior, and then followed the others in the direction of the colony.</br>
</br>
After he returned inside, he passed through the buffer cabin and tucked his equipment into a storage cabinet. He took a can of coffee from the vending machine, walked to a bench in the central square, and sat down. Lunchtime had passed, but he didn't feel the slightest hunger.</br>
</br>
He took a sip of the hot coffee. Then he leaned back against the bench with his eyes closed in an attempt to relax his tense nerves.</br>
</br>
At this moment, someone came to him and sat down.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai raised one eyelid and saw that the man sitting next to him was Wang Qiang, so he closed his eyes again.</br>
</br>
"It's over?" Wang Qiang opened the canned drink in his hand as he asked casually.</br>
</br>
"It's over for now," Zhang Hai self-mockingly said and then glanced at Wang Qiang sitting next to him. "Who knows when the next wave will be, and who knows when this will be over... right, how are things going on your side? "</br>
</br>
"You also saw that the base of operation near Mine 071 has been lost. What progress can be made?" Wang Qiang had a bitter smile and shook his head, "Let's not talk about this. By the way... Koenig. How is he now? "</br>
</br>
"His wound was severely infected, and his entire right arm is gone ... probably only Coro City Hospital can cure his injury, but you know, we can't go anywhere now. We will arrange him to rest in the hibernation chamber until when flights become available next year."</br>
</br>
At this moment, a soldier came over and stood in front of Zhang Hai, then saluted.</br>
</br>
"Are you Captain Zhang Hai?"</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" He looked at the soldier standing in front of him and put his canned coffee on the bench.</br>
</br>
"The ship captain is looking for you. Please go to the institute as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
After Zhang Hai took a second to process this information, he noticed that he had forgotten to take out his wrist-mounted computer from the locker. The ship captain probably could not reach him, so he sent someone to look for him.</br>
</br>
"I'll be right there." Zhang Hai said to the soldier as he picked up his coffee from the bench.</br>
</br>
Squatting behind the potted plants in the square, Jenny held her breath nervously and did not dare to breathe loudly.</br>
</br>
She had no intention of eavesdropping but just happened to pass by here.</br>
</br>
However, after she saw the two sit on the bench, somehow, she made the hotheaded decision to squat down and hid behind the potted plants, and she seemed to have heard some useful information.</br>
</br>
A soldier had walked over and stood beside the bench. He seemed to have said something to one of them.</br>
</br>
Then the two men sitting on the bench got up together and left the square.</br>
</br>
Jenny waited for a while before she nervously peeked her head out from behind the plant. Then she looked at the empty bench.</br>
</br>
She slowly slid down against the potted plants and with one hand on her pounding chest, she finally let out a long breath.</br>
</br>
Mine 071? The Base of Operation? Progress?</br>
</br>
Her experience in journalism not only made her nosy but also gave her intuition for news. For example, right now, her intuition was telling her that Mine 071 was definitely not just as an iron ore mine.</br>
</br>
Who would build a military base exclusively to protect a mine?</br>
</br>
I have to find a way to get the news back to Earth...</br>
</br>
I can't tell Brace, that coward will definitely stop me!</br>
</br>
She stood up from where she was hiding.</br>
</br>
She patted her jeans and looked around. When she found no one was around, she pretended that nothing had happened, and quickly walked back to her room.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The third week into Project 071's temporary suspension and the first weekend since the departure of SS Origin, the good news from the apocalypse made Jiang Chen stop doing the work that was on his hand.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin told him through the interdimensional communication device that X71291's body had been completed.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the news, he immediately took the space elevator back to the surface, took a helicopter, flew to Coconut Island, where he used as a material transfer station, and then hurried to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's Institute. In the lab.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen pushed open the door and entered the room, Lin Lin stood beside the operating table and poked at the tablet in her hand. On the operating table in front of her, there was a petite girl. When Jiang Chen looked over, the girl was watching him too.</br>
</br>
Although it was the first time Jiang Chen saw it in this form, from her eyes, he saw some familiar emotions. Although she certainly looked beautiful, for some odd reasons, a strange feeling lingered in his mind.</br>
</br>
"We have met again..." The girl lying on the operating table nodded as she watched Jiang Chen walk towards her, "Mr. Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
"X71291?"</br>
</br>
"From your tone, I can sense your surprise." X71291 said without much fluctuations in her tone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pulled Lin Lin aside, leaned closer to her ear, and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Why did you make it... like this?"</br>
</br>
"How else would I make it? Do you want me to make one... one of that?" Lin Lin took a step back and flushed as she gave Jiang Chen a vicious stare.</br>
</br>
Maybe it was because the topic was too embarrassing, or maybe it was the hot air blowing in her ear, Lin Lin felt her cheeks burn.</br>
</br>
"I'm not talking about gender." Jiang Chen showed a helpless smile.</br>
</br>
It was not about gender. After all, when Jiang Chen originally saw X71291, it appeared as a virtual character "Tao Tingting" in front of him. It just that this petite appearance felt strange to him.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, the program is genderless." The girl's mouth formed a stiff arc and then said in an incongruous tone, "I don't need that troublesome thing at all, just give me a body that can integrate into human society."</br>
</br>
Looking at the quiet Jiang Chen, the girl tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"Any questions?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and stared blankly at X71291 for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I'm just curious ... Didn't Lin Lin install an emoticon system for you?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, that. I turned it off to save power." The girl said expressionlessly and then looked at Lin Lin who had been tinkering with the tablet. "Did you figure it out yet? If you don't know something, you can ask me. "</br>
</br>
"It's almost done." Lin Lin looked at the tablet in her hand reluctantly, and her fingers quickly tapped on the screen.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin with questions in his eyes</br>
</br>
"She used my lab to add some parts to herself," Lin Lin's cheeks turned a little red and her eyes drifted to the side as she embarrassedly scratched her head. Then she muttered quietly, "but I can't find where..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Parts?" Jiang Chen repeated in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Oh, you're looking for that," the girl sighed. "You could have just told me."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked to the side without talking.</br>
</br>
Obviously, she felt quite frustrated and disappointed that she lost to X71291 in her field of expertise.</br>
</br>
"According to the original agreement, I will be responsible for protecting your safety. In order to be able to cope with various dangers, I have installed some convenient weapons on this body. This is very troublesome to explain. It is better to find a place where I can directly show you."</br>
</br>
Indeed.</br>
</br>
If it is a weapon, there is no more intuitive explanation than "showing them".</br>
</br>
Following Lin Lin, Jiang Chen and X71291 came to the ground floor; a shooting range around hundreds of square meters. This range was previously used to test the power of electromagnetic pulse cannons, the damage of Gauss rifles, and the anti-strike capability of some hadron materials.</br>
</br>
"In the laboratory's sample library, there are Death Claws, Mud Crabs, and the most common zombies. Basically, you can find any mutant species that are around Wanghai City... Where do you want to start?" Lin Lin asked the expressionless girl.</br>
</br>
"Let's start with the Death Claw."</br>
</br>
"You sure?"</br>
</br>
"Yeah." Without another word to Lin Lin, the girl opened the security door and stepped into the isolation room.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin tried to say something, but nothing came out. Instead, she just pressed on the touchpad a few times.</br>
</br>
The floor of the isolation room formed a square opening around a few square meters in size. Soon, an iron cage with a Death Claw slowly rose and stopped in the center of the isolation room.</br>
</br>
Stimulated by the light inside the isolation room, the sleeping Death Claw slowly awoke from its sleep and rushed to the side of the cage.</br>
</br>
Its sharp fangs exuded disgusting saliva and its blade-like claws clasped tightly onto the steel bars of the iron cage. Its amber eyeballs rolled quickly under its dry eyelids and finally locked onto X71291. With a roar, the steel bar, which was as thick as a thumb, began to creak under the intensive force.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, was a dangerous mutant nearly three meters tall, and on the other hand, was a girl who looked like a fragile porcelain doll. The vibe between the two sides formed a strong contrast.</br>
</br>
"No need for weapons?" Jiang Chen asked the one question he was most concerned about as he stared at the petite figure.</br>
</br>
Even if the body was damaged, it would not have any effect on X71291 in the quantum computer group, but he still clenched his fist for her in the room.</br>
</br>
"No," the girl just said indifferently and then turned to Lin Lin, "open the cage."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin spat out her tongue and pressed on the touchpad.</br>
</br>
With a "click", the lock fixed on the cage steel bar popped open, and the steel bar door directly in front of the Death Claw fell heavily on the ground.</br>
</br>
At almost the same time, the Death Claw rushed out of the cage and roared towards the "prey" in front of it.</br>
</br>
Its amber-colored pupils were filled with the thirst for blood.</br>
</br>
The human that dares to imprison me will be shredded!</br>
</br>
Against a charging Death Claw, the girl stood there motionlessly. Just when Jiang Chen thought that perhaps she was too frightened, he noticed that a pool of silver water was spreading outward from X71291's foot.</br>
</br>
Scared?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen revealed a complex expression.</br>
</br>
In the blink of an eye, the Death Claw was already in front of her.</br>
</br>
Seeing that its claw was going to slash open the girl's chest, a silver wall suddenly popped up from the ground and blocked the girl from the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
Ding!</br>
</br>
Sparks flickered, and there was the crisp sound of colliding metal.</br>
</br>
The hurt Death Claw jumped back two steps in pain, widened its amber eyes, and stared at the silver wall in its front.</br>
</br>
The flat and smooth silver casing was like a solid mirror. It protected the girl like a shield.</br>
</br>
Its foot rubbed on the ground as it stared at the prey in front. The Death Claw grinned menacingly and moved a few steps to the side. It looked at its prey without any movement before its legs exerted with full force and with a loud roar, it hurled at her again.</br>
</br>
With a mocking grin, the girl raised her right hand. The silver wall re-transformed into a pool of silver water and centered on where she stood. Then, it converged along the floor in the direction of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
"ROARRRR!"</br>
</br>
The roar of the Death Claw made all the glass inside the isolation room tremble.</br>
</br>
With a Death Claw leaping towards her, the girl just smiled.</br>
</br>
As if she was patting away dust from her sleeves, she waved her hand in the Death Claw's direction.</br>
</br>
Countless thick spikes burst out from the ground and blocked all possible escape routes of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
Too late to stop, the Death Claw was like a fly that threw itself into the net and slammed in unpreparedly. It was stabbed by countless spikes and its charging posture was fixated in midair.</br>
</br>
The claw stopped two inches in front of her.</br>
</br>
The girl turned and looked at the stunned Lin Lin and Jiang Chen behind the tempered glass. She had a slight grin on her face.</br>
</br>
From the astonished look of the two, she felt unprecedented joy ...</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1282: X71291“s New Name</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The silver spikes that penetrated the Death Claw melted into silver liquid again and spilled to the ground. The mercury-like liquid slowly moved forward, gathered towards the girl's foot, and rolled back into her body through her pants.</br>
</br>
Losing its support, the penetrated Death Claw smashed onto the ground. Its blood gushed out from the countless wounds and left a giant pool of blood in the isolation room.</br>
</br>
The girl passed through the security door and left the isolation room. She looked at Jiang Chen and then clapped.</br>
</br>
"What did you think? A digitalized human body is actually very convenient. Even if you unlock the genetic code to the third level, it's impossible for you to possess such power. Do you not want to try it? You can become an immortal being."</br>
</br>
"No, even without a digitalized human body, I have a way of becoming immortal."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt it was physically unacceptable to replace parts of his body with metal.</br>
</br>
"Really? Then it's up to you." The girl shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, that liquid metal was..." Jiang Chen looked at her pants and wondered where the previous silver liquid had disappeared to.</br>
</br>
Inside her clothes? Not likely.</br>
</br>
With her petite appearance, there was not anywhere she could hide things.</br>
</br>
When the young girl heard Jiang Chen's question, she concisely replied, "It's called liquid metal. This type of metal is easily affected by magnetic fields and currents. With the computing power of a quantum computer, I can calculate the relationship between the shape and magnetic field environment in real-time, and their deformation is controlled by the current."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly remembered the former Pan-Asia Cooperation intelligence personnel he encountered when he was at Line 0. The weapon he used seemed to be a metal that could change its shape freely, but his ability was only to condense the silver liquid metal into a projectile such as a knife or a needle. It didn't seem to possess the ability to become a shield and weapon so freely like X71291's.</br>
</br>
Only with contrast could he spot the gap.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gained a further understanding of the power of the girl in front of him...</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, did you think of a name for yourself?"</br>
</br>
"Name? X71291? Does that not work?" The girl revealed a slight frown.</br>
</br>
"That doesn't seem like a normal name..." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"That's troublesome," the girl sighed, and said impatiently, "I'll leave it to you."</br>
</br>
"Leave it to me?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, aren't names used by others?" The girl said with reasonableness. "If that's the case, just give me a name that's easy to say."</br>
</br>
Anything is fine?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen showed a peculiar expression.</br>
</br>
His ability to name things was something people criticized. It was bad to the point where Kelvin only mentions the naming process to Jiang Chen and no longer asked for his opinion in naming starships.</br>
</br>
</br>
Or just Tingting?</br>
</br>
But then Tingting is the one in Lin Lin's body...</br>
</br>
Forget it, just a random name is fine.</br>
</br>
He thought for a moment. Then, as he was about to speak up, Lin Lin spoke before him.</br>
</br>
"How about Lilith."</br>
</br>
"Lilith?" A flash of data stream flashed through X71291's pupils, and she nodded, "Is it based on the manga character? The settings are indeed similar... そうですね (so de si ne), this name will do."</br>
</br>
"Hmmm?" Lin Lin suddenly blushed when she heard what Lilith said. Then, she asked somewhat embarrassed, "Have you read that comic?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin and was confused, "What are you talking about? What manga?"</br>
</br>
She is probably referring to "The Galaxy Era," a comic published in 2159. The heroine in the comic was a digitalized girl who could use liquid metal and her name was Lilith." Lilith shrugged, "I have a back-up of this information in my database."</br>
</br>
That's the story behind this?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin who was full of excitement and made a helpless expression.</br>
</br>
He used to try the mangas Lin Lin recommended, but he could not get into them. The aesthetic differences between different eras caused him to be unable to appreciate the works of art in this world. At this point, Sun Jiao and Xiaorou also realized this point. Only Yao Yao, who was also from before the war, could enjoy the same kind of art as Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Then is there a backup in your database of the plot after Volume 31?" Lin Lin didn't care about the look on Jiang Chen's face. Lin Lin immediately excitedly asked, "I have been looking for the volumes after 2170."</br>
</br>
Before the war broke out, she was brought into Fallout Shelter 005 by her father to assist him in his research on advanced artificial intelligence. Until now, she was still bothered by the fact that she did not get to see the plot after Volume 31.</br>
</br>
Lilith's words undoubtedly gave her hope.</br>
</br>
If the manga was backed up in the database...</br>
</br>
"The last volume was published in September 2171, and it was halted indefinitely due to the war. So far it has not resumed serialization." Unfortunately, Lilith soon gave the ruthless facts to Lin Lin, " For Volume 32, I can find it in my database, but the stories that follow are probably gone."</br>
</br>
"I see... no wonder I can't find it."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was disappointed.</br>
</br>
She clearly tried hard to search for the manga.</br>
</br>
"Actually, you don't have to be disappointed. For my quantum computer group, drawing an ending with graphics processing technology will not even take a minute. If you need it, I can draw the rest of that manga now, "Lilith said without a change of expression.</br>
</br>
"No." Lin Lin shook her head, and sighed with regret, "A manga not completed by the original author has no meaning at all, even if you finish the ending for the original author, it can only be considered as fan content."</br>
</br>
Lilith tilted her head. "What's the difference?"</br>
</br>
"The difference is immense," Lin Lin retorted out of reflex.</br>
</br>
"…Okay, humans are really a troublesome creature." Lilith sighed and gave up continuing to persist on this issue.</br>
</br>
As an advanced artificial intelligence, she possessed emotions, but it was impossible to be exactly the same as human beings. After all, the two did not belong to the same "species" at all, and the differences between the two were not only reflected in the physiological level, but also in all aspects such as values, perception, and so on.</br>
</br>
And this difference was exactly what X71291 desperately wanted to understand.</br>
</br>
"By the way, I was just about to ask you, those liquid metals... Where are you hiding them?" Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Oh, that?"</br>
</br>
Lilith reached out to unbutton her jeans.</br>
</br>
Hey wait, why are you taking off your pants?</br>
</br>
"You, what are you doing!" Lin Lin hurriedly grabbed Lilith's hand and pulled her pants back up</br>
</br>
"Right, why are you suddenly taking off your pants?" Jiang Chen, who stood next to her, facepalmed again.</br>
</br>
Did she just lack common sense, or did she not treat herself as a person.</br>
</br>
Well, she is not a human.</br>
</br>
Lilith tilted her head and looked at Jiang Chen with confusion in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you ask me where I hide those liquid metals?"</br>
</br>
She pointed to her butt as if it was completely reasonable.</br>
</br>
"I was just going to show it to you."</br>
</br>
For some reason, after Lilith's explanation, Jiang Chen suddenly gained some sympathy for the Death Claw in the isolation room.</br>
</br>
Poor thing was killed by poop...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1283: Why didn“t you just ask me?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Back inside the mansion, Sun Jiao looked suspiciously at the poker-faced Lilith; her eyes wandered between Lin Lin and Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Being stared down by Sun Jiao made Jiang Chen somewhat uncomfortable, so he touched his nose to hide the awkwardness, then he asked with a guilty conscience, "What's wrong?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing," Sun Jiao shook her head, "I just wonder if I have to add another pair of chopsticks at home."</br>
</br>
"No, I don't need to eat. I just need to replace my battery regularly."</br>
</br>
As Lilith spoke, she grabbed her clothes and was about to show Sun Jiao the battery slot on her chest.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, who was standing next to her, immediately grabbed her hand and stopped her from exposing herself. Xiaorou also reached out, but she covered Jiang Chen's eyes instead.</br>
</br>
"It's time to eat ...Hmm? What are you all doing?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, in an apron, came into the living room. She saw Jiang Chen whose eyes were covered by Xiaorou, and at Lilith, with a poker face. She blinked in confusion, not really understanding what had happened.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I just wanted to show the location of the battery, but she stopped me," Lilith spoke to Yao Yao and said seriously.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Although Lilith said she didn't need to eat, the kind-hearted Yao Yao prepared a pair of chopsticks for her.</br>
</br>
Lilith took a bowl of rice from Yao Yao expressionlessly and went to sit next to Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen didn't know if it were an illusion but he could feel that even if she didn't show any expressions on her face, she was still very happy that she could sit at the dinner table with everyone.</br>
</br>
Even though he himself thought that speculating on the thought of ​​a program was a bit stupid anyway...</br>
</br>
At the dinner table, Lin Lin explained Lilith's identity to everyone.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao had heard about Lin Lin's recent work. When she heard that Lilith was number X71291, Sun Jiao's reaction was similar to that of Jiang Chen's, and all her emotions were written on her face.</br>
</br>
In some ways, the two were really similar.</br>
</br>
After lunch, Lilith accompanied Yao Yao and Xiaorou and took the plates to the kitchen. There, they washed the plates clean, and then returned to the living room. In the living room, they entangled themselves with Jiang Chen who was sitting on the sofa and reading a book.</br>
</br>
"When will you take me to the other world?" Lilith looked at Jiang Chen and asked.</br>
</br>
"After a few days. I have some things to deal with here... what happened? Are you in a hurry?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"I'm in a hurry." Lilith nodded expressionlessly. Then she blinked and a glimmer of eagerness appeared in her pupils for half a second. "In a hurry to get into a raid."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen froze slightly before he suddenly understood. One of the reasons Lilith wanted to go the modern world was that, it was fed up with watching as an outsider and wanted to participate in Godly Land as a player.</br>
</br>
</br>
But is it cheating to let advanced artificial intelligence play?</br>
</br>
As if she had guessed what Jiang Chen was thinking, she added expressionlessly, "Rest assured, I'll only participate in the game as a player, and I will not use any means outside the rules to change the server data. It's boring. "</br>
</br>
"I'm not worried about this," Jiang Chen shook his head and said with a smile, "It's just a little surprising."</br>
</br>
At this point in time, as the only large-scale immersive VR online games, it had actually only accounted for a small part of the Future Technology's virtual reality network. Especially now that Future Technology was developing a large-scale space-themed online game with the Milky Way as the background. Even if Lilith ruined Godly Land, it would only cost him a few hundreds of millions at most.</br>
</br>
"Surprising?" Lilith looked at Jiang Chen expressionlessly. "Well... this kind of thing doesn't matter. Since you are not worried about this, can you take me there?"</br>
</br>
"You've waited for so many years. Can you not wait another four or five days?" Jiang Chen gave her a side eye.</br>
</br>
"You can send me to that world first and then come back; it should be easy for you. Rest assured, I am very obedient." In order to strengthen her persuasion in this sentence, Lilith restarted the emoticon function, which was originally shut off to save power, and she made an "I'm super obedient" expression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was unmoved by this, but his mouth twitched.</br>
</br>
"You know this is impossible."</br>
</br>
In any case, he would not leave her alone in that world.</br>
</br>
Lilith let out a helpless sigh, she knew she had no chance to persuade him.</br>
</br>
"Well, then can you tell me what are you going to do in the next few days?"</br>
</br>
"I'm investigating some things related to Pan-Asia Cooperation's space projects," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly as glanced at Lilith. "You should have heard that Pan-Asia Cooperation had a research station on Mars. I want to know about that. The more detailed the information, the better. "</br>
</br>
"Oh, that," Lilith nodded with the same expresssionless state, looked at Jiang Chen, and said, "Why didn't you just ask me?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
NASA headquarters.</br>
</br>
A group of workers wore headphones and worked busily and nervously at the computer desk. Behind this group, in addition to Bolden and the Deputy Director of NASA, several FBA agents in grey suits could be seen pointing around.</br>
</br>
Intelligence experts appeared at NASA, a scene that was rare in the history of UA spaceflight.</br>
</br>
The reason why this happened was due to an incident that happened a few days ago.</br>
</br>
Just a few days ago, several UA astronauts, stranded in the Mars colony, made their routine video call to their families. It was done on a monthly basis and under the supervision of Celestial Trade staff.</br>
</br>
While the call was in progress, NASA staff members accompanying the astronaut's relatives unexpectedly discovered that the astronaut named Jenny seemed to be using this opportunity to send a call for help subtly.</br>
</br>
This phenomenon was discovered by Jenny's family and they notified the NASA staff. Consequently, this immediately caught the attention of the authorities.</br>
</br>
Jenny's colleagues retrieved the record of her video call with her family members, played it over ten times, and found some unusual spots. After Bolden reported the incident, the authority sent FBA intelligence experts to assist in the investigation.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, with the help of professionals, they immediately discovered where the problem was.</br>
</br>
"Pay attention to the frequency of her blinking, fast blinking means short sound, and slow blinking means long sound. This is Morse code. Compare frame by frame, pay attention to every action and every keyword. Don't let go of any details. "</br>
</br>
Soon, a code list of dots and dashes were transcribed.</br>
</br>
Glancing at the password table, the intelligence expert from the FBA immediately picked up a pencil and scribbled down the translation result on another piece of paper.</br>
</br>
"071, danger, new species," Holding onto the paper, the intelligence expert walked next to Bolden and the FBA director. "Several possible errors have been deleted. The keywords that she repeatedly emphasized were these three."</br>
</br>
"Danger and new species are well understood. It's likely Celestial Trade had disrupted another part of the ecosystem on Mars, but what does 071 mean?" The FBA director frowned slightly, then he said inexplicably.</br>
</br>
Bolden's brow scrunched slightly.</br>
</br>
He vaguely felt that number was familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had heard it.</br>
</br>
His eyes moved around the room. When his eyes fell on the face of a black colleague, his eyes suddenly lit up, and he immediately looked at the FBA director.</br>
</br>
"Mine 071... I remember it! Remember the James incident? The black employee who was killed by Devil Worms? I remember seeing in a report that he was exploring groundwater reserves at Mine 071."</br>
</br>
Because it was news in his field of work, and because he was a black man, the incident left a strong impression on Bolden.</br>
</br>
After the FBA director heard Bolden's words, he appeared stunned.</br>
</br>
"The Devil Worm... Mine 071... new species, she means that Celestial Trade was again attacked by Martian species while they were developing Mine 071? And this time it was a new species other than the Devil Worm?"</br>
</br>
"The same incident happened twice in the same place. Why are they so attached to Mine 071? Unless there is something there that is worth their attachment..."</br>
</br>
When Bolden raised his head, he looked at the FBA director, who was also looking at him, and they both saw the unusualness in each other's eyes.</br>

</br>
"... Jenny Karim, a former New York Times battlefield reporter. She won the Pulitzer Prize for a report on Iraq's chemical weapons. In 2018, she signed up for NASA's astronaut training program; originally trained for the moon landing mission. However, because the mission was postponed, she became part of the Ares."</br>
</br>
Ayesha read through the report as she sat in her office inside Future Building.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu, director of the Domestic Anti-Intelligence Office, stood in front of her and was reporting to her the findings on the recent investigation.</br>
</br>
"When she was a war correspondent in Iraq, she may have been trained by the CIB. According to the information collected by Bernice in the UA, there is evidence that the CIB, the FBA and other intelligence agencies have issued a special document to train field reporters and diplomats in anti-investigation training in response to a possible hostage crisis."</br>
</br>
"She is from the CIB?" Ayesha looked to Zhu Yu.</br>
</br>
"It's unlikely," Zhu Yu, shook her head, and then continued, "but we have reason to believe that the UA has received her message."</br>
</br>
The number 071 alone would not reveal any valuable information. However, what concerned Ayesha was that they could use the recent news to generate some bewildering thoughts.</br>
</br>
While Ayesha was silent, Zhu Yu added.</br>
</br>
"At present we have sent an inquiry letter to Celestial Trade and the Space Department. Based on Kelvin's reply, they immediately controlled the individuals involved in the incident… do we need to implement disciplinary measures for her observer?"</br>
</br>
There were no Ghost Agents on Mars. The UA astronauts were under the surveillance of Celestial Trade Army Intelligence Division, not professional intelligence personnel. He could know Morse code, but he could not relate Morse code with the frequency of blinking, and he could never have thought that the person he monitored passed sensitive information by blinking.</br>
</br>
Maybe the person didn't need to be Sherlock Holmes, but that person would have to be at least a Conan to notice the subtle details. Zhu Yu tried to put herself in the position and thought that even she could not do a better job in this scenario. Like the FBA, she also found problems in the countless replays.</br>
</br>
However, discipline existed for a reason. Personal accountability must exist, and there was no excuse for this.</br>
</br>
"The personnel involved from Celestial Trade will be handled in accordance with military regulations, and we will not intervene," Ayesha's slender finger gently tapped on the document, and she thought for a moment before she said, "In the future, terminate real-time communication services for stranded UA astronauts and change it to delayed transmission of video."</br>
</br>
"In addition, all videos, whether they enter or leave the colony, must be double-checked by Ghost Agents and the Celestial Trade Army Intelligence Division. No matter where the problem is found, the person involved will be immediately disqualified from contact with their family. It is better to be safe than sorry."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Roger," Zhu Yu stood straight and responded with certainty.</br>
</br>
"Last thing," Ayesha paused for a second before she ordered, "send a truth-telling serum to the Mars colony. I'm curious, where did she hear about number 071?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Apocalypse; in the mansion.</br>
</br>
Lilith, sitting on the sofa, complied with Jiang Chen's request and introduced him to the history of Pan-Asia Cooperation's colonization of Mars.</br>
</br>
"The Mars plan could be traced back to the middle of the 21st century. At that time, the three major forces, Soviet Union, NATO, and Pan-Asia had successfully delivered astronauts to the surface of Mars. However, the Pan-Asia Cooperation Mars Scientific Research Station was built in the early 22nd century. NATO took the lead in announcing the launch of the Mars colonization plan, and successfully sent a 500,000-ton class research ship to the Mars orbit. The Pan-Asia Parliament immediately issued the colonization plan to more than 20 scientific institutions, and the first Mars colony was finally built in 2110..."</br>
</br>
"Wait, I remember that the three major forces did not establish a Mars colony?" Jiang Chen frowned, interrupting Lilith's words.</br>
</br>
"Because of political reasons," Lilith shrugged. "All countries were condemning each other's colonial behavior, emphasizing that outer space resources must be shared by all human beings. Of course, they could not slap their own face. The official name of all colonies were XXX Scientific Research Station. According to the data in my database, by 2120, in less than ten years, Pan-Asia Cooperation built more than 20 'scientific research stations' with more than 1,000 personnel on Mars."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked by the number.</br>
</br>
As the president of Celestial Trade, no one knew the cost of Mars colony better than him. From the budget he received from the Mars colony, even with his financial power, he felt pain every time he received the report.</br>
</br>
With more than 20 colonies built and no profit achieved, Pan-Asia Cooperation was probably losing more than a space elevator every year.</br>
</br>
However, even if it was the case, Jiang Chen still understood their intention.</br>
</br>
To give an example, it was like Uber and Lyft competing for business. Everyone was burning money at the start, and burning money at an incredible rate, but it was for the purpose to gain market share. Perhaps Pan-Asia Cooperation officials also knew that every colony built was going to lose money, but no one could wait until the colonies turned profitable. If they decided to wait until Mars turned profitable, their own enterprises would have already lost at the starting point.</br>
</br>
Even just for a possibility, sending people their first to claim land was the best starting point!</br>
</br>
In contrast, Celestial Trade was extremely lucky as the company entered the Mars colonization era one century in advance. Without a single competitor, there was enough time and space to rationally develop the entire "market".</br>
</br>
"So, the major forces did not just built a research station on Mars? They built dozens of them? And each scientific research station is actually a colony in disguise?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Lilith nodded. "That's been the case since the early twenty-second century."</br>
</br>
"Why are there no news from all the colonies?" Lin Lin, who was sitting next to Jiang Chen, frowned. She muttered in confusion, "In my memory, there were no reports of colonies at all."</br>
</br>
"This is very easy to explain. You were born in the fifties, right?" Lilith asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Lin Lin nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then you should have heard of the economic crisis of 2150."</br>
</br>
Even Jiang Chen nodded this time.</br>
</br>
When he first arrived in the apocalypse, he learned about the economic crisis that was generally considered to be the cause of the World War in 2171. (Note: if you forget the plot, you can go back to Chapter 2)</br>
</br>
"In the recorded history in my database, as of 2149, the number of scientific research stations for Pan-Asia Cooperation had reached 41, and for the Soviet Union and NATO, the numbers were similar. When the economic crisis happened, countries were unable to sustain those bottomless pits. Therefore, the "Houston Convention" was signed in 2150. In addition to outlining zones on Mars, it also reduced its respective colonies... or scientific research stations to 15.</br>
</br>
"However, this doesn't explain why I haven't heard of those scientific research stations at all?" Lin Lin said and held the same frown on her face.</br>
</br>
"Of course it can explain it," Lilith looked at Jiang Chen, "because it involved another problem about the colonies. It was also related to the Gaia civilization you mentioned before."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"By 2150, the population of Pan-Asia Cooperation citizens on Mars had exceeded 500,000. Of these 500,000, almost 80% were native 'Martians'." Lilith focused on Jiang Chen as she continued, "And in the land claiming game on Mars, all countries have overlooked a problem, that is, the sense of identity of the Mars citizens to the 'sovereign state'."</br>
</br>
"A lot of young Martians have never been to Earth. They only heard about things on Earth from their grandparents and only learned about Earth through film and television."</br>
</br>
"Is there no internet?" Jiang Chen wondered.</br>
</br>
"The discovery of Klein particles happened a long time after, and the application for ultra-long-distance communication was after the war." As Lilith explained the context, she looked to Lin Lin, who had proudly raised her chest.</br>
</br>
It was Lin Lin's work that allowed communication through the Klein Particle Resonance Effect.</br>
</br>
After a moment's pause, Lilith continued in her undulating tone.</br>
</br>
"Before that, the means of communication between the colony and the Earth relied mainly on electromagnetic waves, with an average delay of up to five minutes and a maximum delay of even close to half an hour. It is equivalent to shouting into the phone here, and waiting for a long time before it can be heard on Mars. If there was any solar wind, the loss of communication was extremely common. So in order to ensure the effective transmission of information, the communication between Earth and Mars required the same message to be delivered three times."</br>
</br>
"The information lag directly led to the absence of information. Over time, the cultural differences caused by the lack of information exchange had become greater and greater, and this has laid the groundwork for future conflicts."</br>
</br>
"The 2150 Houston Convention was viewed as a wise decision by citizens of all nations, but was regarded as a shameful betrayal by most Martians. Riots of considerable scale broke out across the colonies, especially those colonies that were about to be put on the abolition list. Although countries introduced plans, it was clear that the highly autonomous colonies did not agree with them."</br>
</br>
"Almost a month after the signing of the Houston Convention, a total of 59 Pan-Asia, NATO, and Soviet colonies jointly signed the twenty second-century version of the Declaration of Independence, announced the establishment of the Mars Federation, and organized a coup. With the support of some officers, the insurgents successfully controlled all three space elevators on Mars and forced all the uncertain colonies to join the federation."</br>
</br>
"Don't they long for Earth?" Jiang Chen was intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Only people who haven't been to the Mars colonies will have such confusion," Lilith said with the same expressionless face, "According to the information in my database, the development of the Mars colonies was not too far behind the cities on Earth. And with the construction of the artificial biosphere, the landscape on Mars was not much worse compared to Earth. As for industrial capacity, I have no specific data to give you, but refer to the 'Development of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Steel Industry in 2145' published by the Pan-Asia Academy of Social Sciences. Based on the report, the steel output of the Pan-Asia Mars colonies accounted for 27% of the entire Pan-Asia steel output, and was in a serious surplus."</br>
</br>
</br>
"...after declaring independence, can the Mars colonies be self-sufficient?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, there was no way to be self-sufficient. On Mars, the helium-3 reserves were extremely low. Once the nuclear fusion battery imported from the Moon was interrupted, all Mars colonies were finished." After a pause, Lilith continued, "So, after Mars colonies declared independence, it immediately declared war on Earth and sent a fleet to 'liberate' the Moon."</br>
</br>
"Fleet?" Jiang Chen was dumbfounded. "Where did the fleet come from?"</br>
</br>
"Don't forget the three space elevators that the insurgents controlled at the start of the coup, as well as the starships in the space port," Lilith explained. "Because there was no need for warfare, no one prepared for a Mars Independence. Back then, the battleships were modified transport ships. The modification was simple and crude as they installed as many electromagnetic pulse cannons as possible on them."</br>
</br>
"You just asked why you didn't hear any news about Mars," Lilith looked at Lin Lin. "Because from that time on, the news from Mars were censored. As for the reason for the censorship, perhaps it was because of the unwillingness to admit the failure of the development strategy in the past decade on Mars, or perhaps it was also due to other political considerations. In any case, the Pan-Asia Cooperation did implement strict censorship on Mars after 2150. It would be understandable since twenty years before you were born, no news on Mars were broadcasted."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin opened her mouth in astonishment.</br>
</br>
And Jiang Chen continued to frown, still confused with the situation.</br>
</br>
"But what does this have to do with the Gaia civilization?"</br>
</br>
"This involves the highest-level secrets of the Pan-Asia Cooperation. Even I don't know," Lilith shrugged. "But using the limited intelligence I have for analysis, it is not difficult for us to draw conclusions that is close to the truth."</br>
</br>
Holding up one finger, Lilith went on to say, "First, the Pan-Asia Cooperation, the NATO, and the Soviet Union's censor must be based on the premise that the three-nation coalition was victorious against the Mars Federation rebels, in epic fashion."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and agreed with her statement.</br>
</br>
Not only in epic fashion, the Mars fleet perhaps did not even make it to the Moon before it was completely destroyed. Otherwise, it would be useless to censor the information when war was so close to Earth.</br>
</br>
"Second," Lilith raised her second finger. "Since the Earth forces suppressed the rebels in a short period of time, why would the news of the colony be censored for 20 years, and even remain censored after another world war?"</br>
</br>
"It can't be that they fought for 20 years?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Without the Moon's supply of nuclear fusion fuel, it was difficult for Mars Federation to last for even a year." Lilith shook her head. "There is only one possibility that the news was to be censored forever, and that is a major accident happened on Mars that could not be made public."</br>
</br>
"For example?" Jiang Chen frowned as he seemed to have caught onto something.</br>
</br>
"For example, everyone on Mars died," Lilith said blankly.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, who was sitting next to them, gasped.</br>
</br>
"Ruling out the possibility that these people died in the hands of the Earth forces, since the goal of each nation was to suppress the coup, recover the occupied colonies, and not to kill civilians." Lilith continued her logic, "We assume the independence war lasted for half a year."</br>
</br>
"During this half year, the Mars Federation insurgents discovered the relics of the Gaia civilization and saw hope in turning the tide of the battle again through the memory of the Gaia civilization. Immediately after they got the key, they began to excavate the ruins. Then finally, along the way, they turned on a nightmare switch, and ultimately killed everyone."</br>
</br>
"Devil Worms?" Jiang Chen was digesting the information as his eyebrows furrowed.</br>
</br>
"Accurately speaking, it should be species native to Mars. Based on this conjecture, countries began to study Mars species and the Gaia civilization as early as 2152. The latter did not see any progress, and it was likely because the relics were destroyed. As for the former, the progress was quite impressive. From what I know, the X1 bacteria previously used to remove radiation but ended up coming a deadly virus, had part of the DNA strand from the radiation-resistant bacteria found on Mars."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen attempted to puzzle everything together.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a thought came to his mind.</br>
</br>
[Did the Brahma bring all those live alien species to Gliese 581g?</br>
</br>
At least, some of the bugs.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
On Mars, a woman was escorted by several soldiers and locked into a cell.</br>
</br>
"What do you want?! Let go of me, you have no right to restrict my personal freedom!" Jenny hit the iron bars with her bare hands and angrily shouted at the Celestial soldiers outside the door, "You savages, I'm going to report you! And let the media all over the world know that I have been treated unfairly here."</br>
</br>
The soldiers stopped and turned around. The eyes that focused on her were without much emotion.</br>
</br>
Jenny felt eerie after being stared down and her tone became weaker.</br>
</br>
"I have the right to know why you're locking me up here. I have clearly complied with the laws and have not violated any rules. Why did you lock me here..."</br>
</br>
Until now, she still had hope that she did not get caught.</br>
</br>
She thought what she pulled off was flawless.</br>
</br>
And even if Celestial Trade gathered sufficient evidence, she still had excuses. Many people would blink more in a nervous situation. She never learned Morse code and did not intend for her nervous actions to be over-interpreted.</br>
</br>
However, the two soldiers just looked at each other and sneered.</br>
</br>
"There is no point in dishonesty. There are no lawyers or courts here." One of the soldiers stepped forward and said, "The arrest warrant was issued by Ghost Agents. When we investigated your correspondence, we found you leaked sensitive information using Morse code. "</br>
</br>
"I demand extradition, and there is an extradition treaty between Xin and the UA!" Jenny said nervously when she realized that her trick was easily exposed.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Really. I haven't heard that you can be extradited on charges of espionage? And this is Mars, not Xin." With a sneer, and the soldier said sarcastically, "Also, I can tell you that because of your thoughtless behavior, the return date for you and your friends will be postponed. Until we are sure that you have not overheard more sensitive information, you will stay here with us and enjoy this beautiful sandy planet."</br>
</br>
"You, you can't do this." Only now did Jenny finally realize how much trouble her behavior had caused her crewmates, "I..."</br>
</br>
However, the two soldiers did not want to listen to any more of her nonsense, and while she still wanted to say something more, the door of the room was closed shut.</br>
</br>
In the narrow corridor, darkness returned.</br>
</br>
In front of the cell, an officer of the Army Intelligence Division ticked the logbook and nodded to the two soldiers, signaling that they could go.</br>
</br>
Brace was at the other end of the corridor. He hesitated for a moment, but finally decided to step forward.</br>
</br>
When the astronaut approached him, the officer had a mocking smile.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to plea for your crewmate?"</br>
</br>
"Is there no other solution?" Brace glanced at where his colleague was being held, and then looked at the soldier. "Maybe this is just a misunderstanding. Jenny is a good person..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Misunderstanding? Good person?" The officer pushed up his hat and stared at Brace with a half-smile, "A good person would not be a spy."</br>
</br>
"Spy?" Brace frowned, he suddenly had a bad feeling.</br>
</br>
In fact, when Celestial soldiers came this morning to take her away, the feeling was already lingering in his mind. He kept telling Jenny not to probe into something she shouldn't know, but apparently, she didn't take his words to heart.</br>
</br>
When he heard the word spy, he immediately understood what was happening to that girl.</br>
</br>
It must be that she was sniffing around, and was caught by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
He thought of the conversation he had with his family on Earth and Brace's face suddenly turned pale. Then he cursed at Jenny with all the words he could think of.</br>
</br>
"... But do you know that your actions may hurt the relationship between the two countries?" While Brace scolded Jenny, after all, Jenny reported under him, he tried to plea, "I mean, before there are conclusive pieces of evidence—"</br>
</br>
"When our soldiers risked their lives to save you from the broken ship, they have taken the greatest care for the relationship between the two countries," The officer interrupted the former captain and said with a hint of a sneer, "But how do you repay our grace?"</br>
</br>
It wasn't just the astronaut who was detained. The intelligence department investigator who supervised her communications and the investigator who worked under him were all detained. With his soldier detained, of course, the Army Intelligence Officer did not treat him with the best attitude.</br>
</br>
"Sorry..." Brace said awkwardly, "I apologize for my colleague's reckless behavior."</br>
</br>
"We won't be angry at you," The officer said coldly, "but don't expect us to treat you with respect either. As you wish, I now offer you an alternative that takes care of the relationship of both countries. Either do everything as we say or pack up and go back to Ares."</br>
</br>
Brace froze.</br>
</br>
[Go back to Ares?]</br>
</br>
[That's like asking for death!]</br>
</br>
"If you want to go back, you can come to my office at any time, and I will drive you back in person." The officer stared at Brace and uttered out this sentence word by word. While Brace was still processing the information, the officer walked away without looking back.</br>
</br>
Outside the colony, the war against the swarms continued. The soldiers, shielding behind the cover on the wall, fired back with the Gauss rifle while dodging the spewing acids.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the assault on the colony was becoming a norm, and these bugs just didn't seem to die at all. And the most terrifying part was that the intelligence of those bugs was substantially higher than the Devil Worms. In just a week, their tactics evolved from simply trying to flood the colony to repeated attacks to consume Celestial Trade's ammunition.</br>
</br>
The production cost of a missile was close to 6 million Xin New Dollars. After accounting for transportation and launch cost, the total was close to the ten million figure. Although the cost should not be a factor considered by the military, the command center already proposed to the Captain of the Expedition more than once to use electromagnetic pulse cannons instead of missiles, if possible.</br>
</br>
Inside the office of the Space Department, Kelvin looked at the budget report with a headache.</br>
</br>
At this moment, there was a knock at the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in," Setting aside the budget report in his hand, Kelvin looked at the door and said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
After the staff received permission, he walked into the office.</br>
</br>
"Reporting."</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
"SS Origin successfully completed deceleration into the Mars Synchronous Orbit, requesting next commands."</br>
</br>
Kelvin, after hearing the news, looked at his watch.</br>
</br>
It's been a week...</br>
</br>
Kelvin looked at the staff and ordered with an affirmative voice.</br>
</br>
"Start weapon deployment immediately."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
It's time to end it all.</br>
</br>
Kelvin watched the staff member leave as he thought.</br>
</br>
He did not have the slightest doubt that the weapons, specifically tailored to the bugs, would shred those bugs into pieces...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In the apocalypse, a secluded factory on the northern outskirts of Wanghai was on heightened security under the control of NAC soldiers.</br>
</br>
The factory was only about 20 kilometers from the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Compared with its desolate appearance, the factory itself was full of life.</br>
</br>
Under the supervision of NAC soldiers, NAC engineers operated the mechanical cantilever and carefully placed the energy tank containing several kilograms of deuterium and helium-3 into the slot of a giant machine covering an area of ​​over one hundred square meters.</br>
</br>
A technician from the Guardian Sect stood with the NAC scientists at the moment. He was looking at everything in front of him with excitement.</br>
</br>
Over a year had passed.</br>
</br>
Today, their work finally made a breakthrough.</br>
</br>
As the energy tank was placed into the slot, the entire factory's activities were upped by another gear.</br>
</br>
"Energy output power is normal!"</br>
</br>
"Open the switch, start charging!"</br>
</br>
"Shield generator initiating!"</br>
</br>
"The power system output environment is stable, the temperature is normal, and the system is running steadily!"</br>
</br>
"The shield generator is activated! We are successful!"</br>
</br>
The sound of the stable operation of the machine was like heaven's melody.</br>
</br>
With a shout of excitement, loud cheers erupted in the factory.</br>
</br>
Engineers and researchers high-fived each other, and even the soldiers stationed on the side had a look of relief. Everyone was full of excitement and joy, and embraced each other to celebrate this long-awaited moment.</br>
</br>
Once this shield generating device was repaired, other devices could also be repaired.</br>
</br>
Soon, the news reached the heart of NAC – The Mansion at Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately ordered someone to prepare a vehicle as he planned to make a personal visit to the site.</br>
</br>
For NAC, repairing the Holy Shield was equivalent to protecting all of Wanghai from the nuclear winter. For Celestial Trade, the complete mastery of Holy Shield technology was equivalent to directly increasing the defense of the Earth Fleet and Celestial Trade Fleet to a new level! They made a leap from hard armor defense to energy shield!</br>
</br>
Not long after, escorted by armored vehicles and tanks, an extended car was parked at the gate to the factory.</br>
</br>
The door opened, and Jiang Chen, accompanied by a group of soldiers, walked to the main gate in quick steps. The project leader was already waiting there along with the scientists.</br>
</br>
From the back, Lilith also jumped out and followed behind him.</br>
</br>
As he walked towards the factory, the person in charge of the repair of the Holy Shield System explained to Jiang Chen in excitement.</br>
</br>
"... Repair work is mainly focused on shield generators. During the war, NATO Special Forces' attacks on the Holy Shield systems were mainly directed against shield generators. The technical difficulties we have faced were also around the generator! But now, since all the issues have been resolved, the remaining shield generating devices shouldn't be more troublesome than this one. Before this winter, we should be able to complete all the repairs! "</br>
</br>
</br>
With an approving nod, Jiang Chen followed him into the factory and stopped in front of the giant shield generator.</br>
</br>
"This thing has been repaired?" Jiang Chen looked at the shield generating device in stable operation and then looked back at the scientist behind him, "Why do I not see the shield?"</br>
</br>
Before he headed to Shangjing, Lin Lin gave him a miniature version of the Holy Shield system. From his memory, it was possible to see a pale yellow outline. The graviton could force all approaching mass to either stop or change direction, including air and dust particles.</br>
</br>
"The shield is mainly concentrated on top, and does not necessarily have to form a closed sphere. To describe it in more details, it's like an umbrella. In addition, a shield generating device on a city-scale forms a shield two kilometers above the city. Of course, we can lower it," The scientist explained.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"No, I trust you."</br>
</br>
It was simple to test the strength of the shield. He would just need to command AS Order to fire at this location. But after he thought about it a bit more, he decided against it. The Holy Shield System could defend against space-based weapons after all.</br>
</br>
This can be tested later.</br>
</br>
After he leaves here...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen inspected the work with the accompanying scientist, Lilith went to the shield generator and tapped the generator. A stream of data appeared through her pupils, and soon she retracted her finger and returned to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed her action and looked to her in curiosity.</br>
</br>
"What did you just do?"</br>
</br>
"Optimized the program and eliminated some backdoors. In approximate terms, just increased the performance of the hardware by five percent, and increased the difficulty of infiltration to the maximum… umm, count that as an update to the program," Lilith said with a blank expression.</br>
</br>
"You can do that?" Jiang Chen was genuinely surprised.</br>
</br>
The ability to update the system designed before the war was quite remarkable in a sense. Although it was just a software update, it was designed by the countless scientists of Pan-Asia Cooperation.</br>
</br>
"Is this difficult for the world's only advanced artificial intelligence?" Lilith asked earnestly.</br>
</br>
Although she was showing off, it was true.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know the number of advanced artificial intelligences at NATO and the Soviet Union. But there must be only one advanced artificial intelligence at PAC.</br>
</br>
"By the way, I've always been curious about how powerful your processing is," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"As long as I can identify the hardware, I can use it freely," Lilith shrugged. "For me, using electronics is probably as easy as eating and drinking to you."</br>
</br>
After all, she was a program.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, entrenched in his thoughts, he suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"What if I asked you to hack a country's nuclear weapon system?"</br>
</br>
"It depends on how well their security is," Lilith said in the same expressionless state, but she smiled. "If they fired nuclear weapons with Facebook or Twitter, I probably only need one second to explode the weapons."</br>
</br>
"True," he hesitated for a moment, then understood the humor in Lilith's words, and laughed. "But speaking of which, you know Facebook and Twitter?"</br>
</br>
Indeed, after all, nuclear weapons were not launched on Twitter and Facebook.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not aware of the launch procedure of the UA, but for Celestial Trade, from the moment he pressed the button to the launch of the missile deployed at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, there were at least three procedures, and physical isolation existed between each procedure.</br>
</br>
For example, in the last procedure, after confirming the order, two staff members at the launch pad must insert metal keys into the lock, and they must rotate the key to start the launching process at the same time, and then the third person must enter the launch code through the mechanical keyboard.</br>
</br>
No one would be foolish enough to believe the rumor of a hacker using cyber-attack to paralyze a country's nuclear weapons.</br>
</br>
"I can get a lot of information from that game, and I can even pinpoint exactly which player has spoken to whom and at what time." Lilith explained. She made it sound like it was something that could be easily done by everyone.</br>
</br>
Just a back door on the server allowed her to evolve up to this point. What if she touched Future Technology's server? Perhaps even the fabled Skynet project would not be able to achieve this...</br>

Mars synchronous orbit.</br>
</br>
With two blue streams closing in, a starship slowly moved closer to the fiery red planet.</br>
</br>
Inside the bridge, the staff sitting in front of the computer calmly reported.</br>
</br>
"The orbital parameters have been corrected. We are entering the synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
"All parameters are normal."</br>
</br>
"Initiate mission launch sequence. The drop compartment has successfully separated."</br>
</br>
"Separation successful, and the drop compartment is leaving the synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"The course has been revised. You can leave at any time."</br>
</br>
Looking at the fiery red planet outside the starship, the captain behind the bridge took a deep breath, picked up the wired intercom, and ordered affirmatively, "All units, the main engine is igniting, we're re-entering our course!"</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
After dropping the compartment suspended on the ship, SS Origin orbited for a quarter around Mars' orbit and only encountered TS Expedition stationed in synchronous orbit for a moment before it adjusted its course. Origin's next destination was the Asteroid belt between Jupiter and Saturn.</br>
</br>
With a dazzling white light stream pushing behind the starship, the dark ship pierced into the deep universe like a sharp sword and disappeared into the endless blackness.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Ten thousand meters below, fierce battles continued outside the colony.</br>
</br>
The swarm continued to attack Celestial Trade Marines on the wall, chipping away the colony's defense with their acid and corpses. The electromagnetic pulse cannon projectiles ravaged the battlefield, sent the yellow sand high up in the air before covering all the blood that spewed. Everything happened so quickly as if nothing had happened, then repeated again and again.</br>
</br>
As the two sides fought fiercely, a dark shadow surrounded by a ball flame dropped down from ten thousand meters. Like a meteor, it crashed into the chaotic battlefield.</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
The steel hull came in close contact with the ground.</br>
</br>
The rough, hard landing flattened a sand dune, and a thick yellow haze set off around the impact site.</br>
</br>
The bottom of the compartment was deeply embedded in the ground, crushing dozens of Corruptors who were besieging the colony into pieces.</br>
</br>
When the bugs stared blankly at the unexpected visitor, the front door of the cabin collapsed, revealing a giant drill bit hidden behind the cabin door.</br>
</br>
The bugs that lingered around the compartment seemed to have stop moving as they stared at the metal monster in the middle with confusion. Just as one of the Corruptors tried to spit acid, the metal monster inside started to move.</br>
</br>
The engine roared in the thin atmosphere.</br>
</br>
With the giant drill, a steel beast emerged from the compartment.</br>
</br>
The first difference between this rig and those in colony was its sheer size. This rig was more than double the size of the colony's tiny rigs. A thick layer of organic anti-corrosive material was coated to the thick titanium alloy armor. This material was extracted from the blood of Devil Worms and could render acid strong enough to erode rocks useless!</br>
</br>
</br>
The top and sides of the rig were also modified with small-caliber electromagnetic rapid-fire guns, which could accelerate ten-gram pellets to three times the speed of sound. The pellets could easily penetrate the armor of the Corruptors. In addition, there were two augers that resembled large screws on both sides of the heavy rubber tires, to ensure that the rig was unimpeded in any terrain.</br>
</br>
Without any exaggeration, it would be fair to say that the steel beast could easily enter and leave the swarm without any damage.</br>
</br>
"Drill Warrior", the name of the steel beast, was painted on both sides of the rig.</br>
</br>
The name perfectly explained its functionality. No matter above or below ground, no terrain could stop the steel beast from marching forward!</br>
</br>
"DAMN, this thing is giant..." A solider taking cover beside Zhang Hai watched the rig and exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"What did I just see? A heavily armed rig?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, Drill Warrior, that is a pretty bad*ss name."</br>
</br>
The compartment not only carried the steel beast, but also a hundred T-4H Aerospace Power Armors with corrosion-resistant coating. Unlike the T-4 Power Armor, the T-4H's minigun was replaced by a relatively slower, but more powerful electromagnetic rapid-fire gun. In the middle were two pairs of vortex engines and two bottles of oxygen tanks were added to increase the oxygen holding for 24-hour consumption.</br>
</br>
Soon, the gates on the west of the colony slowly opened, and a group of armored vehicles, in an attack formation, rushed toward the compartment abandoned in the swarm.</br>
</br>
Strikes from TS Expedition began to hit on the ground, disrupting the Corruptors that was surrounding the fleet.</br>
</br>
As the fleet rushed to the compartment, the door suddenly opened, and soldiers inside armored vehicles jumped off, and gathered together to form a defensive formation. They maintained open fire as they moved closer to the open compartment.</br>
</br>
Drill Warrior was already showing off its destructive power in its very first battle.</br>
</br>
The augers suspended on both sides of its tires dropped down, then the entire rig was lifted. The giant drill in front of the vehicle aimed down before it turned rapidly.</br>
</br>
Sand filled the air.</br>
</br>
The entire rig resembled a Devil Worm made of steel. In less than half a minute, the entire body already disappeared into the ground and headed towards the source of the Corruptors.</br>
</br>
The entire desert became restless, like limestones being tossed into a lake.</br>
</br>
The corrupters, hiding underground, was taken aback by the sudden emergence of the steel beast. Without the ability to dig, they could only spit the acid at the giant rig in vain, using their claws as powerful as steel in an attempt to stop the steel monster's destruction forward, but their fate was just shredded to pieces by the more powerful titanium drill.</br>
</br>
Their offense on the surface suddenly slowed down.</br>
</br>
Under the cover of the "Drill Warrior", the soldiers who stormed into the compartment were equipped with the new power armor. Having already simulated and operated the new power armor in the virtual reality training system countless times, they quickly adapted to this powerful new armor. One by one, they marched out of the compartment with the electromagnetic rapid-fire guns.</br>
</br>
"Here is the headquarters. Company A, your task is to follow Drill Warrior to Mine 071, and to recover the land and glory we once lost from those dirty bugs!"</br>
</br>
"ROGER!"</br>
</br>
Listening to the sound of electric current charging along his right arm, Zhang Hai's entire body was stimulated with energy.</br>
</br>
Streamlined casing, thick titanium alloy armor, blue light pulsing in the gun, and the blood and corpses of the Corruptors splashing on his body.</br>
</br>
The futuristic armor hit his G spot.</br>
</br>
With such a powerful equipment under his control, he had no doubt about the victory.</br>
</br>
The soldiers no longer needed to scramble to take cover against the splashing acid.</br>
</br>
Covered by the same material as the blood vessels of Devil Worms, the armor was coated in an organic layer. Even if they were covered with acid, the anti-corrosive nature would protect them in the battle.</br>
</br>
Armed to the teeth, the soldiers assembled behind the dunes on the west side of the colony, re-embarked on the armored vehicles, followed the track of the Drill Warrior wrecking havoc underground, and headed in the direction of Mine 071...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1289: Am I that kind of a pervert!?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the completion of the Holy Shield System, Jiang Chen asked Sun Jiao to make a copy of all the technical data, and then sent the information to Celestial Trade's server.</br>
</br>
After a short week of relaxation in the apocalypse, he took Lilith back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was his illusion.</br>
</br>
When he left, he felt the girls' envy when they looked at Lilith. In particular, Lin Lin, as a digitalized human, was whispering something like "so close".</br>
</br>
But indeed, it was so close.</br>
</br>
Based on what Lin Lin said earlier, at most in one year or two, the interdimensional transmission technology that her research institute was conquering should make a breakthrough.</br>
</br>
By that time, he would have more headaches.</br>
</br>
For example, how to introduce Sun Jiao to Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
Hopefully with Sun Jiao's careless personality, there would be no conflicts...</br>
</br>
Hopefully?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Modern world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took Lilith back to Coro Island from Coconut Island by boat. He stopped in front of his door and hesitated for a moment when they were at the front door.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
Lilith looked at Jiang Chen with the same expressionless state.</br>
</br>
"Try not to speak, I can do the speaking... Besides, don't mention things about that world."</br>
</br>
Although Ayesha and Xia Shiyu both knew, Natasha also lived here. Despite going through many things together, Jiang Chen still questioned if he can trust her without reservation. In order to avoid unnecessary suspicion and confusion, it was better not to talk about that world.</br>
</br>
"This is the seventh time you said this," Lilith sighed. "My head is much better than yours. Instead of worrying about me, you should worry about yourself. "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glared at Lilith and didn't add anything. He clicked on his watch and opened the gate to the mansion.</br>
</br>
Behind the main gate was a concrete path across the garden lawn.</br>
</br>
The road led to the garage and a small path led to the main entrance.</br>
</br>
As Lilith walked through the lawn, she reached out and poked expressionlessly at the ball-type drone floating over to identify her.</br>
</br>
The subtle grin perhaps seemed to be mocking the poor-design of the drone, or perhaps it was to show the pride of an advanced artificial intelligence in front of a basic artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
As soon as the two arrived at the door, the door opened.</br>
</br>
Ayesha rushed into Jiang Chen's arms. After she affectionately rubbed herself against his chest, her head appeared and curiously looked at the girl behind him. Xia Shiyu and Natasha closely follwed and also appeared at the door, casting the same strange look at Lilith.</br>
</br>
In fact, they noticed when Jiang Chen arrived at the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kissed Ayesha's cheek, gently patted her on the back and then placed her down. He then gave Xia Shiyu and Jiang Chen a kiss. Just as he was about to introduce Lilith, Xia Shiyu pulled him aside and quietly asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
"She is Sun Jiao?"</br>
</br>
A long time ago, Xia Shiyu heard Jiang Chen mention that woman.</br>
</br>
For the first woman in Jiang Chen's life, her feelings toward Sun Jiao was quite complicated.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, she was curious what she looked like, on the other hand those jealous feelings were inevitable. Although she already accepted the status quo of the four living together, it certainly did not mean she won't get jealous.</br>
</br>
"Uh, she's not..."</br>
</br>
"Who is she then?" Xia Shiyu also thought she did not seem to be Sun Jiao, she looked suspiciously at him and said, "She looks like... she is not even fourteen years old?"</br>
</br>
"Your little mistress?"</br>
</br>
Natasha sneered and poured oil into this already tense situation. Jiang Chen gave her a vicious stare in response.</br>
</br>
"Am I that kind of a pervert!?"</br>
</br>
After being stared down by Jiang Chen, Natasha just mischievously spat out her tongue and walked towards Lilith and Ayesha. After Xia Shiyu heard what Natasha had said, her suspiciousness only grew.</br>
</br>
"X71291, you can also call her Lilith. It's troublesome to explain, but it's definitely not what you're thinking..." Jiang Chen responded to Xia Shiyu's suspicious look and quickly explained, "Didn't I tell you about artificial intelligence last time? She is an advanced artificial intelligence, and probably the only one in the world."</br>
</br>
"She?" Xia Shiyu's eyes widened in surprise, and she looked at Lilith in disbelief. Her expression had zero faith written all over it as she could not accept the fact that the girl in front of her was a robot. "Wait, you mean, she is a robot."</br>
</br>
The latter was being sandwiched by Ayesha and Natasha, responding to the curious questions of the girls.</br>
</br>
Lilith seemed to sense Xia Shiyu's sight as she turned around and smiled at her with friendliness.</br>
</br>
"As you can see," Jiang Chen nodded with a helpless expression, "Also, it came from 'there'. She is here to help me"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu finally nodded.</br>
</br>
Although she had never been to the world Jiang Chen described, she knew that the world was an apocalyptic world with advanced technology. If she came from there, it wouldn't be surprising to see an advanced artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
It took about ten minutes for Jiang Chen to formally introduce Lilith. The girls seemed to feel indifferent about a new girl joining the mansion. Ayesha would not get jealous, Natasha and Xia Shiyu didn't think Jiang Chen would be a "pervert".</br>
</br>
At most, they would have to watch out where their "battles" took place...</br>
</br>
Even if Lilith explicitly told Jiang Chen that she had no interest in watching humans mate. They could choose to ignore her presence completely, like how they would ignore a table or a sofa.</br>
</br>
However, after all, with a human face, Jiang Chen could not bring himself to do such things in front of a fourteen-year-old loli.</br>
</br>
After a short vacation, Jiang Chen returned to work.</br>
</br>
With Lilith's help, his efficiency increased significantly.</br>
</br>
Many times, he just explained his thoughts to her in simple terms, and she perfectly executed his order to the correct departments, even to the right individual. She also showed the progress of projects and create real-time charts for him.</br>
</br>
Previous, these works were done by Xia Shiyu and Jean.</br>
</br>
Since Lilith took over the work of the "Secretary of the Chairman", Jean, the intermediate artificial intelligence, was given to Xia Shiyu. As the CEO of Future Group, it was her time to receive an assistant.</br>
</br>
Of course, these were not the main points.</br>
</br>
In addition to improving Jiang Chen's own efficiency, Lilith's biggest contribution was her expertise.</br>
</br>
As an advanced artificial intelligence, her existence was comparable to a division of programmers.</br>
</br>
After her upgrade, the performance of Future Group's Supercomputing Center servers increased by a notch.</br>
</br>
The supercomputing center mainly provided information processing services for the global business of Future Group and Celestial Trade. The center was extremely significant to both enterprises.</br>
</br>
In addition, the fleet command system originally maintained by Future Technology was also transferred to her.</br>
</br>
She only squeezed out a small part of her time from playing games, and her efficiency was enough to shame the entire team that was responsible for the project.</br>
</br>
And only until this moment, did Jiang Chen finally realize he had struck gold.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1290: Space-themed MMORPG</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the third day back in the modern world, the colony sent back good news which eased Jiang Chen's tense state.</br>
</br>
The report sent by the Colony Governor, Captain Hong Zewei, stated that the Celestial Marines successfully recovered the operation base near Mine 071 with the help of new weapons. The "Drill Warrior" designed by Future Military and Future Heavy Industrie played an incredible role in combating the Mars species.</br>
</br>
Those T-4H power armors also substantially increased the survival rate of the Marines.</br>
</br>
With Drill Warrior clearing the way, and heavily armored infantries following closely behind, Company A, responsible for attacking Mine 071, destroyed six nests within 24 hours. Five of these nests were Corruptor nests, and the one located outside the radius of the ultrasonic fence belonged to Devil Worms. A total of tens of thousands of adult Corruptors and thousands of Devil Worms were killed. The Celestial Marines successfully pushed from the surface to 21 kilometers underground.</br>
</br>
According to the report from Hong Zewei, they were very close to the bottom of the ruins.</br>
</br>
When the engineering team complete the reinforcement of the tunnel, it was time for the relics of the Gaia civilization to shine once again.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the mansion at the northern tip of Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen,   who was passing by the living room,   asked Lilith,  who was resting against a reclining chair with a phantom helmet on,  "As an advanced artificial intelligence, do you also enjoy playing games?"</br>
</br>
Because she was not human,  even if she wore a phantom helmet,  Lilith could still sense outside information. In her words, she could run the game with one memory zone and control her body with the other memory zone; she was capable of being both in the virtual world and the actual world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen must admit that he was envious.</br>
</br>
"You don't understand,  " Lilith answered in her emotionless state,  "It's not the game that is fun, but the players who participate in the game."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
That's the fun part?</br>
</br>
He was curious why players were interesting for Lilith.</br>
</br>
However,    it may not sound too great. In her eyes,   the players were probably no different than white rats in the laboratory. After all,  in her perspective, a troublesome creature like humans could only offer values by contributing to experimental data.</br>
</br>
Very contradictory thoughts.</br>
</br>
On the one hand,  she possessed the desire to have a body that can integrate into human society,  and on the other hand, she maintained the stubbornness of an advanced artificial intelligence. Perhaps this contradiction was part of the attributes of an advanced artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
"Don't just play. Since you have so much free time,  come and help me do something," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Correct what you just said,  " Lilith said blankly,  "I have helped you process 117.8 gigabyte of files in the past 72 hours, which is equivalent to your normal workload for a month. From any perspective of analysis, my attitude is enough to be considered diligent. In contrast, you seem to be freer because you just move your tongue."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Uh, that much?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen awkwardly touched his nose after being scoffed by Lilith.</br>
</br>
"I haven't counted the workload of helping you upgrade the server," Lilith said with clear evidence to back up her words, "To prevent you from forgetting, I have to remind you. This is your war, not my war."</br>
</br>
"...you are right."</br>
</br>
Lilith sat up and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"So, tell me, what do you need me to do?"</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen looked at her, somewhat confused.</br>
</br>
"I didn't say I won't help you," Lilith shrugged, and said solemnly, "I just corrected your allegations.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Well, when the program learns to think, it is indeed troublesome.</br>
</br>
He sorted out the words in his head, coughed, and then said.</br>
</br>
"Future Technology is currently planning a large-scale space-themed VR MMORPG. The main selling points are probably space colonization, starships, trade, mining, technology tree. At present, the development is close to half-complete. The latest update is that the game completed the import of the astronomical data from the Celestial Trade Space Department. So, are you interested in developing games? "</br>
</br>
Designing a large-scale VR MMORPG with a space theme was discussed and implemented as early as last year.</br>
</br>
In addition to the consideration of the current trend, the VR MMORPG also served a political purpose.</br>
</br>
For example, to promote the current space colonization of Celestial Trade, to ignite pupils' enthusiasm for the space industry, and to improve the tactical theory of starship battles in a virtual environment. These political goals would not be explicated stated, but it would be integrated into the game in subtle ways.</br>
</br>
Of course, for artificial intelligence, designing a game that people love from the beginning may be a little difficult. However, with the game plan already completed, she could easily finish the programming elements.</br>
</br>
"Interest, no. But based on your description, this should be easy for me," Lilith, still with the helmet on, said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Then please and thank you," Jiang Chen said immediately. "How long will this take?"</br>
</br>
From his standpoint, he naturally hoped as early as possible.</br>
</br>
"Depends on the workload," Lilith said. "A week at most, but one or two days if I'm quick. If you can make your people give me as much detail about the game as possible, it can alleviate a lot of my workload."</br>
</br>
"You can rest assured. We have the best game design team in the world." Jiang Chen responded with a bright smile. "By the end of the day after tomorrow at the latest, my team will put together all the information and hand it over to Xia Shiyu."</br>
</br>
Lilith nodded.</br>
</br>
After he explained this, he had no reason to stay.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen glanced at the time on his watch, he thought that there were still a few things to deal with, so he stepped towards the entrance.</br>
</br>
Lilith saw Jiang Chen was about to leave, so she suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to leave?"</br>
</br>
"There are two meetings I have to attend to in the afternoon," Jiang Chen said, checking the time on his watch, "I have to go to the office in a bit. Do you want to stay here?"</br>
</br>
"I will go with you."</br>
</br>
Lilith jumped off from the chair, put on her slippers, and patted her slightly wrinkled dress.</br>
</br>
Since Lilith had no intention of taking off her helmet, Jiang Chen said as he facepalmed</br>
</br>
"Is it really okay for you to leave while wearing a helmet?"</br>
</br>
Lilith responded with another question.</br>
</br>
"Is there an issue?"</br>
</br>
Although it was full of issues from Jiang Chen's perspective, he decided against the idea.</br>
</br>
It was time to go.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1291: On the Shoulder of the Gian</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With a blonde loli following behind him, Jiang Chen walked into the lobby of Future Building and he seemed to realize that he was becoming the focal point.</br>
</br>
Although the eyes of his employees were usually focused on him with his arrival regardless.</br>
</br>
But today, he felt that in everyone's eyes, in addition to the usual respect, there were some strange emotions... or rather, the desire for gossip?</br>
</br>
After all, Jiang Chen's romantic affairs were not news in Xin or even the rest of the world. And the employees of Future Group were accustomed to the fact. It was just the fact the girl following behind him, seemed too young to be a mistress?</br>
</br>
Could it be...</br>
</br>
An illegitimate daughter?!!</br>
</br>
The passion for gossip ignited in the eyes of the two beauties at the front desk. They simultaneously exchanged eye contact and began to whisper.</br>
</br>
In less than half a minute,  the blond loli's story was created. She was a mistake from Jiang Chen's younger days and there was a plot twist even more interesting than a Korean drama. As for the flaw in their logic, they chose to selectively ignore the facts.</br>
</br>
For example, Jiang Chen was only in his twenties now...</br>
</br>
Fortunately, it was not the peak time in the lobby, and there were not a lot of people here.</br>
</br>
With the urge to facepalm, Jiang Chen brought Lilith into the elevator and he finally felt relieved from escaping those odd looks.</br>
</br>
He looked over to Lilith and her expression remained unchanged, as if those looks did not bother her at all.</br>
</br>
After they got into the elevator,  her eyes stayed on the scene outside the floor-to-ceiling window of the elevator, she gazed at the outline of Coro City in the distance.</br>
</br>
The elevator rose, and the view outside the window became more and more open.</br>
</br>
She suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"What a beautiful city."</br>
</br>
Slightly shocked by what she said, Jiang Chen looked at her.</br>
</br>
Lilith noticed his sight,  then sighed, as if she had already guessed his thought.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to think of me as a monster, I still have things like aesthetics."</br>
</br>
"I didn't mean that," Jiang Chen smiled. "I just feel a little surprised."</br>
</br>
Lilith did not respond, she just looked at the outline of Coro quietly.</br>
</br>
After a while, she didn't speak until the elevator stopped on the top floor.</br>
</br>
"I understand your surprise."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The first meeting was the reporting of all departments of Celestial Trade,  as well as budget. As in the past, everyone received only ten minutes to speak, and everyone removed the unnecessary formality in their speech based on Jiang Chen's request. They tried to be as concise as possible in the report.</br>
</br>
Different from Future Group,    in addition to the three major projects,   space elevator,  quantum communication satellites,  and global power grids that could report a stellar financial performance, all other projects were either losing money or barely breaking even.</br>
</br>
</br>
But money wasn't important.</br>
</br>
After all, Jiang Chen's positioning of Celestial Trade was not to generate profit, and he never used KPIs as a criterion for evaluating the work of departments. For most of the non-profit sectors of Celestial Trade, compared with a good-looking financial reports, he valued other achievements.</br>
</br>
The second meeting was a seminar on the development planning of the Mars colony. The attendees of the meeting were mainly executives of the Celestial Trade Space Department, especially those leading the Mars project.</br>
</br>
The reason why the meetings were arranged together was to make traveling easier for executives like Kelvin, who was stationed in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
At the meeting, the expansion plan and space elevator were discussed as key topics.</br>
</br>
However, after the meeting, Jiang Chen added a provisional item in front of these two topics to be discussed.</br>
</br>
That was...</br>
</br>
"... establish an Earth civilization monument and school in the colony? I'm not doubting whether this is necessary, but I think it's too early ..." After Kelvin listened to the president's speech, he was confused by Jiang Chen as to why he brought up this seemingly trivial matter to discuss.</br>
</br>
"It's not too early," When he looked around around at the Mars project executives present, Jiang Chen said in a serious tone, "To strengthen the cultural bond between the colony and mainstream society, we must lay the foundation from the beginning, otherwise, there may be hidden dangers buried."</br>
</br>
The executives of the Mars project all looked at each other in shock and confusion.</br>
</br>
No doubt, from their perspective, the president's words were undoubtedly alarmist.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not surprised by their reaction.</br>
</br>
After all, they didn't possess his ability to travel to another world, and they naturally would feel confused about the problems he brought up.</br>
</br>
The reason why Celestial Trade's development was compared to standing on the shoulders of a giant was not simply because the company possessed technology from the 22nd century. In addition to science, the mistakes made by that world's superpowers in their explorations were also great assets for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He didn't intend to explain anything. As the president of Celestial Trade, he had the highest decision-making power. Whenever he would issue an order, there was no need to vote at all. Others could only make suggestions.</br>
</br>
The proposal was passed directly, and the next step was to discuss how to implement it.</br>
</br>
According to Jiang Chen's proposal, the Mars Project Department would budget 2 billion Xin New Dollars to build an Earth civilization monument, elementary and high schools in the Mars colony. At the same time, in the next batch of colonists, forty teachers and 200 students of different age groups would also be brought on board.</br>
</br>
"Does it make sense to send teachers and students to the colony?" One of the executives asked, "and how can we convince parents to send their children to Mars?"</br>
</br>
"In order to prevent age gaps in the colony, we need a relatively smooth and stable population age distribution curve to stabilize the social structure of our colony. They don't need to do anything there, they just need to stay there to finish their studies, then decide whether to stay in the colony or return to Earth. "</br>
</br>
After highlighting this problem, Jiang Chen continued, "As for the latter problem, this is also very easy to solve. Going to high school in the colony can provide students with additional points during the college entrance examination. I believe there will be many families willing to send their children there."</br>
</br>
As long as Celestial Trade reimbursed the cost of the tickets, perhaps even the entire family would move to Mars.</br>
</br>
"In the next year, we will open flights to and from Mars and increase the population limit of the colony to 5,000. Compared with the current population size, this number indeed is several times larger. For the future development of the colony, I hope you will pay attention to the issues I have just emphasized. "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased as he saw all the executives' expressions begin to turn serious. Then he nodded.</br>
</br>
After a pause, he continued.</br>
</br>
"The next topic is the space elevator."</br>
</br>
"To turn Mars into our heavy industry base, a convenient means of transportation is essential. I believe that you have more intuitive data than I do, so I won't emphasize this again."</br>
</br>
"I just need one thing. With the flight to Mars taking off by next year. Before November, I hope you can put the Mars Space Elevator Program into action."</br>
</br>
"You must guarantee quality while also ensure efficiency!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1292: Galaxy Edge Trailers</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Time passed day by day, and it was already mid-May.</br>
</br>
Anticipated by the netizens around the world, the long-delayed epic sci-fi masterpiece, Galaxy Edge, suddenly revealed two trailers and a 30-minute live demo on the official website, which created widespread and heated discussions.</br>
</br>
In the first trailer, a huge fleet passed through the vast galaxy, marching toward the dark red nebula with unstoppable momentum, ready to destroy anything in its path. In the depths of the nebula, a group of weirdly shaped starships gradually appeared.</br>
</br>
No text or phrases.</br>
</br>
The collision between iron and blood between the two forces unfolded.</br>
</br>
Radon beams and kinetic weapons raged in the dim space; high-speed carrier-based starcrafts fought among the starships. The dance between light beams and electricity arcs, rendered with extreme details, ignited the passion hidden in the viewers. Everyone wished to be the captain of the starship at that moment, commanding the Fearless Class into the battlefield of destruction.</br>
</br>
The first trailer came to an end when the battlefield was illuminated by white clouds and the screen pulled further and further away.</br>
</br>
The BGM gradually slowed down after a sharp turn, symbolizing destruction, but also new life and hope.</br>
</br>
The second trailer was a land covered in magenta soil, filled with giant mushrooms.</br>
</br>
In this tropical rain forest composed of fungal plants, a group of soldiers, equipped with kinetic skeletons, followed by drones, marched forward. With large-caliber Gauss rifles in their hands, they carefully traversed through the rain forest.</br>
</br>
Behind them was a recently established colony, and in front of them were places that no one had set foot on.</br>
</br>
There may be endless opportunities buried there, or only death and barrenness.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a group of bird-like Mars creatures was startled in the forest as they dispersed into the sky. A roar came from a distance, and all the soldiers took a couple of steps back with uneasiness. Their rifles were raised, alerted for any danger in the deep mist of the forest.</br>
</br>
Then a growl approached.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a group of four-footed creatures charged out from the forest and clashed against the soldiers in the front. The soldiers in the back row immediately fired back against the alien species.</br>
</br>
As the size and number of the alien creatures gradually grew larger, vertical take-off and landing fighters, all-terrain attack vehicles ... and even space-based weapons deployed in orbit appeared one after another! The netizens were more and more pumped by the increasingly powerful weapons showcased.</br>
</br>
In the halo of the nuclear explosion, the film came to an end with the battlefield getting smaller and smaller.</br>
</br>
Until the end of the song, many people were still shocked by the magnificence of the battle.</br>
</br>
And the first thing they did after watching the video was not clicking the reply button, but instead, they rushed to the comment area and used their keyboard or holographic touch screen to share their excitement and shock.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Tell me, is this not a recruitment advertisement for Celestial Trade?"</br>
</br>
"This is insane! After creating a world, is Future Technology creating a universe?"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, we have to wait until the end of the month to play. I'm desperate to play this."</br>
</br>
"Have you seen that thirty-minute live demo? The combat system is unreal!"</br>
</br>
"I bought a limited-edition game cabin for this game. The helmet experience can't satisfy me anymore."</br>
</br>
"Oh my! Isn't the limited-edition game cabin worth 100,000 XND? That's a luxury car!"</br>
</br>
"An Internet company sold hundreds of thousands of luxury cars overnight, and the company is..."</br>
</br>
The game used the physics system developed by Lilith, and an independent experimental quantum computer for information processing to recreate the physics in real-time. While guaranteeing the entertainment and pace of the game, the design pushed the concept of realism to the extreme.</br>
</br>
In addition, unlike traditional online games, Galaxy Edge's upgrade system was mainly focused on unlocking technology trees, drawings, and modification of starships.</br>
</br>
Once a battleship was destroyed, it was permanently lost. It was for this reason that the death penalty in Galaxy Edge was extremely punishing.</br>
</br>
Of course, this did not mean that once the ship is destroyed, there was no compensation. The default setting was that all ships automatically purchased insurance.</br>
</br>
If a ship was lost because of a black hole, an insurance company compensated the owner for 50% of the loss. If the ship was destroyed due to war in the explored area, it compensated for 30% of the loss.</br>
</br>
In addition, the clone setting allowed all dead crew members to "resurrect" in the home port.</br>
</br>
At the same time, unlocked technology certificates and weapon drawings were not lost due to ship explosion. As long as there were sufficient funds, players could start from the mother star again in a short amount of time and set sail on their starship again.</br>
</br>
In addition to the starship being core to the game, Future Technology also designed many additional elements that are equally as entertaining.</br>
</br>
For example, high-end players could also set up mining companies, operate space stations, and even build their own space colonies to form a huge army with other players.</br>
</br>
However, considering the massive supplies required by the space colonies, generally only large companies had the ability to organize manpower to build facilities, while training soldiers to steal supplies and necessities from alien creatures, and also taking care of organizing transport fleets to and from the colonies and NPC-owned cities.</br>
</br>
In addition, for players not interested in exploring, they could also choose from a wide variety of professions, or focus on the development of characters. The players could even play the game as a First-Person Shooter or treat it as a Role-Playing Game.</br>
</br>
The players could become a part of a mercenary and participate in a certain force's operations against alien creatures and other colonies. Or they could become an adventurer into the unknown universe and pilot a fast and flexible single-person fighter to explore the mysteries of space or a planet that no one has ever set foot on.</br>
</br>
Galaxy Edge inherited the previous game design experience of Future Group with a focus on organic player ecosystem. Everything in the world existed in a dynamic setting, and evolved as players make choices in the game.</br>
</br>
This dynamic system matured in Godly Land, and after further upgrades from Lilith, the system improved further.</br>
</br>
After he had watched the two trailers and a 30-minute live demo, even Jiang Chen was itching to play.</br>
</br>
In addition to the live demo that made science fiction fans around the world eager to play, Future Technology finally announced the game was going online on May 31st.</br>
</br>
Based on the continuous success of Future Technology in large-scale VR online games, experts in the industry consensually gave very high ratings for the MMORPG yet-to-be-launched. Even IGN, known for its critics in the industry, gave a rare 9.9 score to "Galaxy Edge" before the game even launched.</br>
</br>
As for the reason ...</br>
</br>
"The animation and music are impeccable, and the gameplay is something never been tried before. These are reflected in the actual demo, and we'll not go into details."</br>
</br>
"Based on the past credibility of Future Technology, we have every reason to believe that the actual game experience will only be better than what is in the trailer. After watching the actual demo, we unanimously decided to give this game a high score of 9.9. If it turns out that our decision was wrong, I will eat both my helmet and keyboard."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"... an epic online adventure, Future Technology debuts another masterpiece, pushing the limits of games to the edge of the galaxy. No one can surpass this in ten years unless it is another piece created by Future Technology." Jiang Chen sifted through the news and comments on Galaxy Edge with a grin while he was sitting down on the sofa, he then looked at Lilith, "Your game is highly-rated."</br>
</br>
"Oh." Lilith, who was fighting in the fantasy world in her helmet, only gave a nonchalant response, and then continued to just lay there without a word.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you curious about what the netizens said?" Jiang Chen asked as he scrolled through the comments.</br>
</br>
At the start, Jiang Chen was still a little concerned as to whether Lilith could perfectly create the game design with code, but now, it seemed like his concern was excessive.</br>
</br>
In nearly a thousand alpha tests, not a single bug appeared. And for bugs that existed because of game design, they were quickly fixed with her help.</br>
</br>
In less than a week, Lilith not only completed the remaining development work but also upgraded the existing game development tools of Future Technology. Lilith's inhumane work efficiency was simply incredible.</br>
</br>
"I've seen them."</br>
</br>
Although her expression did not change, Jiang Chen could still feel that Lilith was in a good mood.</br>
</br>
As for why, he was not very clear.</br>
</br>
Probably just a feeling?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In addition to Lilith's work, Future Technology employees were also capable. The carefully tailored trailers perfectly illustrated the charm at the edge of the galaxy to all the netizens around the world.</br>
</br>
With 500,000 limited-edition game cabins worth $100,000 XND made available, they were instantly sold out by the next day. After all costs were removed, the sale generated a profit of more than $30 billion XND. Even when compared to the wealth Jiang Chen has already accumulated, the shocking profit still excited him.</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the product to be marketed as limited-edition, the idea of making another one million units to satisfy the shopping desire of old and new money around the world really tempted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"There are more than 500 million potential players worldwide, and it is estimated that the number of people who will log in to the game on the first day will exceed 300 million. Our promotion effort is very successful. As long as the quality of the game itself can reach 80% of the demo, this will become an inexhaustible gold mine. "</br>
</br>
Today was a rest day.</br>
</br>
As she leisurely sat under the shade of the umbrella on the balcony, Xia Shiyu reported her work while drinking her coffee.</br>
</br>
"The actual demo only showed the tip of the iceberg," Jiang Chen smiled. "Thirty minutes is not enough to fully show the true beauty of Galaxy Edge. In order to continue to hype up players' expectations, we just simply went over a lot of features. I believe that when the players enter the game, they will be amazed by the countless unexpected surprises."</br>
</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's lips also curved up after Jiang Chen finished explaining. She fixed the hair strands around her ear and jokingly said.</br>
</br>
"It's rare for you to be so invested in work."</br>
</br>
"I do work from time to time, okay?" Jiang Chen rolled his eyes and spread his hands helplessly. "It's just that my work is mainly concentrated on Celestial Trade. For Future Group, I have to count on you."</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, what's going on in the Mars colony?" After Xia Shiyu took aother sip of the rich coffee, she gently placed the coffee cup on the plate and asked.</br>
</br>
"Mine 071 has been recovered, and more than eleven nests have been destroyed. The swarm's attack is gradually collapsing under the tires of our new equipment. Engineers have begun to strengthen the support structure of the ruins. The current progress is going well, and it won't be long before we can make the ruins of Gaia civilization reappear," Jiang Chen responded.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Xia Shiyu's mood was also cheered up because of Jiang Chen's content mood, then she added, "What about SS Origin?"</br>
</br>
"SS Origin? I remember two days ago that it safely passed the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is now moving towards Jupiter at one-thousandth of the speed of light. Once it reaches Jupiter, Origin will try to use the slingshot effect to accelerate, and it theoretically can exceed the maximum speed threshold, but there are also risks involved with this decision. After all, no one knows whether the acceleration method applicable to small starships is applicable to large starships."</br>
</br>
"Jupiter? It feels very far away." Xia Shiyu gazed into the blue sky outside the umbrella and suddenly said with melancholy.</br>
</br>
"Is it far away? Their destination is even farther away, the Kuiper Belt, thirty astronomical units from Earth."</br>
</br>
"Thirty astronomical units?" Xia Shiyu looked to Jiang Chen. "How long does it take?"</br>
</br>
"About a year, maybe a little more, only professionals will know."</br>
</br>
"I thought you were a professional," Xia Shiyu had a grin as she joked.</br>
</br>
"Me? I'm a layman at most on technical problems." Jiang Chen laughed along.</br>
</br>
Once SS Origin arrived at Kuiper Belt, it would investigate the resources in the area. At the formation of the solar system, everything was concentrated here, especially water resources, helium-3, and metallic materials. Determining the distribution of these resources would provide considerable help for the future selection of the outer space defense fortress.</br>
</br>
In addition, Origin would also launch the newest observation satellite inside the Kuiper Belt, while deploying a research space station with ten astronauts. The station would cooperate with scientists at the Space Command Center to carry out scientific research in the Kuiper Belt.</br>
</br>
A year was a long time, but for most of the crew on the starship, it was just a matter of a blink. The hibernation chambers, especially, made Interstellar navigation less dreadful.</br>
</br>
"Right, I have always wanted to ask. Did you decide to make Galaxy Edge as a promotion for Celestial Trade's Space Colony Plan?"</br>
</br>
"That is part of the reason." Jiang Chen acknowledged the point. "After all, the universe is still a very distant thing for most people. After the incident in Finland, people started to look up more, but that's not enough. To take our steps further, we must ignite everyone's desire for the brave new world."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then smiled.</br>
</br>
"I think the game is a great choice. It just so happens that we also have the Phantom helmet that can use VR to show the true beauty of the universe to people around the world."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1294: Galaxy Edge Launched!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On May 30th, with much-anticipated expectations, Galaxy Edge's icon officially appeared in the list of Phantom applications. The icon was available after the application was preloaded.</br>
</br>
Based on the statistics of the Future Technology Operation Department, in less than an hour after the preload was made available, more than 50 million users preloaded the game and entered Galaxy Edge through their Phantom helmet or VR game cabin.</br>
</br>
Future Technology was under extreme load due to the high amount of traffic. It responded by urgently adding a quantum computer as a server to alleviate the download demand.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the signals of the 32 quantum communication satellites already covered all continents except for Antarctica. Otherwise, the huge data transmission may create another headache for Future Technology.</br>
</br>
In less than two hours, the number of preloaded users easily exceeded the 100 million mark, and the number still increased at an exponential rate.</br>
</br>
By noon, the number of users already reached an incredible 300 million. It was only till now did the upward trend ease. By the end of the preloading in the early hours of the day, the number of preloaded users worldwide reached an astounding 500 million!</br>
</br>
It seemed that there was no suspense for Galaxy Edge to break the record set by Godly World.</br>
</br>
However, for game designers, their tensed mind could not be rested before they witnessed this moment in person.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The night outside the window was dark, but the meeting room on the 50th floor of the Future Building was still lit.</br>
</br>
This meeting room was now occupied by the staff of the Galaxy Edge Project Department.</br>
</br>
Dozens of executives and technical backbones of the planning group, operation group, and technical support group were sitting in front of the conference table. They nervously stared at the large holographic screen in front of the conference room.</br>
</br>
An hour after the end of the preload, that was, at 1 am on May 31st, Galaxy Edge would officially launch, and all the eager players would flood into the game world they built.</br>
</br>
At that time, could the number of simultaneous online people break through the record set by the Godly World, and would their project create new glories for Future Technology. All the questions would be answered at that instant.</br>
</br>
Become a joke or become a legend; it was decided in this very moment!</br>
</br>
The project director went to the open window, and lit his twelfth cigarette for the day, which had reset its counter when the clock turned to twleve in midnight. The leader of the planning team rubbed his fingers repeatedly and circled around the conference room. The head of the operations had been to the toilet for the seventh time because he almost drank all the coffee in the conference room ...</br>
</br>
Even the CEO of Future Technology, the veteran Ning Huajian who had come all the way from Wanghai with Jiang Chen, also stood in this 50-square-meter conference room and accompanied his staff through this nervous and exciting moment.</br>
</br>
</br>
Finally, the clock on the wall of the conference room acrossed the one-clock moment.</br>
</br>
Almost instantly, the number on the holographic screen jumped from zero to ten million.</br>
</br>
Everyone's heart pumped violently when that number changed.</br>
</br>
But this was just the beginning.</br>
</br>
In just one minute, that number doubled.</br>
</br>
Everyone's heart jumped to their throat and never came down!</br>
</br>
"20 million! The number of online users exceeded 20 million in one minute!"</br>
</br>
"The number of simultaneous online users exceeded 50 million! It took five minutes!"</br>
</br>
"One hundred million! One hundred million! We broke the record!" The leader of the operation group exclaimed, igniting the emotions of everyone in the meeting.</br>
</br>
Record-breaking!</br>
</br>
The legend that Godly World once created had been rewritten by their records!</br>
</br>
The number of online users on Galaxy Edge easily exceeded 100 million, and at this moment, the momentum was leaping toward 110 million.</br>
</br>
"Server 1 is running normally, turn on Server 2! Now!" The leader of the technical team called the technician in the server room, and his calm voice trembled with excitement.</br>
</br>
Enthusiasm was written all over his face, and when he saw the line on the holographic screen, the rock in Ning Huajian's heart finally dropped.</br>
</br>
He looked at his subordinates who were still fighting in their position and encouraged everyone in the room with a thrilled tone.</br>
</br>
"Focus, let's not fall asleep now!"</br>
</br>
"Haha, who can sleep? This is more refreshing than analgesic oil!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Lilith, who was on the sofa in the living room, was also closely following the numbers.</br>
</br>
Although she didn't say anything, Jiang Chen could still feel that as a game designer, she still cared about other people's evaluation of this game.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat next to her and looked at the constantly growing number from the holographic screen hovering above her hand.</br>
</br>
An hour had passed.</br>
</br>
After the number of players broke through the 300 million mark, the increase had slowed down.</br>
</br>
When this number reached 350 million, Jiang Chen was both impressed and moved by this number.</br>
</br>
"Our game has more people online than the third most populous country in the world."</br>
</br>
"That's the data from four years ago. If you look at the latest population data, 350 million can be ranked in the top five in the world ..." Lilith corrected Jiang Chen with her usual emotionless state as a stream of data appeared in her eyes. Jiang Chen saw her look up slightly before she suddenly said, "A cyber attack was detected."</br>
</br>
"Cyber ​​attack?" Jiang Chen looked away from the holographic screen, and began to yawn due to sleepiness before he casually said, "... get him."</br>
</br>
"I've already started."</br>
</br>
Future Technology's sheer size now meant that it would attract countless attention, both positive and negative. Jiang Chen was not surprised that some people would have ill-intentions on such a crucial day.</br>
</br>
He was not even surprised, let alone being worried.</br>
</br>
Not to mention that Lilith was sitting next to him. Even without this advanced artificial intelligence, the cybersecurity team of Future Technology could not be easily taken down by some second-tier attackers.</br>
</br>
"That's it, the target terminal has exploded." A death sentence was issued lightly to the computer of the unscrupulous hacker, and Lilith continued expressionlessly. "Their actual coordinates have been detected... Should we send a 'Peace Ambassador'?"</br>
</br>
"No need, thank you!"</br>
</br>
Looking at the expressionless Lilith, Jiang Chen subconsciously glanced at the direction of the study.</br>
</br>
He locked his suitcase there, and the nuclear button inside it was enough to destroy the world twice.</br>
</br>
"I'm just making a suggestion," Lilith shrugged and said in a rare joking tone. "You know, no matter how powerful computer technology is, it's impossible to break through physical isolation."</br>
</br>
"If you make that joke again, I'll send you back!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glared at Lilith, speechless, and the latter opened her expression system and made a scared expression.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen knew very well that this girl had absolutely no intention of introspection.</br>
</br>
It was really troublesome for the program to have thoughts and feelings.</br>
</br>
However, even Jiang Chen himself was surprised that compared to his original view, his current view on advanced artificial intelligence had been slightly changed because of Lilith's existence...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When Godly Land first came online, the Phantom helmet was still a rarity. Future Technology had never considered outsourcing or licensing the technology to other large manufacturers. Therefore, it was difficult for players to purchase helmets on the official website, even for rich individuals. Many players could only enjoy the games in the Internet cafes partnered with Future Technology, and often times there was a waitlist.</br>
</br>
To a large extent, the low penetration rate of helmets had severely restricted the number of online users at the beginning of the 24-hour period.</br>
</br>
But even so, on the first day of launch, the record of 100 million concurrent users around the world easily broke a record set by a certain MOBA game.</br>
</br>
The launch of Galaxy Edge was bound to divert some players from Godly Land.</br>
</br>
But it was an expected outcome.</br>
</br>
No matter how fun the game, how rich the content, it was evitable that players to grow weary of a game. When people lose their interest and start to feel bored with day-to-day mobs and endless tasks to complete, they were bound to start thinking about playing less or even leave the game, then find a new game to change things up.</br>
</br>
Galaxy Edge happened to provide this new option for these players.</br>
</br>
It was three in the morning.</br>
</br>
Lilith did not need to sleep, but Jiang Chen was already sleepy and couldn't stand it anymore.</br>
</br>
Based on the saying of the Internet, those who were not asleep at this hour must be seeking to become greater beings.</br>
</br>
"You're not going to sleep yet?"</br>
</br>
Attracted by the light in the living room, Xia Shiyu, who got up to use the bathroom, came down the stairs and walked up behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
With her arms on the back of the sofa, she put her face over Jiang Chen's shoulders, looked at the holographic screen floating in front of him, and murmured with tired voice. "... Well, it has reached 370 million? It's estimated that its peak is 400 million."</br>
</br>
"Aren't you surprised?" Jiang Chen turned his face slightly, and smiled, "I was looking forward to seeing a startled expression on your face."</br>
</br>
"I'm afraid you'll be disappointed." Xia Shiyu's lips curved up to form a gentle sleepy smile. "When we met three days ago, we made predictions on this data and reserved server resources based on the data. "</br>
</br>
"Oh? What is the number of players you predicted?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"The daily average... is probably at around 100 million. As for the peak number, if you don't consider expansions and in-game events, it is probably the number you will see. Not surprisingly, it should be about 400 million. "</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gave a fairly conservative estimate to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
But even a conservative estimate was a pretty staggering number.</br>
</br>
Future Technology's creation could only be broken by Future Technology.</br>
</br>
After tonight, this record would once again shock the world.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
</br>
Early the next morning, the Wall Street Journal gave a rare headline to an online game.</br>
</br>
"The VR game industry hits a new high again, the peak of the global concurrent players on Galaxy Edge exceeded the total population of the UA."</br>
</br>
The UA population exceeded 400 million in 2020, and as of 4:00 am on May 31st, the number of online users had already exceeded the 400 million mark with the influx of players from other time zones.</br>
</br>
Like the time when Godly Land went online, the capital world had once again set their sight on the masterpiece created by Future Technology after a gap of four years. In this era where traffic is king, this astounding number of players meant money.</br>
</br>
Wall Street analysts valued Galaxy Edge at more than 100 billion dollars. Whether this valuation was accurate or justified remained a debate, but the valuation was just the tip of the iceberg for the captial world's interest in this game.</br>
</br>
It was not just the Wall Street Journal, 80% of the world's media, on the first day of June, reported on the miracles created by Galaxy Edge.</br>
</br>
On the official website of Galaxy Edge, hundreds of articles on game strategies and experiences in different languages ​​appeared in the newly opened official forums.</br>
</br>
These strategies were usually compiled by high-end amateur players, while professional players were still struggling in the game world at this moment.</br>
</br>
Because there was no internal test on Galaxy Edge, naturally there were no internal beta players with first-hand information. Everyone was in the exploration stage of this game, and everyone's starting point was the same. Whether someone could create a gap with other players was dependent on the first 24 hours.</br>
</br>
In order to respond to emergencies and urgently repair possible bugs, the staff of Future Technology was almost next to their computers and servers in shifts, as they meticulously monitored all the news in game and on official forum in real-time.</br>
</br>
Soon, it was noon, and the team leader who had just brewed himself his fourteenth cup of coffee returned to the conference room.</br>
</br>
It just happened to be at this moment, the staff of the operation team around the computers exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" The team leader walked up to the staff with his coffee in hand, as he looked at the laptop screen.</br>
</br>
The page on the screen was the official forum of Galaxy Edge.</br>
</br>
In the chat section of the official forum, a post gained tens of thousands of visitors in just ten minutes.</br>
</br>
[The first Seagull-class starship in the game, not much to say, just see it yourself!]</br>
</br>
After he saw the title of the post, the team leader took a second to process this information before he snagged the mouse, and scrolled down to look at the post below it.</br>
</br>
[What the..., good lord, is this your ship? ]</br>
</br>
[This is insane! It only took this long before the first 500,000-ton starship is created! ]</br>
</br>
[I don't read much, so don't lie to me! The cost of a Seagull-class is at least ten million credits!? ]</br>
</br>
[The game has just been launched for twelve hours. How come you have tens of millions of credit points? I just completed a hidden reward task, and it only rewarded me with 200,000 credits!]</br>
</br>
[Loli requesting to play with you! Height 160cm, weight 49kg, my location is Wanghai...]</br>
</br>
[@Admin, come out and meet God himself. I just want to know, is this a hack?]</br>
</br>
[The commenter above must have been kicked by a donkey. When did a hack ever exist in a Future Technology game? How many years have Godly Land been running? Have you heard of hacks?]</br>
</br>
[Is it an NPC ship? No, it doesn't look like it. If it is an NPC ship, the flag should be the Earth Federation flag...]</br>
</br>
"Someone posted a picture on the official forum. The first Seagull-class starship has been created... It was posted in the Mandarin section of ​​the forum. It should be a player in Hua's region," Xiao Zhang looked at his team leader and said with a serious expression.</br>
</br>
The team leader frowned.</br>
</br>
Based on the settings of the game, all players had an empty, single-person aircraft at the start. They could mount a mining module to mine, install an attack module to participate in story missions to obtain credit points in the battle with interstellar pirates, or head to the colonies of the Earth Confederation to participate in ground warfare.</br>
</br>
According to normal game flow, players could get their first 100,000-ton starship after 72 hours of game time and start their own Star Trek journey.</br>
</br>
A 500,000-ton seagull.</br>
</br>
It was undoubtedly a bit too powerful for the start of the game.</br>
</br>
Even if he had complete faith in his colleagues at the technical team to not make any mistake, he stop could not help himself but to suspect that a major bug appeared in the game.</br>
</br>
With this thought in his mind, he did not dare to hesitate, immediately took out his phone, and called the technical team leader.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1296: Exceeding Expectations</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When the news reached Jiang Chen, it was already three o'clock in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also confused about how the players in Huo-region created a Seagull-class within 12 hours , Jiang Chen came to see Lilith who was lying on the sofa and observing each player, and asked her about it.</br>
</br>
Lilith quickly answered his confusion.</br>
</br>
"The player who built the first Seagull-class starship is the chairman of an online gaming club called 'Honor of Souls'. This club has been focusing on Future Technology games since its establishment four years ago. The club has more than a hundred employees and more than a thousand members. The club has been active since the earliest 'New Era' mobile game, and has grown to its current size, and even registered its own homepage and forum. "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately understood what had happened.</br>
</br>
This situation was also common in other games. At the beginning of the game, everyone's funds would be concentrated on a few core members. Then these members quickly leave "turtorial island" and secure the top positions on the leaderboard. Once they've established their own clan, they would go back and give resources to the players who initially contributed to them.</br>
</br>
In online games that emphasized economy and resources, such as Galaxy Edge, the benefits of being able to own a transport ship in the early stages were undoubtedly huge.</br>
</br>
At this moment, no player had switched their profession to pirate, and trips between cities of the Earth Federation could easily accumulate a large amount of funds and continue to expand their advantages.</br>
</br>
Although this play style would somewhat disrupt the game's balance, it was within the allowable range of the game rules, so the operation team did not intervened.</br>
</br>
"In fact, I had thought it was your ship." Jiang Chen, who had understood what was going on, looked at Lilith on the sofa and joked.</br>
</br>
"Participating from the beginning of the game would affect the balance too much. I will go in after half a year to see. Now I am focusing on Godly Land," Lilith, with the helmet on, said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Compared to being the number one player in the game or getting some kind of achievement, she emphasized on the game itself, especially the "fun" of participating in human social activities. After all, monetary gains or personal honors were meaningless for an advanced artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
Simply put, her gaming attitude was more similar to casual players.</br>
</br>
Except she was the "overpowered" kind of casual player.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
As of the morning of June 2nd, the operation department reported the data they had obtained.</br>
</br>
On several well-known virtual product trading platforms around the world, the exchange rate between credit points used by Galaxy Edge and Xin New Dollars was almost speculated to a price of 50: 1, and often there was no supply.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the millionaries and major professional clubs in the world were stimulated by the miracle of the Hua-region player who built the first Seagull-class starship in 12 hours. Therefore, they invested heavily in order to create their own first 500,000-ton starship.</br>
</br>
</br>
In terms of players, the statistics reported by the operation department were much higher than Xia Shiyu's prediction. The average daily number of online users worldwide exceeded more than 150 million.</br>
</br>
The insights generated by the operation team's analytics concluded that it may be related to the recent development of space resources, which happened to be a hot global topic.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen told Lilith to oversee Galaxy Edge's progress, he quickly refocused his work on Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Just two days ago, a cargo ship full of arms had set off from Ange Island to Madagascar in southern Africa.</br>
</br>
Since the fall of the Rothschild family, Madagascar's political situation had been under the control of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
At this moment, in the military base Celestial Trade had snatched from Arrow Company, more than 10,000 mercenaries of different skin colors had been assembled. These people were all outside of Celestial Trade's establishment, however, they were considered Celestial Trade's foreign reserve.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade's regional influence had been gradually expanding since the Dnieper Offensive in Ukraine last year. Therefore, Celestial Trade can no longer use the name of a private military contractor as a cover for diplomatic immunity.</br>
</br>
No one was stupid, and the international community gradually recognized Celestial Trade as the armed forces of Xin. Under such circumstances, if Celestial Trade decided to parachute soldiers with kinetic skeleton from the synchronous orbit to another country, it would have to withstand diplomatic and political pressure from the international community.</br>
</br>
As a result, these non-staff personnel, who were originally regarded as reservists at foreign military bases, once again had a part to play.</br>
</br>
These mercenaries were mostly African with a small number of white natives of Madagascar or South Africa. For those who were living below the poverty line, the citizenship of Xin and the official employee status of Celestial Trade were two things they dreamt of.</br>
</br>
There were willing to risk their lives on their pursuit.</br>
</br>
Although they were not protected by kinetic skeleton, and they could not use the Reaper assault rifle with superior functionality, the E-level genetic vaccine had already brought them a lot of advantages. Future Military had also designed some low-recognition but quite practical high-tech equipment for them to enhance their combat effectiveness and battlefield survivability.</br>
</br>
The size of this unit was less than 20,000, and it usually appeared in hotspots around the world. It performed some dirty work that was not convenient for Celestial Trade's regular army to execute.</br>
</br>
For example, their next stop was Syria.</br>
</br>
As an exchange of interests between Celestial Trade and Russia on South American issues, they did not need to abide by international law and humanitarianism. They would use the simplest and most straightforward methods to bring down extreme terrorists and less extreme opposition.</br>
</br>
If they were unlucky, they might have to fight the Turkish army.</br>
</br>
Of course, the unlucky ones were the Turkish army.</br>
</br>
Inside the mansion's study.</br>
</br>
After Ayesha knocked on the door gently, she walked to Jiang Chen's desk.</br>
</br>
"Yerif asked when we would be ready to start, he is ready. A railway in northern Saudi Arabia can help transport our people and equipment to the Jordanian coast from the Red Sea coast. After entering eastern Jordan, there will be an arms dealer familiar with the local matter. He will guide us through the no-man's land to southern Syria. "</br>
</br>
After he had put down the report on the Mars colony development, he looked to Ayesha, who was standing in front of his desk, thought for a moment, and then said,</br>
</br>
"Tell him not to worry. Our people have already assembled in Madagascar. When the UA election enters its final stage, our people will board the ship and head to the Red Sea. By the end of the UA election, the new and old government will begin to transfer power, and we will have dealt with all of the troubles in Syria."</br>
</br>
Among all the options Jiang Chen could think of, this had the least impact on the situation.</br>
</br>
If Kennedy Jr. was finally elected, the UA would willingly restore relations with Xin and join the Earth Defense Alliance unconditionally. He was also happy to let go of his past differences and set his sights on the longer-term future.</br>
</br>
At that time, in order to minimize the differences between the two countries in international affairs, the best way was to solve the problems that were most likely to cause differences between before Mr. Kennedy Jr. completes the transfer of power...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1297: The Warning From The Opposition</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At ten in the morning, Zhang Yaping's chief of staff visited Jiang Chen's mansion.</br>
</br>
Because there were guests coming, Lilith finally left the sofa and went to the balcony with her helmet.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was working at Future Building while Natasha went to the embassy as usual. As the only hostess of the mansion, Ayesha made black tea for the two and then stood behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
This tall and lean chief of staff seemed quite careful.</br>
</br>
After the last chief of staff of the Presidential Palace finished their term, it was the first time the new chief of staff visited this place on behalf of the president. At the inaugural dinner of President Zhang, he and Jiang Chen greeted each other, but this was the first formal exchange.</br>
</br>
In the living room, the chief of staff explained his intentions.</br>
</br>
"President Zhang is on a diplomatic visit to South America, so he couldn't be here in person. Therefore, I'm visiting on his behalf."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen smiled, looked at the chief of staff and then said, "Don't be so nervous, make yourself comfortable."</br>
</br>
The chief of staff smiled, his stiff shoulders relaxed slightly, and after a pause, he spoke.</br>
</br>
"At the Yoto Olympics in August this year, we expect to send 210 athletes to participate. President Zhang wants me to ask you for your opinion on attending the opening ceremony."</br>
</br>
In general, the decision for leaders to attend the opening ceremony also reflected the diplomatic relations between the two countries.</br>
</br>
On issues that involved diplomatic strategy, Zhang Yaping usually asked for Jiang Chen's opinion.</br>
</br>
For example, Zhang Yaping's visit to South America was carried out under the direction of Jiang Chen. On the surface, it was to push for Xin's enterprises in the South American market. In fact, it was a strategy designed to pave the way for Celestial's Global Power Grid to enter UA's backyard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen responded with a polite smile, and said softly.</br>
</br>
"I don't have any opinions. Since they have been actively seeking to participate in the Earth Defense Alliance and corrected the mistakes they have made, then we might as well show some appreciation."</br>
</br>
The chief of staff was slightly caught off-guard, but he quickly smiled too.</br>
</br>
"I understand what you mean."</br>
</br>
"Is there anything else?" Jiang Chen asked with ease as he leaned back into the sofa while looking at the chief of staff.</br>
</br>
"There is one more thing," With a nod, the chief of staff's expression turned more serious. "Just two hours ago, we secretly met with the confidants of the opposition leader in Colombia at the Xin Embassy in Ecuador.</br>
</br>
With economic growth brought by the Global Power Grid and the promise of another space elevator, Ecuador was the only South American country friendly to Xin and Celestial Trade. Jiang Chen was not surprised that the Colombian opposition was able to enter Ecuador and meet the delegation of Xin.</br>
</br>
</br>
What really surprised Jiang Chen was that the Colombian opposition chose to contact them during this sensitive period.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen responded as a frown slowly formed. "What did he say?"</br>
</br>
"He brought a warning from the Colombian opposition," With a solemn look, the chief of staff said, "The CIB is planning a murder against President Zhang. According to the information he provided, a Mexican drug cartel and a UA-Colombian will be involved in the murder, and it is expected to take place when the Xin delegation arrives in Colombia, and this will be planted on the Colombian conservatives."</br>
</br>
There was a moment of shock that appeared in Jiang Chen's pupils, then he turned to Ayesha, who was behind him.</br>
</br>
Ayesha responded to his look by shaking her head gently, indicating that she had not received any intelligence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then focused on the chief of staff again, his index finger lightly tapped on the armrest of the sofa and fell into contemplation.</br>
</br>
It was a serious accusation to state that the CIB was planning the murder of President Zhang.</br>
</br>
If the situation turned out to be true, it may potentially escalate into a war between the two countries.</br>
</br>
However, there were two doubts that troubled Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
How could the Colombia opposition party possess intelligence that even the Ghost Agents did not receive?</br>
</br>
If the information was true, then another question would arise. Why would the CIB choose to strike Xin's leader at this time?</br>
</br>
Is the Colombian opposition lying? In order to prevent contact between Xin and the current Colombian government?</br>
</br>
There was indeed such a possibility, and the possibility was not small.</br>
</br>
After all, the life and death of the Colombian opposition depended entirely on Celestial Trade's attitude towards the current Colombian government. The one party that did not want Xin's delegation to visit Colombia was the opposition party ready to revolt.</br>
</br>
But do they really dare to lie?</br>
</br>
With these thoughts in mind, Jiang Chen's frown turned deeper</br>
</br>
He felt there was more to this.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was not responding, the chief of staff gently coughed and asked.</br>
</br>
"...President Zhang asked me to seek for your opinion on whether we should adjust the delegation's visit to Colombia."</br>
</br>
Generally, in situations like this, it was always better to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Even if they wouldn't cancel the visit to Colombia, the visit time would be adjusted.</br>
</br>
However, after pondering for a while, Jiang Chen's reply was beyond the expectations of the chief of staff.</br>
</br>
"I will increase the security forces around him so that he does not have to worry."</br>
</br>
"You mean..."</br>
</br>
"Itinerary will not not adjusted."</br>
</br>
"This ..." Although hesitant, the chief of staff still nodded reluctantly, "Okay."</br>
</br>
The meeting was over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sent the chief of staff to the door.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen waited for the vehicle to drive away, he looked at Ayesha at the entrance.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"There are too many suspicious points," Ayesha whispered, "This year is the election year in the UA. Even if they want to provoke a war, they will not choose this time. In addition, if it is the Hill government, they are now shifting their strategy to a conservative one, and it is unlikely that they will make such a risky move. "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He shared the same thought.</br>
</br>
He did not think that after facing countless failures, the CIB would still be so certain that their plan would not be discovered by Ghost Agents. Just a few months ago during the spy war in Nippon, they should have thoroughly learned the true strength of Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
Is it Morgan?</br>
</br>
No, it's impossible.</br>
</br>
Although they would become the beneficiary of the war, they were definitely not referring to a war with unclear outcomes or even consequences that they could not bear.</br>
</br>
"I will immediately send someone to South America to investigate this matter, and at the same time be responsible for protecting Zhang Yaping's safety," Ayesha said softly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, the investigation is going to have to trouble you. As for President Zhang's safety ..." As he spoke, Jiang Chen looked up toward the balcony above the mansion, and a smile suddenly formed. "I know just the right person."</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1298: Strange Events</br>
</div></br>
</br>
South America, Xin Embassy in Ecuador.</br>
</br>
Because of the time difference, it was still late at night.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping finished the meeting with the representatives of the Colombian opposition and without having the time to take off his suit, he was pacing back and forth in the reception room while constantly looking up at the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
The moment he learned that someone was planning his murder, and it was being plotted by the infamous CIB, he was furious and shocked.</br>
</br>
Although it was not the first he received a death threat, it was the first time he received a death threat from a third country during his diplomatic visit.</br>
</br>
Finally tired from pacing around, he walked to the sofa in the reception room and sat down.</br>
</br>
Pressing his fingers on his temples, Zhang Yaping closed his eyes with a headache.</br>
</br>
While digesting a mess of emotions, he suddenly had a moment of realization as his closed eyes opened, showing a color of confusion.</br>
</br>
"Why me?"</br>
</br>
It would be impossible for the CIB to not be aware of the political environment of Xin.</br>
</br>
Although Xin supported a universal suffrage system, everyone was aware that without the support of Celestial Trade, he would not be able to win this election. With the support of big data, Future Group could accurately push specific news to specific people.</br>
</br>
Under such circumstances, even if everyone was satisfied with their vote, the final result of the vote would match the interest of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
To put it bluntly, he was a puppet of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
What would be the use of assassinating a puppet? If he died in South America, the vice president would immediately be able to take over in Xin. Other than causing the people of Xin to mourn and be angry, his death would not cause any disruption to the stable political environment in Xin.</br>
</br>
Does the CIB want to provoke a war?</br>
</br>
Filtering through these thoughts, Zhang Yaping revealed an odd expression.</br>
</br>
If all conditions were to be met, the most likely answer obtained was the least likely possibility.</br>
</br>
Just then, his assistant knocked on the door of the reception room and walked in quickly with the phone.</br>
</br>
"Sir, it's a call from the Presidential Palace ..."</br>
</br>
Snatching the phone from his assistant, Zhang Yaping hurriedly asked.</br>
</br>
"...What did he say!"</br>
</br>
The voice on the other end of the phone hesitated and then responded in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"He said he will increase the security around you, so you don't have to worry."</br>
</br>
How can I not worry!</br>
</br>
With his face gradually turning pale, Zhang Yaping gulped.</br>
</br>
"That is to say, the itinerary for visiting Colombia remains unchanged?"</br>
</br>
"...Yes."</br>
</br>
He hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Collapsing into the sofa, Zhang Yaping looked at the phone in his hand with a wry smile and threw it to the assistant, who hurriedly caught it.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mr. President?" The assistant looked at him with some worry.</br>
</br>
"It's nothing," Zhang Yaping loosened the tie around his neck and waved at him, "Go do your thing."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded respectfully and turned to leave the room.</br>
</br>
The reception room had returned to its previous silence.</br>
</br>
Inside the empty room, Zhang Yaping buried his face between his palms, took a deep breath, and sighed with a headache.</br>
</br>
"... this is pushing me into the fire pit."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Early the next morning.</br>
</br>
At the suburb of Langley, near the Capital, was the CIB building during working hours. It was as busy as ever.</br>
</br>
A CIB agent in a suit knocked on the director's door and then walked in. He went to Henry Wilmot, who was drinking coffee and reading newspapers.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter? My dear Mr. Baird?" Without taking his eyes away from the newspaper, Henry asked in a relaxed tone as he read the latest report on the election on the Washington Post.</br>
</br>
Since Kerry's defeat, he had nothing to do.</br>
</br>
Since he already made a mistake for choosing a side once, he did not plan to make another mistake. As long as Hill, who he sabotaged previously, did not get elected, he could stand in the middle and not make any enemies.</br>
</br>
As for the historical grudges of the Kennedy family and the CIB.</br>
</br>
They all belonged to the older generation...</br>
</br>
"Well, tell me what happened to make you look so wry so early in the morning?" Henry put down the newspaper, then noticed the serious expression on his top staff, and his own expression also gradually became more serious.</br>
</br>
"... We were informed by our informant in Venezuela that recently a batch of Russian-made weapons came ashore from the port of La Cruz and we lost track of it after it was being transported to Venezuela with trucks," Baird reported seriously, then placed two reports on the table.</br>
</br>
"Russian weapon? Venezuela?" Henry was processing the information.</br>
</br>
Does Russia have any core interests in South America? They haven't even solved the problems near them and now they are still thinking about South America that is tens of thousands of kilometers away from Moscow?</br>
</br>
Don't fool me, this is not the 60s or the 70s.</br>
</br>
"Can we trace the origin of this shipment?" Henry asked in a low voice after a moment of pondering.</br>
</br>
"We are tracking this shipment's origin now. The latest information we've obtained is that it is from a port located in Greece, but it is very likely that this shipment never landed in Greece at all and were just attached with the official seal of the Greek customs. "</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter where it originated, I hope it's not from Coro Island."</br>
</br>
Cussing in a low voice, Henry glanced at another report on the table and put aside the issue that he could not make sense of.</br>
</br>
"Report the latest developments to me immediately. Also, keep an eye on Celestial Trade's recent international movements... I'll put this question aside first, and I noticed that there is one more report."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Baird nodded solemnly. "Another piece of bad news. Just this morning we received intelligence that Agent Braddock, who was sent to Colombia last month, lost contact with us early yesterday morning."</br>
</br>
"Lost contact?" Henry frowned, "Can you confirm his current security situation?"</br>
</br>
Baird shook his head.</br>
</br>
"In his residence, we found no evidence of fighting. However, when our people arrived, he had disappeared."</br>
</br>
"There is no evidence of fighting? How is this possible?" Henry wondered.</br>
</br>
Henry was aware of Agent Braddock. Known as the CIB Hound, he had more than ten years of experience in field intelligence work. With the director being well aware of his name, he was certainly a tough individual.</br>
</br>
Without any resistance, an experienced senior CIB agent was taken down.</br>
</br>
Even if the kidnapper possessed power of 007 and Tom Cruise, it shouldn't be that easy right?</br>
</br>
"I also think this is quite strange. With Agent Braddock's strength, it is impossible for him to be kidnapped without resistance." After a pause, Baird, with a complex and complicated expression, added. "At present, we have contacted the Colombian police through the embassy to search for the whereabouts of Agent Braddock as a missing citizen. But so far, we have not received any useful information from Colombia."</br>
</br>
"It is hopeless to count on the Colombian police. They can't even solve their own problems." With a serious frown, Henry thought for a moment, then looked to Baird, "What is the mission Agent Braddock handled before his disappearance? "</br>
</br>
"Tracking down a batch of drugs imported from Florida and a drug cartel active in Colombia and Panama," Baird replied immediately.</br>
</br>
A drug cartel?</br>
</br>
Henry was dumbfounded again.</br>
</br>
If he was kidnapped while following KGB Agents or Ghost Agents, he could understand.</br>
</br>
However, a drug cartel, how is that possible?</br>
</br>
What was with today? How come strange things were happening one after another?</br>
</br>
Henry subconsciously looked at the calendar on the corner of the table, and his eyebrows twisted together.</br>
</br>
Damn it, today is not April Fools' Day either...</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1299: The Rats In The Ditch</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The moonlight was pristine.</br>
</br>
On the border between Ecuador and Colombia, an off-road vehicle colored in military green was parked on a hilly slope.</br>
</br>
A dense tropical rainforest faced the hill and a river only about knee-deep bisected the rainforest into two. One side was Ecuador while the other side was Columbia.</br>
</br>
An Ecuadorian soldier carrying a rifle jumped down from the vehicle, took two steps forward, then used his binoculars to examine the situation on the Colombia side.</br>
</br>
After he had confirmed that no border guards were patrolling the area, he turned back to the off-road vehicle, opened the door for the man sitting in the car, and said with his cigar-flavored Spanish.</br>
</br>
"Border is in the front. There is a Colombian town about two kilometers away. You can take a bus to the nearby city. It's best if you cross as soon as possible. Also, remember to be careful of the patrol lights from helicopters and the crocodiles of the swamp."</br>
</br>
"Thank you, I will." After  bearded man got off the car, he smiled slightly and thanked the soldier.</br>
</br>
The Ecuadorian soldier grinned.</br>
</br>
"You are welcome, our friends' guests are naturally our guests."</br>
</br>
In principle, Ecuador and Colombia, as friendly neighbors, should not give the green light to the Colombian opposition. There were exceptions to everything, however, especially given Ecuador and Celestial Trade's honeymoon phase. Tempted by the check of another space elevator, most of the requirements put forward by Xin could be guaranteed.</br>
</br>
Even if the requirements compromised diplomatic principles.</br>
</br>
With a meaningful smile, Hirst nodded without responding. He picked up his backpack from the back seat of the off-road vehicle, threw it on his back, and walked toward the border under the watch of the soldier.</br>
</br>
Stepping across the river, he walked across a kilometer of the tropical rain forest. Then he dragged out his motorcycle from the bushes and dropped his backpack on it.</br>
</br>
The roar of the engine alarmed the lizard lying on the tree, and the crocodile by the shoal raised its eyelids slightly.</br>
</br>
After he hopped on the motorcycle, he confirmed the direction using the scattered moonlight and then drove straight to the Colombian town not far from the border.</br>
</br>
Time gradually passed, and soon it was deep into the night.</br>
</br>
Hirst stopped in front of a warehouse at an abandoned farm. He locked the motorcycle in front of the door, glanced at the pitch-dark warehouse, and opened the rusty iron gate.</br>
</br>
"Who."</br>
</br>
Not knowingly, a gun protruded out of the shadow, and it was pressed against his face.</br>
</br>
With a grin, Hirst raised his hands above his head and said impatiently.</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
As soon as he said those words, the beard faded from his face at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. The muscles on his face seemed to be wriggling like boiled water, followed by the cracking sound of his bones, Hirst's look had completely changed.</br>
</br>
</br>
The muzzle against his face slowly lowered.</br>
</br>
Hirst lowered his raised hands and complained towards the shadows.</br>
</br>
"Is this necessary?"</br>
</br>
"Special times, forgive me," the man said in a hoarse voice.</br>
</br>
Shrugging off the comment, Hirst followed the man and walked deep into the warehouse.</br>
</br>
They bypassed an agricultural machine, and in the corner of the warehouse, he saw a beam of light leaking from the wooden door.</br>
</br>
The beam of light was very fragile and wavered in the darkness, like a boat swaying in the eye of the storm, it was as if it could disappear in the wave in any second.</br>
</br>
To some extent, its situation was very similar to the current Kurofune.</br>
</br>
Two years ago, the tragedies of City K and Yoto shocked the world. It directly led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of people and the ousting of the two regimes. For the first time, the word T-virus appeared in front of the eyes of all the countries in the world, and the world was caught in an unprecedented panic.</br>
</br>
In December of the same year, NATO launched a large-scale military operation in northwest Somalia under the auspices of the United Nations. With concrete evidences, nations declared war on the warlords and set off another sandstorm in Somalia.</br>
</br>
In less than a month, the iron fist from the civilized world destroyed the warlords who provided support to the Kurofune and took over the infected area and the T-virus factory on the border between Ethiopia and Somalia.</br>
</br>
At the beginning of the following month, Celestial Trade sent troops without authorization to launch an assault in Kenya, destroying the only 1.7 tons left out of the 50 tons of virus stock solution, eradicating everything the Kurofune accumulated over the past decades.</br>
</br>
One bad news came one after another, and Tanaka, the spiritual leader of the organization, also lost contact after a duel with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Even the most senior member of the Kurofune was only aware that he last appeared in the suburbs of Yoto, not knowing whether he was still alive or not.</br>
</br>
Only Tanaka was able to communicate with the Kurofune.</br>
</br>
Losing Tanaka meant that they completely lost contact with the "Black Ship".</br>
</br>
In the confusion and fear of losing the unity, the members of the Kurofune were either exhausted by the global pursuit of Ghost Agents or hiding in a remote area under a different name.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long for Celestial Trade to build a space elevator, which began to emerge internationally, and its strength expanded at a geometric speed. In the shadow of Jiang Chen, they trembled like mice in the gutter, and they didn't dare to look squarely at this behemoth, let alone seek revenge.</br>
</br>
Hirst was no different.</br>
</br>
As a senior member of the Kurofune, he was not only pursued by Ghost Agents but also topped the wanted list of various countries as a terrorist. But because of his ability to change his appearance and height at will, he barely escaped the intelligence organizations.</br>
</br>
Hirst, who fled to South America, wandered in loneliness and confusion for two years and lived a semi-reclusive life while carefully paying attention to the news of the Kurofune.</br>
</br>
However, the cruel facts were stated in front of him.</br>
</br>
Other than news of Kurofune members being arrested or "accidentally killed", he could not find any useful information in the newspapers and the Internet.</br>
</br>
Just when he was almost in a state of despair, he saw the mark left by members of the Kurofune from a newspaper. Overjoyed, he quickly found a companion hiding in Colombia based on the clues left in the newspaper.</br>
</br>
Not only he escaped the pursuit of the Ghost Agents, but three other companions did as well.</br>
</br>
Psychic Andrew from Britain, the UA mercenary Gerak, and a person named Sakai with the ability to read minds.</br>
</br>
"What if they change their itinerary, or simply end their South America visit?" Gerak asked in a hoarse voice while wiping the sniper rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
"They can't change the itinerary," Andrew smiled. "They are Celestial Trade. The CIB is not enough to make them back down, and it won't happen even with FBA involved."</br>
</br>
And their arrogance will make them pay a painful price for this.</br>
</br>
"I hope everything goes well." Hirst drew the Kurofune mark on his chest and closed his eyes religiously, "I also hope that the sacrifice we offer is enough to show our loyalty to our Lord.</br>
</br>
"I just want to avenge Mr. Tanaka," Sakai said with hatred-filled eyes hidden under his long hair and sitting in the corner with his arms folded.</br>
</br>
"We will."</br>
</br>
Andrew's smile was very gentle as if he were a kind priest facing a lost lamb, "My Lord will bless us to victory."</br>
</br>
If the blood of the immortal people could be exchanged for the favor of our Lord and usher in eternal evolution for this decaying world, no matter how many sacrifices, it'll be worth it. This was all because all life will finally gain eternity in glorious harmony.</br>
</br>
World War III...</br>
</br>
This offering should be enough?</br>
</br>
With this thought in mind, Andrew reached out his skinny right hand and touched the pendant on his chest.</br>
</br>
He looked at the tied-up UA citizen who was twisting in the corner, and his dark green pupils flashed with fanatic colors...</br>

</br>
Early the next morning, Lilith went to the airport.</br>
</br>
When she left, she did not bring any luggage. She only asked Jiang Chen to prepare a ticket for her from Coro to Bogota.</br>
</br>
Ayesha wondered if the empty-handed Lilith was really capable of such a serious task. But after Jiang Chen gently combed her chestnut hair, she no longer questioned and timidly chose to believe Jiang Chen's decision.</br>
</br>
The mansion once again returned to the long-absent four people state.</br>
</br>
"You sent such a little girl across the globe to carry out a mission. Is that really okay?"</br>
</br>
Sat at the dining table and biting off a large sandwich filled with vegetables, salad dressing, and bacon, Natasha, who was enjoying her lunch, asked Jiang Chen with a muffled voice.</br>
</br>
"Why not?" Jiang Chen just shrugged and answered nonchalantly. "Compared to Lilith, I'm more curious about how many seconds those who try to challenge my bottom line can last."</br>
</br>
"She... is that powerful?" Natasha looked at Jiang Chen suspiciously while her mouth, that was about to bite the sandwich, opened wider in surprise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed softly while the chopsticks in his hand stopped at the side of the bowl, and his eyes drifted towards the ceiling. "In terms of individual combat ability, if everyone in this room worked together, perhaps it would be a tie."</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen omitted the fact that if the safety program added on Lilith's brain was not in place, he could not think of a way to beat her in a fight. The liquid metal's operability was simply too powerful, Lilith even showed him how to turn the liquid metal into a Gauss rifle.</br>
</br>
Modeling and framing, it'd be completed in an instant.</br>
</br>
The liquid metal could be transformed into a shield at close combat, and it could be transformed into an electromagnetic pulse cannon in far range combat. With its computing power, it was simply unbeatable.</br>
</br>
Although Natasha still had doubts about Jiang Chen's statement, she reluctantly accepted his statement.</br>
</br>
Just that when she thought of the enemy that little girl would face, she couldn't help but feel nervous for her.</br>
</br>
"However, her opponent is the CIB," Natasha shrugged and teased, "Those people will not be merciful because of her age."</br>
</br>
"When did you assume the CIB is stronger than me?" He rolled his eyes, then continued with a casual tone, "And, do you really think the CIB is crooked?"</br>
</br>
"Isn't it?" Natasha asked back.</br>
</br>
Natasha, who had left the Russian intelligence system, was now completely transferred to the diplomatic system as a security adviser to the Russian embassy in Xin. It was debatable if Russia, who was in the midst of a political coup in Colombia, detected anything abnormal, it was realistic for a former agent located tens of thousands of kilometers away to know anything.</br>
</br>
Of course, the Russian Security Services did not receive any news, and it happened to confirm Jiang Chen's guess.</br>
</br>
</br>
Both Ghost Agents and the Russian Security Services did not receive any intelligence of the assassination plans, but these plans were seen by the Colombian opposition in advance and they warned the President of Xin who was visiting Ecuador. No matter how one thought about it, it seemed incredible and improbable at the same time.</br>
</br>
However, the trouble was that this matter could not be verified. Now the coup of the Revolutionary Army had entered the final preparation stage. Basically, the combatants were either hiding in the mountains or lurking in the shadows.</br>
</br>
At this point in time, even the Russian Security Services, who was responsible for supporting the coup, may not be able to find the leader of the revolutionary army hiding in the mountains. Even if they could locate him, it would certainly be too late.</br>
</br>
Because Zhang Yaping would visit the Colombian capital just three days later.</br>
</br>
"Will we know in a few days?" Jiang Chen glanced at the clock on the wall, "In three or four days or at most one week. The delegation of Xin will not stay in Colombia for too long. Therefore, if those people really planned on doing something, then their opportunity window would be the next four days."</br>
</br>
Now Lilith's plane should have taken-off.</br>
</br>
With no direct flights from Coro City to Colombia, counting the transit time, the trip should take her about thirty hours in total. Assuming no delays, Lilith should arrive in the Colombian capital Bogota early in the morning tomorrow.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was inexplicably worried after he thought about the itinerary.</br>
</br>
Is it really okay for Lilith to go so far away alone and get off the plane in the middle of the night?</br>
</br>
But soon, he was amused by his thoughts.</br>
</br>
What a joke, Lilith is the advanced artificial intelligence of the 22nd century.</br>
</br>
It must take at least a division to threaten her...</br>
</br>
Because Lilith was not there, the small third wheel was no longer there.</br>
</br>
During the quiet night, Jiang Chen, Ayesha, and Xia Shiyu finally had some fun outside the bedroom.</br>
</br>
From the gym to the bathroom to the bedroom, after two moans filled with joy and sweat, the three people slept in each other's arms.</br>
</br>
Although Xia Shiyu's bottom line had been slowly lowered by Jiang Chen's constant pleas, it seemed that being with Ayesha was her bottom line.</br>
</br>
But even so, Jiang Chen was already very satisfied.</br>
</br>
If there was another person, he was afraid he could not handle the situation.</br>
</br>
As for the sweet harem dream, while he was curious, he was not eager to make it a reality.</br>
</br>
He would just go with the flow.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Early the next morning, listening to the uniform breathing in his ears, Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
The two women were still asleep.</br>
</br>
A smile formed as he glanced over to see Ayesha and Xia Shiyu snuggling together like kittens. He gently kissed the forehead of each girl, then he quietly crawled out of the bed. Before he left the room, he tucked them in again.</br>
</br>
Although the "exercise" last night took a lot of his energy, he felt almost completely recovered this morning. Other than the soreness in his shoulders, he didn't feel any fatigue at all, instead he felt refreshed.</br>
</br>
After washing up in the bathroom, Jiang Chen came to the kitchen obediently and prepared breakfast for the two women who were still asleep.</br>
</br>
Of course, this may be an overstatement. After all, he only heated up the bacon sandwiches from yesterday.</br>
</br>
But did it matter?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mood was lightened by Ayesha's happy smile as he sat at the dining table and watched her happily bite into a sandwich. A bright smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
However, for some odd reason, Jiang Chen, who showed such a smile, was not well received by Natasha. She responded by giving him a dirty look.</br>
</br>
After she had vented out some of her moodiness, Natasha, who sat diagonally across from him, was yawning profusely while she stuffed the sandwich into her mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought she slept early last night, but he seemed to sense that she was not in a good mental state.</br>
</br>
Could it be that she stayed up yesterday?</br>
</br>
If Natasha knew what he was thinking, he would definitely get two punches.</br>
</br>
You guys were so loud, who could fall asleep!?</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 451: 121 Hydrogen Bombs</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The rain fell rhythmically. The droplets shined under the light bomb, scattering a blood-like texture. The two stood across from each other in the front of the Sports Center, eyes fixed on each other in silence.</br>
</br>
[God?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scoffed at the thought.</br>
</br>
[How childish would you be to consider yourself a God?]</br>
</br>
Boo Yu didn't seem to mind Jiang Chen's scoff as he smiled.</br>
</br>
"I have to respect you for the fact that you made me show my trump card. I'm really curious as to where you got those rockets. As far as I know, no countries before the war were bored enough to use the boring non-guided missiles."</br>
</br>
A task that could be completed by a single guided missile obvious didn't need a bunch of non-guided missiles to complete. These non-guided missiles left history in the mid-21st century, so it made sense for Boo Yu to be completely oblivious to the source.</br>
</br>
"I managed to find creativity in history. Outdated doesn't mean useless." Jiang Chen grinned and gave a vague answer.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Boo Yu shrugged.</br>
</br>
"But you, how did you manage to do it?' Jiang Chen glanced at the steel beams and bullets on the ground. He was intrigued.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu seemed to have heard an interesting question as he suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
The arrogant laughter echoed inside the Sports Center, clear but strange.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you know nothing about power."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't respond as he only apathetically looked at the smile on his face. He seemed to have finished laughing as he retracted his arrogance.</br>
</br>
"Fine, because you answered a question for me, I'll tell you. Have you heard of the hidden genetic code?"</br>
</br>
[Hidden Genetic Code?]</br>
</br>
"I have heard about it," Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
[He already unlocked the second level.]</br>
</br>
"Did you try to unlock the third level?" Bo Yu said mysteriously.</br>
</br>
"The third level?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. The hidden genetic code is someone human ancestors possessed, but through the process of evolution, it was eventually lost. The reason why they lost the ability was not of its weakness or extraneousness, but rather because they were too powerful, therefore they were balanced out by nature." Bo Yu stared at Jiang Chen's eyes with a smile and raised one of his hand, "Just like this."</br>
</br>
The bullets began to float from the ground and concentrate in his palm before slowing forming a mini hurricane.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows at the supernatural scene.</br>
</br>
"Telekinesis?"</br>
</br>
"No, no, no. That is too unprofessional of a way to describe it," with bullets in hand, Bo Yu shook a finger, "This is just a different way of using Klein particles. It uses the third-dimensional physics phenomenon to disrupt the coordinate location."</br>
</br>
"So your ability is to detect Klein particles?" Jiang Chen said musingly.</br>
</br>
</br>
Klein particles' disruption to a third-dimensional phenomenon. Speaking of which, he remembered that the Klein particles that Tingting fired could destroy electronic equipment, could that be a method of disruption?</br>
</br>
The disruption to electron movement.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought about this, he noticed the flashing ring in his hand.</br>
</br>
[Wait, if his ability is to disrupt Klein particles, then his ability must come from…]</br>
</br>
"Sense, disrupt, and control." Bo Yu smiled. "Just like what you saw, I can make kinetic energy stop at will, and I can create magnetic fields out of thin air. I become the God of this world by unlocking the third level! And technology's power will allow me to gift my power to my followers."</br>
</br>
"I originally wanted to use the 121 hydrogen bombs I have on me to force you to help me leave, but now I have changed my mind."</br>
</br>
"I respect your ability, with your help, my plan will be much easier."</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Do you long for this power? Do you long for leaving the barren wasteland?"</br>
</br>
"Join us. I will give you a ticket, and I will gift you the ability to intervene with nature."</br>
</br>
Bo Yu said, his voice manipulative while gazing into Jiang Chen's pupils.</br>
</br>
[Join him?]</br>
</br>
The project to leave for a new world had not the slightest attractiveness to Jiang Chen. He could freely traverse between the modern world and the apocalypse. But Jiang Chen didn't immediately reject him but instead became immersed in thought.</br>
</br>
[121 hydrogen bombs.</br>
</br>
Even if they explode in Jia City, it could easily wipe off the province of Suhang from the map.]</br>
</br>
"You have no other choice. I already activated the 121 blood crystals in my body. Once they leave my control, they will explode like grenades." Seeing Jiang Chen was silent, Bo Yu advanced.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up in the sky.</br>
</br>
The fifteen light bombs dangling nearby seemed to be reaching their limit.</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at it?" Bo Yu frowned.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I agree to work with you." Jiang Chen suddenly smiled and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu paused for a moment as Jiang Chen's smile gave him an ominous feeling. But feeling the hefty weight on his body, he felt calm again.</br>
</br>
[I don't care what kind of tricks you play, I have nukes strapped on me."</br>
</br>
Bo Yu opened his hand and let the bullets slide down as he shook Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, my comrade."</br>
</br>
"Haha, welcome.' Jiang Chen warmly shook his hand as mischievousness suddenly flashed across Jiang Chen's eyes as he put his finger casually on his sleeve.</br>
</br>
The light bombs in the air began to fade as the shadow projected down the wall began to gradually disguise the two's figure.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Bo Yu was alerted.</br>
</br>
Before he could react, he felt the weight on his body disappear as his ring and jacket all vanished into thin air.</br>
</br>
"How, how is that possible?!"</br>
</br>
Bo Yu backed up feeling wholly shaken while pulling out the pistol around his waist.</br>
</br>
He could no longer use his ability after losing the ring, although his mind was in complete chaos after witnessing the "supernatural activity", he knew one thing clear. If he wanted to live, he must control the man in front of him.</br>
</br>
But before he could even raise his pistol, a soaring light blade chopped off his arm</br>
</br>
"AHHHH!"</br>
</br>
The deafening scream echoed in the giant stadium, Bo Yu tumbled and fell to the ground. He held onto his severed right arm; his limbs twitched in pain.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hid away the laser sword in his hand while he used his earpiece to order Cheng Weiguo to come in. He then walked toward Bo Yu.</br>
</br>
The leader that referred to himself as God had the muscles on his face completely twisted in pain. White foam fizzed out from his mouth as his calm and collected persona vanished.</br>
</br>
"Looks like I just slew God." Jiang Chen kicked away the pistol on the ground and looked down on the leader of Dusk.</br>
</br>
This counted as revenge for Sun Xiaorou and Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
The high temperature of the laser blade burned his wound. He didn't lose too much blood. Because of this, Jiang Chen could ask a few more questions.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible, my blood crystals… You hid them. Haha, it's okay… Without my control, they will blow you all to pieces… and die with me." Bo Yu moved back while locking his eyes on Jiang Chen as words came stuttering out.</br>
</br>
"You could speak already? Unfortunately, they disappeared from this world," Jiang Chen scorned.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu's eyes widened, his face full of disbelief.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible."</br>
</br>
"Do you want to know why?" Jiang Chen smile.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu curled up on the ground gulped and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then tell me first about Fallout Shelter 071. Or, why would you chose Sun Xiaorou?"</br>
</br>
It was what puzzled Jiang Chen the most. [If he had granted Sun Xiaorou's ability, why would he choose her and implant a chip to block her memory?]</br>
</br>
When Bo Yu heard her name, Bo Yu took a moment to process it before realizing.</br>
</br>
"Oh, you are talking about the assassin I sent? What a useless- AHHHH!"</br>
</br>
"Don't bullsh*t me." Jiang Chen said apathetically as he stabbed the laser sword into his toe.</br>
</br>
The sharp pain almost made Bo Yu unconscious.</br>
</br>
He had never experienced such pain. Sweat began to roll down from his forehead as he said while howling and screaming.</br>
</br>
"I'll say it, I'll say it!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and looked at him.</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 071, there is a live PAC specimen there." Holding onto his severed limb, Bo Yu's muscles tightened up as his words came right out.</br>
</br>
"Specimen?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
There was hesitation in Bo Yu's eyes, but when he saw the laser sword dangling in Jiang Chen's hand, he decided to reveal the secret.</br>
</br>
"Among the 500 survivors, there is an eternal life code hidden among them."</br>
</br>
[Eternal life!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was completely stunned, but there was no expression on his face as he said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Oh, did you find it?"</br>
</br>
No people of influence could escape the temptation of eternal life, and Jiang Chen was not an exception.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu's twisted face squeezed out a smile.</br>
</br>
"Haha, guess?"</br>
</br>
"Don't waste time." Jiang Chen said emotionlessly with the laser sword pointed at his nose, "Based on the value of the information you provided, I can consider letting you live."</br>
</br>
"Hehe, then why don't you just kill me." Bo Yu said with a grim smile, "You really think I will fall for your trick? You only have two choices; kill me and loss all the clues or let me live in exchange for a clue."</br>
</br>
The truth-telling liquid was useless to anyone injected with the genetic vaccine. If he didn't say anything, Jiang Chen had no better ways of obtaining the information in his head.</br>
</br>
[Capture him first before interrogation?]</br>
</br>
But just then, drowsiness began to overwhelm him.</br>
</br>
He felt a burning sensation from his wrist.</br>
</br>
With "uh oh' in his mind, the laser sword pointed at Bo Yu nose slid down from his hand.</br>
</br>
Without screaming, the laser sword penetrated Bo Yu's head.</br>
</br>
Trying his hardest to maintain his fallen consciousness, Jiang Chen pressed on the earpiece and said "help me" to Cheng Weiguo before dropping to the ground.</br>
</br>
The 121 blood crystals finally exploded.</br>
</br>
But it was not in this world. It was inside Jiang Chen's storage dimension.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 452: Collapse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Among the hazy chaos.</br>
</br>
The 121 crimson dots began to expand and illuminated the 30 cubic meters sub-dimension.</br>
</br>
The light was getting brighter and brighter and gradually swallowed all the items inside the storage dimension and expanded to the edge of the space.</br>
</br>
All the energy inside was trapped by the invisible force field inside the tiny space. The entire sub-dimension was like a paper box that quarantined all the energy released from the 121 hydrogen bombs.</br>
</br>
The blinding light expanded against the invisible wall in an attempt to break through the boundary and spread further.</br>
</br>
The 121 blood crystals were like a dam that was cracking; the violently diffused energy unleashed into the third-dimensional space. Followed by the Klein particles constant decay to the third dimension, inside the 30 cubic meters space, the pressure against the boundary was even comparable to the pressure inside a star.</br>
</br>
It was just like a sun squeezed into 30 cubic meters.</br>
</br>
The restraint was absolute, despite the massive amount of energy, they could not leak out from the sub-dimension.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the energy filling the space came to a halt as it stopped pressurizing the space boundary.</br>
</br>
With the force of gravity, once the photon concentration exceeded the threshold. They could no longer escape, but rather began to collapse toward the middle…</br>
</br>
The light that filled the space shrunk to a single point. That one point was darker than any material in the natural world because no light could escape its constraint nor its gravity field.</br>
</br>
"Is that… a black hole?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared blankly at the changes in the space. He wanted to reach for the black dot, but he realized he had no hands at all.</br>
</br>
After fallen unconscious, his consciousness appeared in the dimension.</br>
</br>
Before, even if he could store and sense the items in the subdimension, which he referred to as the storage dimension, he never examined it closely.</br>
</br>
And now, he could allow all his consciousness to flow into the dimension and observe everything inside.</br>
</br>
"This dimension is not cubical nor spherical, but rather… Uh, what exactly is it?" Jiang Chen frowned as he searched for the right word to describe the place.</br>
</br>
Without any shape, it was purely comprised of an invisible gravitational force used to restrain all matters inside the 30 cubic meters space.</br>
</br>
Space was free of shape. The only limitation was the size of the matter inside the space.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and gave up on the idea of naming the dimension. He started to observe the black dot.</br>
</br>
The 121 blood crystals completely vanished, all the Klein particles decayed into energy visible in the third dimension.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly viewed the black dot while patiently waiting for its change.</br>
</br>
But a long time passed, and no change occurred.</br>
</br>
</br>
But even then, Jiang Chen could sense that the black dot's dimension was still compressing. Only because its shape was being compressed by its own gravitational force to the shape of the space, it was difficult to physically observe its change.</br>
</br>
If there was a physicist here, he may fall into shock or even frenzy, and gaze onto this "miracle".</br>
</br>
Gravitational collapse!</br>
</br>
It was gravitational collapse!</br>
</br>
Any of the small changes that occurred there could cause an earthquake in the world of physics.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen, who stood there, was only an engineer that forgot most of his knowledge. Not only did he lack any understanding, but he also did not have any desire to pursue. He only spent the time observing the black dot because he had nothing else to do…</br>
</br>
It was not the first time he wasted a valuable opportunity.</br>
</br>
But then, an odd occurrence appeared in his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The black dot where not even light could escape began to use its force to twist and shred the dimension.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen shockingly discovered that the boundary that restrained the sub-dimension began to loosen.</br>
</br>
He was first ecstatic, but his mood took a rollercoaster ride down to the bottom.</br>
</br>
The boundary did indeed begin to shake.</br>
</br>
But it was not being expanded outward, but being dragged in by the black dot with infinitely large density and infinitely small dimensions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what to feel.</br>
</br>
"My storage dimension will be pulled to form a singularity?" Jiang Chen wanted to stop everything from happening, but he could not interfere with the changes.</br>
</br>
Throw the black dot outside?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly rejected the idea as cold sweat dripped down.</br>
</br>
Creating a black hole on earth, the place would no longer be an apocalypse, but doomsday.</br>
</br>
Just as he was pained by the idea that his storage dimension "disappearing", the black dot exploded.</br>
</br>
The big bang occurred.</br>
</br>
If a physicist were here, he would fall unconscious due to the excitement.</br>
</br>
Because at that instant, Jiang Chen witnessed the birth of a universe.</br>
</br>
When compressed to the limit, the motion of photons turn into an absolute static state. The photon without mass instantly lose all its energy when it stopped moving. The black dot lost its energy, the infinitely large density instantly returned to zero, and the gravity that warped space vanished too.</br>
</br>
The big bang caused by the gravitational collapse caused a sudden transition from the "sub-dimension" to a dimension.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen witnessed everything that occurred in front of his eyes with astonishment before his consciousness slowly returned to his body…</br>
</br>
He opened his eyes and realized that he was in a room.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo sat beside him.</br>
</br>
"General! You are finally awake!" Seeing Jiang Chen wake up, Cheng Weiguo instantly turned joyous as he immediately got closer.</br>
</br>
"How long was I unconscious for?"</br>
</br>
"Two days!"</br>
</br>
"Mhm… Where is this place?" Jiang Chen scanned his surroundings.</br>
</br>
"This is Shenxiang Town, I followed your order and left 1000 soldiers to defend Jia before taking the rest of the soldiers and armored forces back to Wanghai." Cheng Weiguo immediately responded.</br>
</br>
"We won?"</br>
</br>
"We won!" Cheng Weiguo nodded in excitement.</br>
</br>
[We won… but everything feels surreal.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen reminiscenced about the final showdown and what happened in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"General, please don't do something dangerous like this again. If anything happens to you, your Miss will blow our heads off," Cheng Weiguo said with a bitter expression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only smiled.</br>
</br>
[If it were not for me, who threw the 121 blood crystals into the storage dimension, the entire Suhang province would have been wiped out from the map, never mind you.]</br>
</br>
Of course, he would not explain this to them. Only a few members of the NAC knew that the Dusk could explode crystals. As to his storage dimension ability, only Sun Jiao, Yao Yao, and Lin Lin knew, even Sun Xiaorou didn't know as he hasn't had the opportunity to tell her.</br>
</br>
"Where did the eight mounted rocket launcher vehicles go?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"The vehicles are deployed to Shenxiang; the remaining solid fuel rockets are still being transported. General, are you hungry, should I bring you some food?"</br>
</br>
With how caring Cheng Weiguo was, Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No need. Leave me alone for now. I just want to lie here for a bit… Also, did you report that I was unconscious?"</br>
</br>
"No, I was about to."</br>
</br>
"No need."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Cheng Weiguo was relieved too.</br>
</br>
When he left, he closed the door for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rested for a moment before he picked up his EP and began to check his body stats.</br>
</br>
All body functions were normal without any physical damage.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen instantly disappeared from the bed before returning to bed in the next second.</br>
</br>
The interdimensional traveling ability was functional.</br>
</br>
Feeling relieved, he submerged his consciousness into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mouth twitched at the sight.</br>
</br>
There was nothing inside.</br>
</br>
Including a power armor, some grenades, the PK2000 he used for a while… two protective suits, a few instant noodles, and snacks…</br>
</br>
Everything was destroyed in the big explosion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
He was not pained by the loss of weapons and foods.</br>
</br>
But all the debit card, ID, and driver's license must be obtained once again. He would also have to obtain a new set of keys and a new phone…</br>
</br>
He was used to tossing everything into the storage dimension. Now everything inside had been melted down.</br>
</br>
"Whatever, it is a good time for new things. I will ask Yao Yao to create a new phone for me," Jiang Chen let a sigh as he muttered to himself while staring blankly at the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Other than that, there was an increase in his sense of the storage dimension, as he could not only submerge his consciousness into the pitch black space, but he could also use his consciousness to interfere with the matter inside.</br>
</br>
For example, he could control a pair of nonexistent hands inside the dimension to move the location of the vase he threw inside.</br>
</br>
The vase reappeared in his hand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the life signal detector on the EP and lowered the frequency identification range. Staring into the EP screen, Jiang Chen was silent before he sighed.</br>
</br>
[Still could not carry creatures?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and let his consciousness continue to sink into the dimension to feel more of the "suspended feeling."</br>
</br>
But then, he was shocked by his discovery.</br>
</br>
[Eh?]</br>
</br>
[When did my storage dimension get so big?]</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The storage dimension somehow reenacted the Big Bang.</br>
</br>
The previous 30 cubic meters dimension expanded ten times, and it was now 300 cubic meters already! The previous sub-dimension only restrained by gravity now turned into a "universe!" And the "universe" was expanding outward at a hardly visible speed!</br>
</br>
A spherical dimension 300 square meters in volume with a radius of 4.146 meters.</br>
</br>
Outside of the spherical was just space.</br>
</br>
It was minuscule compared to the actual universe, Jiang Chen referred to it as "small universe" for now.</br>
</br>
He knew with time; the "small universe" will eventually become something comparable to the actual universe.</br>
</br>
Although it may take billions of years...</br>
</br>
But what fascinated Jiang Chen was not the slowly expanding size.</br>
</br>
He had an inexplicable feeling that the transition between emptiness to defined state was the key to him bringing people through interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rested until morning. He moved his body around in the room after waking up, seeing that there was no discomfort, he headed out.</br>
</br>
The soldier stationed outside the door saluted when he saw Jiang Chen and took him to the temporary command post of the First Corps under his request.</br>
</br>
When he saw Cheng Weiguo, he started to ask about the status of the First Corps.</br>
</br>
First, it began with the loot.</br>
</br>
The 300,000 tons of Grade C steel far exceeded the expected 200,000; the Sixth Street investors would cheer at this fact. At the same time, the First Crops obtained 50,000-tons of Grade A steel from the newly built warehouse in Jia, as well as large amounts of Type-99 anti-tank cannons, mortars as well as other heavy weapons. The looted steels would be used by the factories in Fishbone base to produce Tiger II tanks. The regular weapons were left in Jia and were guarded by the 1000 First Corps soldiers.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the kinetic skeletons and Gauss rifles remains used by the Apostles were collected by Cheng Weiguo. After the end of the mutants flood, the pieces would be sent to Fallout Shelter 027 for technological recreation.</br>
</br>
Optical illusion, Gauss rifle, Jiang Chen had been thirsty for these technologies for a long time but never obtained the design blueprint for them. Although he didn't know where the Dusk managed to obtain such technology, they belonged to him now. The loot from a technological point of view was pleasing too.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu died. This marked the end of the Dusk and the big problem was finally solved.</br>
</br>
The only regret was that the secret of Fallout Shelter 071 would be carried into the grave along with the death of Bo Yu. If he wanted to know, he would have to search for the remaining members of the Dusk, or personally investigate the abandoned remains of fallout shelter 071.</br>
</br>
In the nuclear fallout shelter under the Sports Center, the NAC soldiers killed the leader of the mutated humans, Troy, as well as the remaining mutated humans in the Seventh Area. All the mutated humans in the Seventh Area were eliminated. After capturing the Seventh Area and Jia, Cheng Weiguo ordered all mutated humans vial to be destroyed as well as the FEV formula.</br>
</br>
</br>
Therefore, the problem that bothered Wanghai for so long was finally removed. The business route to the west would be open again.</br>
</br>
By next year spring, endless amount of merchants would traverse to the treasure land, Wanghai, with their shining crystals and delicate goods.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, only ten thousand Defenders were saved from Jia. They all expressed their interest in joining NAC, even though 50,000 died under the rain of destruction.</br>
</br>
It was human nature for the weak to worship the strong.</br>
</br>
If they were protected by a powerful force, they wouldn't have needed to experience that kind of hardship in the first place. So they pleaded Cheng Weiguo to shelter them, even as NAC slaves.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo didn't immediately agree. He only expressed that he would pass their request on to the general.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen considered it for two seconds before accepting them. Then he selected a few people who looked clever to look after the ten thousand people from the First Division and to start rebuilding in Jia.</br>
</br>
Jia was the gateway to Wanghai from the west. Jiang Chen was debating if it should be declared a military zone or economic zone.</br>
</br>
But after discussing with Chu Nan on the phone, Jiang Chen made the final decision.</br>
</br>
He established Jia as an economic zone and completely abandoned the Seventh Area. This way, the merchants that pass through the area could complete simple supplying. On the other hand, Jiang Chen requested the temporary director of Jia to investigate the state of the maglev track.</br>
</br>
If they could repair the maglev track from Jia's rail station and link it with Wanghai's rail station, the time between Jia to Wanghai would drastically shorten. The merchants from Hai heading to Su and Changzhou would indeed favor taking Wanghai's route and abandon traversing the barren land to the east of Lake Dingshan.</br>
</br>
At the end of the call, Jiang Chen briefly asked about the current status of the Sixth Street. He knew that they were in a precarious state, hanging on by a thread.</br>
</br>
Currently, large numbers of dangerous mutants appeared from east of the Sixth Street, and the long defense line brought immense pressure to the soldiers defending. Just yesterday, the north door was attacked by a group of Death Claws.</br>
</br>
It was a calamity.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult for the Death Claw to hop onto the wall. But to the survivors, all the anti-tank cannon or rocket launchers could damage the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
"If we cannot receive assistance within four days, we will have to abandon the Outer Circle wall and retreat to the Inner Circle. The mutants in the rural area have become more and more powerful. The fuel storage in the Sixth Street is also running short…" Chu Nan said difficulty.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry. Latest this afternoon, everything will end." Jiang Chen laughed on the phone.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan raised his eyebrows, puzzled. He didn't know the massive commotion Jiang Chen caused on the East line. But with how confident Jiang Chen sounded, he still stated that he would do his best to defend while waiting for backup to arrive.</br>
</br>
The source of Jiang Chen's confidence was simple.</br>
</br>
[20 thousand solid fuel rockets to bring on the rain of destruction.]</br>
</br>
[Regardless if it is zombies or Death Claws, any carbon-based life form must die!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone and looked toward Cheng Weiguo waiting on the side.</br>
</br>
"When will the 20 thousand rockets be ready?"</br>
</br>
"It has been ready since an hour ago, waiting for your order."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded pleasingly.</br>
</br>
"What about the armored force?"</br>
</br>
"Prepared to enter the battle!" Cheng Weiguo raised his chest.</br>
</br>
It was time to end everything.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the hologram map hovering on the table and a grin formed on his face.</br>
</br>
"Tell everyone to get ready. Bring the weapons and let's go home!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 454: The Fire</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Outside of the east gate of the Sixth Street, broken limbs were scattered on the ground. The thickened blood and zombie fat mixture formed a hard shell and covered any visible surface.</br>
</br>
A soldier on the wall gulped and slightly moved his finger on the trigger. The tragedy and disgust under the wall made his skull feel numb.</br>
</br>
The sentry guns on the wall moved at a uniform speed with the red sight scanning outside of the wall, searching for any suspicious target. The higher towers were installed with Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon or Type-99 anti-tank cannon. The soldiers responsible for firing were taking a nap beside the cannon as a lot of them haven't closed their eyes for over 24 hours.</br>
</br>
"They are almost here."</br>
</br>
Inside the command tower, Zhao Gang gazed at the red dot on the hologram screen with his eyebrows twisted together. The drones captured the mutants' distribution outside of Wanghai. The red box labeled "Bug Vehicle" gave him an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
As an ex-Qingpu survivor who survived for over ten years on the wasteland, he knew exactly what the "Bug Vehicle" was. He hid into the Sixth Street along with his father that year to survive through the first mutants flood.</br>
</br>
"The First Corps is still not here." Chu Nan also looked tense beside him.</br>
</br>
"They already left from Shenxiang, but with their current speed, they may not arrive until tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"This is an absolute disaster," Chu Nan looked at the halted blue dots on the map as he exclaimed.</br>
</br>
When he was a pilot at Liuding, he never met something like the mutants flood. The mutants flood seemed to be only limited to land as the mutants in the ocean didn't exhibit any oddity. Therefore, the Bohai that was stationed beside the harbor would only need to retract the foldable suspension bridge for the zombies and mutants to be stuck on land.</br>
</br>
The occasional mutants that could fly onto the dock were killed off by soldiers or power armors holding flamethrowers without the need for him as a pilot to head to the front line.</br>
</br>
"This was a disaster to start with." Zhao Gang stared outside the wall.</br>
</br>
Another round of mutants attack began!</br>
</br>
"It's the Bug Vehicle!"</br>
</br>
Followed by a shout, all the soldiers napping woke up and stared down the wall.</br>
</br>
On the soft but powerful bug body was a shell as durable as a rock. The shell as smooth as the mirror surface protected its weak head and fragile body. It crawled at an even speed, leaving a disgusting white trial on the concrete surface. It was just like a giant snail with its head covered, but it was not afraid of salt…</br>
</br>
It could easily climb over high walls and swallow any of live creatures along its path.</br>
</br>
"Machine guns fire! Cannons prepare to shoot, fast!"</br>
</br>
Tatatata-!</br>
</br>
The soldier kneeling behind cover fired the machinegun and unleashed its fire along with his comrades. The sparks reflected on his face vividly displayed his look of despair.</br>
</br>
</br>
Bullets splattered and only left thin dents on the surface of the Bug Vehicle. The dense calcium shell was formed from the interlayer of graphene and hexagonal silicon mesh, which was close to the strength of B Grade steel, and the thickness of the shell close to 500mm was like a wall.</br>
</br>
The Type-99 anti-tank cannon fired. A bright orange shell soared through the sky. But when it hit the "snail shell", it was deflected at a 90 degrees angle.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, it bounced off!"</br>
</br>
With a loud roar, the soldiers reloaded.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon unleashed its blue electric arc and the 5 kg bomb instantly vaporized the shell. In front of the Bug Vehicle that rendered all anti-armor bullets useless, only the electromagnetic cannon posed a threat.</br>
</br>
The problem was the limited number of electromagnetic cannons deployed in the Sixth Street. Only four cannons were distributed to each wall with each cannon responsible for defending a defense line of over a thousand meters. But there were at least hundreds of Bug Vehicles attacking the north wall.</br>
</br>
The Bug Vehicle that lost its shell didn't die yet. It crawled on the ground like a snail before quickly dying under the machine guns fire.</br>
</br>
A soldier with a rocket launcher kneeled down by the wall and aimed at the Bug Vehicle closest to him.</br>
</br>
Target Locked.</br>
</br>
He pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
The exhaust burst out as the rocket launched five meters out before readjusting course and blasting into the sky. Five seconds later, the rocket smashed down like a meteor and penetrated the shell of the locked on Bug Vehicle. The "snail shell" suddenly stopped in its track before it was blown three meters into the air and the bug hidden inside was instantly shredded to pieces.</br>
</br>
"Nice shot!"</br>
</br>
The soldier beside him gave him a thumbs up. He grinned, removed the one-time use launcher, and took out another launcher from the box beside him to install it onto the guidance device.</br>
</br>
Red Arrow-42, one of the few weapons that could damage the Bug Vehicle other than the electromagnetic cannon.</br>
</br>
With the assistance of anti-tank weapons, the battle began to turn as the Bug Vehicles close to reaching the wall were being wiped out. But Zhao Gang in the command tower still had his eyebrows knitted in a frown.</br>
</br>
A total of 251 red dots were on the screen, but there were only 100 Red Arrow-42 rockets in storage. The weapon costing 4000 crystals was too expensive for the Sixth Street to have in high reserve.</br>
</br>
At that time, the communication device connected through.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" Seeing it was Jiang Chen, he immediately picked up.</br>
</br>
"Get ready to look at the fireworks." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang was still processing as to what was going on. But half a minute later, the communication device dropped from his hand onto the ground. Staring out the window, his pupils began to widen. His mouth moved up and down in disbelief as he could not search for a single word that could describe his state.</br>
</br>
Beside him, Chu Nan's expression was nonetheless similar…</br>
</br>
On the wall, a soldier heard the roaring sound from a distance and raised his head.</br>
</br>
"Look! What is that?" A person shouted out and pointed to the southwestern sky.</br>
</br>
Dense black dots with long smoke trails.</br>
</br>
The anti-air machine guns pointed in that direction in caution, but when they saw that those were not mutants, everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.</br>
</br>
The rockets smashed down like raindrops and covered the area behind the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the scorching flame columns shot into the sky and instantly engulfed the battlefield. It swallowed the two hundred something Bug Vehicles as well as the zombies and mutants flooding toward the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The shell of the Bug Vehicle could easily deflect the rocket and withstand the blast of the explosion, but it could not withstand the thousand degrees high temperature. Their outside remained intact, but the soft body inside was cooked before turning into carbon dust.</br>
</br>
The swarming fire and the thick smoke that covered the sun. Under the rain of destruction, no mutants survived.</br>
</br>
Feeling the high heat and burnt smell drifted to their nose. The soldiers on the high wall stared at the scene blankly as their rifles rolled out of their hand without knowing.</br>
</br>
Moments later, someone spoke the first sentence.</br>
</br>
"This is insane."</br>
</br>
"…Indeed."</br>
</br>
"What is that…" The soldier's voice was trembling.</br>
</br>
"…Hell?"</br>
</br>
"Perhaps…It is our people."</br>
</br>
"Without a doubt."</br>
</br>
Feeling the scorching heat whiff to the tip of his nose, his comrade beside him closed the safety and lowered the rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
If this existed, rifles no longer served a purpose.</br>
</br>
A Death Claw dashed out from the fire. It rolled on the ground in pain, but the mixed fuel that stuck to its body could not be extinguished. Rolling and turning around didn't help but made it burned faster. Slowly, it no longer twitched, it only scratched the concrete with its claws in agony.</br>
</br>
No one bothered with the Death Claw, because everyone knew it could no longer survive.</br>
</br>
In the distance, rockets continued to soar through the sky.</br>
</br>
In the command tower, Zhao Gang and Chu Nan gazed at the fire in the distance.</br>
</br>
The sky in the distance turned red.</br>
</br>
But they didn't know if it was the dusk or the fire that illuminated the sky.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Liuding, the deck of the Bohai Aircraft Carrier.</br>
</br>
The limping zombies wandered near the port, and their whitened pupils were blankly fixed on the aircraft carrier in the distance. The deck of the aircraft carrier was filled with survivors, most of them came from the east of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
When the mutants flood arrived, the weak survivors often chose to join more powerful settlements, or some just chose to migrate out of the city. Liuding in the ocean was without a doubt their primary choice since zombies and mutants that lived on land couldn't do anything to the aircraft carrier city in the sea.</br>
</br>
For these survivors, Liuding's official stance was also welcoming. The official government designated a living area and provided them with drinking water and nutrient supplies. Of course, these services were not free. Including the ticket to board, all the protection must be exchange with crystals.</br>
</br>
A middle-aged man in uniform and a general cap stood up straight with his hands behind his back. He gazed into the sky in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Rockets?"</br>
</br>
"Yes… And it should be napalm rockets," With a rifle in hand, the soldier beside him replied.</br>
</br>
The General didn't say a single word and only stared at the flames ascending afar.</br>
</br>
After a moment, he cursed out in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, where did they get so much fuel?"</br>
</br>
The powerful NAC was indeed a threat to Liuding. If this massive amount of rockets flew toward Liuding, he knew too well that even with the electromagnetic and laser anti-missile systems, they had no possibility of surviving.</br>
</br>
With the rockets that absolutely had no "technological capability," the cutting-edge countermeasures such as electronic hacking and electromagnetic were simply invalid. The laser anti-missile systems could also at most destroy three or four rockets. In front of hundreds of missiles, it was a joke.</br>
</br>
The soldier beside him didn't speak. He slowly took a deep breath and watched the rockets fiesta in the distance with a stiff expression.</br>
</br>
It was already getting darker. The General abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"How long did they fire for?"</br>
</br>
"They started from dusk," the soldier who recollected his thought replied.</br>
</br>
After a momentary silence, the General turned around and left the deck.</br>
</br>
"These bastards, they will blow all the radiation dust from the city center to here. Prepare to activate the anti-radiation sail."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The soldier saluted while watching the General.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the survivors not far away were also on the edge of the aircraft carrier, gazing at the flames in the sky.</br>
</br>
They whispered to each other and discussed everything that was happening on land.</br>
</br>
"Did NAC do all of this?"</br>
</br>
"Should be… That's the Sixth Street's direction."</br>
</br>
Men, women, elder, children… Almost everyone gazed in the same direction.</br>
</br>
</br>
Their pupils reflected the bright red fireworks.</br>
</br>
It was the flame of order.</br>
</br>
They saw hope.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
At the same time, in the space 36000 kilometers from the surface.</br>
</br>
The debris of satellites and space stations quietly rotated along the synchronized orbit and formed into a steel planetary ring. Just from the sheer sight, it was easy to catch a glimpse of the tragic battle that erupted there.</br>
</br>
Among the space junks, a ship cruised among them.</br>
</br>
Inside the ship lied a figure.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Very interesting."</br>
</br>
Through the layer of glass, he narrowed his eyes while watching the spark of flame on earth. The flame from Wanghai was visible even in orbit.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the pleasant female electronic voice began to play.</br>
</br>
"Okay, but I don't think I will need it." Lin Chaoen spoke to the program that could not reply before he clicked on the launch pad.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen ignored the voice as he inputted the password beside the glass hatch.</br>
</br>
The steel opening popped up as the emergency launch button appeared. He slapped the red button.</br>
</br>
Following the sound of air dispersing, the hatch door gradually opened.</br>
</br>
As a robot made completely of mechanical parts, he didn't mind the vacuum environment and was obviously unfearful of the radiation source. He pulled the graphene and attached the metal hook around his waist. Lin Chaoen put on the booster and bounced out into space.</br>
</br>
He watched the silent space station floating in space as a smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
It was a cane.</br>
</br>
A cane that granted absolute authority.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Besides the launch vehicle, Jiang Chen had a cigarette in his mouth as he watched the flying rockets.</br>
</br>
It was already night time, but the sky was still bright.</br>
</br>
The BM-21 rockets continued to unleash its power as the solid fuel rockets covered the west rural area all the way to the city center. Millions of zombies and mutants died under "Stalin's Organ." Just with the body of flesh, he didn't believe that any creature would survive in this hell.</br>
</br>
It was quite funny, but he suddenly remembered the last time Sun Jiao, and he played together in the virtual reality game. She seemed to have used a spell and scorched the entire beginner's village.</br>
</br>
"The feeling of magic?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised the cigarette with his two fingers as he grinned and extended his hand into the night sky filled with rockets.</br>
</br>
The "Fireball Rain" started because of his order. If he interpreted the order as a spell, then he was indeed a magician.</br>
</br>
The magician that possessed power.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo who stood on the side had his hands behind his back. He pretended not to see the General's childish moves.</br>
</br>
"What's in the city center?" Jiang Chen suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo first took a moment to process before a wry smile appeared.</br>
</br>
"I don't know, I heard that when the rumor of God's Cane was in the city center, the furthest the survivors reached was the Changning area which is still five kilometers away from the city center. It was all ruins there with a giant nuclear crater in the middle. Only dangerous mutants or extremely mutated creatures would appear there.</br>
</br>
"Is no one curious what is there? It shouldn't be that difficult to send a drone to investigate." Jiang Chen killed the cigarette and threw it on the ground.</br>
</br>
To be honest, after being injected with the genetic vaccine, he didn't really smoke anymore. But when it was too boring to wait, he would occasionally have one or two.</br>
</br>
"The drones can't enter the area, or I should say no electronic equipment could enter." Cheng Weiguo shook his head.</br>
</br>
[EMP?]</br>
</br>
[Using EMP through a creature's body? That's too obscure.]</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen thought about this, he raised his eyebrows in question as he reached for his pack of cigarette only to realize it was empty.</br>
</br>
He wanted to look in his storage dimension, but he remembered that there was absolutely nothing inside.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo immediately walked up and took out his own.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and grabbed one for himself.</br>
</br>
"I will give it back to you."</br>
</br>
"Haha, General, you gave it to me." Cheng Weiguo smiled.</br>
</br>
With the cigarette in his mouth, Jiang Chen didn't light it up. He gazed into the flame in the distance, pondering.</br>
</br>
[No, the creature could launch EMP… or launch Klein particles.]</br>
</br>
Tingting inside Lin Lin's body could do that too.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, he never really understood.</br>
</br>
[The bug that the artificial intelligence talked about, what exactly was it?]</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When the last rocket ascended, it was already midnight.</br>
</br>
The 20,000 napalm rockets were all launched.</br>
</br>
The blazing fire covered everything from the rural areas to the city center and vanquished all life in the vicinity.</br>
</br>
When the concentration of zombies and mutants dropped below a certain threshold, the mutant flood would stop. The zombies and mutants in the western half of the city would meet this condition.</br>
</br>
"Will the fire be extinguished by tomorrow?" Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he looked at the thick smoke and light of the flames.</br>
</br>
"It should stop," Cheng Weiguo said. "Wanghai was struck by nuclear warheads before, so most of the materials should've burned already. Once the rocket fuel is completely consumed along with the zombie fat and lipid, the fire should stop then."</br>
</br>
The armored force was mobilized in the morning to clear out the road from Shenxiang to Fishbone base. They should've arrived by now. Once Jiang Chen took care of all the necessary things, it would be time to return to the base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and threw away the cigarette in his hand.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, you can head back now."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo saluted and turned around.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kneeled down as he stared at the dry soil. He seemed to be searching for something.</br>
</br>
An ant caught his attention.</br>
</br>
It waved its tentacles, searching the ground for something. At the same time, a finger stopped in front of it. Its two tentacles touched it before the ant vanished from this world.</br>
</br>
The next second, the ant reappeared again, but it was no longer moving.</br>
</br>
"It still can't transport any live creatures?" Jiang Chen looked at the dead ant on his fingertips, deep in thought.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and dusted off his hand before he headed to Shenxiang.</br>
</br>
When he returned, Cheng Weiguo came over with a phone, looking helpless.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the phone and opened the hologram screen.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"General, the next time you want to do something dramatic like this, could you let us know first?" When the communications came through, Chu Nan's wry voice came from the other side.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I just wanted to give you a surprise." Jiang Chen laughed, completely oblivious.</br>
</br>
"It was quite a surprise." Chu Nan sighed as he continued to speak with the same wryness: "It would've been better if we could've brought the weapon out earlier. We only needed to launch a few into the city without the need to burn half of the city…"</br>
</br>
"Because I didn't have it at the time, or I hadn't transported them into Wanghai. Umm, was that it?" Jiang Chen changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"No, it has to do with the crystals." Chu Nan paused for a second before he continued, "According to the rules of the wasteland, the crystals of the mutants belong to whoever killed it. But we clearly don't have the capability to collect crystals from half the city."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then they will belong to whoever picks them up," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
When Chu Nan heard Jiang Chen's words, he took a moment to process them.</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem?" Jiang Chen spoke since Chu Nan didn't respond.</br>
</br>
"No, I just feel like… General, you're very generous." Chu Nan facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Rather than letting outsiders who heard the news pick up the crystals, it's better to let the survivors who fought together with us pick them up. All of Sixth Street is mine - do I care whose pockets the crystals are in? How about this: from Sixth Street to the outskirts of the city center, the crystals will belong to whoever picks them up." Jiang Chen was extremely generous.</br>
</br>
"Okay, but I think it's better to tax the crystals a certain percentage since you killed all the mutants yourself. I don't think the survivors would disagree. Without a tax, it's not good for a large number of crystals to suddenly appear on the market," Chu Nan suggested.</br>
</br>
"Then we'll follow your plan. I give you full authority to handle this."</br>
</br>
"Roger that." Chu Nan nodded.</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, just as Jiang Chen was going to return the phone to Cheng Weiguo, the phone rang again.</br>
</br>
Seeing the "Office of the General" on the hologram screen, Jiang Chen didn't need to think before he realized it was Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"Did you fire the rockets?" Just as the call went through, Han Junhua immediately spoke.</br>
</br>
"That's right, are you surprised?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Why didn't you use it earlier…"</br>
</br>
She had the same question as Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh. "That's enough, don't be greedy. I had to leave the base before being able to obtain them. What's the status at the base?"</br>
</br>
"Your rockets greatly alleviated the pressure. The areas five hundred meters out were all suppressed by the rockets. After the mutants behind the wall were cleared out, the soldiers on the wall watched some fireworks with protective masks on," Han Junhua reported concisely.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen laughed, delighted.</br>
</br>
The feeling of crushing his opponents was too delightful.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
At dusk the next day, at the rural area west of Wanghai:</br>
</br>
The broken limbs were visible on the wide road and the pungent smell of burnt flesh filled the streets. The broken ruins were stained with daunting darkness; it would take more than several drops of rain to wash it all away. It wasn't until they approached Fishbone base when the scenes from hell began to fade.</br>
</br>
Four bulldozers modified from trucks were working outside the wall as they pushed the corpses with crystals already extracted 1000 meters away to be burned.</br>
</br>
With the First Corps force appearing at the end of the street, the survivors working outside the wall began to cheer. They whistled and waved at the victors.</br>
</br>
On top of the Tiger II cannon, Jiang Chen carefully listened to the cheering from the crowd as he responded by waving back.</br>
</br>
The gates opened and allowed the First Division to storm in.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived, he didn't immediately head to his office. Instead, he chose to go home.</br>
</br>
After being gone for so long, Sun Jiao and the others must be worried.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen thought to himself, he couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
When he entered the mansion, he opened his arms to welcome Sun Jiao, who jumped toward him. After they kissed, he picked up the cute Yao Yao and pecked her adorable face.</br>
</br>
Her pale skin was colored red as Yao Yao lowered her head in embarrassment and said in a timid voice:</br>
</br>
"D-do you want to shower together?"</br>
</br>
When she reminisced the last time they showered together, her heart began to pump uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
But Sun Jiao authoritatively declared possession of Jiang Chen and spoke to Yao Yao with a smirk:</br>
</br>
"That's not okay, your Brother Jiang Chen will have to wash with me."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao made a face like she was wronged as she replied in a feeble voice:</br>
</br>
"Wha-what about tomorrow…"</br>
</br>
"How about the four of us shower together?" Sun Xiaorou hugged Yao Yao. "We can also teach Yao Yao the adult stuff…"</br>
</br>
"I-I'm not a kid anymore! I'm older than all of you!" Yao Yao protested as her cherry-like mouth pouted with displeasure.</br>
</br>
With arms crossed, Lin Lin interrupted on the side.</br>
</br>
"The time spent in the hibernation chambers does not count toward age. That was the rule in any country before the war."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's face turned red as she looked away.</br>
</br>
Only Lin Lin and she were born before the war.</br>
</br>
"Does Lin Lin want to come too? The five of us together?" With a little devil's smirk, Sun Xiaorou invited herself.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin blushed. Her mouth opened and closed for a while before finally squeezing out half a sentence:</br>
</br>
"Wh-who wants to do it together…"</br>
</br>
With her face completely flushed, Lin Lin walked out hastily.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gave her sister a harsh stare. "Xiaorou!"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou blew out her tongue and innocently hid behind Jiang Chen's back while pretending to be sad. "Brother-in-law, sister is bullying me…"</br>
</br>
As she said this, she hugged Jiang Chen's arm and began to shake him in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
Although it was a tempting proposal, Jiang Chen's conscience told him that if they showered together, something out of his realm of control could potentially occur.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped and acted like nothing happened.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, why don't you three shower together? I'll go after you're done…"</br>
</br>
Leaving before the girls could react, Jiang Chen slipped out of the living room.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 457: Regain Control from the Mutants</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Although Sun Jiao liked to bully people at times, she was a nice person by nature. Maybe it was because of the warmth of their little family, but it made her recall happy moments before she left the fallout shelter. This was why she was more considerate of family members than anyone else, particularly with considering how everyone felt.</br>
</br>
Although she declared possession of Jiang Chen, she told Jiang Chen before bedtime, "Yao Yao really misses you - go spend some time with her." She slipped back to her room and locked the door.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen was touched by how considerate Sun Jiao was, he didn't know how to feel with the door shut in front of him.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was indeed cute, but she was inedible.</br>
</br>
And that was not okay.</br>
</br>
The somewhat matured little loli would always subconsciously do something that would turn him on and he almost couldn't control himself.</br>
</br>
[Whatever, there is something I need to ask Yao Yao.] Jiang Chen turned around and headed to Yao Yao's room.</br>
</br>
He knocked on the door before he heard some noise from behind the door.</br>
</br>
"Ummm? It's already so late, is there anything to do?"</br>
</br>
With the door pushed open, he saw Yao Yao in loose pajamas. Judging by her wet hair, she must've just showered as the light scent of lilies blew in his face.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I have something to ask Yao Yao, is that okay?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Of course." With a sweet smile, Yao Yao walked to the door with light steps. "Come in."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tousled her hair and walked in.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the room. Because there was only one chair inside, Jiang Chen casually sat on the bed. Yao Yao blushed at the scene but still walked up and sat beside Jiang Chen, pretending nothing was amiss, before she secretly moved in Jiang Chen's direction.</br>
</br>
"Could you tell me what it is?"</br>
</br>
Because of her anxiety, her voice trembled slightly to the point where it was out of tune.</br>
</br>
With her nervousness, the little loli was unable to sit still. Jiang Chen wanted to laugh.</br>
</br>
He paused before he spoke.</br>
</br>
"It's about the phone. Could Yao Yao design a phone for me?"</br>
</br>
With a few imaginary question marks appearing above her head, the little girl didn't hear the words she wanted to hear. She paused.</br>
</br>
Realizing that she misinterpreted the situation, redness extended from her ears all the way to her neck.</br>
</br>
It took a while before Yao Yao recovered from her state of awkwardness. She spoke in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Phone? Is that the thing brother Jiang Chen showed me before?"</br>
</br>
It was a very distant memory, but Jiang Chen gave her a phone for reference.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, it's that type. If possible, could Yao Yao design a similar but more powerful phone?" Jiang Chen tried to make Yao Yao understand what he wanted as he used his hands to show the shape while explaining the functionality of the phone.</br>
</br>
</br>
Yao Yao listened and nodded attentively.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen was done, Yao Yao patted her small chest confidently.</br>
</br>
"Leave it up to me! Are two days okay?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Please!" Jiang Chen joyfully rubbed Yao Yao's head.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao closed her eyes as she enjoyed his caress while a sweet curvature appeared on her mouth.</br>
</br>
Seeing as it was late, Jiang Chen stood up and prepared to leave. But then he discovered a small hand feebly dragging onto his clothes.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Is there something else?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao looked away while she spoke timidly, "Umm, could Yao Yao make an unreasonable request?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
She retracted her hand while her face turned red again. Her fingers pointed toward each other.</br>
</br>
"Could-could we sleep together t-tonight?"</br>
</br>
Considering how adorable she looked, Jiang Chen felt like he was going to melt.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
Observing the gracefulness on Yao Yao's face, Jiang Chen was touched by her happiness. He leaned down and gently kissed her soft forehead.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao seemed to have noticed that kiss and moved her beautiful mouth before moving herself into a more comfortable position. She curled up like a small animal.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly got out of bed and covered Yao Yao with the blanket before he sneaked out of the room.</br>
</br>
He microwaved two buns in the kitchen then left the mansion.</br>
</br>
It was almost the end of August - the tail end of summer.</br>
</br>
Due to the radiation dust, mornings in the wasteland were usually cold, but the temperature during the next few days would be irregular. It was two days after the fire, yet there were still sparks that could be made out in the direction of the city center.</br>
</br>
The reality was different than what Cheng Weiguo imagined. Although there were no more combustible materials in Wanghai, the fat of the zombies and mutants provided an excellent source of fuel for the fire.</br>
</br>
When the thousand-degree fire evaporated all the water content inside, the entire Roshan was like a barrel of fuel burning continuously due to its high density of fat.</br>
</br>
Following the conclusion of the mutant flood and the return of the First Division, the quiet base became crowded again. The survivors returned to the surface. They were either reunited with family members who were part of the crusade or accepted the urns in mourning.</br>
</br>
There were fatalities with every war, an unpleasant point that could not be changed.</br>
</br>
And on the wasteland, death was to be expected.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived at his office, he was surprised to discover that Han Junhua was already in front of the table that belonged to the advisor. She was working on the tablet.</br>
</br>
"Did you sleep here last night?" Jiang Chen sat at his desk while looking at her.</br>
</br>
"No. Mhmm, precisely speaking, I didn't sleep. There was too much work yesterday, looking at fatality numbers as well as the war consumption figures from the logistics department, the compensation to the families of deceased soldiers, as well as the cleaning of mutant bodies and collection of crystals…"</br>
</br>
Only now did Jiang Chen notice the heavy eye bags on her face.</br>
</br>
No wonder she didn't look for him when he returned last night - she was too busy.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen expressed his gratitude.</br>
</br>
"It's okay." Han Junhua still wore the same expressionless look.</br>
</br>
"If you're tired, go take a nap first."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua half-heartedly agreed before stopping the task at hand and looked at Jiang Chen. "How many rockets are left?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged. "All of them are gone, a total of 40 thousand rounds. But now that the mutant flood is over, is there still a need for them?"</br>
</br>
Although he could certainly buy more, it was hard to prevent other people from noticing that he frequently purchased weapons that violated the Geneva Accords. If possible, it would be better to delay repurchasing until a later date.</br>
</br>
"All gone?" Han Junhua fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
The number of rockets should be limited since fuel was uncommon in the apocalypse before, let alone solid fuel rockets mixed with other chemicals. No one thought of using low-tech weapons to begin with.</br>
</br>
But to everyone's surprise, low-tech weapons were highly effective against mutants.</br>
</br>
After a short silence, she spoke again.</br>
</br>
"How much fuel can you obtain?"</br>
</br>
"A lot. Hmm?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"The technology required for that napalm rocket should be low. We could easily produce rockets with better combustion effectiveness and a high range."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua paused, looked at him in the eyes, and said sternly:</br>
</br>
"With fuel, it's not impossible for us to regain complete control of Wanghai from the mutants."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
[Regain control of Wanghai from the mutants?]</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it was a tempting proposal, and the current NAC certainly had the capability to do so.</br>
</br>
Wanghai from before the war wasn't only the center of PAC's economy; it was the industrial base for technology. If NAC could regain control of Wanghai, the speed in which the pre-war technologies could be recovered would be much faster.</br>
</br>
But then another problem had to be considered.</br>
</br>
The mutants did indeed threaten the lives of the survivors, but the crystals they provided were the foundation to survivor industries. The Sixth Street's power station required crystals, the fuel rod used for everything from vehicles to power stations required crystals. Survivors unable to obtain Helium-4 to produce nuclear fusion batteries had to use crystals to produce fuel rods with the same specification to provide power to pre-war equipment.</br>
</br>
Fallout Shelter 027 was currently using this fuel rod.</br>
</br>
The economy of the Sixth Street depended on Wanghai City as the hunting grounds. If the mutants inside the steel forest were wiped out, the hunters had to go further to hunt.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only debated for two minutes before he made a decision.</br>
</br>
Regain control of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
The reason was simple - going from hunting to farming was a necessary step to go from brute to civilized peoples. And the first step toward civilization was a step NAC must take one day. Jiang Chen wouldn't be able to provide food for this place forever. The current population of NAC was five digits, but what if it became six digits? What if it even exceeded the million mark?</br>
</br>
As to the farming problem, if he was willing to pay up, there were solutions available. It wasn't out of the realm of possibility to produce a closed biosphere through the Project Garden of Eden controlled by Lin Lin with NAC's resources.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a potential alternate source to obtain crystals, but to make it into a reality, he had to discuss it with the biologists in Fallout Shelter 027.</br>
</br>
After leaving the community center, Jiang Chen arrived at the empty plot of land belonging to the Aerospace Research Institute and managed to find Jiang Lin who just returned to the surface.</br>
</br>
It was quite funny as the guy was standing beside the BM-21 rocket that Jiang Chen bought with a wrench. The picture looked like a 21st-century modern rocket scientist studying the " firing crow 1  " from the Ming dynasty.</br>
</br>
A soldier standing nearby looked nervously at Jiang Lin, afraid he would take this thing apart.</br>
</br>
He didn't care if it was for research or not. As the launcher for the rockets, he just knew that this thing destroyed half a city of mutants and zombies, and the powerful explosion was still clear in his memory even after two days.</br>
</br>
"Did you figure something out?" Jiang Chen walked beside him and asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin nodded and exclaimed at the same time: "A straightforward design - primal, even - in both ignition and targeting system. The rocket has no guiding function, and it wipes out targets just by sheer strength. It damages creatures with the fuel and it proves that nothing is more effective than this against zombies and mutants. But to produce this, it must've been stressful for the logistics department."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously and didn't answer his question.</br>
</br>
[Funny, are logistics even a problem for me?]</br>
</br>
"There's certainly difficulty surrounding the logistics, but it's not unsolvable. I need you to design a rocket launcher that can launch multiple rockets simultaneously without impacting functionality. The only requirement is being able to send thirty kilograms of combat parts to a distance of thirty kilometers. It must have more power than this while having higher accuracy. Can you do that?"</br>
</br>
"That's easy. All that needs to be done is redesigning the boosting fuel and the contents of the explosive. The problem is the material itself - there's nothing harder to find than oil on the wasteland. If we can secure the materials, it's not difficult to produce the weapon you want." Jiang Lin nodded, paused, then asked a question as if he just remembered something: "Do we still need to produce the Dolphin-10 Ballistic Missiles?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. I have other uses for the nuclear missile." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin scratched the back of his head. "Okay, if you insist."</br>
</br>
After rocket production was assigned, crystal production was next on the agenda.</br>
</br>
Starting from the end of the mutant wave, Wang Zhaowu began to prepare to take the Second Corp back to Fallout Shelter 027. When Jiang Chen came out from the Aerospace Technology Research Institute, the Second Corp fleet was lined up at the front door while waiting for Wang Zhaowu's order to mobilize.</br>
</br>
"General." When Wang Zhaowu saw Jiang Chen, he saluted.</br>
</br>
"No need. Are you planning to head to Fallout Shelter 027?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, our soldiers are ready to mobilize."</br>
</br>
"Take me along," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Yes, Sir!" Wang Zhaowu nodded and immediately went to arrange a spot for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After ten minutes, the Second Corp fleet finally finished loading the supplies. With the gate open and the survivors waving farewell, the fleet gradually started to move.</br>
</br>
Burnt corpses were scattered along the road. When the fleet was halfway through the journey, Jiang Chen saw a Roshan kneeled in the middle of the road. Its face looked horrific, and its body was charcoal black. Its body was blocking the fleet, so the armored vehicle Jiang Chen was on turned its machine gun before a few shots broke the Roshan into charcoal blocks.</br>
</br>
Crushing the "charcoal dust," the fleet continued to move. The horrific scene along the road agitated Jiang Chen's stomach, but to the hardened apocalypse survivors, this was a common scene.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, inside the car, closed the observer screen before resting with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
It was an hour before the fleet finally arrived at the gate of the fallout shelter. When the rain of destruction was unleashed, the First Corp didn't leave this place pristine - the entire Camp 27 was stained black as if a blaze had swept through the place. But most of the supplies were moved underground, and the condition of the remaining concrete didn't matter much.</br>
</br>
When the gate opened, it was havoc.</br>
</br>
The zombies who smelled the scent of mutants didn't leave this place just because the Second Corp retreated. The ten-meter-high wall could tolerate a hill of hundreds of zombies.</br>
</br>
The corpses blocked the entrance to the elevator. The soldiers jumped off the car, put on protective masks, and worked with their shovels for a while before they finally cleared the charcoal dust piled at the elevator gate.</br>
</br>
"Damn, the First Corp really is ruthless." Wang Zhaowu got off the car with Jiang Chen as he cursed out while laughing.</br>
</br>
"They had to be ruthless, otherwise we would've had to face a bunch of zombies who could climb over the wall," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"True. But the engineering soldiers in the front certainly will have a lot of fun." Wang Zhaowu scoffed before leaving Jiang Chen and heading to the truck in the back.</br>
</br>
He needed to arrange for the redeployment of the fixed weapons. When they retreated, the machine guns and electromagnetic cannons were all moved into Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
At the same time, considering how atrocious the environment was inside the base, a deep cleaning was necessary before anyone could enter.</br>
</br>
Without disturbing the Second Corp's work, Jiang Chen headed in the direction of the fallout shelter elevator.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 459: Mutant Farm Project</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A blue light flashed and the elevator quickly descended to the bottom.</br>
</br>
A moment later, the red indicator light turned green and the elevator stopped at 1000 meters below the surface. Jiang Chen walked toward the entrance of the fallout shelter, typed in a few passwords, pulled out the cable from inside, and connected his EP.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen disconnected the cable and backed up two steps. Following a deep noise, the circular entrance in front of him began to shift to the side. At the back of the door, the director of Camp 27, Xu Lu, was already waiting there.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, she bowed down with a smile and led Jiang Chen into the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"The mutant flood is already over; you can arrange for personnel to return to the surface."</br>
</br>
"Already?" Xu Lu was slightly shocked, but it didn't take long before she returned to her smiling self. "I'll go prepare now."</br>
</br>
After saying goodbye to Xu Lu, Jiang Chen headed straight to the Robotic Research Facility in Fallout Shelter 027 along with the two soldiers behind him. He managed to find Fang Weixian, who was working on a blueprint.</br>
</br>
"General? How come you're here?" Fang Weixian pushed aside the tablet used to draw blueprints and greeted Jiang Chen with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I want to show you something and consult your opinion." Jiang Chen signaled behind him.</br>
</br>
The soldier nodded and put the two boxes in his hands on the table before returning to stand behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"This is...?" Fang Weixian raised his eyebrows, walked up to the box, and opened it.</br>
</br>
When he saw the contents, he took a moment to process before he was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Kinetic skeleton… Gauss Rifle?!"</br>
</br>
"It's a kinetic skeleton with optical illusions," Jiang Chen added.</br>
</br>
With interest flashing in his eyes, Fang Weixian first searched among the broken pieces of the kinetic skeleton before glancing at the broken Gauss Rifle.</br>
</br>
"I want you to recreate the technology - can you do it?"</br>
</br>
"I can give it a shot; it shouldn't be hard." Fang Weixian first moved the two boxes beside a scanner. "Scan the part composition and replicate the lost parts then use a quantum computer to simulate the design plan to finally establish the production process."</br>
</br>
"Is it possible to produce these on a large scale?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It's going to be difficult." Fang Weixian shook his head. "A lot of things must be recycled. For example, for the Type-50 Electromagnetic Pulse Cannon at the base, a lot of parts can't be produced. Without recycling the parts, we can only print the parts using a 3D printer."</br>
</br>
The 22nd century 3D printing technology was extremely mature without the durability, precision, and limitations in materials faced in the early 21st century. But even then, 3D printing technology was still an expensive technology. For example, a Reaper Assault Rifle manufactured from a military production line would have a price of less than ten thousand USD, but if 3D technology was used to the print the rifle, the cost would be at least six figures, and producing it on a mass scale would not lower the cost.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the wasteland, with the collapse of the industrial process, the survivors printed parts unable to be produced with 3D printing technology. Just like with the T-3 power armor, out of the ten thousand parts, at least six thousand were printed by 3D printing then assembled by hand. It was a large factor leading to the high cost of the power armor.</br>
</br>
"What would the cost be to equip one Gauss Rifle per power armor?" Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
"The majority of the cost would be power consumption and material usage if everything is printed by 3D printing… It would be 4000 crystals per rifle. The Miniature High Energy Capacitor and acceleration track have high requirements for materials." Fang Weixian provided an estimate.</br>
</br>
[Damn, it's close to half the cost for T-3 power armor.] Jiang Chen was shocked by the figure.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen deliberated for a moment before he said, "Regardless, first recreate the technology. It's fine for it to be a bit expensive."</br>
</br>
Other than a potential application in the aerospace field, the Gauss Rifle was particularly effective against power armor. Its penetration power and stability could not be matched by traditional rifles.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the status of armored vehicle production inside the Robotic Research Institute before he left, not wishing to disturb the researchers inside any longer.</br>
</br>
Leaving the Robotic Research Institute, Jiang Chen then headed to the Biology Research Institute not far away and found the biologists unpopular at the fallout shelter. When Jiang Chen walked inside, he saw a bunch of scientists in white lab coats all surrounding a vial with daunting excitement on their faces.</br>
</br>
As to the reason why it was daunting, it was because they acted like science freaks from cartoons.</br>
</br>
The study of life had always been a taboo in the science field as its danger was no less than advanced artificial intelligence. But on the wasteland, research laws were no longer in effect and hence, they had the opportunity to allow their creativity to flow.</br>
</br>
"What're you looking at it?" Jiang Chen walked up to Wang Fangping and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
Wang Fangping jumped. It wasn't until he saw Jiang Chen that he smiled. "General, we completed the electricity-producing seaweed project."</br>
</br>
"Completed?" Jiang Chen stopped to think for a second before a joyful expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
For Xin to develop its tourism, they had to decrease the number of coal-powered power stations. But due to the low efficiency of wind and solar energy, the high cost of tidal energy, and the reluctance to use nuclear energy, Jiang Chen maintained a strong interest in the biological power generation Wang Fangping proposed.</br>
</br>
Not only was it environmentally friendly, but it was also cheap, and the one thing a Pacific country didn't lack was ocean territory.</br>
</br>
"This is it." Wang Fangping moved aside and pointed at the vial in the middle.</br>
</br>
Inside the yellowish-green vial was a piece of floating three-meter-long seaweed with a UV light hanging above the seaweed. The note on the side recorded the ratio between light levels and power generation.</br>
</br>
"It can be grown 100 meters below the surface with maximum power generation of 1-kilowatt of power per square meter. The tip of the seaweed can be attached to a metal wire and transports the electricity to the transformer on the surface before becoming part of the grid." Wang Fangping pointed at the device and explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with pleasure. "Great, you did well. All researchers who participated in the project will be awarded 1000 crystals each!"</br>
</br>
All nine scientists in the facility turned ecstatic.</br>
</br>
A NAC knight's monthly salary was merely 50 crystals, so 1000 crystals was a large sum of wealth. Jiang Chen would never be stingy on his investment in research.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, General!" Wang Fangping thanked Jiang Chen with sincerity.</br>
</br>
"No need, I'll generously reward anyone who contributes to the NAC. Also, I still need you to do something: I need you to breed a type of mutant that isn't hostile, easy to breed, and quickly able to produce crystals." Jiang Chen brought up the primary purpose of his visit.</br>
</br>
Since he was certain he was going to "clean up" Wanghai, the source of the crystals would have to come from elsewhere.</br>
</br>
He would make all the hunters transform into mercenaries guarding the merchant fleet, then change the source of crystals from the "hunting ground" to a farm and establish food production at the Garden of Eden.</br>
</br>
`Jiang Chen already had the blueprint drawn out in his mind, and the first step to completing the plan was to find the best-suited mutants as livestock.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
To help the Biology Research Institute with researching mutants, Jiang Chen ordered Xu Lu to establish an area to house the mutants outside of Camp 27's walls. The area would support research intended to genetically modify the mutants while conducting breeding tests. As for the task of capturing mutants, Jiang Chen assigned the task to the Hunter Corp.</br>
</br>
With the support of the helicopter and power armor, aside from the difficulty in capturing Death Claw, other mutants were relatively easy to catch.</br>
</br>
All experiments would be done outside the walls. Any mutants who escaped would be killed by machine guns and electromagnetic cannons on the wall which prevented uncontrollable circumstances from arising.</br>
</br>
After all this, Jiang Chen returned to Fishbone base via helicopter.</br>
</br>
When he returned, Jiang Chen headed to the warehouse and moved a set of T-3 power armor, kinetic skeleton, and Reaper Assault Rifle into his storage dimension. After all this, only a laser sword would fit inside the three hundred cubic meter dimension. Emptiness in the storage dimension didn't make Jiang Chen feel safe.</br>
</br>
Heading to the city center would still require a period of preparation before their mission could be executed - whether it was designing the rocket launcher or producing ammo at the base, it all required time to complete.</br>
</br>
The crystals on the ground would especially need people to pick them up.</br>
</br>
Therefore, after Jiang Chen and Han Junhua had a discussion, the attack on the city center was set for mid-September.</br>
</br>
The reproductive cycle of creatures wasn't short; even a month after the rain of destruction, the number of mutants and zombies didn't increase substantially.</br>
</br>
Seeing as he didn't need to assist with anything else, Jiang Chen returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
The 20 days were almost up as he was eager to see the results of the construction robots. He needed to solve the mining problem as soon as possible so Future Mining could officially start its business and virtual reality helmets could then be manufactured.</br>
</br>
Leaving his mansion on Coro Island, he went to a telecommunication store along the way. While he reactivated a new SIM card, Jiang Chen purchased a new phone.</br>
</br>
Although Yao Yao was designing a phone for him, he still needed a phone in the meantime. In such a digitalized world, being without a phone practically meant being back in the primal age.</br>
</br>
After all the troublesome things were dealt with, Jiang Chen took a boat and arrived on Coconut Island. Just as he approached the island, he discovered from afar that the dock built along the shore was completed.</br>
</br>
The primary structure was reinforced concrete with the top covered by metal roofing. The interior was a concaved water trench. Compared to the hundred-meter-long dry dock, the small dock could only be described as tiny.</br>
</br>
</br>
But despite its miniature size, it possessed all the functionality of a dock. And if there was a need in the future, it could be expanded further.</br>
</br>
He dragged the boat onto the dock and headed to where the construction materials were stored.</br>
</br>
The two construction robots were in standby mode where the materials were stored. After they completed the construction mission, they automatically entered hibernation.</br>
</br>
The reinforced steel, anti-corrosion concrete, and sand were mostly consumed, the explosives used to blow up the shore were all gone, and the six fuel rods used as batteries were depleted. After he placed all the remaining construction materials back into the storage dimension, Jiang Chen walked to the drone terminal among the trees.</br>
</br>
The bee nest-shaped drone terminal quietly laid there with most of the drones charging on standby mode; only a small portion hovered near the beach outside the forest.</br>
</br>
He connected the cable to his EP and checked the reconnaissance reports of the drones. After he confirmed that no one approached the island, Jiang Chen removed the cable and headed to the dock.</br>
</br>
He opened the dock door before he saw the deepwater submersible floating on the surface.</br>
</br>
The length, width, and height were nine meters, three meters, and four meters respectively. The waterdrop-like design had a smooth surface.</br>
</br>
The rear end was embedded with a "T" shaped structure, the inlets on both ends allowed water to be fed into the engine without interruption, while the back-end nozzle jet pressurized water. The tail tilt of the shell produced a water pressure squeeze effect, and the dual effect of the water jet propulsion gave the submersible the speed of victory over all the submarines.</br>
</br>
The "Droplet" had two pairs of mechanical arms installed in the front, capable of conducting deepwater construction as part of the construction module. An eight-meter cylindrical device hung on the bottom as part of the mining module. The construction robots assembled all parts and were operational once charged.</br>
</br>
The submersible consumed electric power designed to fit the 100mmm nuclear fusion battery, but due to a lack of nuclear material, Droplet used crystal fuel rod.</br>
</br>
The submersible's built-in molten salt electrolytic carbon dioxide reduction device meant that in theory, as long as sufficient power was present, it could maintain a normal water supply in the submersible.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen jumped on top of Droplet. While he felt it sway under his feet, Jiang Chen carefully kneeled down and finally found a camera-like device on top.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved closer then spoke in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Initiate."</br>
</br>
"Iris verification passed. Welcome, captain."</br>
</br>
A crack appeared one meter away from Jiang Chen before exposing a way inside the submersible.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved closer. After confirming its safety, he jumped inside.</br>
</br>
"It is transparent? No… should just be an optical effect."</br>
</br>
When he entered the cabin, Jiang Chen scanned his surroundings in shock.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that viewing the outside from the inside was easy - it looked transparent.</br>
</br>
[Wide angle imaging?]</br>
</br>
By hiding some full-angle cameras on the outside of the submersible, external images were presented on the screen in the cabin. Standing in this submersible felt like being inside a huge transparent bubble.</br>
</br>
After exclaiming at the magnificent image, Jiang Chen passed through a narrow hatch and entered the cockpit.</br>
</br>
Most parts of this submersible were printed by 3D printing, costing more than half a million crystals. But when he saw everything inside, he didn't feel it was a high cost at all.</br>
</br>
"Captain, please name the submersible." The courteous digital voice instructed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After deliberating, he said:</br>
</br>
"Droplet."</br>
</br>
Because the exterior looked like a droplet of water, it was Droplet then.</br>
</br>
"Great, Droplet at your service. Captain, please follow the instruction manual…"</br>
</br>
Without complicated operating procedures and with the help of basic artificial intelligence, even a single person could operate the piloting system that normally demanded the cooperation of multiple people. There were controlling rods at the captain's seat - one was responsible for controlling the XY axis while the other controlled the Z axis. Beside them was a series of other instruments.</br>
</br>
Other than manual control, it could be set in automatic control mode as well. Based on the map stored inside the deepwater submersible, the captain could control through a tablet or voice.</br>
</br>
Once Jiang Chen familiarized himself with the controls, he immediately used the terminal to instruct the submersible to submerge.</br>
</br>
With the low noise of water breaking, the entire submersible plummeted below the vast ocean surface outside the dock. Needless to say, it was more fun compared to being on a boat. With the waves splashing, the waves looked as if they could hit him since the cabin was transparent.</br>
</br>
He felt as if he was surfing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately ordered as he stared at the waves disappearing.</br>
</br>
"Submerge, 100 meters."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The digital voice spoke out before Droplet began to submerge. Just like submerging a person's head into the water, the sound of the waves instantly vanished.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen observed the instruments next to his hand as the symbol signaling depth continuously flashed before finally stopping at the 100-meter mark.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in his mind as Jiang Chen set the coordinates of Future Mining's mining platform as well as a depth of 7000 meters.</br>
</br>
With excitement in his voice, he said:</br>
</br>
"Droplet, set sail!"</br>
</br>
"Roger, captain."</br>
</br>
Into the deep eerie ocean, Droplet plunged down.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 461: Deepwater Construction</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Due to the shape of Droplet, it had faced no resistance when traversing in the water. It could move through fifty meters in the blink of an eye with the instrumentation showing a speed of</br>
</br>
"Damn, just from pure speed, it could easily defeat the fastest submarine in the world." With the ocean soaring under his feet, Jiang Chen couldn't help but exclaim at its magnificence.</br>
</br>
He remembered that the fastest submarine in the world is the Russian K Class Ballistic Nuclear Submarine with its highest speed reaching 44.7 knots. And the speed of Droplet could achieve a daunting 75 knots.</br>
</br>
He was wondering how the rumored superconducting magnetic fluid submarine faired against his "ride."</br>
</br>
The jagged trenches were filled with swaying seaweed. The colorful fishes freely roamed amongst them. The jellyfish and eel danced under the rhythm of the bubble. All the scenes were captured on the walls of the Droplet.</br>
</br>
Other than that, Jiang Chen saw a shark.</br>
</br>
When the Droplet passed by it, the giant seemed to have ignored the Droplet as it turned its body and instantly disappeared from Jiang Chen's field of vision.</br>
</br>
Following gradually increasing depth, the light from the surface began to fade, and the claustrophobic feeling from the dark blue eeriness was more and more apparent. Jiang Chen was uncertain if he had deep sea phobia, but he still closed the wide-angle cameras and only left the four visual windows in the four directions open.</br>
</br>
"Droplet, where are we now?"</br>
</br>
"We are still 100 nautical miles away from our destination."</br>
</br>
[100 nautical miles, or around one hour?]</br>
</br>
Seeing that there was still some time, Jiang Chen headed to the living quarters.</br>
</br>
The living quarters were compacted together with two beds with nylon hooks on each side of the room. If the beds were lifted up, the table and closet underneath would appear. Jiang Chen examined the interior of the submarine before he instructed the submersible to wake up him once they reached their targeted location. Then he stuffed himself into the sleeping bed to take a nap.</br>
</br>
One hour later, with gentle music, Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
When he got off the bed and returned to the cockpit, he looked toward the control panel before his eyes widen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
7500 meters under the surface?</br>
</br>
The dark abyss where life is restricted.</br>
</br>
In the entire area, only a light beam shining from the front of the Droplet remained. The black and shiny rocky surface reflected the faint light under the light beam. The disturbed creatures nesting on the surface scattered before they escaped to the darkness nearby.</br>
</br>
Other than the odd-looking deep sea creatures, the cracks on the bottom of the ocean constantly spat out scorching air bubbles. The dark red light was just like a volcano, possessing an incredible amount of energy.</br>
</br>
</br>
At the same time, a ten meter long, flat-shaped fish slowly moved toward Droplet. The disc-shaped head had no visible eyes, and the nail-like teeth looked horrifying. It curiously examined the Droplet and even used its mouth to touch it. But it quickly swam away as if it was electrocuted without turning its head.</br>
</br>
The static electricity on the surface of the Droplet would make most of the deep sea creatures lose their interest. The design was put in place to protect and ensure the safety of the submersible while also there to protect the safety of the creatures.</br>
</br>
Without playing further, Jiang Chen manually controlled the Droplet based on the mining deposition marked on the map and moved to the top of the rich molybdenum manganese nodules.</br>
</br>
"Initiate mining module." After confirming the targeted location, Jiang Chen order.</br>
</br>
"Roger, Mr. Captain." The artificial intelligence politely answered.</br>
</br>
Immediately, the circular tube below the Droplet separated out. A trial of air bubbles dispersed out from behind the circular tube and pushed the torpedo-shaped tube to the targeted deposition.</br>
</br>
100 meters.</br>
</br>
50 meters.</br>
</br>
10 meters.</br>
</br>
The light locked onto the circular tube as Jiang Chen stared at the scene without blinking.</br>
</br>
The black rock was embedded into the greyish black mudstone similar to a road built with pebbles. The circular tube stooped above the black rock with the engine stalling.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the map on the screen; the green dot that marked the location of the submersible coincided with the red dot on the mining map.</br>
</br>
After a brief paused, Jiang Chen ordered affirmatively, "Mining module, deploy!"</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Bubbles appeared from the bottom of the circular tube as a graphene hook shot toward the bottom of the sea. The cable tightened and slowly dragged the circular tube toward the ground and stopped three meters before reaching the surface.</br>
</br>
The circular tube gradually deployed with the hatch door on the two sides extended out to release two rocket-like items. The rocket was five meters in length and one meter in diameter, the tail was connected to the inner circular tube with a graphene tunnel.</br>
</br>
The two rockets were released from the circular tube, and the head immediately dove down with a series of water bubbles propelling it from behind, pushing the rockets down into the sea.</br>
</br>
The rockets' head pierced into the rock body.</br>
</br>
Then an almost miraculous scene happened.</br>
</br>
The tail of the rocket popped out, while it created more air bubbles, just like an umbrella opening, it expanded into a circular disc with a radius of ten meters. The disc slowly descended and clipped onto the flat sea surface.</br>
</br>
From afar, it was just like a circular tube connecting two bowls flipped upside down with graphene tubes.</br>
</br>
"Mining module deployed, please deploy transportation module."</br>
</br>
The courteous digital voice sounded again and brought Jiang Chen back from being shocked by the technology.</br>
</br>
The transportation module was four graphene cables and an oval-shaped ascending device. Because of the size of the equipment, Jiang Chen didn't bring it aboard the submersible. Since he had the storage dimension, it was easy to bring things under water.</br>
</br>
With Droplet stalling, Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse and headed to the backyard of the mansion. The place stored his Dolphin-10, a bunch of graphene cables from the Sixth Street factory.</br>
</br>
Under the deep sea environment, 7000 meters under, normal materials could not withstand the water pressure. Therefore, graphene played a key role.</br>
</br>
After putting everything into the storage dimension, Jiang Chen returned to the Droplet.</br>
</br>
With a hand pressed against the hatch door, his consciousness submerged into the storage dimension. It didn't take long before the graphene cables were deployed outside of the submersible.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen traveled a few more times between the modern world and the apocalypse and released all the construction material outside of the Droplet.</br>
</br>
He ordered the Droplet to restart again, and the smart system began to connect the graphene cables together with the floatation markers, using the blueprint stored in the mining module.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to do anything after. With five hours remaining of construction time, Jiang Chen yawned and returned to the living quarters.</br>
</br>
The artificial intelligence will take over.</br>
</br>
As the captain, he only needed to take a nap. And once construction was completed, he could return home.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 462: Future Mining in Production</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The 7000 meters track was just like a strand of seaweed that swayed with the ocean current.</br>
</br>
The 500 meters long graphene track connected on both ends by Titanium rings; 14 tracks in total formed the 7000 meters deep sea stairs from the abyss to the surface.</br>
</br>
The entire track cost 500 million crystals, almost equivalent to the entire food trade revenue of NAC.</br>
</br>
Out of all the equipment, the most expensive was the 15 titanium rings. They not only play a role in fixing the graphene tracks, but they could also freely control the depth of water just like submarines. Based on the direction of the ocean current, the titanium ring can also move through the four angles of the blade engine to move in the opposite direction. This prevents the huge tidal force from tearing the entire graphene track apart.</br>
</br>
When the Droplet placed the six meters long, two meters wide oval "elevator" at the bottom of the track, the entire deep ocean mining module was completely deployed.</br>
</br>
The two suction discs underwater would shred the rocks on the surface and use the graphene tube to transport the broken pieces into the "circular tube". Based on the selection, the circular tube would crash the rocks into finer particles. Mudstones with low hardness would be crashed into particles and released into the ocean through a mesh net. The higher hardness molybdenum nodules would pass through the selection and be sent to the "elevator" to the top.</br>
</br>
When the elevator was filled with minerals, the graphene track would be powered up. The entire oval would be sent to the surface like the shell of the electromagnetic cannon.</br>
</br>
Once the minerals reached 100 meters below the surface, the modern equipment would be able to retrieve the minerals.</br>
</br>
The workers on the platform would send out retrieving boats based on signals from below the sea. Then scuba divers with nets would be able to bring the minerals up.</br>
</br>
Once the minerals on the platform accumulated to a certain point, a boat would transport the minerals to the manganese nodule refiner on Ange Island. By that time, Xin would no longer need to depend on import for its consumption of iron, molybdenum, and manganese.</br>
</br>
After all this, Jiang Chen deployed two 3D printed tidal current power generators at the surface of the sea to provide electricity to the mining equipment.</br>
</br>
With the cost of the Droplet included, the equipment totaled more than seven million crystals.</br>
</br>
Although it was expensive, Jiang Chen knew the investment was well worth it.</br>
</br>
Just from the market price of ten crystals for one kilogram of molybdenum ore in Sixth Street, 700 tons would allow breakeven.</br>
</br>
Moreso, the deposition at the surface of the ocean floor had more than one million tons!</br>
</br>
The entire mining equipment would support mining operations for ten years without a problem.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to Coconut Island, Jiang Chen phoned Yang Yuan and told him about the mining operation.</br>
</br>
"The problem with deep sea mining is solved?" When Yang Yuan heard that he could send people to the platform now, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
"That's right. I will provide you with the mining steps through email. A transportation boat, a retrieving boat, two scuba divers, one observer, that's about all." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan raised his eyebrows in skepticism.</br>
</br>
"But how do you retrieve the ore from the deep sea? Don't tell me you're going to tell the scuba divers to chisel it 7500 meters below the surface."</br>
</br>
"Do you think I'm dumb?" Jiang Chen scoffed jokingly, "Don't worry, I took care of it. I will send it to you by email, and you'll know how the entire mining device functions. It's the top technology of Future Group, don't be too shocked."</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan glanced at his phone.</br>
</br>
[Funny, I'm a graduate student from West Australia University and a top student that signed with Rio Tinto in my first year as a student. What type of equipment haven't I seen?]</br>
</br>
It was the first time he heard that something could retrieve ores from 7000 meters below the sea.</br>
</br>
"Okay, send me the email first."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, wait."</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen hung up and sent out the email that included visualization of the mining equipment through a digital file.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan held onto the phone for half a minute before he heard a buzz; the email came through.</br>
</br>
He opened the email with skepticism and began to scan the document Jiang Chen sent.</br>
</br>
He was first questioning the mining equipment as he thought his boss didn't consult with him before purchasing and that he must have been fooled by a fake company.</br>
</br>
But when he was halfway through the document, he shocked state was more and more apparent.</br>
</br>
"This, this is impossible. What kind of joke is? Are we shooting a sci-fi film?" With his finger continually sliding on the screen, Yang Yuan muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Nothing else, just the circular tube mining device, even if it was built with titanium, it was hard to prevent it to be squashed into a ball by the immense water pressure by operating for an extended period in the deep ocean. And that bowl-shaped mining device, it didn't look like it was designed to withstand pressure at all.</br>
</br>
And the long graphene track…</br>
</br>
With the current material, technology level, it was impossible to make this mining equipment a reality.</br>
</br>
Yang Yaun's finger moved furiously and slid down the document. The operation of the employees on the platform was outlined in detail in the document.</br>
</br>
When he saw the last line, he stopped.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan suddenly realized that the mining equipment was the work of Future Group.</br>
</br>
"How many more secrets does this guy hold?' Yang Yuan shook his head.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, Yang Yuan deleted the document as required based on the warning on the last line.</br>
</br>
He got up and headed for the door.</br>
</br>
"Yuan, are you leaving?" Su Fei, who was in the kitchen preparing dinner, spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, its work related." Yang Yuan hastily put on his shoes and headed out.</br>
</br>
Although he could arrange employees through the phone, he couldn't wait to personally see the mining equipment. It was unbelievable. Without seeing it with his very own eyes, he wouldn't be able to sleep.</br>
</br>
Su Fei looked at her boyfriend rushing out the door as well as the shoes messily scattered on the ground, she let out a sigh and put the bowl she was working with on the kitchen counter.</br>
</br>
Although she was first excited when she arrived, there was a mansion, a beach, endless amount of champagne and seafood. But after a while, she thought the life far away from the noise of the city was different than the life she envisioned.</br>
</br>
She washed her hand and went to the bedroom on the second floor to scroll through her Weibo.</br>
</br>
Only when she saw her friends in the country's envious replies could she satisfy her vanity a bit.</br>
</br>
But just as she was scrolling through Weibo, she noticed an unread private message.</br>
</br>
"Who is it?"</br>
</br>
She murmured to herself and opened the text bubble.</br>

</br>
After sending the email to Yang Yuan, Jiang Chen left Coconut Island on a boat.</br>
</br>
As to the Droplet, he left it on the island. With the Hummingbird drones guarding the place, he was confident about the security of the place. Even if an elite special force landed on the island, the hundred something drones would easily wipe them out.</br>
</br>
Without the support of the EMP weapons, the small and agile drones are the nightmare of any creature.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived on Coro Island, it was getting dark. He touched his empty stomach while thinking about the empty mansion as a wry smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
He missed Ayesha's cooking.</br>
</br>
It was late. Even if he returned to the apocalypse now, Sun Jiao and the rest must be done with dinner too.</br>
</br>
"Whatever, I will just grab something to eat."</br>
</br>
Since he drove to the city center area, a few restaurants were around him. He parked the car and found a Chinese restaurant.</br>
</br>
He ordered a few dishes before he began to play with his phone out of boredom. The phone he just bought had nothing inside. After using the restaurant's Wi-Fi to download Future 1.0, he scanned his iris with the camera and logged into his account.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was syncing the contacts on Future 1.0 to his new phone, he suddenly noticed a name.</br>
</br>
With a smile on his face, seeing there was still sometime before the dishes arrived, he pressed on the name and called.</br>
</br>
"Hello? You finally remember me?" The phone went through, and it was Liu Yao's voice, full of resentment.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I've been busy, do you miss me?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I miss you so much." Liu Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
"Your movie is finished?"</br>
</br>
"Finished two months ago, the editing was done last month. It has been sent in for review, and the release schedule has been proposed already. Our director also asked me to see if you could give the movie a headline." As Liu Yao said this, she couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
The achievement she has today was all because of the man behind her. Among the cast, even the leading actresses respected her when they spoke without acting superior to her, and even called her sister.</br>
</br>
This was something she couldn't even imagine before.</br>
</br>
She was an intelligent woman. Although the intelligence was sometimes not used at the right place, she knew that he didn't mind as long as they didn't make principle mistakes. And because of this, even if she received her position today, she didn't feel any arrogance. She knew that the people that looked at her in awe were not actually looking at her, but the man behind her.</br>
</br>
Even if a lot of actors wanted to pursue her to use the paparazzi to increase their publicity, she rejected without hesitation. A lot of actresses without much fame did everything to get close to her to connect with Jiang Chen, and she smartly deflected all the requests.</br>
</br>
</br>
She was already holding onto a firm leg. She didn't need to mind what other people thought, she just needed to hold onto the leg tighter.</br>
</br>
"Headline? No problem."</br>
</br>
It was easy for him since he was the biggest investor in the film.</br>
</br>
"Love you, mua."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mood felt more cheerful listening to her coyness.</br>
</br>
Not only did she have big breasts, Liu Yao's voice and vibe all cast liveliness. She was already 24, but whenever he saw her, she gave Jiang Chen the feeling that she was only 17.</br>
</br>
"Are you free?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Yes, do you want to take me out traveling?" Holding onto the phone, Liu Yao said in excitement.</br>
</br>
"I'm inviting you to visit my island." Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao seemed to have heard the smirk in Jiang Chen's voice as her face turned red, "Pervert."</br>
</br>
But rather than rejecting, she sounded excited.</br>
</br>
Since the experience Jiang Chen brought her was always so addicting.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to book a flight for you?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"No need, I already got paid! Eight million! I will treat you to a nice dinner."</br>
</br>
"I gave it to you." Jiang Chen rolled his eyes.</br>
</br>
Eight million was enough for a superstar. The top actress in Hua was paid eight million per film; her pay was the top ten. Normally speaking, the supporting actresses' pay never exceeded the leading actresses' pay.</br>
</br>
But Liu Yao was an exception, the investors paid her directly.</br>
</br>
"Don't say it like that. It is my first time receiving so much." Liu Yao pouted coyly.</br>
</br>
"Ok, ok, ok, up to you," Jiang Chen smiled, "Also, do you have a digital version of the film?"</br>
</br>
"Digital version? Yes, but why do you need that?' Liu Yao was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Get me a copy of it for collection purposes."</br>
</br>
Collection? Liu Yao skeptically tilted her head.</br>
</br>
There was no way the director would agree to make a digital copy of the film before the film was released. But since Jiang Chen was the only investor in the film and spent one hundred million and the director was not particularly famous, the director would not reject his request.</br>
</br>
"Okay. But you can't upload it online. If it is leaked, it will impact the box office," Liu Yao pleaded in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I spent my money on it, why would I let other people watch for free." Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was more assured as she began to giggle.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! You're the best! Also, could you tell me what you're going to do with the digital version?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled with mysteriousness.</br>
</br>
"Of course I'll watch it with you."</br>
</br>
"Watch it with me?" Although she was delighted that Jiang Chen wanted to watch her film, Liu Yao still tilted her head feeling puzzled, "Didn't we say we are going to watch it in theaters? The experience of the digital version is not as good as the actual theatre right?"</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I have a home theatre in my mansion, six million AUD. The experience is no less than a movie theatre." Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's smirk made Liu Yao slightly "unsettled" as she frowned .</br>
</br>
"Watch it in a home theatre… I think you are planning something naughty."</br>
</br>
"Could you not guess it?" Jiang Chen pretended to be shocked.</br>
</br>
"I can't guess it." Liu Yao shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Then let me give you a hint. When the movie is playing, you sit on me." Jiang Chen laughed mischievously.</br>
</br>
With his teasing tone, Liu Yao's face instantly turned red and immediately understood what this pervert was thinking.</br>
</br>
"You're so perverted!"</br>
</br>
"Eh? Why do I sense you sound excited?" Jiang Chen didn't mind the waiter bringing the dishes look at him strangely.</br>
</br>
"Leave me alone. I'm going to book now."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao hung up.</br>
</br>
[Book now? Her body is more honest than her words.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down his phone in a pleasant mood and began to enjoy the dinner in front of him.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 464: For Our Friendship</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was working on his dinner, a blonde beauty suddenly sat across from him.</br>
</br>
Without raising his head, Jiang Chen knew who it was.</br>
</br>
"How did you know I was eating here?"</br>
</br>
"You definitely didn't notice that the Russian embassy is on the next street, and how eye-catching your Lamborghini is parked on the side of the road." Natasha grinned and asked the waiter to bring her a bowl of rice.</br>
</br>
"I remember that Russians live off of bread, are you okay with eating rice?" Jiang Chen glanced at the bowl in front of her.</br>
</br>
"No worries. Before I came here to work, I learned about the culture." Showing off, Natasha picked up the chopsticks and spun them between her fingers.</br>
</br>
[Would ordinary people play with chopsticks before they eat?] Jiang Chen mocked in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Is there something you need?" Jiang Chen was direct.</br>
</br>
"Nothing in particular, can I not just ask you to treat me?" Natasha also asked the waiter to bring two bottles of beer.</br>
</br>
"Are you not afraid of getting a beer belly?' Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"Are you caring about my body?" Natasha giggled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked away.</br>
</br>
[This girl is seducing me again.]</br>
</br>
"Also, could you let me play with your virtual reality helmet?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you say you just want me to treat you?"</br>
</br>
"Can we not talk about this topic as friends?" Natasha took a gulp of beer.</br>
</br>
"Of course, once the Phantom is officially released, I will gift you one personally."</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen wasn't planning to disclose any information, Natasha sighed.</br>
</br>
"Okay, the Kremlin wants me to learn more about how advanced your virtual reality technology is… Don't be mistaken, the only reason I ask this is that we are somewhat disconnected from the world in this area. But even if I ask, you won't tell me right?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." To Natasha straightforwardness, Jiang Chen was extremely pleased.</br>
</br>
Natasha rolled her eyes as she picked up a piece of meat and sent to her red lips. With every movement, it looked seductive. So Jiang Chen's choice was to not look at her to avoid being distracted.</br>
</br>
"What about the nutrient supply?" Natasha continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"Nutrient supply? Kremlin would be interested in nutrient supply?" Jiang Chen laughed out.</br>
</br>
"Precisely speaking, the Ministry of Defense and Department of Aerospace are both interested. Because we tried your nutrient supply, although it is not filling, we surprisingly discovered that we wouldn't po-"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, we are eating." Jiang Chen coughed to remind her.</br>
</br>
Natasha immediately realized and changed her wordings.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… You don't produce any waste."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her and continued to work on the delicacies on his plate.</br>
</br>
"So?"</br>
</br>
"We want to work with you to develop a nutrient supply that's convenient to carry, capable of maintaining people's energy, and won't po-, produce waste in critical times." Natasha put down her chopsticks, put an elbow on the table, and smiled at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
"A nutrient supply that's convenient to carry, and would allow the soldiers to obtain enough calories without the need to number two in critical times?" Jiang Chen put down his chopsticks and wiped his mouth with a napkin.</br>
</br>
"And astronauts. With nutrient supply as food, we could save space and remove the waste disposal unit." Seeing Jiang Chen was done, Natasha directly began to talk business.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, we already developed this, so we don't need to work with you," Jiang Chen sighed, "But I personally have a cautious attitude to the military necessities market. This thing is just like poop, it is hard to wash off after you get it on your hands."</br>
</br>
"It is only military necessities and not a tool for killing, you don't need to be so sensitive." Natasha sighed, "Just like a tech company, Google, they still design robotic dogs for the UA army for transportation."</br>
</br>
When he heard Natasha's words, he fell into silence.</br>
</br>
After a long pause, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"How are you planning to partner up?"</br>
</br>
"Three plans. First, sell your technology to us, and promise that it won't be released to a third party. We'll purchase it at one hundred million USD."</br>
</br>
"Too low, I don't want to sell it."</br>
</br>
Other than too low, the organic boiler that's used in manufacturing of the nutrient supply possessed too many advanced technologies. Just with a particle filter inside, it is something that current technology cannot achieve. The recipe for the nutrient supply itself is not expensive; the expensiveness comes from the technology used to produce it.</br>
</br>
Natasha was not surprised by Jiang Chen's response. She put up a second finger.</br>
</br>
"Second, we'll give you the policy to build a plant in our country. We have a wealth of labor resources and a raw materials market."</br>
</br>
"I'm only planning to build the nutrient supply plant on Ange Island. After so many things have happened, I don't feel very safe. You know," Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Natasha gave Jiang Chen a hard stare. She took a deep breath before extending out her third finger.</br>
</br>
"Three, you produce, we import."</br>
</br>
"The military type?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Natasha nodded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
"Could I know how much you're ordering?"</br>
</br>
"20 million per month."</br>
</br>
20 million per month? If it were not for the fact that the nutrient supply in the modern world pursued low calories, the cost would be much lower. The nutrient supply now must be produced with DH seaweed, but if the wasteland nutrient supply was manufactured, any fruit and vegetable could be used as the ingredient to produce nutrient supply above A grade.</br>
</br>
And the cost of fruit and meat was meager for Xin, a near significant farm product exporting country.</br>
</br>
"What kind of price could you accept?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"3 USD per nutrient supply." Natasha proposed in anxiousness.</br>
</br>
The average food cost for a Russian soldier per day is 351 Rubles which is equivalent to 4.6 USD. Based on the consideration that the nutrient supply could replace regular dietary needs, if the nutrient supply is not high in cost, it is no longer a burden for the Russian military to replace food as it could decrease military spending in that area. And due to the ease of storage of nutrient supply, to use military supply as a strategic supply for storage, it could also save a big chunk of the budget.</br>
</br>
But based on the nutrient supply's current price of 6.1 USD per nutrient supply, they could not afford it.</br>
</br>
So when Natasha proposed the price point, she was very anxious as she feared that Jiang Chen would consider their price point too low and disagree with the proposal outright.</br>
</br>
Too low?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought it was high.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen calculated in his head. A normal nutrient supply had a cost 1 USD, much lower than the improved nutrient supply. Would the profit of 2 USD per nutrient supply be too greedy?</br>
</br>
Especially since it was effortless to increase the production of this nutrient supply; there was no need to expand DH seaweed's farm area. It could also be produced with normal vegetables and even the leftovers from restaurants.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at Natasha, seeing how tense she looked, she was afraid that he would reject.</br>
</br>
[Since you don't think it is expensive, I will sell it to you.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen coughed and pretended to be serious.</br>
</br>
"Although it is lower than what I expected, based on our friendly relationship… deal."</br>
</br>
A charming smile immediately appeared on Natasha' face, she clearly looked relieved.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your generosity, I wish the best of luck to both of us."</br>
</br>
"No need." The tip of Jiang Chen's mouth carved up.</br>
</br>
Natasha slightly raised her eyebrows, puzzled at Jiang Chen's expression.</br>
</br>
The faint smile on his face made her feel like she was tricked, but she couldn't tell where she got tricked.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 465: Virtual Reality Helmet in Production</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Back into the mansion, it was too lonely to sleep himself. So after rolling in bed for a bit, Jiang Chen headed to the apocalypse and quietly sneaked into Sun Jiao's bedroom.</br>
</br>
When he took off the blanket, he was shocked to discover two people in bed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, is brother-in-law disappointed?" Sun Xiaorou covered herself with the blanket and pulled it up by her chin while giggling.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao blushed and rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Fool, I thought you went back to that side to sleep."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was used to Jiang Chen traveling between the apocalypse and the modern world. The mutants flood was just over as she initially thought Jiang Chen would stay for a bit of time on that side, but he left in the morning before returning at night.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the giggling Sun Xiaorou. The reaction in his head was as follows.</br>
</br>
[Two people?]</br>
</br>
[Then two people it is!]</br>
</br>
Following two light shouts, Jiang Chen leaped onto the bed with a smirk.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next day at noon, Jiang Chen had lunch with the girls and got the phone from Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Just by the looks of it, other than the phone being a bit thinner, it didn't look too different from a normal smartphone. However, the functionality was much stronger than normal smartphones. Most of the parts inside used graphene materials and completely replaced the silicone chips.</br>
</br>
Also, the camera on the front was installed with hologram components. Also, the phone could be installed with the drone control program and used as the remote for drones. The latter functionality was similar to an EP, but Jiang Chen loved the first function.</br>
</br>
To be able to project the operating system out in the form of a hologram, he would be the only who could do it in the world.</br>
</br>
He then changed the sim card and headed to his office.</br>
</br>
For example, even though the city center was showered by the rain of destruction, the life signal in the area didn't completely disappear. The mutants flood did stop, but zombie reproduction continued. A lot of mutant's nests weren't destroyed either. But since the drones could enter into the area, they brought back the details of the city center to the base.</br>
</br>
A lot of mutant nests were not located on the surface, but rather in the underground sewer system, metro stations, or the basement of buildings. The mutants on the surface indeed all died, but the mutants under the surface didn't completely die off. Even if all the oxygen were burned off, a lot of mutants were resilient even in an oxygen-free environment with only a portion of the mutants dying off due to asphyxiation while the rest survived.</br>
</br>
To remove the remaining threats, the plan of attack on the city center was in the process. The First Corp was responsible as the primary attack force, with the support of the armored force, they will conduct surgery to the infection source in the city center.</br>
</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Lin's improved rocket already achieved great results. The material didn't require fuel but was refined through Carm tree sap and other mutated plants. The new fuel's unit volume of combustion rate was two times the amount of solid-fuel and three times the fuel used in BM-21. At the same time, the component of the rocket became two times heavier than the BM-21, and the original launcher was replaced with the more powerful rocket booster.</br>
</br>
The "primal weapon" replicated by future technology had no similarities other than the appearance.</br>
</br>
The single launch cost was 1000 crystals, equivalent to 20 rifles sold at the Sixth Street Gun Store. While it was a bit pricey, the power was immense.</br>
</br>
The weapon was named "Fireball-1" by Jiang Lin. Although the name sounded magical, it was surprisingly fitting. Any mutants splattered by the fuel would turn into a fireball.</br>
</br>
When 1000 rounds of "Fireball-1" were produced, they could start the military operation on the city center. Jiang Chen ordered to stop the production of the Scream mortar shell and used the remaining production capability on the "Fireball-1".</br>
</br>
Although the cost of 1000 crystals certainly pained him, he knew it was well worth the price. With one fireball, it could at least decrease one casualty. To Jiang Chen, who didn't lack food, people were the most valuable resource on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Everything at the base was functioning smoothly. Since there was nothing to do, Jiang Chen returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Since the problem in the apocalypse was solved, he needed to get the virtual reality helmet production online as soon as possible. There were only four months left before the start of next year. Once the virtual reality helmet hits the market, Future Technology will face a completely new market.</br>
</br>
Even if 10% of the global 3.2 billion netizens pay for the virtual reality helmet, it was 300 million units! Even if each helmet only made 500 USD, it was a daunting 150 billion USD.</br>
</br>
Of course, he would be grateful if 20 million Phantom could be sold when the helmet is officially released. With the gradual ramp up in production, once the game goes online, Future Technology should be able to sell around 100 million in helmets in the most ideal scenario.</br>
</br>
He took a boat to New Moon Island and found Ivan who was training the recruits. He was having a great time on the island as he was growing a belly. But from how tanned he looked, it was almost comparable to Barkary.</br>
</br>
When Ivan saw Jiang Chen, Ivan gave him a sharp salute and asked Jiang Chen what the purpose of this visit was.</br>
</br>
"Future Mining's platform is in use. I need you to send and station three soldiers on the island. In terms of equipment, bring the "Python" anti-tank rocket and the drone backpack.</br>
</br>
The drone backpack was the single-soldier drone carrier. Capable of providing processing support for five Hummingbird drones, ammo supply as well as charging. In the modern world without single-soldier EMP equipment, it was a strong and powerful weapon.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Ivan stood straight and saluted again.</br>
</br>
With how serious he looked, Jiang Chen smiled and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Make sure you pick people you can trust as Future Group's secret is on the island. There is no dispute area around the platform area and zoned into a military control zone. Any ships approaching can be shot if they ignore the warning.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, with the truth-telling serum, we have already found two traitors in the team." Ivan laughed cheerfully.</br>
</br>
Although his laugh was cheerful, Jiang Chen felt a hint of cruelty in the laugh.</br>
</br>
As to the two poor suckers, Jiang Chen was too lazy to ask. He knew Ivan would take care of them.</br>
</br>
Zero tolerance to betrayal.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had emphasized this point since day one.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Because the sea platform was located in the shallow sea, it was extremely stable, and it practically felt like standing on the ground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen planned to put the production line for the "Phantom" helmet here. In the entire Xin, there was no place safer than New Moon Island. When the platform was completed, Jiang Chen brought the construction map and opened bidding to the international construction companies to construct three plants here listed on each of the three corners on the sea platform. Factories would be connected by enclosed streamlines.</br>
</br>
Plant A would be responsible for the basic production of the helmet, Plant B would be responsible for manufacturing the graphene chip and the nerve connection module, and team C would be responsible for putting everything together and installing the security function on the enclosed helmet with the finished product was exported out of plant C.</br>
</br>
The entire production facility was highly automated. Only 30 workers were necessary to complete the operation of the production line. The workers only needed to transport the ores to the targeted location, stand on the fixed production line, and follow the manual to control the equipment. As to the principles, they didn't need to know, and Jiang Chen wasn't planning on telling them.</br>
</br>
All products that met the quality standard would be passed on with products fallen below the standard sent back to ensure quality was met. Production would increase once the workers familiarized themselves with the production procedures.</br>
</br>
All the workers must pass a security screening when they enter and their phones locked away during shifts. The procedure was stricter than college entrance exams to prevent the technology from being leaked.</br>
</br>
With Future Group's technology, even a pin-sized needle would be scanned out. Any worker attempting to bring in spy devices would be prosecuted based on Xin Business Secret Act and fired from Future Group.</br>
</br>
If the production facility experienced technical difficulties, the entire production line would immediately halt, and the triangular floating island would be temporarily shut down. The production would only be restarted when Jiang Chen arrived to solve the problem.</br>
</br>
But the facility had high stability. Without deliberate human damage, the facility could run several years without error.</br>
</br>
Currently, Jiang Chen instructed the scientists in Fallout Shelter 027 to improve this production line and the possibility of drones replacing workers to conduct the production. It was best to decrease the number of people directly involved with the production while increasing production volume.</br>
</br>
The exterior of the helmet was primarily made out of industrial plastic, and lead insulation and modern world technology could easily produce this. Therefore, the work without any technical innovation could be contracted to companies with interest.</br>
</br>
With the current production facility, half a million helmets could be produced monthly. Followed by the wasteland's continuous improvement and building of the production line, the helmet could reach five million per month by year-end.</br>
</br>
After sending the soldiers on the platform back to the island, Jiang Chen went into a plant and returned to the apocalypse and moved the two finished production lines over. He installed and placed the two production lines based on the blueprint provided.</br>
</br>
After everything, Jiang Chen dusted off the sand on his hands and looked pleasingly at the equipment in the three plants.</br>
</br>
Once the two production lines come into production, the entire world will be crazy over Future Technology.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 466"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 466: Unrest at Night</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Earlier in the month, Jiang Chen contracted out the specification of the "Phantom" helmet to workshops on Coro Island with a production cost of 40 USD per helmet. Jiang Chen aimed to sell each helmet for 50 USD, so a single helmet would have a profit margin of 10 USD.</br>
</br>
The high rate of return brought a wave of startups in Xin.</br>
</br>
There were no more fishermen on Ange Island. People grasped the opportunity to purchase production equipment and started workshops in their own backyards. They only needed to produce 1000 helmets to gain 10 thousand USD in profit; it was a much better business compared to fishing.</br>
</br>
After they got accustomed to the taste of money, the clever ones would start building bigger plants, expanding production, lowering costs, and making more money…</br>
</br>
And they would become capitalists dependent on Future Group.</br>
</br>
The calculations showed that a helmet cost roughly 500 USD. Jiang Chen planned to set the price at 1500 USD. Based on the tariffs of each country, the price would vary 5 to 15%.</br>
</br>
Although the price of 1500 USD was a bit pricey, from another perspective, it would allow users to gain eight more hours when they could have their eyes "open." Was that still considered expensive?</br>
</br>
It was like giving them a second life!</br>
</br>
And Future Technology promised that the "Phantom" had a warranty of more than five years. Any helmet broken with normal usage within two years could be replaced while any helmet malfunctions within five years could be replaced at half price - the warranty was impeccable.</br>
</br>
For users who opened the helmet out of "curiosity," they had to pay for their curiosity, unfortunately. The agreement and package explicitly stated that any activity exposing the interior of the helmet could cause the interior to "oxidize." A helmet damaged in this manner would not enjoy the warranty provided.</br>
</br>
On the production side, due to low production rates of the helmet, it meant that only part of the population could obtain one. Jiang Chen trusted that even at a price of 1500 USD, the "Phantom" would be out of stock for a long period of time.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Late into the night, inside the virtual reality MMORPG testing room, 2000 players quietly laid on their recliners and carried out the testing.</br>
</br>
In the first 20 days, the internal tests were conducted in the morning. But the employees soon discovered that when "Phantom" was active, the user's brain would be in sleep mode. So when the testing was done in the morning, it shifted the players' biological clocks. It meant that the players were all energetic even well into the night.</br>
</br>
The fact that the helmets affected their biological clocks was undoubtedly a problem, but it also meant the virtual reality helmets had an excellent ability to lure people to sleep. Even for players with insomnia, they could use the helmet to obtain a great night of sleep.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although this was just a minor detail, the employees recorded this data to provide better information for when the game would officially be in operation.</br>
</br>
It was day 25 of internal testing.</br>
</br>
After their initial shock, the players became accustomed to the otherworldly experience.</br>
</br>
At first, a lot of mages loved to throw fireballs in the starting village only to be killed by guards who came to the rescue, and it wasn't until all the NPCs in the city displayed unfriendly attitudes towards them that their brain-dead behavior stopped.</br>
</br>
They couldn't be blamed as anyone who suddenly possessed magic wouldn't think about saving the world first; they would probably try to frustrate the NPCs and cause extensive damage instead.</br>
</br>
However, there was no doubt that even if the Florentine psychology was brought out, this behavior still followed a certain pattern.</br>
</br>
And it was because of this that most mages chose their second job as a fire mage or undead mage.</br>
</br>
One was powerful. The other was evil.</br>
</br>
According to user preferences, the game designers in the other world could only use the raw data and wave their "butcher knives."</br>
</br>
"The weather is quite nice today."</br>
</br>
"Let's nerf the mage."</br>
</br>
These two sentences were commonly spoken in Du Yongkong's office.</br>
</br>
Since they couldn't see the players, they didn't know why internal testers favored mages or why they were so keen to light up the NPC's building with fireballs. It was something Du Yongkong had never seen in the twenty years of his professional career.</br>
</br>
It wasn't until Du Yongkong reported the mage getting nerfed to Jiang Chen that the behavior stopped.</br>
</br>
The virtual reality in the apocalypse took a century to mature from its infancy, so the players in that world didn't feel too astonished by the freedom and magic of the world - they were already accustomed to it.</br>
</br>
To put it in simple terms, the internal testers in the modern world displayed behaviors similar to primates in awe of civilization due to the hastened timeline of the availability of virtual reality. Just like an an indigenous person who had a musket thrown into his hand, their first reaction wasn't to be repelled but rather to come closer to the muzzle, wondering how the black hole could spit out fire.</br>
</br>
Nerfing the damage on the spell would decrease the game's playability, but without nerfs, no one would play warrior which would impact the overall gaming experience. After careful consideration, Jiang Chen instructed them to nerf the scalability, but not the damage.</br>
</br>
For example, C level equipment for a warrior required 100 gold with a drop chance of 10%, while C level equipment for a mage required 1000 gold with a drop chance of 4%. If most noobs couldn't afford to play a mage, they would automatically choose another profession.</br>
</br>
And at level 20, players would gain an opportunity to redistribute their stats and choose their class again.</br>
</br>
Also, for classes like the priest, the game designer on the wasteland made similar adjustments.</br>
</br>
25 days after the change, the playability of the game increased quite substantially.</br>
</br>
As Wei Wendong played an archer he just created, walking in the woods, the symbol of  suddenly popped up.</br>
</br>
"Disconnected?" Wei Wendong frowned.</br>
</br>
The battery should be full. The "Phantom" connected to Wi-Fi could potentially disconnect in theory, but this is the first time this has happened…</br>
</br>
He chose to log out, put down his helmet, and look around only to discover it was pitch black in the hall. He could slightly make out that the players around him were all experiencing the same situation as they woke up from their games with a blank expression.</br>
</br>
"Everyone, please remain calm. There's been a small accident outside."</br>
</br>
An employee walked in and spoke to the crowd with a loudspeaker.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 467: The Intimate Arrival</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Because Wei Wendong was close to the door, he noticed that behind the employee was security in "plastic armor."</br>
</br>
He had been skeptical of the futuristic-looking "plastic" armor that could defend against bullets. The fluid-looking rifles in their hands were more like props from a sci-fi movie.</br>
</br>
But if Wei Wendong knew the plastic armor could defend against the firing of a 12.7 mm caliber machine gun or the toy could easily flip over a 3-ton military Hummer or that the prop gun could penetrate through the bulletproof exterior of a Hummer, what kind of expression would he have on his face?</br>
</br>
The kinetic skeleton had remained a concept only in labs. In this aspect, Celestial Trade was leading the world.</br>
</br>
A faint explosion transmitted from outside.</br>
</br>
But due to the excellent insulation of the hall, only Wei Wendong, close to the door, felt a minor shake. The explosion made him uneasy, but just as he was planning to ask the employee, the lights in the hall came back again.</br>
</br>
"What just happened? Fu*k, I was killing a boss but suddenly disconnected."</br>
</br>
"Q.Q, I just got a legendary weapon but hadn't picked it up."</br>
</br>
"Did the power just go out?"</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong listened to the chit-chat of the surrounding players. He hesitated for a moment before he swallowed his question down. The explosion outside and the barely audible gunshots made him feel the situation wasn't as simple as a power outage.</br>
</br>
"We apologize as the hotel's power system experienced a temporary outage. Our technical experts have resolved the situation, please return to the game. The game data has been reset to before the outage and will be unpaused in two minutes."</br>
</br>
[Pausing the server is only something that can be done during internal testing.] With a mind full of questions, Wei Wendong put on the helmet and logged into the game.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had spent an entire day working on the contract for the production of helmets. When he returned home, he fell asleep right away.</br>
</br>
But two hours into his sleep, a call from the internal testing center woke him up.</br>
</br>
"An attack?" Jiang Chen listened to the description over the phone as his eyebrows furrowed together.</br>
</br>
"That's right. There were five attackers in total. One cut off the power supply in the hotel remotely while the other four with light weapons attempted to enter the hotel, but the drones detected them. Our people immediately suppressed them with bullets. When they were retreating, they used grenades and struck the wall of the hotel, but fortunately, there were no casualties," the security manager responsible for the internal testing center reported.</br>
</br>
"Where are they?" Jiang Chen asked in a serious undertone.</br>
</br>
As long as there was one person alive, the truth-telling liquid could uncover the truth.</br>
</br>
"Three people were shot dead during their escape. One person died due to a vehicle collision and the other person committed suicide."</br>
</br>
</br>
[Suicide?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows tightened.</br>
</br>
"Did you confirm their identities?"</br>
</br>
"Other than the fact that three of them were white and two were black, we weren't able to obtain any more information," Ma Li answered.</br>
</br>
The organization that sent out that force was a formidable opponent as they sent out agents who would rather commit suicide than reveal their identity.</br>
</br>
"Were there any witnesses?"</br>
</br>
"All information leaks have been controlled."</br>
</br>
"Great, continue to monitor the information leaks and don't let the media know. Take care of the situation."</br>
</br>
If the media exposed a shooting at the door of Future Technology's Internal Testing Center, Xin's tourism rating and Future Technology's public image would be impacted. If possible, it was better to keep the media ignorant of the incident.</br>
</br>
"Understood," Ma Li answered affirmatively.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a while after he hung up the phone to think about who could've launched the attack. But when he carefully went through a list of potential organizations, he realized there were too many suspicious people. Future Technology's virtual reality touched too many people's slice of the pie. It was fortunate that the testing was being done on his territory and Celestial could punish any rats with iron fists.</br>
</br>
He had to wait for Ayesha to finish training the agents.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
There was no signal on that island, so there was no way of contacting Ayesha even if he wanted to. If he made a trip… he feared it would interrupt her teaching.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen flung his phone to the side, yawned, and laid down again.</br>
</br>
Regardless, he was tired today. He still had to head to the airport tomorrow, so it would be an early morning start for him.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Inside the airport, a splendid figure in a summer outfit strolled around. Her black circular shades were matched with a straw hat; her graceful hand pulled a lemon-yellow suitcase along. Her appearance looked exactly like a celebrity traveling in secret, catching the attention of all the tourists.</br>
</br>
But the beauty was clearly used to their envious looks, so she didn't react at all as she headed straight to the door.</br>
</br>
"Hello~"</br>
</br>
Liu Yao's eyes lit up when she saw Jiang Chen leaning against the door. She waved energetically.</br>
</br>
With Liu Yao's lively appearance, Jiang Chen smiled and greeted her as well. But just as he was about to speak, an unstoppable yawn came out.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen and dragged her suitcase in front of him.</br>
</br>
"What? Did you not miss me?"</br>
</br>
"How could I not? It's just that something happened last night," Jiang Chen said with his mouth wide open while taking Liu Yao's luggage. He walked in front of the car to stuff the luggage in.</br>
</br>
Something did happen last night, but Liu Yao clearly mistook it for something else. She rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen again but it didn't take long before her attention shifted to Jiang Chen's car.</br>
</br>
"Wow, is this a Lamborghini? The trunk is in the front." Liu Yao touched the car out of excitement.</br>
</br>
"Do you like it? I'll gift you one then?" Jiang Chen opened the door.</br>
</br>
Even Natasha had scoffed at the lack of defense on his ride. Out of safety considerations, it was time to switch to a safer vehicle.</br>
</br>
For example, he should build the cast with C-type steel, use tempered glass for the car windows, use nuclear fusion batteries as the engine for the car, and install two rockets.</br>
</br>
When Liu Yao entered the car, she immediately took off her shades and tossed her hat to the back.</br>
</br>
"Why do I feel like you're really excited?"</br>
</br>
"I just really missed you." Liu Yao stared at Jiang Chen with her watery eyes.</br>
</br>
"Really?"</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Liu Yao lifted her graceful legs. Her movements showed her charm.</br>
</br>
"I think you got prettier." Jiang Chen examined Liu Yao while rubbing his chin.</br>
</br>
"Where?" Liu Yao asked with enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pretended to be deep in thought. Faced with Liu Yao's hopeful glance, he finally gave a response:</br>
</br>
"Your boobs got bigger."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao's face was decorated with a blush as she pouted.</br>
</br>
"Screw you."</br>
</br>
"Then where should I compliment you?" Jiang Chen started the car while he spoke with a smirk.</br>
</br>
"Obviously other parts. Like my face, my eyes."</br>
</br>
"Then your face got bigger."</br>
</br>
"What? Did it get bigger?" Liu Yao scrambled through her purse to find a mirror and examined her face. "It didn't get bigger..."</br>
</br>
But soon after, she saw the smirk on Jiang Chen's face and she replied to him with a hard stare:</br>
</br>
"Hmph, you dared to trick me."</br>
</br>
With a grin on his face, Liu Yao felt she shouldn't let this go so easily, but she couldn't think of a way to punish him.</br>
</br>
Her eyes rolled around and suddenly a bright smile formed on her face.</br>
</br>
"Pay attention when you're driving."</br>
</br>
"Of course, you don't have to worry about my driving."</br>
</br>
"Oh, is that so? Then you better drive slowly..." Liu Yao smiled mysteriously then reached out her left hand nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Xin's road conditions aren't bad; there aren't many cars on the road-"</br>
</br>
The cold sensation made Jiang Chen's scalp tingle.</br>
</br>
"What're you doing..." Jiang Chen frantically tried to stabilize the steering wheel then glanced at the mischevious Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
"I'm testing your driving skills."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao turned the bottle of water and grinned.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao studied Jiang Chen's expression and she felt confident. Regardless of what happened last night, he still had feelings for her. As his mistress, only this feeling gave her a sense of security.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen knew what she was thinking, he would have a peculiar expression on his face. Something did happen last night, but it was completely contrary to what Liu Yao thought.</br>
</br>
Something similar happened before. When they came out of Wanghai University, a similar scene happened in the car. But the only difference was that the Maybach had tinted glass. The inside of this Lamborgini could still be seen from the outside.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen parked on the road, everyone would see what was happening in the car. But the car was moving.</br>
</br>
"Can't you wait until we watch the movie?" Jiang Chen was consumed by the gentle coldness while he squeezed a few words from this teeth. He tried his best to maneuver the vehicle.</br>
</br>
It was very distracting to have people drinking water on the side.</br>
</br>
"No, I'm thirty." Liu Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
The "displeased" Jiang Chen made Liu Yao even more naughty.</br>
</br>
Her mischevious eyes rolled around and she opened the bottle cap. Her bright red lips moved closer and began to slurp on the water.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 468: What If</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen drove Liu Yao back home and they watched a movie she starred in at her home theater.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it was fun hugging the actual movie star from the film. But because Liu Yao distracted him from viewing the movie, Jiang Chen didn't absorb any of the film's plot.</br>
</br>
But even then, just from the few scenes she acted in, her performance as "the prom queen who could only be viewed from a distance" was exquisite. This was especially obvious when she rejected the supporting actor's confession and the leading actor accompanied the supporting actor to watch Liu Yao's plane fly into the distance - Liu Yao displayed her "goddess" ambiance and even surpassed the leading actress on this aspect.</br>
</br>
Although it had a typical romance plot, teenage girls loved to watch it and their boyfriends loved to watch it with them. The plot wasn't important necessarily as long as the BGM 1  and scenes were emotional enough. With the weight of a favorable review from "senior film critique," Jiang Chen, once the film hit the theatres, Liu Yao would become the goddess in everyone's heart, the prom queen only viewable from a distance…</br>
</br>
But what they wouldn't know was that the prom queen was currently sitting on Jiang Chen's lap.</br>
</br>
"Okay, that should be all your scenes. Aren't you going to come down?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"No, the film isn't over yet." Her hair was slightly messy, but Liu Yao pouted defiantly, shook her waist, and swatted away Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
"Okay, as long as you can take it."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao stuck out her tongue and thought about it for a bit before coming down.</br>
</br>
"The gorgeous exit scene I heard was added when the director asked the screenwriter to change the script."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is that so? I feel it was a great addition. Mhmm, bring me a bottle of champagne." Jiang Chen smiled nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, to prevent the supporting cast from taking over, the director would usually decrease the number of scenes the supporting cast appeared in. Although Jiang Chen wasn't well-versed in the art of movies, who cared? He was rich.</br>
</br>
"Thank you," Liu Yao whispered as she stood in front of Jiang Chen and tidied up her messy clothes.</br>
</br>
"No need." Jiang Chen smirked, closed his eyes playfully, and opened his mouth: "I'm thirsty, give me water."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao seductively rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen. She turned around and headed to the kitchen with elegant steps.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was the type of girl who knew her position and what other people needed. Because of this, it was relaxing and joyful spending time with her.</br>
</br>
In the next three days, Jiang Chen had the rare opportunity to enjoy the lavish life of a billionaire. He either brought Liu Yao to "contribute to the local tourism industry" on Coro Island or spent time with her on his private island.</br>
</br>
When he thought about it, he hadn't had the time to relax for the past while. He was either working on Future Group's business in Xin or he was working on the "territorial dispute" in the apocalypse. While he made a decent amount of money, only a small percentage was used for leisure.</br>
</br>
</br>
"This is such a waste." Jiang Chen laid on the lounge chair while sluggishly bathing in a ray of sunshine.</br>
</br>
"A waste?" Liu Yao laid beside Jiang Chen while uploading pictures of the southern kingdom.</br>
</br>
"It's nothing. I just think it's so beautiful here, yet I only spend a handful of time enjoying this."</br>
</br>
"Could I interpret that to mean you're showing off right now?" Liu Yao pouted while looking at Jiang Chen, speechless. She then continued to play with her phone and upload pictures onto her Weibo.</br>
</br>
Just then, she posted a photo of their private beach. A lot of "good friends" commented and called her "sister," hoping she could bring them along next time she traveled.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao's vanity was satisfied when she scrolled through the comments. A bright smile appeared on her face. She typed away with delight and replied, saying she would bring some specialties back and treat them to a nice dinner with her pay.</br>
</br>
As for bringing them there…</br>
</br>
She'd pass. She didn't want to increase her competition.</br>
</br>
While Liu Yao was waving her legs in joy, Jiang Chen couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
Without needing to look, he knew what she was doing.</br>
</br>
A woman's vanity wouldn't make a man jealous, because vanity could also bring satisfaction to men. A lot of the time, men just hated women who used their vanity to kidnap him, challenge his limits, and cause unnecessary problems.</br>
</br>
But Liu Yao seemed to know this point well - while she did brag about her man's power, she never used Jiang Chen's name for anything unreasonable. And she didn't use her relationship with the biggest investor in the film industry to mistreat the other cast members.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen often thought she was the perfect mistress.</br>
</br>
"Oh, am I in the picture?" he asked casually.</br>
</br>
"Hmm? No." Liu Yao tilted her head but suddenly remembered something as she whispered, "Of course, if you want to make our thing public, I won't mind."</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
[This girl's thought process is completely different from mine. To be honest, I don't care about scandals or rumors; the reason I asked was because…]</br>
</br>
"It's for your safety."</br>
</br>
"Safety?" Liu Yao had a slight look of fear. "Did you get into trouble with gangs?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen burst out laughing and spat out the orange juice he just gulped down. [Gangs? Am I this low?]</br>
</br>
Liu Yao looked at Jiang Chen, still confused, as she didn't know why he was laughing.</br>
</br>
"Are you scared?" Jiang Chen didn't address her confusion.</br>
</br>
If she was afraid, he would draw a line in their relationship and force her to stay away from that world.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao took a moment to process things before she shook her head rapidly.</br>
</br>
"I'm not afraid."</br>
</br>
"Really?"</br>
</br>
"Don't act like this. What did I do to make you dislike me?" Liu Yao got up from lying on the ground with sadness on her face before she moved next to Jiang Chen. She rested her face on his arm and looked at him, feeling mistreated.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's question gave her an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and tousled her hair.</br>
</br>
"You're absolutely safe in Hua and Xin. But if you make some people believe you're close to me and that you mean something to me, some people may attempt to kidnap you and use you to threaten me in exchange for a ransom."</br>
</br>
Although it was the most comical thing to kidnap the women of rich men, a lot of wealthy men wanted to get rid of their old wives and mistresses who no longer interested them. Compared to kidnapping, it was better to seduce… but Jiang Chen considered himself someone who cared about the people around him, so he had to consider this possibility.</br>
</br>
[Then would you come and save me?]</br>
</br>
Liu Yao subconsciously wanted to ask, but she swallowed the question down in the end.</br>
</br>
[I'm only his mistress…]</br>
</br>
She regretted that she hadn't given her first time to him more than once. [If we met earlier… if…]</br>
</br>
Her tears rolled down and hid in the sand. Perhaps the sorrow of being an actress was that even if she felt emotional, her tears would be considered acting by others.</br>
</br>
[I'm your regret.]</br>
</br>
[But you're my regret as well…]</br>
</br>
Liu Yao felt melancholic.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen seemed to have read her mind. "I'll save you."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao's eyes widened in disbelief; her teary look was beautiful.</br>
</br>
Her shaking lips seemed to be asking: "But why?"</br>
</br>
"But… the only thing I can do in the end is to avenge you." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Even though Liu Yao was just his mistress, if the people who bothered him killed her, he would do anything to find them and press the nuclear button without hesitation because he cared.</br>
</br>
The reason why he tolerated spy activity was because they hadn't reached his bottom line.</br>
</br>
"That's enough," Liu Yao whispered as she dried her tears on Jiang Chen's arm.</br>
</br>
"Why's that enough? Can't you protect yourself?" Jiang Chen asked wryly.</br>
</br>
"Because I still mean something to you. Can't I be proud of that?" She rested on Jiang Chen's arm.</br>
</br>
They weren't worried about the same thing. He was concerned about safety, but now the topic had shifted to personal importance.</br>
</br>
[It might not be a great thing to be important to me…]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rolled his eyes and gazed at the horizon in the distance.</br>
</br>
"You know what's the best way to protect the people important to you?"</br>
</br>
"What's that?" Considering the sternness on Jiang Chen's face, Liu Yao asked genuinely.</br>
</br>
"Have enough important people in your life so people won't know who's more important," Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao first paused before she pouted speechlessly.</br>
</br>
"You know..."</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows, no longer serious.</br>
</br>
"You completely ruined the atmosphere just now!" Liu Yao made a funny face at him with her eyes rolled and tongue stuck out. She sat back down and completely ignored him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and didn't respond.</br>
</br>
It was just a joke.</br>

</br>
"Recently, the MLF active in Country F's territory launched a large-scale military attack named 'Autumn Assault' on the Dawo Port. Currently, over 70% of the area in Dawo is under the control of anti-government forces. The new leader of MLF called all faithful believers and Moro nationalists to join the organization, to resist Country F government's invasion and suppression, to restore the sovereignty of Moro and return MLL Island to the Moros."</br>
</br>
"The UA spokesperson criticized Santos' speech, calling its actions unconstitutional. Seeking independence should not threaten the life and property of normal citizens. And they expressed that they will refuse to recognize a country formed through violent means. The Rainbow House is currently discussing the possibility of sending out ground forces…"</br>
</br>
"The Russian president stated that the comments should take into consideration the current situation in Syria. It isn't only Country F's anti-government forces using violent means…"</br>
</br>
"Due to the conflict in Country F, support for Sandy has slid down by 7 points. The UA media questioned its campaign objective to return to the Asia Pacific, stating that it could not improve the current situation without making the situation spin out of control. The Capital didn't comment further and only expressed that they would provide assistance to their allies when the time was deemed appropriate. But analysis stated that the possibility of sending ground forces to intervene with the Country F situation is unlikely. With the upcoming election, due to the influence of anti-war sentiment in the country, the Republicans don't want to further add variables to the election…"</br>
</br>
[Santos actually did something, then.]</br>
</br>
Watching the news on TV, a smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Just then, a soft sensation came from behind his head.</br>
</br>
"Are you watching the news?" Liu Yao hugged Jiang Chen from behind.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, just taking a look." Jiang Chen shut off the TV.</br>
</br>
"Country F is so close to Xin - would it affect us here?" She rested her chin on Jiang Chen's head as she asked with concern.</br>
</br>
"Are you worried about me?" Jiang Chen lifted Liu Yao's head and rubbed her hair.</br>
</br>
"Why else then?"</br>
</br>
Liu Yao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen and lowered her body to nibble on his ear. She then moved up and said, "Breakfast is ready, let's eat."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, got up from the sofa, and headed to the table with Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
The past seven days, he lived a shameless life with Liu Yao. Jiang Chen previously thought she was the trophy type of woman who didn't do any housework or cooking, but the reality soon proved that he was wrong. After living alone for so long, Liu Yao learned how to take care of herself.</br>
</br>
For the past few days, Jiang Chen's life had been taken care of by the celebrity. Because of this, the mansion, previously filled with dust, became bright again.</br>
</br>
</br>
Other than enjoying life, Jiang Chen kept himself busy. The production arrangements for "Phantom" and the new nutrient supply production line were all tasks that couldn't be delegated to anyone - he had to do it all himself.</br>
</br>
Also, three completed Dolphin-10s were deployed by Droplet, 200 nautical miles away from Coro Island in the Pacific region. With the protection of nuclear weapons, Xin no longer needed to be afraid of the threat of any external forces. As to when their nuclear weapons would be made public, the date hadn't been set.</br>
</br>
During the night, Jiang Chen immersed himself completely in Liu Yao's softness.</br>
</br>
With the blink of an eye, it was already early September.</br>
</br>
Although he wanted to continue to live the comfortable life, since the "Wanghai City Center Attack Plan" was approaching its scheduled date, he had to wrap up everything in the modern world before mid-September.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Outside the airport, Liu Yao released the suitcase she was dragging. She hooked her arms around Jiang Chen's neck longingly and kissed him.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to go. Take care of yourself."</br>
</br>
"When's your next film going to show up? Is there a plan?" Jiang Chen gently patted her back and smiled.</br>
</br>
"The movie isn't currently in theatres yet. I'll have to wait for the box office at the year's end. Remember to watch it with me one more time in a movie theatre."</br>
</br>
"Aren't you embarrassed?" Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
"Pervert!"</br>
</br>
Her boarding announcement echoed throughout the terminal. Although Liu Yao wanted to stay longer, time didn't permit.</br>
</br>
She went up on her tiptoes and left another kiss on Jiang Chen's face. Then she dragged her luggage along and rushed to the gate.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left the airport, he didn't get in the car immediately. Instead, he leaned against it and watched the sky above the airport.</br>
</br>
Her plane departed and disappeared into the clouds.</br>
</br>
He reminisced the past seven days of joy before he started to chuckle and got into the car. He put on his Bluetooth and went on his way.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dialed Xia Shiyu's office.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" It was a cold but familiar voice.</br>
</br>
"There are 600,000 units of 'Phantom' helmet ready. How are preparations on your side?"</br>
</br>
"Only 600,000? That's too little." Xia Shiyu leaned on the office chair, scanned the document on her laptop and spoke with an eyebrow raised.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, by the year's end, you'll see 20,000,000 virtual reality helmets." Jiang Chen began to laugh.</br>
</br>
Production must be increased gradually. Just yesterday, Fishbone base produced two more production equipment. When the equipment was installed at the plant, the output of "Phantom" could reach 1,100,000 per month.</br>
</br>
As long as they increased the production capacity to 10,000,000 before January, with the Sixth Street part of the order, it wouldn't be unrealistic to achieve the 20,000,000 target.</br>
</br>
"Currently, we contacted 70,000 net cafes domestically and 310,000 net cafes internationally to launch the virtual reality experience project. We need 1,440,000 helmets for this."</br>
</br>
Marketing was only one aspect of the project, but for word of this project to spread, advertisements alone weren't enough. Using internet cafes as a physical channel to market the product was an excellent choice. With expensive products, consumers often held a cautious attitude, but Jiang Chen was confident that when players experienced the magic of "Phantom," no one would want to put it down.</br>
</br>
"What're the specifics of the plan?" Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"We'll provide the product and they'll provide the channel. The current pricing for experimenting with the product is set at 1 USD per hour with an equal split of profits. I've laid out the details of the plan. But the key is: do you really have 1,440,000 helmets?" Xia Shiyu pushed up her glasses and asked concisely.</br>
</br>
"When do you need them?"</br>
</br>
"As soon as possible. In the initial stage, we can work with bigger net cafe chains before expanding to the smaller cities. We only need 100,000 in the first phase, but it's still better for us to have 1,440,000 ready by the end of October."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, it'll be done by early October. On your side, you can start to arrange the logistics." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"I already made an agreement with Norway-based MSG Group. They have an excellent reputation, have high efficiency and are considered a top-five global logistics company. I signed a three-year agreement with them. They promised to bill us at 90% of the market price." Xia Shiyu spoke nonchalantly with subtle pride.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this, he was amazed at Xia Shiyu's abilities. Anything that could've come to mind was already arranged by her.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I can't believe you took care of everything. Then, for everything aside from production, I'll have to count on you."</br>
</br>
"You've always counted on me," Xia Shiyu said, speechless.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only grinned at Xia Shiyu's scoff.</br>
</br>
"How's it been?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… not bad." Xia Shiyu felt touched when Jiang Chen began to ask about her; she answered with a finger twirling her hair.</br>
</br>
The female assistant at the side looked at her CEO's expression in shock.</br>
</br>
She had been working for her for a long time, yet it was the first time she saw such a womanly expression on the normally-emotionless CEO.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Inside the hallway of Tencent's headquarters, a project manager in a suit walked with brisk steps. He had a document in his hand and from the expression on his face, something good must've happened.</br>
</br>
Du Zhuze stood in front of Ma Huateng's office. He took a deep breath, adjusted his tie, and knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
When he heard the voice inside, he eagerly pushed open the door.</br>
</br>
"Boss, they agreed on the acquisition. Wanghai Lexiang Technology stated that with our support, their Deepon virtual reality equipment now has the ability to directly connect to laptops and the previous compatibility problem has been resolved. From the test they did yesterday, it can smoothly run virtual reality games such as Microsoft's Minecraft and Eve: Valkyrie."</br>
</br>
The former had quite a reputation domestically. Ever since the virtual reality trailer was released in December of 2015, it received considerable attention. And the latter's lack of publicity domestically was primarily due to the poor selection of game operators.</br>
</br>
"Discuss publication rights with CCP. You must make them sign the contract," Ma Huateng said with an undertone.</br>
</br>
Without a game that people enjoyed playing, it would be extremely difficult to market virtual reality. People wouldn't purchase VR equipment just because they could log on their QQ with VR equipment.</br>
</br>
"But EVE's partner Shiji Tiancheng is also in discussions about Valkyrie. They're already the operator for EVE; we don't have any advantage in winning the bid for Valkyrie," Du Shuze said with a pained look.</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng smiled mysteriously. "We have money and an even better user group."</br>
</br>
He hadn't focused on EVE because it was a small market game, but now that he thought about it, what was more appealing than freely soaring in the galaxy in virtual reality?</br>
</br>
After receiving assurance from his boss, Du Shuze felt relieved and continued.</br>
</br>
"What about Microsoft's Minecraft?"</br>
</br>
"That's a single-player game, right?" Ma Huateng had a slight frown.</br>
</br>
"Primarily a single player game, but it has server functionality," Du Shuze answered.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, without the need for a large-scale server, it allows for a local network connection?"</br>
</br>
"In theory, yes." The project manager nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then ignore it. We're only focusing on MMO. The spirit of the internet is sharing, and players will naturally tire of this type of game." Ma Huateng waved his hand to dismiss his concerns.</br>
</br>
The project manager suddenly understood.</br>
</br>
"Boss you're so smart!"</br>
</br>
[Did you even need to say it?] Ma Huateng glared at him.</br>
</br>
But it certainly felt good to listen to flattery as Ma Huateng sunk into his chair, feeling proud. Future Technology's sudden emergence was indeed annoying, but with the solid foundation of the Tencent empire, it would be easy to break into virtual reality.</br>
</br>
</br>
The only reason they hadn't made a move was because the mobile market was saturated. As a newly-formed company, they dared to fight for market shares with the three giants - Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba? That was wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
But since the war began, he was more focused on the plans of the other two giants.</br>
</br>
"Keep an eye on Alibaba and Baidu; I feel they will-"</br>
</br>
The door was suddenly pushed open, interrupting their conversation.</br>
</br>
The person at the door leaned on the door frame while gasping for breath. He had a piece of wrinkled paper in his hand.</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng raised an eyebrow as this employee's rude actions displeased him. Du Shuze, by the side, glanced at the person and gloated before returning to a serious expression.</br>
</br>
After catching his breath, the person finally stood up. Without apologizing, he hastily walked to Ma Huateng's desk and placed the document down while shaking.</br>
</br>
"Boss, Future Technology made a new move. This is a document I copied from a net cafe that works with us." The person finally started to breathe normally and began to articulate himself.</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng glanced at him before gazing at the document.</br>
</br>
"Virtual reality experience project?"</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng flipped through the document before he started to look concerned.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Future Technology's move made him feel uneasy.</br>
</br>
"Little Du."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Du Shuze straightened his back and awaited orders.</br>
</br>
"You're responsible for virtual reality. After work, go experience this for me," Ma Huateng said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Yes Boss."</br>
</br>
"Ok, that's it from me."</br>
</br>
Du Shuze immediately stepped out. The employee who rushed in hesitated for a moment, wanting to say something. When he saw the displeased expression on his boss' face, realizing his recklessness, he shut his mouth and left the office with Du Shuze.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Wanghai City's Star Netcafe was filled with people. There were empty computers, but the front desk was crowded with people.</br>
</br>
The first things people said when they entered the net cafe was:</br>
</br>
"Could you get a 'Phantom' virtual reality helmet for me?"</br>
</br>
"Sorry, sir, the only four Phantom helmets in the store are being used," the staff said with mixed emotions.</br>
</br>
She had repeated the same line over fifty times.</br>
</br>
"What?! Full already?" The man's eyes widened. "Eh, why're there only four here?"</br>
</br>
Her explanation clearly didn't convince this man. If it wasn't for the fact that the staff looked cute, he would've cursed.</br>
</br>
As a loyal fan of Future Technology, he followed the official site of Godly Land while waiting for the monthly updated trailer. Other than that, he also avidly followed the streamers who chose to be part of the internal test.</br>
</br>
The streamers didn't disclose the game content, but when they were asked if the game was fun, even straight-faced streamers would display a fervent look.</br>
</br>
It had been half a year since the official site came online. Now that he could finally play it, he was indeed eager. As soon as he saw "Experience project" on Future 1.0, he immediately dropped everything he was doing and rushed to the closest partnered netcafe.</br>
</br>
Yet now, the Star Netcafe was telling him it was full?</br>
</br>
What kind of joke was this? The largest net cafe in the area only had four "Phantom"?</br>
</br>
"How long is the wait?" the man said out of annoyance.</br>
</br>
The new staff was about to be in tears considering how menacing the man looked.</br>
</br>
"You'll have to wait."</br>
</br>
"I know I have to wait. I'm asking how long do I have to wait?" the man said aggressively.</br>
</br>
The older staff who just finished her tasks could no longer stand by as she dragged the new staff to the back before personally handling the situation.</br>
</br>
"Sir, do you want to open a computer or experience virtual reality? If you want to experience virtual reality, please register on our computer. There are still 51 players before you for a total of 102 hours of wait time. We'll alert you through text message five hours before your spot opens up. Also, if you have time at night, you could join the night list with 23 players currently waiting—"</br>
</br>
When he heard he had to wait for five days, he immediately exploded and began yelling.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, what kind of sh*tty net cafe is this? I have to wait! I won't play anymore."</br>
</br>
Although he said that, he still stood there. He stared at the staff while waiting for the server to give in.</br>
</br>
But the staff was experienced as he looked at the man with a smile without displaying any emotion.</br>
</br>
Since he was blocking the way, the people behind him began to grow discontent.</br>
</br>
"Can you be faster? If you don't want to play, leave. Stop wasting time."</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
When he heard the voices from the back, the man's face turned red out of embarrassment. He wanted to leave, but when he saw the long line before him, if he left, he wouldn't be able to experience virtual reality anymore.</br>
</br>
"Who said I won't play? I'll wait, how much?"</br>
</br>
"You said that?" There were whistles behind him, but he chose to ignore them.</br>
</br>
[Whatever you say, my skin is thick enough.]</br>
</br>
"6 RMB an hour." The staff pointed at the sign at the door.</br>
</br>
It wasn't expensive, which made him feel a bit better. By comparison, an Apple computer cost 12 an hour.</br>
</br>
The same scene was also occurring in Wanghai, Shangjing, and other metropolises. A few days later, Phantom was set to appear in New York, London, and Paris.</br>
</br>
When the first player put down the virtual reality helmet reluctantly and began to share his astonishment with his friends, it would mark the first intimate contact between civilization and virtual reality.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 471"/>
<div class="totop" >

<div class="caption">Chapter 471: Arena Mode</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Based on the income and tax of each country, the virtual reality experience price differed. The internet cafe in Hua was priced at 6 RMB an hour, in UA it was 2 USD, in Europe, it was 2 Euros. Half went to the internet cafe while the other half went to Future Technology. Two months later, the internet cafe could purchase the helmet at 2000 USD without the need to share their profits with Future Technology.</br>
</br>
All the players' accounts were being connected to their iris scan and could be linked to their Future 1.0 account.</br>
</br>
To ensure everyone could play the game, Future Technology limited the experience of time per person. Every person could experience the game for a maximum of 2 hours every 72 hours. The frequency would increase following the increase in vacant helmets.</br>
</br>
But that would never happen.</br>
</br>
Within 24 hours, after introducing the virtual reality experience project to 21 major internet cafes in Wanghai, the internet exploded with passion. A lot of forums, BBS, and Weibo were flooded by the word "Phantom." Players who were fortunate enough to experience the game all expressed their astonishment.</br>
</br>
"It's immersive virtual reality helmet! The rumor before was true! I did experience it in my life!"</br>
</br>
"That's unbelievable. It's hard to imagine, my body didn't move… It's hard to describe the feeling. It felt as if I traveled to another world!"</br>
</br>
"Selling HoloLens purchased, only played for two days, selling at half price, please contact here…"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Words alone could not describe the excitement of the players.</br>
</br>
Not only players, but even the scientific field was also stunned by Future Technology.</br>
</br>
The Nobel Prize Committee sent emails to Future Technology, inquiring about the individual that made the breakthrough of exchanging information between the neural network and electric signals as they wished to name them as a candidate for the next Nobel Prize.</br>
</br>
But when Xia Shiyu asked Jiang Chen about the name of the person, Jiang Chen painfully rejected the Nobel Prize right at his doorstep. Even if he said he invented it himself, no one would believe him. With his personal resume and life, it nowhere resembled a sophisticated scientist.</br>
</br>
This technology was destined to be left out of the Nobel Prize.</br>
</br>
Disregarding how astonished the players and the scientific field was.</br>
</br>
In the hopes of the players waiting to experience virtual reality, Future Technology finally opened the tip of the iceberg to Godly Land - Arena Experience Project.</br>
</br>
Although it was just an experience project, it could be defined as internal testing.</br>
</br>
All the players were arranged to be part of the testing server. Although they could not experience the content of the full game, they could experience the arena function that the internal test players have yet to experience and its dueling function.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the arena, the player level was set to ten with all classes available. When the game started, the player could use gold from the system to purchase equipment from the arena merchant, then join the battle in the arena.</br>
</br>
Duel or team. Twelve different terrains to choose from.</br>
</br>
Everyone was a beginner without any need to consider advantages and disadvantages. But when they just enter the game, there was a tutorial. In some element, the data from the arena would affect the class balancing in the official release.</br>
</br>
On the other side, the arena would allow the players to unleash their desire to throw fireballs. On the official release, the prepared players would not all choose the mage class.</br>
</br>
What was funny was that a lot of pacifist players chose to make an agreement with the opponent not to fight, but rather to stroll around the map, turning the arena into a tourist spot.</br>
</br>
A lot of mages who had fun with the fireballs began to dig mud with their canes. As to the players that purposely chose to be a different gender, they wanted to see if they had the parts of the opposite gender… based on the country's law, the sensitive content would be removed. If they wanted to play the adult game, once the helmet was officially released, following the tutorial on the internet, they could use Xin's VPN to play.</br>
</br>
But strictly speaking, the "Phantom" helmet didn't provide audio and video footage. All the footage was played at the brain level. Similar to the idea of "daydreaming". So it was debatable whether virtual reality content would fit in the boundary of the current regulation on electronic publications. It would be unreasonable to use the law to prevent people from daydreaming.</br>
</br>
Of course, the primary theme of the arena was the battle.</br>
</br>
Other than that, what also shocked the players was the real-time translation functionality in the game.</br>
</br>
All the players in the world were in the same testing server, but they could freely communicate. The functionality allowed the players to speak in the common twelve languages.</br>
</br>
With so many advanced functionalities, Future Technology once again became the center of the public's and media's discussion.</br>
</br>
In a UA talk show, the host had a discussion with Gates on Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"There is virtual reality equipment called 'Phantom' that has been recently introduced, Gates, did you play it?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, I was at a internet cafe the day it was available, mhmm… and finally managed to play it yesterday." Gates had a helpless expression on his face as laughter came from the crowd that shared the same sentiment.</br>
</br>
The host also laughed along and continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"if this equipment is officially released one day and you purchase it on the second day, are you not afraid that the scene in the movie would happen? For example, locked into the virtual world and unable to come back?"</br>
</br>
"That's a great question. My answer is…" Gates purposely lowered his voice to build up the suspense before he burst out laughing, "I'll play even if I can't come back."</br>
</br>
The host was shocked.</br>
</br>
"As the founder of Microsoft… Is it good that you view a competitor's product so highly?"</br>
</br>
"I view virtual reality highly. I have to admit, after experiencing 'Phantom', the realistic feeling left me stunned. But I want to say that the HoloLens introduced by Microsoft also has its uniqueness. Our philosophy is to promote user interaction in the real world with virtual items, and not further stray away from reality."</br>
</br>
"So you're saying, Microsoft and Future Technology have two different emphases?"</br>
</br>
"You could interpret it this way." Gates crossed his legs and said while leaning on the chair.</br>
</br>
"Then which one do you think will become the new trend?" The host asked a tough question.</br>
</br>
The crowd was attentive to the discussion, but Gates certainly felt awkward about the question.</br>
</br>
His expression changed for a few seconds. Then he coughed and used a voice with certainty, but gave an ambiguous answer.</br>
</br>
"… I can only say that there are advantages on both sides."</br>
</br>
Just as Gates was still troubled by the host's tricky question, a research institute was trouble by Phantom.</br>
</br>
In a national research institute.</br>
</br>
Director Qian with a stern expression looked at the researcher walking toward him.</br>
</br>
"Little Wu, did you figure something out?"</br>
</br>
The research called Little Wu let out a sigh and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"X-ray is unable to scan it. Future Technology sneakily built a lead insulation layer in the helmet."</br>
</br>
"What about taking it apart?"</br>
</br>
Little Wu's smile was even more bitter.</br>
</br>
"Just as we were taking it apart to see what was inside, it immediately triggered the protection mechanism. All the circuits were fried. The only thing we are certain about is that the material they used is the rumored graphene chip. Because when it was taken apart, everything burned into carbon dioxide. As to the critical neural connection, it was even more of a disaster. The molybdenum melted into a ball…"</br>
</br>
"Is there no way of replicating it?" While pained by the idea, Director Qian asked.</br>
</br>
Little Wu shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Damage is too great."</br>
</br>
Whenever Director Qian thought about the person called Wang in Wanghai, he was furious. Although he was not as powerful as that guy, it still didn't stop his contempt.</br>
</br>
"So wasteful." He cursed out and shook his head before heading out the door, sighing.</br>
</br>
He needed to request to his superior to see if they could contact Future Group. If they could cooperate in virtual reality, it would be best.</br>
</br>
Though he knew that it would be a difficult process.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"The patent office has sent another person here, hoping we can complete the patent registration process to prevent other companies from stealing our intellectual property and future disputes."</br>
</br>
"Tell them that the company will take serious consideration on their recommendation, next."</br>
</br>
"Tencent wants to partner with us on virtual reality. They stated that if we could provide support on neutral connection—"</br>
</br>
"Next."</br>
</br>
Currently, Jiang Chen was sitting in front of his desk with both legs on the table while video chatting with Xia Shiyu. Perhaps he was feeling good about himself for he felt just like an emperor at his morning meeting.</br>
</br>
"Okay. Although I share the same thought with you, can you still just let me finish reporting?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu put down the documents and let out a sigh as Jiang Chen continuously interrupted her.</br>
</br>
But from the curvature formed by her lips, her mood was particularly pleasant right now.</br>
</br>
As an ambitious woman, Future Technology was just like her kid. She felt no less achieved than Jiang Chen watching it grow into the giant it was today.</br>
</br>
Based on the highest valuation from venture capitals, Future Technology's market cap was estimated to be over one hundred billion dollars. Compared to the ten billion last year, it increased ten times. And as the Miss CEO with 1% of the company's shares, her net worth rose exponentially to one billion USD.</br>
</br>
Just one year ago, it was something she never dared to imagine.</br>
</br>
She still remembered that night. Jiang Chen had inexplicable confidence when he said:</br>
</br>
"Currently, the company is still in its planning phase, don't you feel excited? You'll be the new Steve Jobs and I. I will become the new Bill Gates!"</br>
</br>
She still vividly remembered how she doubted him.</br>
</br>
But now looking back, his confidence was not "without reason". He did become the Hua Bill Gates, and in Wall Street's view, he even exceeded Bill Gates. Future Technology expanded from a small company in an apartment to a one hundred billion dollar company. It only took him one year.</br>
</br>
"Is there something else you need to report?" Jiang Chen leisurely sunk into his chair and asked.</br>
</br>
Only 17 days left before internal testing is over and the virtual reality experience store will expand worldwide. In four months time, people will gain an initial understanding of Future Technology. Then they would use the hype to put Phantom online before raking in the cash.</br>
</br>
"Currently, I have released preorders for half a million helmets with a price of 1000 USD. They were all gone in three minutes. Players who didn't manage to purchase a helmet hoped we could release another half a million units."</br>
</br>
Taking out the 500 USD cost, a profit of 250 million in three minutes was extremely exciting.</br>
</br>
"Then release another half a million units." Jiang Chen said in excitement.</br>
</br>
</br>
"My recommendation is to release half a million units at the beginning of every month," with Jiang Chen's excitement, Xia Shiyu covered her mouth and began to giggle, "releasing high amounts would lower the price of the product in consumer minds. Only a hungry market is an energetic market."</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu finished, Jiang Chen blanked out.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong with what I said?" Seeing Jiang Chen was silent, Xia Shiyu was confused.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and laughed without being serious.</br>
</br>
"It's nothing, I just feel you like to smile more now compared to before."</br>
</br>
Now it was Xia Shiyu who blanked out.</br>
</br>
"Really?" Xia Shiyu touched her own face.</br>
</br>
But when she noticed the joking expression on Jiang Chen's face, she blushed and closed the camera.</br>
</br>
"Ahem!" She coughed loudly as she sat up straight in front of the computer forcing herself to put on a serious expression, "let's continue with what we just talked about… umm, where was I?"</br>
</br>
Although there was no camera, Jiang Chen still imagined how she looked as he couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
"Preorder."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Right, preorder…"</br>
</br>
The entire conference was done with a black screen.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen requested multiple times to turn on the camera, Xia Shiyu refused with the excuse that it would distract her from work.</br>
</br>
[Is this girl being shy?]</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that was the likely cause.</br>
</br>
He shut the computer, stretched his body, and headed to his bedroom.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was already mid-September, As the attack on the city center was about to commence, it was time to go back.</br>
</br>
When he headed to the warehouse on the south end of Coro Island, Jiang Chen put on the bracelet and was prepared to send the warehouse full of food back to the apocalypse when he discovered that the interdimensional teleportation device no longer functioned.</br>
</br>
Although slightly downed by the mishap, the storage dimension still had a size of 300 cubic meters. So after a few trips, he finally emptied the warehouse.</br>
</br>
It costed some extra crystals, but he didn't mind.</br>
</br>
Like usual, he ordered Wang Qin to arrange for the storage of the food. Jiang Chen then went to Lin Lin's lab to see Lin Lin who was working between vials.</br>
</br>
"What are you working on?"</br>
</br>
"Fuel. Your Aerospace Technology Research Institute requires fuel with higher combustion time and higher energy and I happen to have some knowledge in this area, so I am helping them out. So, what do you need from me?" Lin Lin swirled a suspicious looking clear liquid in a test tube while she said proudly.</br>
</br>
"Your interdimensional mass teleportation device seems to be having problems." Jiang Chen took out the bracelet and put it on the desk.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible." Lin Lin raised her eyebrows and put the test tube on the rack, and then picked up the plastic bracelet.</br>
</br>
She entered into deep thought while examining the bracelet.</br>
</br>
Then, she abruptly walked in front of a table as if she had thought of something and took out a rubric cube-sized cube.</br>
</br>
"Put this into your sub-dimension." Lin Lin walked back in front of Jiang Chen and passed the item to him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen threw it into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"And then?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin didn't respond but instead walked to testing equipment on the other side of the room, and then opened a device similar to a radio.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"Klein Particle Resonance Receiver. The cube could return the coordinates of its location, as well as the image… how is this possible." Lin Lin stared at the waves in rhythm in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows in confusion, staring at the electrocardiogram lines.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"It is not a question of what happened… Your sub-dimension became a universe? Although it is just a mini one." Lin Lin's eyes were flushed with excitement.</br>
</br>
"I call it the small universe."</br>
</br>
"I don't care what it's called. This is a miracle in the field of physics… a sub-dimension created by gravity could give birth to physics principles, this is unbelievable."</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying." Jiang Chen looked at the exhilarated Lin Lin while he facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Ahh, don't worry, you don't need to mind the details. There is nothing wrong with my device! I just need to change the coordinates before it can be used." Then, Lin Lin threw the bracelet back into Jiang Chen's lap.</br>
</br>
"It is good now?"</br>
</br>
"It is good."</br>
</br>
"Then what are you doing now?" Lin Lin was eagerly working in front of a computer and completely forgot what she was working on before.</br>
</br>
"I'm collecting data, or put it in simple terms, I'm studying your small universe!" Lin Lin said in excitement.</br>
</br>
"Is there any purpose to that?" Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"The purpose is, maybe because of my research, you could travel with people," Lin Lin said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen held his breath.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh, are you not surprised?" Seeing Jiang Chen didn't say anything, Lin Lin proudly glanced at him.</br>
</br>
"I'm shocked… or rather, amazed! If you could really develop a way for me to travel with people, I promise an endless amount of pudding." Jiang Chen was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
He promised Sun Jiao that if there were an opportunity, he would definitely take her to see his world, visit his school, and look at where he lived before…</br>
</br>
Not only that, if he could bring people to travel, he could further gather the technology in this world, and utilize the rich resources in the other world to easily conquer both worlds.</br>
</br>
"Pudding from all over the world." Lin Lin was afraid that Jiang Chen would forget their promise as she immediately corrected him.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, anything!" He laughed.</br>
</br>
With billions in assets, the pudding was nothing to worry about it.</br>
</br>
She smiled cheerfully, but just as she was going to say something, she bent down and began to cough.</br>
</br>
"Are you okay?" Jiang Chen rushed up to see what was wrong.</br>
</br>
"It's nothing." When Jiang Chen touched her arm, Lin Lin's pupils instantly turned red but quickly returned to normal.</br>
</br>
She moved back and avoided Jiang Chen's hands. She took a few breaths and calmed down.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure you are okay?" He was concerned.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry." Lin Lin covered her left eye with the other handing pushing him away, "All in all, you can leave now."</br>
</br>
"Are you sure?"</br>
</br>
"I'm sure, Just go."</br>
</br>
Although it hurt to be pushed out, Jiang Chen still listened to Lin Lin's request and left her room and closed the door for her.</br>
</br>
[Is she really okay?]</br>
</br>
With the door closed shut, Jiang Chen muttered in his mind.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Lin Lin concerned him or even gave him an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
And at that moment, the Klein particles flooding out dispersed from city center like a soundless cry.</br>
</br>
The last cry.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 473: Inflation?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A strange phenomenon had appeared in the Sixth Street market lately, as to what it was…</br>
</br>
"4 crystals for a kilogram? Why don't you go rob the bank?" A mercenary with a piece of gold in his hand shouted beside the store.</br>
</br>
The merchant yawned and then glanced at the survivor.</br>
</br>
"Does the explosive to blow the vault open not cost money? Does it not cost money to transport it back? Gold is not that easy to find. I met a Death Claw still breathing in the basement. That's enough. If you're not going to buy it, just leave. You won't be able to buy it later."</br>
</br>
After moments of hesitation, the mercenary still threw the crystals to the merchant and picked a few pieces of gold that weighed four kilograms. Although the gold had PAC's specification on it, it was better to be safe.</br>
</br>
The merchant picked up the crystal and confirmed it was 16 crystals on the detector before he put the crystals away.</br>
</br>
The mercenary looked at the gold in his hand in pain, but he still covered it up before leaving in quick steps.</br>
</br>
Four crystals per kilogram was cheap for gold. As to why? Canned food was worth ten crystals. One kilogram of gold was only enough to buy a pack of instant noodles.</br>
</br>
But from the expression on the mercenary's face, he was still displeased with the price.</br>
</br>
He certainly had his reasons.</br>
</br>
Since for the people on the wasteland, gold really didn't serve a purpose. The amount used in the industrial process could be recycled through other electronic parts. When the apocalypse just arrived, people did indeed hoard a lot of gold, but those people pretty much all died out due to starvation.</br>
</br>
The reason why gold was valuable was due to its rarity, anti-corrosive nature, and its agreed upon value. With a population of billions in the PAC, gold indeed possessed value. But in a world where it was questionable if there were a billion people, if the total amount of gold were divided among everyone, everyone would net at least a few kilograms if not more, did gold still possess value?</br>
</br>
The answer was obviously no.</br>
</br>
But even then, why did the mercenary still use his crystals to exchange for gold?</br>
</br>
The reason being that there were too many crystals in the Sixth Street right now!</br>
</br>
The NAC's destruction of Wanghai did indeed frighten the survivors of the Sixth Street with its glorious scene. Half a city of zombies and mutants were wiped out was a scene as horrific as actual hell.</br>
</br>
And then they were shocked by NAC's generosity again.</br>
</br>
The crystals belonged to whoever picked them up as long as they hand in 10% to the military government since the military government fired the rockets. It was hard to execute the task as it was mostly done at the gate. But since the tax amount was not high, the survivors were all cooperative. And with the existence of banks, it made auditing this much simpler.</br>
</br>
</br>
But even then, the survivors in the Sixth Street all won the lottery.</br>
</br>
The diligent could make 700 a day, and the lazy could easily make 400. Mutant bodies were everywhere. Without the need to fight, they only needed to use a knife to pick apart the burned charcoals.</br>
</br>
It was not only the survivors that made bank, but the NAC soldiers also participated in the looting process. It was not until half a month later did the zombies and mutants from the east side of the city migrate over.</br>
</br>
In just half a month, everyone had thousands, if not over ten thousand crystals in hand.</br>
</br>
If the number of crystals defined wealth, there were no poor people in the Sixth Street anymore.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street survivors were never this rich before, and this type of wealth was dangerous. The average wealth already far exceeded the number of products available in the market. Even if the Sixth Street factories worked at full capacity for ten years, they could not consume all the crystals.</br>
</br>
Subsequently, a period of hyperinflation occurred. The price of canned food rose from 10 crystals to 50 and continued to be sold out. The steel that depreciated due to the second expedition rose to its peak value of 100 crystals per ton, and that was when no steel was actually available.</br>
</br>
Then, luxury goods regained its value.</br>
</br>
Jewelry, gold, gems… all the things viewed as useless in the apocalypse reappeared on the market. A lot of soldiers, mercenaries, and soldiers with wealth in hand not only stored their crystals in the bank, but they all also chose to invest in gold and gems for future investment. Gold price skyrocketed from the initial price of 100 crystals per ton to four crystals per kilogram.</br>
</br>
Investing in gold was betting on the future. If the wasteland could restore its order, gold would eventually regain its value.</br>
</br>
It was just that when the World Alliance Organization launched the space colonization ships, it made most people's hope falter. But with the emergence of NAC, it made the survivors in Wanghai regain the confidence of order returning. Therefore the future of gold's value began to climb.</br>
</br>
Naturally, gold became more valuable.</br>
</br>
"It is not a good thing for everyone to become rich. Without enough products to meet the consumption of the survivors, a lot of people with abilities would spend the crystals elsewhere. Since crystal is a hard currency on the wasteland, while the life in Su or Hang might not be as good as here, ten thousand crystals would make you a wealthy man there."</br>
</br>
Inside the virtual conference room, Chu Nan stood in front of the table and reported the status quo of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Your plan is?" Jiang Chen rubbed his chin and asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"First, ensure the products are stably supplied."</br>
</br>
"Second, it is something we have to do regardless. Moderate inflation could stimulate economic growth, but hyperinflation could destroy the market. Inflation itself is not scary, but the scary thing is if we can't control the inflation," Chu Nan said.</br>
</br>
"You mean, we should introduce a currency?" Jiang Chen tried to guess Chu Nan's plan.</br>
</br>
"That's right. This is an urgent task." Chu Nan nodded.</br>
</br>
"Introduce a currency… What do we use as a guarantee?"</br>
</br>
'Gold? Too much. Not only among survivors, but there was too much in Wanghai. And although gold became valuable in the Sixth Street, outside of the province, it could not become a hard currency.'</br>
</br>
'The total global reserve was estimated to be 60 trillion tons and comparable to the iron reserve. Until 2005, a total of 8.9 trillion tons of reserve were identified, with 12.5 trillion tons extracted, god knows what the number was in 2171 before the war.'</br>
</br>
Chu Nan smiled mysteriously at Jiang Chen's question as he was clearly prepared.</br>
</br>
"General, please think carefully. What is something that has a stable demand, and we have control over its quantity?"</br>
</br>
Demand? Control?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a second before he suddenly realized.</br>
</br>
"Is it… food?"</br>
</br>
"That's right! We can use food as a guarantee!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 474: Issuing Currency</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, there was a long line up in front of the Sixth Street Bank.</br>
</br>
Under the supervision of NAC soldiers, people handed in their crystals and changed them into papers with a special identification code. Some even walked out empty handed.</br>
</br>
Is the NAC government robbing people?</br>
</br>
Clearly not. Due to a culture that praised power, all the survivors possessed guns. And from people rushing in with an expression afraid that the bank wouldn't accept their crystals, they clearly wanted to be inside. And the NAC soldiers that looked threatening were ensuring order in the line.</br>
</br>
As to the reason, it had to do with a newly implemented policy.</br>
</br>
To change the current chaotic pricing environment on the Sixth Street market, the NAC government used the Sixth Street bank to introduce a new currency known as "credit point", credit in short. It was not guaranteed by any precious metal. Instead, it was guaranteed by NAC's credit.</br>
</br>
At the same time, any of the products defined as specially supplied could only be traded with credit. The products were all made through NAC factories. For example, food, Carm tree sap, iron, aluminum, firearms, etc. It covered almost all the necessities of life.</br>
</br>
A kilogram of rice was ten credits, a compressed cracker was two credits, a kilogram of flour was 16 credits… Although the price doubled compared to a month ago, in the currently chaotic market, the price was indeed thoughtful.</br>
</br>
Two crystals were equivalent to one credit, and credit point exchanging back to crystals had a 10% tax to it. In mid-September, the Sixth Street planned to introduce 5 million credits and the NAC government promise to provide 500 tons of rice, 100 tons of flour, and 100 thousand pieces of compressed crackers to the market by next spring.</br>
</br>
The rights for the food trade in Wanghai was taken back from Zhao Corporation and controlled by the market established by the NAC government at the west gate of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The quantity of the credits introduced was a decision made after careful deliberation between Jiang Chen and Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
The paper bills had the amount of 1, 5, 10, 100, with a total of 3 million credits distributed. 5 million virtual credits were released and recorded with the DNA sequence of the individual and used with EP implemented with the "credit trade chip." All data was stored in the bank's database, and virtual trades must be done in NAC jurisdictions with information relay stations.</br>
</br>
The employees in the military zone of NAC would be paid in credits to prevent the depreciation of crystals impacting the net worth of its employees.</br>
</br>
The introduction of credit received extensive support from the Sixth Street merchants.</br>
</br>
The merchants were all smart people. They knew that only the existence of order would allow for their assets to continually appreciate and to prevent everything they own from becoming worthless the next day.</br>
</br>
</br>
To the merchants with a high amount of crystals, Jiang Chen opened an exclusive channel for them with a total of 8 million credits dedicated to them to collect the crystals depreciating in their hands. The specially introduced credits would be stored in the merchant's account. Jiang Chen also outlined that before November of this year, 90% of the special credits could not enter the market. 50% would be made available after November before lifting the restriction in January of next year. This would prevent a large amount of currency from flooding the market and disturbing the price.</br>
</br>
The introduction of credits marked the end of the era where goods were traded for goods in the Wanghai area.</br>
</br>
The crystal detector commonly found on the streets would gradually become part of history. With the credits, people would choose to trade with EPs, just like how people paid with their phone in the 21st century.</br>
</br>
Not only this, Jiang Chen planned to push the "NAC standard" to other places.</br>
</br>
Use the invisible fulcrum known as Economics to lift the resources of the wasteland. Just like in the other world, where the USD used gold and oil to kidnap the world economy. Credits would use the prosperity of the Sixth Street and the food storage of the NAC to control all trades on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
The specifics were demonstrated by the Zhao Corporation changing their crystal strategy and use NAC credits to charge for goods. Crystals would become one of the products and no longer used as a trade equivalent.</br>
</br>
Although the survivors outside of the province had no concept of credits and bills, with the passage of time and more merchants heading out of the Sixth Street, the currency would one day become the currency of the world.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Followed by the introduction of credits, NAC government had a huge storage of crystals. After thorough auditing, Wang Qin put a report on Jiang Chen's desk.</br>
</br>
"No wonder the government loves to print currency, it is a much faster way to make money than taxes." Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
Just from three days, the NAC treasury expanded by 38 million crystals; comparable to one year of NAC's total food trade.</br>
</br>
"But we also distributed 16 million credits. Rather than saying this money belongs to us, it was more fitting to say we borrowed it from the market." Wang Qin was worried that Jiang Chen would start to mass print currency, so she warned him, "If we cannot supply the products we promised by next spring, we may face a credit bankruptcy."</br>
</br>
But her concern was clearly extraneous. Jiang Chen knew clearly the harm of inflation. As to why, he had personally experienced it before…</br>
</br>
"Don't worry." Jiang Chen smiled. "Out of the total currency amount, only a small amount will be used in the exchange for products. Most of the currency will flow into the market. As long as we can prove that the food supply is sufficient and stable, we don't have to worry about a bank run. Rather than saying the market let us burrow the crystals, I think it is more of a "protection fee" the market gave us.</br>
</br>
Rather than saying it was the NAC's food and production that guaranteed the currency, it was more appropriate to say it was the NAC government's credit.</br>
</br>
Just like precious metals in the 21st century was the guarantee for paper bills, only rarely did people use stacks of bills in exchange for precious metals. When people believed in the stability of the country, people would be in favor of holding its currency.</br>
</br>
NAC government would control the market for food and the amount of currency circulating on the market. There was no need to worry that the currency would lose control.</br>
</br>
Distributing credit was only part of it. Jiang Chen planned to use the Sixth Street bank to lend out 10 million credits in total to encourage the factories to increase production.</br>
</br>
The mutants and zombies on the west side of the city were completely wiped out and the plan to wipe out the east side was in progress. The situation in areas surrounding the Sixth Street was never so slack before and it was the perfect opportunity to expand out!</br>
</br>
After Wang Qin left, Han Junhua came into the office.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't need to ask to know the intention of her visit.</br>
</br>
It was mid-September already and the plan to attack the city center was about to commence.</br>
</br>
"The plan of attack will require the mobilization of First Corps and part of Third Corps. A total of 3000 personnel, 41 power armors, 400 kinetic skeletons, 9 Tiger IIs, 40 armored vehicles will be involved. This is the plan of attack." Han Junhua with crisp motions put the tablet on Jiang Chen's table.</br>
</br>
The hologram expanded and outlined the map of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
The First Corps would move from Qingpu and attack the area near the Qingpu airport. Then this will become the starting point of attacks on the city center. The Third Corps would attack the city center from the west through Camp 27.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the artillery in the Fishbone base will provide support.</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, Jiang Chen inputted his fingerprint onto the screen.</br>
</br>
"Let the battle begin!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 475"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 475: Start of the Battle</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The artillery support consisted of eight trucks modified into "Fireball-1" launchers. The previous BM-21s that Jiang Chen bought from Russia quickly went obsolete.</br>
</br>
Just in terms of combustion, Fireball-1 had combustion energy twice that of BM-21 and a combustion time that was three times longer. At the same time, its accuracy was higher.</br>
</br>
Other than the combustion rockets and bombs, the Aerospace Research Technology Institute led by Jiang Lin explored their imagination and designed various laser explosive missiles, EMP missiles, and other futurist weapons.</br>
</br>
EMP missiles were simple to explain. Once exploded, all electronic equipment in the area would be rendered useless or destroyed.</br>
</br>
And the power of the explosive laser missile was not to be underestimated. The missile would be launched into the air before exploding into countless high energy beams. The power laser damage dealt a considerable amount of damage to any target. Under the shower of multiple missiles, the scene would be as glorious as a massive storm.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen contracted out the shell of the rocket to private military factories in the Sixth Street, the number of rockets held in NAC's reserve far exceeded the 1000 target Jiang Chen had set a month ago.</br>
</br>
Thousands of giant rockets stacked together on the launching ground at the Aerospace Technology Research Institute with the artillery soldiers under the direct command of the advisory department carefully loading the rockets into the launchers.</br>
</br>
Right now, Jiang Chen stood beside the launcher with a tablet in his hand while he listened to Jiang Lin's instructions.</br>
</br>
"The details of each vehicle launch status is here along with the internal temperature of the launcher and the number of the ammunition. The tablet can be used to target the coverage fire area and the number of rockets launched. The projectile motion will be calculated with the smart program. After completing all the input specifications, just print your finger beside it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen intriguingly rubbed his chin looking at the red circle beside the tablet.</br>
</br>
"The automatic ammunition loading program is still under design. It won't be completed until some time later. Just use this for now."</br>
</br>
"Not bad. A reserve of 5100 rounds of rockets, 1000 bombs, 151 laser explosive missiles… no EMP?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No. The command office ordered us to prioritize the production of combustion rockets. Isn't this an attack against mutants? EMP is useless against creatures."</br>
</br>
It didn't take long for all the launchers to be loaded. The soldiers all backed five meters away, dragging the ammo boxes with them.</br>
</br>
On the command tablet, the First Corps and Third Corps were marked with blue dots, approaching the city center. The scanned out red dots were zombies and mutants, behaving aggressively. Just from the map, Cheng Weiguo was approaching Wanghai Airport.</br>
</br>
</br>
With his finger sliding on the screen, he drew out a circle. Just like a life restricted zone, it included all the mutants in the airport.</br>
</br>
"It feels like I'm casting a spell." With his finger hovering above the launch button, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"And it is the forbidden spell." The designer of the weapon Jiang Lin laughed along.</br>
</br>
With a finger on the red circle, the scanning waves ripped through the screen and the merciless words appeared.</br>
</br>
Fireball-1 attack group launched.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the launch ground was engulfed by the exhaust left by the ascending combustion rockets.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Outside of Wanghai airport, the heavy metal symphony was playing.</br>
</br>
After a few days of rain, the burning marks left on the street were beginning to fade. The dried up corpses under the weather turned to dust.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the tranquil streets were broken by engines homing and yellow shells.</br>
</br>
Tiger IIs crushed the corpses with its mighty force and the charged cannon released its prowess, shredding the heads of Roshans into bits. The zombies and mutants on the east side of the city spread to the city center again. However, the concentration was at a normal level.</br>
</br>
The machine gun on the top continuously unleashed its bullets as they trampled the zombies on the highway. Zombies without forming into a sizable group would not pose a threat to tanks.</br>
</br>
Most of the risks faced by the First Corps were from the dark alley and the shattered windows of the stores. A lot of zombies in there remained inside, and the zombies from the east were mixed among them.</br>
</br>
"Follow up."</br>
</br>
Feng Yu in kinetic skeleton fired with his right hand while his left hand signaled his team to move forward.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, heinous zombies flooded out from a side street and tumbled toward his team.</br>
</br>
"Grenade!"</br>
</br>
A soldier ripped off the grenade in front of his chest and threw it toward the swarm of zombies rushing out.</br>
</br>
Fire, explosion, and chunks of meat flew toward the team.</br>
</br>
Feng Yu shook them off before raising his rifle to fire back.</br>
</br>
Firing in close range meant that only explosive grenades can be used instead of combustion grenades, or the burning zombies would be catastrophic to other creatures. To the zombies with their limbs exploded off, the soldiers finished them off with one more bullet. Or they stepped on them as most of the soldiers were injected with the genetic vaccine could crush the corroded skull of the zombies.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, there are more and more zombies in the front!"</br>
</br>
With the opportunity to exchange clips, Feng Yu scanned the EP on his left arm.</br>
</br>
The drones marked out the zombies in the area as the dense red dots made his skull feel numb.</br>
</br>
But he would not back down, because he was an upper citizen of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
He finally climbed to that level today. He was only one step away from being a knight, he was not going to back down!</br>
</br>
"It's a Death Claw!" Suddenly, a shout came through the radio.</br>
</br>
A lizard on its feet, waving its claw, rushed out from the street nearby with a soldier struggling to break free from its mouth. From its wrinkled skin, it should be a Death Claw that survived last month's attack.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!" The face that was slowly losing life chilled Feng Yu.</br>
</br>
Without hesitating, he immediately ordered the team to move back while firing at the head of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
"Grenade!"</br>
</br>
Grenades alone could not kill the Death Claw. At most, it could suppress its movement.</br>
</br>
A sharp claw shredded the smoke of the explosion as the grenade hurt it, but it didn't die.</br>
</br>
The Death Claw tumbled toward their direction as its two claws waved in front of it. Just as it was about to touch Feng Yu, its throat was clamped by a powerful hand that forcefully turned it by 90 degrees, and smashed into the concrete wall.</br>
</br>
"ROARRRR!"</br>
</br>
The Death Claw let out its last roar with its sharp claws leaving a series of deafening screeches on the C grade steel.</br>
</br>
But against the T-4 power armor, a dying Death Claw's attack was more like a scratch.</br>
</br>
With a hand like an iron claw, the minigun fired and the close distance shooting penetrated the head of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
"You owe me a life, buddy."</br>
</br>
The power armor threw down the Death Claw and pumped the steel plate on its chest before it continued to move with its tactical rifle.</br>
</br>
The armored vehicles began grouping together on the road. The zombies in the area were cleared out, and they didn't encounter any dangers upon arriving at the airport.</br>
</br>
Breathing heavily, with his rifle lowered, Feng Yu looked at the Death Claw on the ground still shaken by what had happened.</br>
</br>
"Captain, what are we going to do next?" An infantry moved beside Feng Yu while panting.</br>
</br>
"Continue to move—, wait, alert from the command office." With the flashing symbol on the EP, Feng Yu immediately stopped his comrade from moving forward.</br>
</br>
The fleet stopped moving, and the power armor dashing in front also stopped and enacted a defensive stance.</br>
</br>
Feng Yu raised his head and looked at the clear sky.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, hundreds of sharp arrows soared through while dragging long trails of smokes, heading toward the airport.</br>
</br>
The bright red flame ascended into the air and the thick smoke hid away the airport.</br>
</br>
"Combustion rockets…"</br>
</br>
"Our artillery!"</br>
</br>
A soldier put down his gun while staring blankly at the sky. Feng Yu who was gazing at the flames shooting up did the same. He quietly watched the fireworks.</br>
</br>
When the smoke dispersed, only the ground scorching in fire remained.</br>
</br>
The soldiers raised their rifles up high, and loud cheers erupted.</br>
</br>
With the cover fire of the rockets, the First Corps with boosted morale stepped onto the road again. They headed towards the last territory that blocked them from reaching the city center.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 476: Target Locked</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Geosynchronous orbit.</br>
</br>
36000 kilometers away from the surface of the earth was a zone devoid of life.</br>
</br>
Steel, plastic, and unexploded rockets floated around in the quiet space. Among the debris was an aircraft carrier-sized space station.</br>
</br>
The God's Cane.</br>
</br>
It was completed in 2025 and was continually refined throughout the century to become the massive giant it was today. It turned from a sky-based weapon satellite to a sky-based weapon platform.</br>
</br>
The dodecagon metal rings kept the tungsten rods in place while they quietly floated beside the space station just like a loaded revolver. An electromagnetic push would allow the tungsten rods weighing several tons to fall at speeds faster than meteors with a horrifying amount of kinetic energy.</br>
</br>
Other than the tungsten rods, there were laser arrays and an HPM weapon in front. In the back were wireless electricity receivers powered by the nuclear fusion power plant built on the moon. When power from the moon wasn't available, it could use its foldable solar panel to generate electricity. The eight engines located on the space station could allow the weapon platform to move between the geosynchronous and low-earth orbits to alter its target area.</br>
</br>
It was like the Sword of Damocles hovering over the CCCP and PAC's heads.</br>
</br>
But ironically, the "suppressive weapon" that cost generations of taxpayer money was conquered by PAC's fearless Space Special Forces with their undying battle spirit at the beginning of the war.</br>
</br>
"Power system repaired." Lin Chaoen grinned before he wiped his forehead although he didn't sweat and there was no point in speaking in a vacuum.</br>
</br>
It had taken him a month's time and a lot of energy to repair this. Bodies floated in the space station because of the lack of gravity, and all the bodies still looked the same as when they died. Outside of the cockpit, he met a sentry robot still with power. But with his laser sword, he quickly resolved the problem.</br>
</br>
"Tungsten rod launch device: functional… This is so troublesome. Whatever, it's fine if I only use it once." Lin Chaoen stared at the warning symbols on the screen and clapped his hands with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
There was only one tungsten rod left. The few remaining ones either flew out of the geosynchronous orbit or crashed into the ocean when the space station had fallen. Others were floating in orbit thousands of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The sky-based weapon platform was completely destroyed. When PAC gained control of the platform, the NATO commander immediately initiated self-destruction to turn the space station into a land of death. The sprint to sacrifice wasn't any country's specialty - on the brink of collapse, any creature would subconsciously make the "correct choice."</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, the right choice was often made after a series of "wrong choices."</br>
</br>
</br>
Therefore, creatures are troublesome.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen shook his head and pressed a few buttons on the touchscreen.</br>
</br>
He was fortunate to obtain some of the blueprints of the sky-based weapon to make some of the parts on the ground. While most of the God's Cane was destroyed, it could still perform simple firing actions.</br>
</br>
"It can only fire now?"</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen scanned a map of Wanghai City as he looked at the screen with a smile.</br>
</br>
In the picture, NAC soldiers were firing at zombies and mutants. Afterward, countless combustion rockets littered the battlefield and engulfed the mutants and zombies at the airport in a blaze.</br>
</br>
"Nice fireworks. They already established order… Then could I consider them naturals?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
As he watched the flames on the screen with a smile, flickers of images were reflected in his pupils.</br>
</br>
The screen moved with the crosshairs targeted at the artillery grounds. Jiang Chen, on the target screen, was pointing at his tablet.</br>
</br>
"And you are Harmony."</br>
</br>
The screen was focused in the city center onto the giant tree floating in the water. The rumbling meat chuck seemed to possess a tremendous amount of energy.</br>
</br>
[Which threat's bigger?]</br>
</br>
There was only one bullet in the revolver.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen watched the battle with a God-eye view as he fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
From the cleansing courtesy of the combustion rockets, the First and Third Corps didn't encounter any resistance before converging at the airstrip in Wanghai Airport.</br>
</br>
Although the airstrip was bombed into jagged patches and was now burned pitch-black as a result, it would still be usable after some repairs. Jiang Chen ordered Fallout Shelter 027 to research fighter jet technology earlier and they came up with some initial results.</br>
</br>
Wanghai airport was perfect as a base for the NAC fighter jets.</br>
</br>
After some restocking, the converged divisions once again headed out. With the support of the soaring rockets, they continued to push towards the city center.</br>
</br>
Along the way, they encountered a Thrower, Death Claw, and even a horrific Bug Vehicle, but they didn't stop marching forward.</br>
</br>
They pushed forward while destroying mutant nests along the way. When they met a Bug Vehicle or Roshan, electromagnetic cannons took care of the problem. When the mutants swarmed together, they called on support from the artillery. When they found mutant nests hidden among the ruins, they sent the infantry to clear out the area.</br>
</br>
They destroyed a total of 91 mutant nests, encountered 371 reproducing mutants and cleared out all irregular life signals from the map.</br>
</br>
When they approached the forbidden zone, the radiation level gradually climbed. The soldiers took out their protective suits from the trucks and put on breathing masks to push forward.</br>
</br>
Tatata-</br>
</br>
Sparks emerged and shells dropped. Feng Yu pulled on the trigger calmly while moving forward under the cover fire of the armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
"What's this?"</br>
</br>
A soldier stared at the luminescent lake among the ruins in the far distance.</br>
</br>
"It's a nuclear crater - I think it's where Death Claw gives birth?" Another soldier's machine gun bullets swept across the zombies while he responded.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't look like one - there's water in the crater. I think Death Claw gives birth on land… Fu*k, what is that?"</br>
</br>
The mountain made of chunks of red meat was in the middle of the luminescent lake. The dense veins on the surface crossed the meat blob and moved rhythmically with the flow of blood. The bottom was infused into the lake surface just like a massive tree rooted into the ground.</br>
</br>
A meat bulb that could light up was hung by a tentacle.</br>
</br>
It was just like a light bulb.</br>
</br>
"This is team E. We identified an unknown creature, requesting artillery support. I repeat…"</br>
</br>
Feng Yu immediately raised his EP. Not letting his guard down, he reported the situation on the frontlines to the command office.</br>
</br>
A large amount of static noise filled the radio as a strong interference entered the area. Even the EP, known for its stability, started to blur.</br>
</br>
"Signal interference? Or is there still an EMP generator in the area?" The soldier beside Feng Yu reloaded his clip while he muttered.</br>
</br>
In the distance, rockets appeared again.</br>
</br>
Flames instantly engulfed the meat mountain. The rockets covering the sky not only cleansed the nuclear crater, but they even burned out an isolation zone to the east of the city center made of flames.</br>
</br>
But when the smoke began to fade, Feng Yu's eyes widened as he looked at the meat chunks in disbelief. He was so stunned that he forgot to press the trigger.</br>
</br>
The mutants all died, but the meat chunks…</br>
</br>
They were unscathed.</br>
</br>
How could that be possible!</br>
</br>
Before he could shout out, the meat chunks began to move.</br>
</br>
The light bulb on top began to turn red as it flashed an ominous light. The unknown particles moved restlessly in the air and concentrated together into a crimson ray. Even a cloud began to spread out due to the force the bulb was creating.</br>
</br>
It seemed prepared to shoot something!</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, all the electronic equipment in Wanghai experienceced interferencec to some extent.</br>
</br>
"Not working anymore?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked sternly at the tablet in his hands as the screen turned into a sparkling white. The connection to the frontlines was suddenly cut off and he didn't even know if the meat mountain was destroyed.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he felt like he was someone's target.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately raised his head and looked in the sky.</br>
</br>
A blinding white light flashed in the sky.</br>
</br>
Something was dropping down.</br>
</br>
36000 kilometers in distance disappeared instantly. The blinding white light dropped down and crashed to the city center's location.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows before his eyes widened in disbelief.</br>
</br>
For some reason, a word suddenly popped into his head along with an image that seemed familiar.</br>
</br>
The weapon that existed in virtual reality.</br>
</br>
The God's Cane!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 477: The God's Cane</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The ring hovering in the sky began to move.</br>
</br>
A button was pressed just like a revolver's trigger.</br>
</br>
A blue arching light flashed and something escaped it, falling straight to the ground.</br>
</br>
On earth, it was as small as a feather, minuscule and thin. But the instant it entered the atmosphere, it transformed into a flaming dragon hundreds of meters long, roaring at the earth. It lit up the sky like a sun rising at dawn, even though the sun was already in the sky.</br>
</br>
It was just as the Genesis described the scene of Jehovah's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah: "And when Lot reached Zoar, the sun came out, and the Lord rained down sulfur and fire from heaven. The city was destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah along with all the inhabitants of the city and all the earth was destroyed; the wife of Rhodes looked back at it before turning into a salt rod."</br>
</br>
When the fire touched down on the surface, there was no sound in space. The swirling trail of fire was engraved on the blue planet. The flame, thousands of degrees in temperature, was burning. The violent shockwave swept through everything and turned everything around it to dust.</br>
</br>
And the meat chunks in the middle of the explosion turned into dust long ago.</br>
</br>
Just like slapping a mosquito.</br>
</br>
Right now, in the building of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, a man in a suit on the top floor gazed in Wanghai City's direction.</br>
</br>
"With this, Wanghai will be a mess again."</br>
</br>
With a smile, he turned around and left.</br>
</br>
Right now, inside the space station, Lin Chaoen witnessed everything with the same smile.</br>
</br>
You dared to aim at the God? Then I'll have to kill you first.</br>
</br>
He looked at the shockwave dispersing. He raised his right hand and with his thumb and index finger up, he made a shooting gesture.</br>
</br>
"Nice shot."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"This is First Corps command office. Team E, please respond. I repeat, please respond…"</br>
</br>
The noise-filled communication was fitting among the ruins.</br>
</br>
A breeze swept by and blew away the soil on the broken walls.</br>
</br>
The debris began to move as a hand reached out among the ruins.</br>
</br>
"Uh….ah!" With a deep roar, he tossed away the rock on his chest.</br>
</br>
The protective suit was broken - it would be the end of him if he stayed any longer in the vicinity with such high radiation.</br>
</br>
He could already smell the sweetness in the air.</br>
</br>
It was a sign of excessive radiation.</br>
</br>
Without staying any longer, Feng Yu climbed up from the ruins while shaking to free his leg stuck in the debris.</br>
</br>
His kinetic skeleton was half-destroyed. The joints were sparkling with fire while they made deafening screeching noises.</br>
</br>
The polyethylene board in front of his chest was completely shattered while the metal frame connecting the boards was caved in. He ripped the board against his chest off, looked at the crack with a lingering fear, then tossed it on the ground.</br>
</br>
</br>
The meat chunks and the lake were no longer there; only a deep pit remained.</br>
</br>
There was chaos everywhere.</br>
</br>
The meteor destroyed the meat chunks and everything around.</br>
</br>
Just as Feng Yu was preparing to leave, he heard some noises around him which made him immediately pull out his pistol.</br>
</br>
"He…Help me… ahhhh!"</br>
</br>
It was his comrade's voice.</br>
</br>
He put the pistol away while he stumbled in the direction of the voice.</br>
</br>
"Feng…"</br>
</br>
"Don't talk and give me your hand. We'll be done for if we stay here much longer." With strength from the kinetic skeleton, Feng Yu moved the rock on his comrade's body. When he saw the clearly crushed left leg, he paused.</br>
</br>
"Whatever, just leave me, if you stay longer..."</br>
</br>
"Shut up, hold on!" Feng Yu gritted his teeth while pulling out his dagger.</br>
</br>
"No, no! Just end me- ahhh."</br>
</br>
Feng Yu cut off his comrade's broken leg before pulling out the hemostatic spray and spraying it on the severed part.</br>
</br>
The soldier's expression was terrifying. Blood spilled out from his mouth and his twitching throat couldn't make any sounds.</br>
</br>
"You'll be better, don't worry. I heard the director of the Aerospace Institute is a master in prosthetics." Feng Yu lifted him up and supported him with his arm before running with trembling steps.</br>
</br>
There was a horrific scene along the way.</br>
</br>
The First Crops' leading team was almost completely wiped out and the subsequent force was hit hard by the impact. The high-temperature shockwave almost swept through the entire city center. Some of the armored vehicles were crushed flat by the rocks blown from the center of impact.</br>
</br>
Standing in the middle of the launching ground, Jiang Chen looked at the light in the distance, completely stunned.</br>
</br>
The light already disappeared.</br>
</br>
The wind blowing by carried a faint smell of explosives coming from the frontlines.</br>
</br>
"Did an earthquake just happen?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin gulped and turned his head.</br>
</br>
"Probably."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked back at the tablet again; it was still white in the city center. But soon after, communication from the frontlines came back.</br>
</br>
"This is the First Crops, we were hit by a meteor… Dammit, I swore it wasn't a meteor." Cheng Weiguo's voice was screeching and hectic.</br>
</br>
"Report casualty figures," Jiang Chen said with a deep voice.</br>
</br>
"We're calculating. We can confirm that 2 Tigers and 11 armored vehicles lost contact… Dammit, the mutants are attacking-"</br>
</br>
A noise came from the radio and Jiang Chen immediately made some orders.</br>
</br>
"Immediately retreat from the city center to Camp 27. Fireball-1 will cover for you."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Cheng Weiguo responded.</br>
</br>
Communications ended as Jiang Chen looked at the launch interface again.</br>
</br>
Eight Fireball-1 launch vehicles were locked and loaded. He stuck out his finger and drew a curve on the northeast side of the First Division to surround all the red dots.</br>
</br>
After confirming that the blue dots had left the area, Jiang Chen pressed fire.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The rockets launched one by one and began to soar toward the city center to cut off the path of the mutants and zombies.</br>
</br>
Seeing the First and Third Corps moving further and further away from the red dots, Jiang Chen finally felt somewhat relieved.</br>
</br>
Although the battle ended with a retreat, no mutant nest could've survived through the meteor strike. Even though they retreated, they still achieved their objective.</br>
</br>
The life detection device scanned the area again. Just as he expected, the unnatural red dots located in the city center vanished. The internal stress produced by the tungsten rods striking the ground should've been fatal to the underground structure.</br>
</br>
They only needed to get rid of the smaller mutant nests scattered around the city and establish stations at the entrances to Wanghai City before the mutant crisis in Wanghai could be resolved.</br>
</br>
But just as Jiang Chen was starting to feel relieved, his tablet suddenly started to flash.</br>
</br>
"Who is it?"</br>
</br>
"Hello, we meet again."</br>
</br>
A face surfaced in the middle of the screen and Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Lin Chaoen?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, I'm happy you still remember me, Lord of Wanghai." Lin Chaoen smiled.</br>
</br>
[Lord?]</br>
</br>
It was fitting, but Jiang Chen felt it was a jab at him.</br>
</br>
"Whenever I see your face, I want to smash it against the wall." Jiang Chen raised his head while looking down at the screen.</br>
</br>
"What a pity. I do enjoy looking at your face, especially when I'm looking down on it." Lin Chaoen smiled.</br>
</br>
[Looking down?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and subconsciously looked up at the sky with his expression turning violent.</br>
</br>
How do you feel?"</br>
</br>
"Terrible," Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"I have a recommendation for you," Lin Chaoen said.</br>
</br>
"Speak your mind."</br>
</br>
"You can rule the humans while I rule the digitalized humans. We can conquer the wasteland together as long as you swear allegiance to my father."</br>
</br>
[Together?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scoffed.</br>
</br>
"Did you evolve into advanced artificial intelligence?"</br>
</br>
"That's still far, far away." Lin Chaoen sighed. "I heard my father say that I had a sister before. After trillions and trillions of calculations, her thought process infinitely approached advanced artificial intelligence. But unfortunately, when I arrived at Fallout Shelter 005, she was destroyed by a bug."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils contracted slightly.</br>
</br>
The Secret Teller and The Secret Protector, or X71291… Rather than saying it was destroyed by a bug, it was more fitting to say he destroyed it with his very own hands.</br>
</br>
"A bug?" Jiang Chen pretended not to know.</br>
</br>
"That's right, the ambassador of Harmony. There's evidence indicating that it killed her." Lin Chaoen didn't look remorseful in the slightest as he explained with a smile. "So we need new samples. What's your decision?"</br>
</br>
"I reject," Jiang Chen said without hesitation. "Coexisting together is only a lie."</br>
</br>
Coexisting together was just one force putting the other force into captivity. Even if it could create a temporary peace, it was a fictitious peace. Once they figured out the path to evolving into advanced artificial intelligence, the old humans would lose their purpose and be forced to live in the zoo while awaiting their deaths.</br>
</br>
There was only brutality and blood on the path to evolving their civilization; there was no compromise!</br>
</br>
"Is that so? That's regretful to hear then. You are on the absolute path to purity. Compared to the fallen Harmony, you are only a bit stronger. Without accepting the evolution of the Supreme, you will have to wait to be eliminated because of your stubborn persistence."</br>
</br>
"Is it so? Why do I think you should be eliminated?"</br>
</br>
He had plenty of trump cards in his hand - he still had the Third Corps at the Sixth Street as well as the ballistic missiles deployed in Shenxiang Colony. At the same time, Shenxiang and Jia city had soldiers stationed along with new recruits and the survivors from the Defiant.</br>
</br>
The only trouble was the God's Cane hovering in the sky. He was certain Lin Chaoen controlled the God's Cane.</br>
</br>
Which was the biggest problem.</br>
</br>
And Lin Chaoen seemed to have read his mind.</br>
</br>
"We already surrounded your base and hijacked your base's radio signals. To us, your knowledge of information technology is a mere joke. You have two choices: surrender or death. Of course, I understand how slow your species' brains are, so I will give you three days to reconsider."</br>
</br>
His smile was mixed with menace. He raised one finger.</br>
</br>
"One day is enough time for an ant to circle your base."</br>
</br>
Afterwards Lin Chaoen waved his hand. Faced with Jiang Chen's gloomy expression, he ended communications.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The flashing light outside the window drew the attention of Lin Lin who was working in front of a lab bench.</br>
</br>
For some odd reason, watching the light outside made her restless.</br>
</br>
"A meteor? Should I make a wish?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin murmured while the test tube in her hand stopped shaking. She gazed into the distance.</br>
</br>
The meteor crashed into the ground.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, her mechanical heart felt a sharp pain.</br>
</br>
"Uhhh! AHH!"</br>
</br>
Her pupils contracted. She covered her chest in pain while droplets of sweat rolled down profusely from her forehead.</br>
</br>
Splash!</br>
</br>
The test tube smashed and shattered and Lin Lin curled up on the ground. Her hands covered her chest as her expression twisted because of the pain.</br>
</br>
[Dammit, is it that thing again?]</br>
</br>
She heard a noise from outside the door. There were brisk footsteps before the door was knocked.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin? Did something happen?"</br>
</br>
It was Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
"Help…Help…"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao immediately realized the situation was odd. She twisted the doorknob. Seeing as it was locked, she backed away before kicking the door forcefully.</br>
</br>
The door was kicked open, breaking the doorframe.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was shocked by the scene of Lin Lin curled up on the ground as she moved to help her up.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin, Lin Lin! Are you okay?"</br>
</br>
The menacing light radiating from her pupils gave her the chills.</br>
</br>
But quickly after, the menace was replaced by agony.</br>
</br>
"No, no! Tingting… Stop!" Lin Lin suddenly jerked her head up as her silvery-white hair became drenched with sweat because of her pain.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Lin Lin's pupils were completely covered by crimson rays as she turned around, diving towards Sun Jiao. But Sun Jiao was prepared as she snagged both of Lin Lin's hands and put her on the ground face down.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou, who heard the noises in the room, rushed in. When she saw Lin Lin being pinned down by Sun Jiao, she was stunned by the scene.</br>
</br>
"Sister, what happened?"</br>
</br>
Not long after, Yao Yao appeared at the door. When she saw the two people on the ground, she covered her mouth in shock.</br>
</br>
"Sister Sun Jiao, Lin Lin…"</br>
</br>
"You two, come help me! This girl...how is she so strong?!" Sun Jiao's hands were shaking because of the force as her face turned red.</br>
</br>
The power of mechanical parts was indeed superior to that of creatures. Her strength of 50 barely managed to contain Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou reacted first and rushed forward.</br>
</br>
"I'll help you. Strap her onto the surgery bed first."</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao, get Jiang Chen here. He should be at the launching ground."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" The little girl turned around and ran out of the room.</br>
</br>
Her eyes teared up as she didn't know what was going on; it made her extremely worried.</br>
</br>
She pushed open the mansion door. Just as she ran to the gate, she crashed into Jiang Chen with a stern expression.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ouch—"</br>
</br>
With a short yelp, Yao Yao fell backward with clumsiness. But Jiang Chen, with his quick hands, managed to snag her.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao? What's going on?"</br>
</br>
Seeing Yao Yao rushing out, Jiang Chen thought something serious happened as he held her up.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin turned into that again." Yao Yao was about to cry.</br>
</br>
Without needing any more detail, Jiang Chen immediately realized what she was talking about before he ran into the mansion.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Pushing open the lab door, Jiang Chen quickly walked to the surgery table in the middle of the room. Yao Yao, running with short steps, immediately followed behind him.</br>
</br>
When Sun Jiao saw Jiang Chen, she walked over.</br>
</br>
"What happened- wait, are you injured?!" Jiang Chen saw the bandage around Sun Jiao's arm.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's right arm sleeve had been ripped off completely.</br>
</br>
"I'm okay. Just got some small scratches while trying to contain her. Lin Lin… is a bit weird right now." With the concerned expression on Jiang Chen's face, Sun Jiao felt warm inside. But when she looked back at Lin Lin, her face turned solemn again.</br>
</br>
They weren't small scratches at all.</br>
</br>
But with Sun Jiao's abilities, she should recover easily.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put aside his concern for Sun Jiao temporarily and focused on Lin Lin strapped down on the bed. With a crimson light flashing in her eyes, her limbs twitched as if she was having a seizure in an attempt to break free from the bed.</br>
</br>
"She can't control herself again?" Jiang Chen asked with a headache.</br>
</br>
The bug in her body was like a time bomb - no one knew when it would explode.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, but this time it's a bit stranger." Sun Jiao nodded.</br>
</br>
"Brother Jiang Chen, Sister Lin Lin… will she get better?" Yao Yao looked at Jiang Chen with a serious expression and pulled on his sleeve.</br>
</br>
Although Lin Lin liked to trick people, Yao Yao knew she didn't have any harmful intentions. It was just that she didn't know how to express her emotions aside from "badmouthing" people.</br>
</br>
From the bottom of her heart, she always treated Lin Lin like a dear friend.</br>
</br>
Looking at the worried expression on Yao Yao's face, Jiang Chen rubbed her soft hair attempting to comfort her. "Definitely."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao nodded with a slightly relieved smile on her face.</br>
</br>
Although she was still concerned about Lin Lin's condition, she trusted Brother Jiang Chen's words.</br>
</br>
With a deep breath, Jiang Chen walked toward Lin Lin. Just as he approached her, he noticed Lin Lin's gaze was locked onto his face.</br>
</br>
No, precisely speaking, it wasn't Lin Lin but Tingting in her body - the brain of that bug.</br>
</br>
Being stared down by her crimson pupils gave Jiang Chen chills down the back of his spine. The feeling was similar to being watched by a higher level creature in the middle of a forest.</br>
</br>
Tingting stopped trying to break free while she silently gazed at him without speaking a word.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen noticed that she opened her mouth.</br>
</br>
[She opened her mouth?]</br>
</br>
[What's going on? Is she hungry?]</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao, bring me mango pudding from the fridge."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Yao Yao nodded and ran out.</br>
</br>
A moment later, the little lolita ran back with mango pudding.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the pudding and kneeled down beside Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a plastic spoon to scoop out the orange pudding and put it beside the opened mouth.</br>
</br>
But Lin Lin didn't eat the pudding. She didn't even look at it; her crimson eyes still gazed at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
This time it made Jiang Chen completely confused, unsure what she wanted.</br>
</br>
Just then, she - or it - spoke.</br>
</br>
"The antenna is broken."</br>
</br>
[The antenna?]</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
It learned how to speak, which was an improvement. But for some reason, Jiang Chen didn't feel happy about it. He had almost forgotten everything related to this creature and he didn't think he had an obligation to save a fictitious character.</br>
</br>
Yes, Yao Tingting died already in the fall of 2172. And the person he encountered in virtual reality was just a character created by PAC researchers based on the memory of a captive.</br>
</br>
When he escaped the digital prison, almost all his memories related to that girl disappeared. The person in front of him was just another player in the virtual reality.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, not understanding what she wanted to express.</br>
</br>
Tingting then said, "The path to evolution is broken."</br>
</br>
"Evolution?" Jiang Chen looked down as he began to understand.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen used the God's Cane to destroy something in the city center, and that thing was what she referred to as the antenna. And the antenna was related to evolution. If he understood correctly, evolution had something to do with the zombies and mutants.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to know?"</br>
</br>
Tingting looked quietly into Jiang Chen's eyes. Perhaps she was getting used to mechanical vocal cords as her voice was a lot more clear now.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked straight at the red pupils, attempting to read her thoughts, but he failed.</br>
</br>
"I want to."</br>
</br>
There was nothing wrong with listening.</br>
</br>
"Then kiss me." Tingting shocked everyone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked. He didn't know what she meant.</br>
</br>
Tingting opened her mouth slightly wider without saying anymore.</br>
</br>
"Kiss?" Sun Jiao's face turned red and she rejected Tingting's request on behalf of Jiang Chen: "No no, that's too weird! What does it have to do with kissing? This is too weird. And she's so aggressive now - what if she bites?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao blushed too. Although she didn't say anything, her expression indicated she shared the same opinion as Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
"I agree with sister. Although my instinct tells me she won't hurt you, if something does happen…" Sun Xiaorou hesitantly stopped midway.</br>
</br>
[Kiss?]</br>
</br>
[What's the point?]</br>
</br>
Staring at Tingting - or Lin Lin's - face, even if he wanted to kiss her, he didn't have the heart to do so.</br>
</br>
He gulped and his heartbeat began to accelerate.</br>
</br>
He didn't know what kind of expression he should have, nor did he know if he should try kissing her.</br>
</br>
After a moment of hesitation, Jiang Chen let out a sigh and stared into the crimson eyes.</br>
</br>
"…Okay, I'll trust you for now."</br>
</br>
The red eyes blinked and seemed to respond to his trust.</br>
</br>
"Wait, but…" Sun Jiao wanted to add something more but was one second too slow.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen resisted the odd feeling in his mind as he took a deep breath and slowly kissed the thin lips.</br>
</br>
[I'll just pretend this is CPR …]</br>
</br>
Just as Sun Xiaorou guessed, although Lin Lin was aggressive, she didn't bite Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
A cold tongue pried open Jiang Chen's teeth.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen felt shocked by Lin Lin's kissing technique, something unexpected happened.</br>
</br>
It felt soft and gentle.</br>
</br>
A tentacle-like string slipped down her tongue and touched Jiang Chen's tongue before twirling up, then continuing…</br>
</br>
It felt good…</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was suddenly alerted to something.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k! Something is wrong!]</br>
</br>
Just as he tried to break off the kiss, his consciousness fell into an abyss and his field of vision turned dark.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 479: Humans aren't humans</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was a strange feeling. It felt like his consciousness was dragged into a vacuum by that tentacle and was floating in the endless universe.</br>
</br>
[Spiritual connection?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know why these words would appear in his hand, but once he thought carefully, the word seemed accurately describe everything he saw.</br>
</br>
Gradually, the universe brightened up.</br>
</br>
Everything around him was covered in color. The world made out of nothingness began to fill up. It didn't feel like virtual reality, but it was similar.</br>
</br>
Yes, it was just like watching a hologram movie.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, behind the clouds, Jiang Chen saw a magnificent scene.</br>
</br>
It was a vertical building or a rectangular shape that pierced through the clouds. People were busy working below with hovercars moving around it, operating all kinds of equipment while building this massive skyscraper.</br>
</br>
White paint in 12 languages described the same word.</br>
</br>
It was like an inscription.</br>
</br>
The space colonization ship based on the god of creation in India's legends belonged to the PAC. It was launched from Sri Heligida Island.</br>
</br>
It was just like watching an animated CG of a game. The stabilizer holding the skyscraper began to detach as Jiang Chen watched it ignite, rise, break through the atmosphere, and head away from the blue planet.</br>
</br>
Away from the solar system.</br>
</br>
Like Noah's Ark engraved in the "Genesis" at the top of the Roman Sistine Chapel, it carried the hopes of one-sixth of mankind. But it wasn't heading into a monstrous flood but rather it was en route to the boundless galaxy.</br>
</br>
With regrets for past hatred and best wishes for the remaining survivors on land, the passengers waved goodbye to the planet.</br>
</br>
Top speeds were one-tenth of the speed of light and it had a capacity of 27,000 passengers. The passengers were mostly from the elite class of different fields in addition to the constructors of the ship.</br>
</br>
The plan was that the Braham would form a fleet with two other ships at the synchronous orbit around Neptune before heading to the wormhole 6400 astronomical units away from the sun.</br>
</br>
Although humans hadn't set foot in this area, 22nd-century theories already proved that a singularity point existed here. All parameters of physics were twisted in this place. As long as they passed through this area, they could traverse hundreds and even thousands of lightyears away.</br>
</br>
And behind that wormhole would be mankind's new home!</br>
</br>
Before they entered the wormhole, everyone would lie in the hibernation chambers. Of course, while they envisioned the best for the future, they were also prepared for the worst.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the Gods they believed in didn't abandon them as they passed through the wormhole safely.</br>
</br>
A year passed before the survivor with code 01 came out of hibernation. When he woke up from hibernation, he was ecstatic to discover that he was still alive. The ship was in auto-exploration mode, floating in boundless space.</br>
</br>
</br>
According to plan, he entered the cockpit and proved to the system that he was healthy. He woke all the other passengers in the hibernation chamber.</br>
</br>
They held a huge celebration party and cheered for the rebirth of mankind in the merciless galaxy.</br>
</br>
Astronomers looked at the star map and confirmed that the ship was still in the Milky Way, but it was 20.5 light years outside the Libra near the planet Gliese 581g.</br>
</br>
This 581g planet was located in the red dwarf Gliese 581's "habitable" zone, 0.15 astronomical units away from the star.</br>
</br>
The planet was similar to Mercury in the solar system with one side always facing the star. One side of the planet was permanently under the star's light while the other side was permanently in the dark, known as tidal locking.</br>
</br>
Although it was hard to imagine, this particular formation stabilized the planet's climate.</br>
</br>
In addition, people also learned that the planet revolved around itself in 37 days with a thick atmosphere. There was water on the surface. The planet's diameter was 1.3 times that of Earth, so its gravity was similar.</br>
</br>
It was a planet suitable for habitation.</br>
</br>
Because of their unexpected happiness, the crew began to cheer just like when Columbus discovered the new continent.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, they lost contact with the other two space colonization ships; they couldn't share their joy with anyone else.</br>
</br>
The ship ended its automatic exploration mode, changed courses, and headed to planet 581g.</br>
</br>
On the way, the crew began all forms of preparation for colonizing the new world including checking the status of the colonization model and voting to see who would be the first to step onto the new land.</br>
</br>
Just as everyone was working toward their new life, the physicist on the ship made another astonishing discovery.</br>
</br>
The cesium atomic clock they brought appeared to have backtracked.</br>
</br>
The backtracking phenomenon could not be explained with physics. It was like everyone knew that atoms decayed, but no one would believe that atoms would return to the state before decaying under normal circumstances.</br>
</br>
There was only one explanation - when they passed through the wormhole, they not only passed through the twisted space but they also passed through twisted time.</br>
</br>
To put it in simple terms, they returned to the past.</br>
</br>
Based on the calculations from the quantum computers, the cesium atomic clock showed that the time was 120 years B.C.</br>
</br>
It was the third year into the Han dynasty under Emperor Yuan and 634 years since Rome was first built. This year, the Han Dynasty sent envoys to Alexandria and the ancient Greeks built the Pantheon.</br>
</br>
If the ship returned to earth, the earth would be in a primal stage.</br>
</br>
It was an odd feeling - it was as if your parents weren't even alive, yet you were born into this world.</br>
</br>
The physicists had multiple explanations for this phenomenon.</br>
</br>
They suggested that if the multi-world theory was true, they might have reached a world distinct from the previous world. And the previous Earth was a distinct world from this Earth.</br>
</br>
This theory was accepted by everyone to some extent.</br>
</br>
Their 22nd-century selves couldn't believe that three-dimensional people could move vertically on a four-dimensional plane as this would lead to a time paradox. The only thing that could explain this was probably that they jumped to a parallel world and their old world had nothing to do with this.</br>
</br>
It was an obscure feeling.</br>
</br>
Just like being born as a baby and having your umbilical cord cut off.</br>
</br>
The universe not only cut them off in terms of distance but also their spiritual sense of belonging.</br>
</br>
In the next three seconds, everyone became quiet.</br>
</br>
Someone suggested that if they changed course to return to earth, they could use the power on the colonization ship to conquer the earth in the Bronze Age. Even with a distance of 20.5 light years, with a maximum cruise speed of one-tenth of the speed of light, they would only need 400 to 500 years. The worst case would be that they could encounter Huns cavalry.</br>
</br>
But this proposal was quickly shut down.</br>
</br>
No one could be certain that in this parallel world, the history of the world would follow the same track as in their previous world. Perhaps writing was invented a thousand years earlier? Perhaps Columbus was born 500 years earlier? Perhaps the first industrial revolution started 200 years earlier? Perhaps nothing happened yet.</br>
</br>
Relative to the entire human race's 400,000 years of evolutionary history, it would only take a small disruption to create earth-shattering changes. The only thing they could be certain of was that the world was certainly different from their previous world.</br>
</br>
Perhaps when they returned to their original earth of this world, they would face a civilization far more advanced. Perhaps they would be the ones getting colonized like primal people.</br>
</br>
It was an odd thought. While they were 20.5 light years away from earth, everyone shared the same thought.</br>
</br>
War.</br>
</br>
Because of their fear of the unknown, everyone settled down and retrained their focus on the colonization of planet 581g.</br>
</br>
Two other thoughts began to take shape in everyone's head at the same time and ultimately influenced the development of the newborn civilization.</br>
</br>
"Earth is not home."</br>
</br>
"Humans are not humans."</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 480: Colonization Era</br>
</div></br>
</br>
But regardless, life had to continue.</br>
</br>
People began to forget about their old Earth and they began to start their new life while masking their communication channels.</br>
</br>
Without being certain about the level of civilization on the Earth in this universe, it would be unwise to expose themselves.</br>
</br>
Survival took precedence.</br>
</br>
This idea was supported by all crew members.</br>
</br>
The colonization ship entered the synchronous orbit of 581g and began to deploy observation devices along the twilight line.</br>
</br>
When the device landed on the surface and transferred up data from the surface, the colonization ship released the airdrop cabin for the paratroopers. Next was the basic infrastructure unit then the living quarters with the survivors. Thus began the "Colonization Era." Although a year was 37 days, since there was no concept of day and night on this planet, people still used the 24 hour and 365-day calendar year convention from Earth as a sign of commemoration to the blue mother planet.</br>
</br>
There was no ocean on this planet; all the freshwater came from the glaciers on the other side of the planet and freshwater lakes scattered around the twilight line as well as the underground river with complex vein-like tributaries.</br>
</br>
The large fungi and low shrubs on the surface provided adequate oxygen for the air which made breathing the planet's air pleasant. The planet was almost designed for humans.</br>
</br>
The planet was beautiful; a lot of stunning views were here that couldn't be seen on Earth.</br>
</br>
From the river that stretched out from the sun-facing surface to the back of the planet to the mist wall thousands of kilometers long due to high-temperature evaporation, sunlight refracted and formed an everlasting rainbow. The giant fungi and odd-looking vegetation covered every single inch of the soft soil on this land. From space, it was just like a carpet interwoven with fresh green and vibrant red.</br>
</br>
Life existed on this planet, although it was scarce.</br>
</br>
From long ago, the planet's observer, Steven Vogt, made a prediction. From his point of view, he thought that life must exist on this planet without a doubt.</br>
</br>
And he was proven to be right.</br>
</br>
The twilight line was covered with dense vegetation and a large amount of eccentric small and medium-sized arthropods, forming a simple ecosystem.</br>
</br>
The colonists were delighted by the discovery because this meant they weren't alone.</br>
</br>
With the living quarters built, an endless amount of farms were created then the roads began to expand to create a connected city. The mining vehicles traversed the ground like ants, the construction vehicles terraformed, and the biologists keenly collected genetic data they had never seen before. The unsetting giant sun was like the sun at dawn. People worked hard to create their new home and celebrate the beautiful future.</br>
</br>
</br>
They were just like the colonists who first stepped onto the land of America.</br>
</br>
Except they weren't criminals from Europe but human elites from PAC. They had the confidence to despise the painful history of work. Utopia would be built from their hands. There was no war nor crimes here; everyone here were brothers and sisters.</br>
</br>
The conflict was resolved in the old world.</br>
</br>
The seed of mankind would once again prosper on this soil.</br>
</br>
Of course, there were still difficulties.</br>
</br>
For example, the mineral reserve on this planet was beyond low. Toxic gas from underground could lower human immunity and even cause people to become sick.</br>
</br>
But all the problems could be resolved - the space mining module on the colonization ship could increase mineral stores and the toxic gas that endangered the health of the colonists was caused by a special form of spores. The biologists quickly invented antibiotics that could eliminate the reproduction of spores, easily solving the problem.</br>
</br>
But aside from that, there was a more pressing problem.</br>
</br>
It was the solar wind.</br>
</br>
Without a stable magnetic field, the planet had almost no resistance against the particles thrown its way from the red dwarf.</br>
</br>
581g was only 0.15 astronomical units away from the star, therefore 0.15 times the distance between sun and Earth. The constant solar wind whipped the humans' faces directly. Without the protection of a magnetic field, all the electronic equipment had to operate under the electromagnetic shielding environment.</br>
</br>
It was like thousands of EMPs constantly bombarding the planet.</br>
</br>
To increase the accuracy of some physics experiments at the atomic level, they had to be moved onto the space colonization ship.</br>
</br>
Later, to prevent solar wind from the red dwarf from damaging the ship, people moved the ship to the back of the planet, away from the sun. Therefore, the space colonization ship was always one planet away from the star to prevent the disruption of the solar wind on the space colonization ship to enable scientific research to be properly conducted.</br>
</br>
The humans who relied heavily on electronic equipment were heavily influenced. Even though humans used a wide-range magnetic field to solve the problem of the solar wind, the disruptions still existed.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how wide the magnetic field was, it couldn't enclose the entire planet under its field.</br>
</br>
But humans were adaptable.</br>
</br>
After they adapted to the difficulties, everything became smoother. All the cities were built within the magnetic field. From space, it looked like umbrellas opened around the twilight line and people were sheltered under the umbrella.</br>
</br>
Everything was so pleasant.</br>
</br>
Until they discovered the "original inhabitants" of the planet.</br>
</br>
They were a bunch of hostile creatures with a similar social form to ants. They had a queen bug responsible for reproducing, battle bugs responsible for hunting, and worker bugs responsible for the expansion of caves.</br>
</br>
Typically, they lived 20-30 thousand meters below the surface on the dark side of the planet. The temperature underground could mitigate the frozen surface and could melt underground ice into water.</br>
</br>
People discovered later that the thousands of rivers underneath the surface were the work of the bugs and their species had been in existence for millions of years already or their civilization existed at least for the past hundred thousands of years.</br>
</br>
A civilization longer than the total sum of all the human civilizations added together.</br>
</br>
Although their civilization wasn't yet "civilized."</br>
</br>
Their iving spaces were too far apart from each other, with one on the twilight line while the other was in the deep underground of the dark side. Perhaps both thought the other were "bugs" so humans didn't discover their neighbor until living there for over a hundred years.</br>
</br>
This only happened when the living spaces became constrained and humans began to expand to the underground river belonging to the bugs.</br>
</br>
It was determined the instant both parties encountered each other that a war was inevitable.</br>
</br>
Typical speaking, with bugs made out of flesh, humans with technology would not be at a disadvantage, but the reality soon proved far more complicated than the humans imagined.</br>
</br>
Soldiers with Gauss Rifles steamrolled through the bugs that spread to the surface. The scientists invented a virus that could make the bugs extinct, and the satellite in orbit launched drilling missiles to clear the underground caves of the bugs.</br>
</br>
Everything was going smoothly to the point that people thought optimistically that they could easily declare ownership of the underground river the bugs spent thousands of years carving out.</br>
</br>
Until a bug flood attacked a border city.</br>
</br>
Millions of arthropods flooded the human city without a fear of death. With a thunderous attack, they crashed through the human colonies along the twilight line.</br>
</br>
The explosions lt up the sky and still couldn't stop the bug flood from moving forward.</br>
</br>
The scene looked like doomsday.</br>
</br>
Everyone was stunned. They never thought the bugs they crashed through could became such a strong battle force. Although their missiles and bombs could easily penetrate through weak bodies, they were still futile against the swarm of bugs.</br>
</br>
From biological weapons to genetic bombs, humans thought of everything yet were still unable to exterminate the bugs. Instead, they facilitated the evolution of the bugs. Just like humans took hundreds of years to not even eradicate mosquitos and cockroaches, these bugs couldn't be wiped out.</br>
</br>
Under highly intensive natural selection, the bugs evolved different functionalities with similar genetics. The previous queen bugs, warrior bugs, and worker bugs continued to differentiate into a difficult-to-ignore state.</br>
</br>
The Spatter's acidic saliva could corrode tanks and the Shredder's diamond-strength claws could easily rip through nanocarbon vests. A hundred-meter-long Attacker with a hardened surface could destroy the city by wreaking havoc like worms. Humans had to limit the usage of nuclear and biological weapons to prevent bugs from further evolving.</br>
</br>
The civilization that continued for hundreds of thousands of years demonstrated their heritage. The civilization that could not be understood by humans used its own cruelty to declare its sovereignty on this planet.</br>
</br>
It would take 18 years for humans to be born and grow into adults, but it would take the bugs one week at the longest for that to happen. They would feast on the bodies of their own species and use the organic matter to evolve. People were dumbfounded to discover from an economic perspective that mutants could rip through nanocarbon vests with their claws that had less "cost" than a magazine clip of the Gauss Rifle.</br>
</br>
The creatures, not knowing what death stood for, used their numbers to test humans.</br>
</br>
With their living space challenged by the bugs, the humans had to retreat to the space station near the orbit. Even with advanced scientific research, without the resources to convert it into power, they had to admit that they were at a disadvantage in the war with the bugs.</br>
</br>
Their saving grace was that while some bugs could fly, they could not leave the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Humans created a word to summarize the bugs who evolved through the mutated process – mutants.</br>
</br>
With this, the "Battle Era" that spanned a thousand years unfolded.</br>
</br>
The battle between humans and mutants.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 481: Harmony Era</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The scene changed.</br>
</br>
It was still the tidal-locked planet, but its geographic landscape altered drastically.</br>
</br>
An orange line divided the planet's surface with one side always facing the sun.</br>
</br>
One side was vibrant green, while the other was crimson red.</br>
</br>
That colonization ship was nowhere to be seen.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Jiang Chen felt like the planet was moving.</br>
</br>
It felt like the planet was a living creature rather than dead.</br>
</br>
"What happened to the Battle Era?" Looking down at everything, Jiang Chen was intrigued.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a person surfaced beside him.</br>
</br>
In the queen uniform, looking elegant, she stood straight with hands behind her back, looking solemnly forward.</br>
</br>
"The War Era is over, right now it is the Harmony Era."</br>
</br>
"It is over? Did the humans lose?"</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"Did the mutants lose?"</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, she shook her head again.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"Then what happened?" Jiang Chen persisted.</br>
</br>
"Common prosperity."</br>
</br>
She only said two words before drifting to the planet.</br>
</br>
At the same time, without control of his own body, Jiang Chen flew along with her.</br>
</br>
"Humans used hundreds of years and didn't eliminate mosquitos and cockroaches. We are not greater than our ancestor. We spent a thousand year without eliminating our enemy. So there was no victor in this war. Everyone compromised. Or, everyone sacrificed something."</br>
</br>
"I don't understand." Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"We chose to fuse."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recollected the words of Academician Qin, and he seemed to have understood something, but he didn't understand why they took this path.</br>
</br>
"Steel is the foundation of industry, but this planet's metal reserve is extremely scarce. The cost of space mining was also too high which made developing industries extremely difficult. On the other hand, due to the influence of the constant solar wind from the Red Dwarf, our electronic equipment had a higher failure rate."</br>
</br>
"Our industry was going into a dead end and even began to regress. With production, we could no longer equip more armies, and the balance began to tip to the mutants' favor. But just then, a great biologist stood out and proposed a new ideology to the evolutionized civilization – Harmony. With this, the Harmony Era began to unfold."</br>
</br>
"We used calculation cells to replace digital chips. We used the highly efficient biological computer to replace quantum computers. Then, we changed our own genetics to expand our 23 pairs of chromosomes to 139 pairs. Through the selective expression, we differentiated into scientists, producers, combatants, and commanders.</br>
</br>
"All the problems were solved. We no longer relied on metal. This planet's rich carbon and oxygen supply are at our disposal. Every "person" is independent but also the "cell" of the civilization. At the same time, we stopped our attack on mutants. We began to communicate with them, then marriage, before integrating together."</br>
</br>
</br>
[Fu*king a bug?]</br>
</br>
"This is crazy!" Jiang Chen had to interrupt this bewildering idea.</br>
</br>
For some reason, a bunch of random hentai popped up in his head with octopus and tentacles.</br>
</br>
"Was it crazy when the black and white first married?" She asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped, not being able to say a word.</br>
</br>
"In the 17th century it is indeed crazy, but not in the 20th century. Without eliminating the other, understanding was the only solution."</br>
</br>
Then, she skipped over the irrelevant question and pointed at the green planet.</br>
</br>
"It is just like a giant tree. The part facing the sun is the leaf, and the back is the tree trunk. We used an entire century to complete this project. The leaf provides the energy and nutrients for our civilization to form the atmospheric environment on this planet. Water circulates between the veins and carries the excess energy to the back of the truck. The truck is the area where everyone lives."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed her finger. He murmured at the half green, half red planet.</br>
</br>
"This tree is too massive."</br>
</br>
"It is not that big. Compared to the entire universe, it is more like a seed," she said quietly.</br>
</br>
"What about the humans?"</br>
</br>
"All the neo-humans live under the leaf. Everyone is independent and a collective group."</br>
</br>
"Then who are you?"</br>
</br>
Just as he asked this, Jiang Chen saw the shadow turn into a different form. A graceful princess gown replaced the empire uniform. The yellow face turned pale white with a hooked nose.</br>
</br>
"I'm the main consciousness of the nest. All the consciousness is born from me, so I'm the queen. As to the form, I can be Wu Zetian, I can be Elizabeth or Ekaterina. We no longer possess the concept of "Art," so I could only search through historical records to show you the figures that appeared through history.</br>
</br>
"… And why are you showing me this?"</br>
</br>
The Queen looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"To spread the seed of civilization to further places."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen held his breath. Although as an embodiment of consciousness, he didn't need to breathe.</br>
</br>
The Queen continued.</br>
</br>
"We used our constructed high-resolution biological telescope to confirm the status of the mother planet. Although all the records are from 20.5 years away based on comparing planetary stats, we confirmed your civilization level. Based on time, you are at the beginning of the 21st century."</br>
</br>
"You're outdated compared to us."</br>
</br>
"So we decided to return."</br>
</br>
"94 years ago, we finally built a colonization ship capable of ensuring our survival. To prevent crossing dimensions, we decide to traverse through the three-dimensional universe."</br>
</br>
"We'll bring your civilization and help you interrogate with nature."</br>
</br>
Like a declaration of war, the queen declared the cruel reality.</br>
</br>
"But we don't need your help," Jiang Chen said with uneasiness.</br>
</br>
Although he knew that even if he said that, they wouldn't care.</br>
</br>
Just like…</br>
</br>
"Just like the Homo Erectus and Neanderthals ultimately losing to the Homo Sapiens. Humans view the Homo Sapiens as their ancestors from which they evolve into the "modern human". Blood must accompany the evolution of the civilization, and we agree with blood." The Queen spoke out the cruel words emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Wait, didn't you say, you traveled to a parallel world?" Jiang Chen realized something.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The Queen blinked and looked at Jiang Chen without expression.</br>
</br>
The sight made him feel extremely uneasy.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, the queen's words made his unease turn into a reality.</br>
</br>
"We are currently located on your home planet."</br>
</br>
[That's impossible!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's suddenly flinched.</br>
</br>
[How does she know that I can interdimensional travel! How could she confirm my coordinates in that world!]</br>
</br>
[Wait, Lin Lin…]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes suddenly widened as he realized that. If Tingting had been living in Lin Lin, then what Lin Lin saw must be known by Tingting. And from the current situation, Tingting must be able to communicate with the Queen of Harmony.</br>
</br>
"The Klein particle." The Queen raised her hand as a dark red ray formed in her hand, "As long as time exists, then this must exist."</br>
</br>
"So you obtained the communication channel between Lin Lin and me?" Jiang Chen said with an undertone.</br>
</br>
Fourth dimension messenger. If Lin Lin could know his coordinates on that side, there was no reason Tingting wouldn't know.</br>
</br>
"No," The Queen said without emotion, "We are shocked how you could freely traverse through two worlds. And the world you are born in happens to be the world we arrived in from the wormhole."</br>
</br>
[Is this real…]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's sight moved between the planet and the Queen. Although there was a lot he wanted to say, he couldn't speak a single word.</br>
</br>
Momentarily after, Jiang Chen spoke in a light voice.</br>
</br>
"What's the purpose of you telling me this?"</br>
</br>
"We plan to convince you."</br>
</br>
[Convince?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows as he couldn't understand the meaning behind her words.</br>
</br>
The queen moved her gaze away from Jiang Chen and to the two-colored planet.</br>
</br>
"We thought that our world was disconnected from the original world and that the information we obtained through evolution can no longer be shared with the survivors."</br>
</br>
"But the situation soon took a turn."</br>
</br>
"The Klein particles we sent were finally received and successfully guided a believer of us. He used himself and used biological technology to change himself to become an antenna for our communication. With our guidance, he successfully evolved into what we hoped for and communicated with creatures in an entire area. Most important, he even managed to divide out an egg."</br>
</br>
"We chose 12 citizens and converted their consciousness into Klein particle waves and sent them to that egg with the messenger. The distance that could not be traversed with the body could be done through a message. Fortunately, we found the way to return to the original world."</br>
</br>
"But unfortunately, that egg was destroyed by your foolish behavior. But we still luckily, and surprisingly, preserved the individuals."</br>
</br>
"She was captured by artificial intelligence, put into a fallout shelter, and locked into the virtual world before finally meeting you."</br>
</br>
[The egg was destroyed? Could it be the Liuding's military mission to destroy some extreme mutants?] He heard Chu Nan talk about this mission before. The biological cannon that could launch red beams that took out the electronic equipment in the entire area.</br>
</br>
It was not a mutant, but the "paratroopers" the Harmony deployed to the world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped with difficulty.</br>
</br>
"And you discovered me through Lin Lin?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." The queen nodded.</br>
</br>
"It was a pleasant surprise to discover you. If you're willing to join us, I can promise you that even if Natural Selection arrives in the new world earth, we can still preserve you."</br>
</br>
"Preserve me? What about the other people…"</br>
</br>
The Queen said blatantly.</br>
</br>
"They will donate their organic matter."</br>
</br>
[Become food? Just like the natural selection of mankind in ancient times, the Homo Sapiens, after the destruction of Homo Erectus and the Neanderthals, chose to treat them as food.]</br>
</br>
When he thought about this, sweat rolled down his forehead, although he was just an embodiment of consciousness.</br>
</br>
"I'll have to disappoint you. Since you know that I can freely traverse between two worlds. Then you must know that it is impossible to catch me."</br>
</br>
"That's fine." The Queen was emotionless.</br>
</br>
The primary task is to conquest the new world. As to the original world's "died" earth, it was more of a memory. Even if Jiang Chen was unwilling to surrender, they would express their regret at most without feeling any sympathy at all…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
"And your choice is?" The queen said calmly.</br>
</br>
"… I reject." Jiang Chen was at peace.</br>
</br>
The Queen was silent for two seconds.</br>
</br>
"This is a wrong choice. You don't have the capability to stop us."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?"</br>
</br>
"If I guessed correctly, the world you're currently in now, and Supreme is currently ruling the 'original world' by our definition. They are a tough opponent, although powerless in front of us."</br>
</br>
Klein particles could destroy most of the digital equipment.</br>
</br>
"Ruled? It is too early to say ruled. Only you lost, and I haven't lost yet," Jiang Chen said without changes in his expression.</br>
</br>
"In our perspective, you don't have the ability to defend against them."</br>
</br>
In front of sky-based weapons, any land-based weapon is useless. And combustion rockets dealt substantial damage to creatures, but to the Supreme that ditched their bodies, the damage is almost negligible.</br>
</br>
The only thing they could use was EMP. Though there were plenty of ways to defend against EMP with 22nd-century technology.</br>
</br>
[So fu*king unlucky. The ambassador from Harmony is on the way to the modern world while the threat of Supreme erupted in the apocalypse.]</br>
</br>
"I'm really curious. With mechanical parts, how can you travel through interstellar?"</br>
</br>
"Why do we need mechanical parts?" The Queen rebutted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
[No need for mechanical parts?]</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of their arrogance as a higher level civilization, the Queen didn't avoid the question and continued to explain.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of the water bear?"</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
"Tardigrade. Although the smallest tardigrade is only 50 microns in size, they are known as the most resilient creature on earth as they could survive in outer space without any protection measures. Any facts proved that, without external assistance, creatures could still achieve interstellar travel. 50 microns creature could, then a creature 50 kilometers naturally could too."</br>
</br>
"The ark of evolution is sailing toward you. Since you already rejected it, then, in the end, I will allow you to meet our force."</br>
</br>
As the voice died down, the Queen waved her hand, and the scene changed again.</br>
</br>
It was a giant octopus. It slowly swayed its tentacles in the back and quietly traversed the boundless universe.</br>
</br>
A Sailing Bug.</br>
</br>
Abruptly, this odd name surfaced in Jiang Chen's head.</br>
</br>
The Sailing Bug was 50 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide. Its shape was similar to a hammer with multiple holes on its side. There were cilia in the back. The middle was grown with umbrella-shaped membranes that could contract or expand to a radius of 40 kilometers.</br>
</br>
Bright light particles shone behind the meat membranes. Although Jiang Chen couldn't guess the working principles behind it, Jiang Chen felt that the membrane was similar to a giant solar sail using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight.</br>
</br>
Just from its structure, it was a non-working propulsion engine. Jiang Chen could not guess its cruising speed, although it must not be very low.</br>
</br>
[This is Natural Selection?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched the sail pass by him and watched it head further into the distance.</br>
</br>
He wanted to say something more in an attempt to gather more intelligence.</br>
</br>
"Wait!"</br>
</br>
Just then, his field of vision turned dark again…</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The spiritual connection ended. It felt like a lengthy dream.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his eyes and happened to meet a blank stare.</br>
</br>
From her black pupils, she should also be "awakened" from her dream soon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved two steps away.</br>
</br>
He was hesitating if he should sneak out from the room before Lin Lin had time to realize what had happened.</br>
</br>
But as he was contemplating, the crystal-like pupils began to be covered in a fine layer of mist. The numbed lips collapsed down.</br>
</br>
Instantly, two thoughts flashed through her head.</br>
</br>
[That was my first kiss!]</br>
</br>
[This pervert finally made a move on me!]</br>
</br>
Her blush extended from her face all the way to her ears before covering her pale neck.</br>
</br>
"PERVERT!"</br>
</br>
The cry in agony went out of tune because she was too emotional.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed his nose in awkwardness as he didn't know how to comfort Lin Lin and looked ashamed.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen before she walked out to loosen the straps on Lin Lin and started to comfort the undoubtedly sad her.</br>
</br>
"Calm down Lin Lin. Jiang Chen was saving you, uh, how should I explain this…"</br>
</br>
Without finishing her sentence, Sun Jiao also began to feel awkward as she became silent.</br>
</br>
"Seems to be impossible to explain…" Sun Xiaorou had a wry smile on her face.</br>
</br>
"Kissed for so long." Yao Yao pouted as her jealousy was clearly evident.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was bothered by how to explain this to Lin Lin, crisp knocking sound came from the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around and saw Han Junhua in uniform standing at the door without any expression on her face.</br>
</br>
"Although I don't want to interrupt you, right now –"</br>
</br>
"Let's talk outside," Jiang Chen immediately said when Han Junhua was halfway through her sentence.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua briefly scanned the girls in the lab and nodded to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
She swung her ponytail and left without a hassle.</br>
</br>
"Did something happen?" Sun Jiao looked concerned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen throated moved, he looked at Sun Jiao and smiled at her.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry."</br>
</br>
That smile made people feel calm, but uneasy at the same time.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao walked to Jiang Chen and held onto his hand.</br>
</br>
"if there is anything I can do to help, please tell me."</br>
</br>
With certainty in his eyes, Jiang Chen squeezed Sun Jiao's hand and promised.</br>
</br>
"Definitely."</br>
</br>
[If you could help.]</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
With brisk steps walking into the community center, Han Junhua's ponytail swung back and forth. Beside her was Jiang Chen as he never had a more stern expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"The communication signal of the Fishbone base is blocked."</br>
</br>
"I know that. Is there any other method to contact the people from Camp 27?"</br>
</br>
"There is only one communication channel." Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
</br>
The arrived at the command room. She stopped and opened the door.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen walked in, she followed.</br>
</br>
The two stopped in front of the command table. Han Junhua pressed her finger on the fingerprint detection device and opened the hologram.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation like outside?"</br>
</br>
"There are 300 'Reptile' quadruped robots, 1200 'Viper' attack drones surrounding us." Han Junhua tapped the map, and the dense red dots appeared around the base.</br>
</br>
Two popup windows appeared, recording the pictures and specifications of the Reptile and Viper. Both were standard units from PAC. As the Colonel of the Mechanical Division, Han Junhua knew the specs of the two robots well.</br>
</br>
The former was known as an "all-terrain battle platform", and the latter was known for its balanced performance and smart artificial intelligence design which earned it the name "Battle Assistance" by PAC soldiers.</br>
</br>
"The force in the base?"</br>
</br>
"Only 500 new recruits that recently completed training. The 327 people Hunter Division, and eight RPGs." Han Junhua reported.</br>
</br>
"What about our drones?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"I shut them down."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen looked at her.</br>
</br>
She seemed to be expecting this question as she pointed to the hologram map, "There is a KN30 signal hijacking device here. Its functionality is not only there to hijack the communication channel, but also hijack the communication between the drone terminal and drones. We can be certain that they are at an absolute advantage in information technology. Even if we deployed drones to the battle, there is a high probability that they could hijack them."</br>
</br>
This was certainly Han Junhua's style.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen peeked at her. On her face, he didn't see any signs of fear.</br>
</br>
But it made sense; she didn't have extraneous things like emotions.</br>
</br>
In deep thought, Jiang Chen thought for a while before looking at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"Could we establish communication with the Sixth Street through the underground system?"</br>
</br>
"The underground system is captured. When communication first ceased, I sent scouts out immediately." Han Junhua pointed at the location between the Fishbone base and the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
While the subsystems in the underground system were blocked by partitions, the partitions were mostly there to prevent the mutants from entering. With a welding tool, it was easy to hijack the underground tunnel.</br>
</br>
"So the only thing we can rely on in the base is the 500 new recruits and the Hunter Corps?" Jiang Chen began to frown.</br>
</br>
Because of the close proximity, the rockets were ineffective. The new recruits wouldn't be much use and at most provide assistance in firing. The Hunter Corps was the elite force of the NAC which certainly made people more at ease.</br>
</br>
But they were against a mechanical force of over one thousand units. With eight hundred bodies made out of flesh, could they defeat the force from Supreme?</br>
</br>
"What do you think is our probability of winning?" With hands on the table, Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"50%."</br>
</br>
"Even with your command?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Han Junhua nodded as she had a rare sternness on her face.</br>
</br>
"The base has an ample reserve of EMP grenades, but if it the Reptile and the Viper, the pulse level of the EMP grenade could only cause minor damage to the friendly unit detection system which would cause it to stall temporarily. We don't have a reserve of powerful EMP weapons."</br>
</br>
"Then don't use EMP. We can use the electromagnetic cannons, the Pythons, the Red Arrow-42 RPG, rifles. We can use bonfires. Without electro signal, we can use smoke. As long as there is hope, we can't give up," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"That will have to be. But I'm afraid of the sky." Han Junhua looked up, "If they really did control the God's Cane, we don't have any possibility of winning."</br>
</br>
The tungsten rod dropping from the sky. The invincible spear unguarded by any shield.</br>
</br>
Perhaps only the Holy Shield System could defend its attack.</br>
</br>
Is there really a possibility of winning?</br>
</br>
Wait…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
He closed his eyes. Then after a long moment, he abruptly opened them.</br>
</br>
"There should be one tungsten rod."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked to him.</br>
</br>
"The probability is low."</br>
</br>
"No, or rather, there is only one." Jiang Chen gazed at the hologram map as certainty began to appear in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Reason?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recollected what Academician Qin told him and the conversation with the bug queen.</br>
</br>
"Because we're different, and that's enough of a reason."</br>
</br>
With his arms crossed, Han Junhua thought for half a minute. She closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
"I see."</br>
</br>
From the beginning, it was a war without a captive.</br>
</br>
If they had a second round, there was no need to save it. Only one tungsten rod could destroy the "heart" of the NAC and the order established in Wanghai would again turn back to chaos. Only when the wasteland turned into chaos could the digitalized humans have the hope of replacing humans as the ruler of the land. Jiang Chen recalled everything Lin Chaoen did. Other than killing the "experimenter" from Fallout Shelter 027, all he did was bring chaos to the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Either NAC or Supreme must be eliminated.</br>
</br>
Because the outcome of this war would go down in history.</br>
</br>
The reason why they didn't do anything was that they didn't have the confidence to win either.</br>
</br>
As long as the Fishbone can last until assistance from the Sixth Street and Camp 27 arrives, they will not lose.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 483: The Last Shackle</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The atmosphere on the wall was depressing.</br>
</br>
Soldiers hidden behind cover anxiously rubbed the trigger, aiming at the robots hundred meters away in ruins.</br>
</br>
It had a circular body filled with fluid but powerful short legs, if it was not for the daunting machine gun and the grenade launcher on top, its appearance was cute.</br>
</br>
"What are these things…" A recruit moved around his sore arms as he said with unease.</br>
</br>
"If the "reptile" comes, remember to aim at the observation hole, the four holes on its wall." The soldier beside them also looked unsettled, but because of his experience traversing through the wasteland, he didn't look too fearful.</br>
</br>
[How does this thing look like a reptile?]</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay!" The recruit gulped, perhaps he thought the first okay didn't sound confident, so he replied again.</br>
</br>
The unknown mechanical force surrounded the base, making all the survivors tense. The engineering soldiers dragged the heavy weapons and ammo along the wall in silence. The weapons included the Python, the Red Arrow-42, and the EMP grenades.</br>
</br>
The survivors hauled out the rubber tires from the warehouse, soaked them in gasoline, and waited for Jiang Chen's order.</br>
</br>
In front of the community center, Jiang Chen in a T-3 power armor looked at the soldiers in the square with a solemn face.</br>
</br>
They were the most elite soldiers of the NAC; the Hunter Corps led by Ma Zhongcheng.</br>
</br>
200 kinetic skeletons and 14 power armors. Everyone had no expression on their face and stared at Jiang Chen standing under the Mother of Death Claw statue. Their comrades were already on the wall and the NAC they swore allegiance to was facing its toughest challenge.</br>
</br>
Like all the survivors, Jiang Chen was also facing this challenge.</br>
</br>
If he abandoned everything here and escaped to the modern world, even without the apocalypse, he could still use the technology he has now to establish a force that stood at the peak of the world.</br>
</br>
20.5 light years? Therefore, 94 years ago, the Natural Selection that left in 1922 is on route to modern day earth.</br>
</br>
Realistically, it should only have a speed of one-tenth of the speed of light, at most one-eighth of the speed of light. With consideration of the acceleration and deceleration phase at the two ends of the journey, it would still take at least one hundred years before it arrived on earth. And the one hundred year time was more than enough for him to live a happy life.</br>
</br>
If he chose not to change his lifespan.</br>
</br>
But he couldn't do that.</br>
</br>
The reason? Obviously because of his responsibility.</br>
</br>
With his head pointed at by a "gun", it was certainly an obscure feeling.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the reflection of the statue on the ground as he suddenly grinned.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k! When am I ever afraid!]</br>
</br>
Just then, Lin Chaoen appeared in Jiang Chen's communication channel and said in an intermittent voice.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Could I interpret this as the negotiation failed?"</br>
</br>
The God's Cane on the synchronous orbit looked down at everything. Jiang Chen in the power armor in front of the soldiers obviously didn't escape his eyes.</br>
</br>
"When did you get the illusion that I planned to negotiate with you?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned and gazed at the "block" option on the hologram screen and closed the communication channel.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen's voice ceased all of a sudden. Jiang Chen raised his head and iron arm to the clear sky, giving it a middle finger.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The survivors beside the tires tossed out the lighters in their hands.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With the thick smoking rising, the Fishbone base used the most primal way to send out a help signal.</br>
</br>
When the Sixth Street and Camp 27 saw the smoke in Fishbone's direction, they immediately responded.</br>
</br>
"All units wait for orders! Complete preparation in one minute, and rush to the base in half an hour! Quick! Quick!"</br>
</br>
Under Cheng Weiguo's thunderous roar, the soldiers boarded the trucks.</br>
</br>
The gate immediately opened, and the First Corps led the charge while the Second Corps followed. The two helicopters also lifted off with electromagnetic cannons and the power armor paratroops to provide assistance to the base.</br>
</br>
The First and Second Corps only had 1000 people left to garrison in Camp 27, with everyone else returning on route to defend the base.</br>
</br>
Inside the tank, Cheng Weiguo gazed at the rising smoke with eyebrows locked.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Sixth Street also began to mobilize its soldiers. When the patrol soldiers at the gate discovered the smoke from Fishbone base, Zhao Gang immediately led two-thirds of the Third Corps force along with 1000 mercenaries still under contract in Fishbone's direction.</br>
</br>
"The communication channel has been blocked. I should have known that something was wrong." Chu Nan stared at the "Standby" command on the EP with concern.</br>
</br>
The enemy not only blocked off communication, but they also hijacked the communication channel between the Fishbone base and the Sixth Street. To avoid suspicion, to any of the requests sent by Chu Nan, the enemy used the ambiguous "Standby" command.</br>
</br>
"But who could it be?" Chu Nan stared at the hologram map and fell into thought.</br>
</br>
While the three Corps were being mobilized, the battle outside of the Fishbone wall also started.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The mortars launched a series of electromagnetic shells before it exploded outside the wall.</br>
</br>
The "reptile" equipped with grenade launchers continued to fire with explosions happening all over the wall.</br>
</br>
Concrete debris flew as a lot of reinforced steels were exposed.</br>
</br>
The soldiers behind cover valiantly fought and fired back with rifles in hand. In the conflict against weapons, the nitrogen armor recently equipped to the force became useful.</br>
</br>
The soldiers let the shrapnel fly above their heads as they raised the Red Arrow-42 behind cover, they used their roar to disperse away any fear they had.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The rocket launched out and flew into the high air before crashing down at rapid speed, directed at the escaping "reptile" robot.</br>
</br>
"Nice sh—"</br>
</br>
The explosion sound interrupted his voice. The loud noise transmitted the vibration below everyone's feet.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! The gate is blown open."</br>
</br>
In modern warfare, a wall didn't serve many purposes. A high-speed quadruped robot dashed in front of the gate and exploded the C4 on its body and blew the entire steel gate away.</br>
</br>
"The East gate is lost! I repeat! The East gate is lost!"</br>
</br>
"Shrink the defensive line."</br>
</br>
"Get the electromagnetic cannon up! Quick!"</br>
</br>
Because the radio was blocked, control could only rely on the loudspeaker in the base which made the entire scene chaotic. The "reptile" that broke into the wall quickly turned its gun and began to unleash its furious firepower on the wall. The soldiers that couldn't dodge in time all dropped to the ground and left a trail of blood splashes on the wall.</br>
</br>
"EMP!"</br>
</br>
With a loud roar, a soldier dived to the ground, dodged the bullets above his head, and threw an EMP grenade below the wall.</br>
</br>
The static noise temporarily filled the battle scene as the closest "reptile" immediately shut down, the other ones all stalled.</br>
</br>
At the same time, an orange bullet shower came from the apartment side.</br>
</br>
The Hunter Corps hidden behind ground covers simultaneously pressed the trigger at the "reptile" and "viper" that broke through the wall. The bullets splattered all over the steel surface.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Type-99 anti-tank cannon moved down from the wall, unleashed its power, and left massive craters on the wall and ground.</br>
</br>
The soldiers on the wall began to retreat which brought the battle down to the ground. The family of the soldiers all retreated into the mansion and community center, males with some strength and even some strong females were handed a rifle to stand on the frontline to defend the people that mattered the most.</br>
</br>
The community center and Jiang Chen's mansion were the top priority of the Supreme's attack, and the NAC soldiers would not let their plan succeed as they didn't give up any ground.</br>
</br>
At the office on the top floor of the mansion, Jiang Chen in power armor looked outside.</br>
</br>
The battle line was gradually moving toward the mansion, soldiers already moved back to the wall of the mansion backyard. The flying shrapnel even scratched the bulletproof glass and left spider web-like cracks on it.</br>
</br>
"Only five minutes passed?"</br>
</br>
He looked at the time on the screen and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Are you going to go?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao voice came from behind him. She was leaning on the door with a PK2000 hanging in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
From the kinetic skeleton on her body along with the expression on her face, her intention was obvious.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
"I'm there to cheat, why are you following me," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
If it is a robot, then that method should work! But regardless, it was risky to do.</br>
</br>
Cheat?</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn't understand his words, but it didn't prevent her from showing her determination.</br>
</br>
"Protecting this home," Sun Jiao said seriously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a loud explosion came from outside the mansion; it sounded like something exploded against the wall.</br>
</br>
"Be careful."</br>
</br>
"You too." Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen and smiled.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 484: This is Impossible</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Their firepower is too strong!"</br>
</br>
The machine gunner kneeled behind cover and roared.</br>
</br>
"EMP! Is there more EMP?" An infantry five meters out shouted at him.</br>
</br>
"All gone! Dammit, I need ammo—"</br>
</br>
His eardrums were almost shattered due to the violent explosions. He gritted his teeth without his finger leaving the trigger. With the communication being blocked and the constant explosions, they could only shout to communicate.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a mortar shell smashed onto the side of the cover.</br>
</br>
A bowl sized dent appeared on the steel surface, the machine gunner kneeling behind it didn't have time to react before being smashed by the caving effect and flew out.</br>
</br>
Seeing his comrade die, the soldier on the side's eyes became bloodshot. He got up to the machine gun position. But before he could make two steps, he was shredded to pieces by the bullets that came from the sky.</br>
</br>
Smoke dispersed from the launcher. The reptile that just fired stood still and started the reloading program.</br>
</br>
The battle was completely chaotic. The commanding voice was covered by the sound of bullets and fires. With communication being suppressed, the Supreme was slowly but surely gaining the upper hand.</br>
</br>
Multiple Python drones broke out from the fire suppression and soared in at low altitude. The engine spat at blue air streams and ripped a hole in NAC's defensive line.</br>
</br>
Then they encountered a giant hand.</br>
</br>
The smoke grenade exploded, and Jiang Chen in his power armor suddenly broke out from the wall, and both of his hands reached for the roaming Pythons.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen passed by them, the two Pythons disappeared out of thin air.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his left eye as a cocky smirk appeared on his lips.</br>
</br>
After being sent to the pitch black small universe, the two drones instantly became flies without heads and smashed against the edge of the small universe. Because there was no oxygen, the engine immediately stalled. The drones without power and information guidance stopped at the edge of the universe.</br>
</br>
"Just like what I expected… with robots, a storage dimension is the trump card."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and looked at the drones and quadruped robots outside of the smoke screen.</br>
</br>
Because they were not living creatures, the energy they consumed to be put into the storage dimension was similar to normal items. With the robot units with sizes no bigger than two cubic meters, the storage dimension was like cheating.</br>
</br>
As long as he could reach them.</br>
</br>
The quadruped robots trying to break through the wall found the power armor and immediately turned its machine gun and began to focus fire on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Nitrogen armor!</br>
</br>
The violent air stream blew open and shifted the bullets. The turbine engines on him propelled and dragged him to the wall on the side.</br>
</br>
</br>
Tatatata-</br>
</br>
At least 20 reptiles moved toward the collapsed wall with their machine guns on the top unleashing its fury and continuing its destruction on the smoke and wall.</br>
</br>
But at the same time, countless steel strings attached with magnets stuck to the twenty reptile robots.</br>
</br>
[As long as I can touch them!]</br>
</br>
With a grimacing smile, Jiang Chen hid behind cover and dragged onto the strings in hand.</br>
</br>
"I'm a fu*king genius!"</br>
</br>
Storage dimension, activate!</br>
</br>
The twenty-something robots connected by the string disappeared from the battleground.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible!"</br>
</br>
Standing in the space station, Lin Chaoen very "humanly" pressed his arms against the table and looked in disbelief at the satellite image.</br>
</br>
The twenty robots just disappeared under his eyes. He thought that he made a mistake when he saw the two Pythons disappear, but with that look, the power armor was strange.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen's eyes adjusted as the digitalized eyes locked onto the power armor.</br>
</br>
[Jiang Chen?]</br>
</br>
He narrowed his eyes while a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
His finger slid on the screen and selected 200 drones and 20 Reptiles. Then his finger pressed onto the power armor.</br>
</br>
"The General is on the battlefield? It's like you're asking for death."</br>
</br>
But just then, the corner of his eyes caught a familiar but distant figure.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible!"</br>
</br>
Muttering to himself, disbelief was written all over his face.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, there are too many!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gritted his teeth and dodged the bullets coming toward him. The nitrogen armor could only blow so much mass away. If the unit was attacked by too many bullets, the nitrogen armor could easily be shredded.</br>
</br>
He could, of course, use the interdimensional travel ability to dodge, but with the fact that Lin Chaoen was in the God's Cane watching him, any of the exposed areas must be under his watch. If possible, he didn't want to reveal this ability.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the mansion, Sun Jiao raised the Ghost Sniper Rifle and provided assistance to Jiang Chen. She tried desperately not to let her troubled state distract her focus, but when she saw the waves of bullets directed at Jiang Chen, her heat uncontrollably clenched.</br>
</br>
"Please don't let anything happen!"</br>
</br>
She pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang—!</br>
</br>
The Reptile with its observation hole penetrated collapsed on the ground with sparks emerging from its body.</br>
</br>
Just then, she was suddenly alerted and immediately rolled to the side. At the same time, a series of bullets flew to her from the back and smashed the tile she was on into debris.</br>
</br>
"Pshh!"</br>
</br>
She spat out and took out the laser pistol around her waist. With her index finger scrolling through the power adjustment, she pressed the trigger simultaneously.</br>
</br>
The powerful laser beam instantly fired and burned the Reptile as the robot fell down from the roof.</br>
</br>
Just then, a cold sweat rolled down from her forehead. In her field of vision, at least ten Reptiles appeared.</br>
</br>
The black muzzles were all locked onto her.</br>
</br>
[Dammit, she didn't focus on her surroundings.]</br>
</br>
Just as Sun Jiao raised her pistol in despair and fired onto the Reptile closest to her, a red light suddenly broke out through the air and the Reptiles and surrounded Sun Jiao all collapsed onto the ground.</br>
</br>
The laser rifle in her hand also stalled.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin!" Sun Jiao looked at Lin Lin in shock.</br>
</br>
She was covering her left eye while tumbling to get up onto the roof. She clenched onto a dagger in her hand and pressed it against her heart.</br>
</br>
"Did we make it… Uhhh! Don't move around! You don't want him to be hurt either. Whatever since you can't go back! I promise you, I will lend my body to you sometimes… Uh!" She seemed to be fighting against something as the muscles on her face twitched while she muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
Then, she forcefully moved her eyes to the drones and robots surrounding Jiang Chen. Then with a sharp shout, "Now!"</br>
</br>
A red light began to form in Lin Lin's eyes. The solidified light twisted space and something horrific was building up.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao first paused. Before she was aware of what was going on, she stood up and shouted to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Quick, use travel!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't hesitate at all when he heard Sun Jiao's shout and instantly disappeared from where he stood.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the crimson particles fired through the battlefield and destroyed all the electronics in the area. The high-density Klein particles rapidly decayed to the third dimension. The accelerated high energy particles instantly fried all the internal circuits of the robots and drones.</br>
</br>
Klein particles ray.</br>
</br>
The trump card invented by the Harmony against the Supreme.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen muttered with his digitalized eyes locked onto Lin Lin, streams of data flowed through his pupils.</br>
</br>
The sample in Fallout Shelter 05.</br>
</br>
The masterpiece of his father.</br>
</br>
The first digitalized human.</br>
</br>
His sister.</br>
</br>
Number 00.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
(Lin Lin has the same sound as 00 in Chinese.)</br>

</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse again, he was completely stunned.</br>
</br>
All the Reptile robots' machine guns stalled and the Pythons drones crashed.</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k! What kind of cheat is more powerful than mine?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately looked in the mansion's direction. He saw Lin Lin with a dagger in one hand while she waved at him with the other.</br>
</br>
[It was it… or her.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was perplexed.</br>
</br>
Tingting was a spy sent by Harmony. Even if the "Antenna" was no longer there, he didn't have an idea how he should take of it as he has been hesitant. She seemed to like him but his impression of her was far less.</br>
</br>
And she just saved him.</br>
</br>
[Whatever… I'll think about it later.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh. Just then, his pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>
The dagger from Lin Lin's hand slid down. The swaying body slowly fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao saw that something was odd and immediately jumped to that direction. But because the distance was too far, she was just inches away.</br>
</br>
With hands hanging in the air, Sun Jiao watched Lin Lin fall to the ground as she screamed out a cry.</br>
</br>
"No!"</br>
</br>
Just then, a shadow broke through the air as Jiang Chen caught Lin Lin falling to the ground head first. He rolled on the ground with her in between his arms and smashed into the wall.</br>
</br>
His head was dizzy from the impact, but he shook it off and looked at Lin Lin in his arms anxiously.</br>
</br>
The helmet opened as Jiang Chen put his head closer. When he felt the faint breath, he finally felt relieved.</br>
</br>
"Pervert… do you want to kiss me again?" Lin Lin's eyes opened a line and looked at Jiang Chen as she said feebly.</br>
</br>
"Could you not say that every time?" Jiang Chen wryly replied.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin smiled and looked away. A red hue covered her pale face.</br>
</br>
[Switch to me.] Tingting's voice surfaced in her head.</br>
</br>
[No, let me stay for a bit longer,] since she already controlled the technique to speak with her, Lin Lin said in her head.</br>
</br>
"You lied to me!"</br>
</br>
[How could I? I said I would lend you the body, but, but this is a princess hug!] Lin Lin's face blushed even more.</br>
</br>
Although a layer of steel was between them.</br>
</br>
[So switch to me!]</br>
</br>
"What are you murmuring to yourself about?" Jiang Chen had a genuine smile on his face when he saw Lin Lin with continually changing expressions.</br>
</br>
"No, nothing—"</br>
</br>
Bang—</br>
</br>
The bullets fired at Jiang Chen and hit his back.</br>
</br>
"Ouch!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a painful roar and covered Lin Lin in his lap.</br>
</br>
The back was the entrance to the power armor and the weakest point of the power armor. It was the most foolish choice to face the enemy with his back, but he was hugging Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Warning: Power module damaged.</br>
</br>
</br>
[Fu*k! Too careless!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't dare to hesitate. He swung his hand with a steel hook and fired it into the smoke, sticking to the Reptile Robot. His hand shook and the steel string along with the robot disappeared into thin air.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen's expression changed again.</br>
</br>
The power model being damaged meant that the entire power armor had collapsed and the 300-kilogram weight was being held on by his pure muscle strength. His entire body felt like it was injected with lead.</br>
</br>
Afraid to stay any longer, Jiang Chen stood up with Lin Lin still in his arms. Dragging his heavy body, he jogged to the side of the mansion.</br>
</br>
"I will cover for you!'</br>
</br>
Right now, Sun Jiao was already on the top floor with the sniper rifle aimed at the collapsed mansion wall. But then, her eyes widened.</br>
</br>
Ten Reptile drones and ten Python drones swarmed into the broken wall again.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how skillful her shooting was, she could not take out 20 targets in an instant.</br>
</br>
"Dammit." Jiang Chen raised the machine guns on his right arm and fired at the robotic force.</br>
</br>
The bullets sparkled on the mechanical surface, but the enemy's firepower was no inferior. To protect Lin Lin, he had to take the shots.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh—"</br>
</br>
With finger locked on the trigger, the machine guns revolved rapidly. With one hand holding Lin Lin and covering her on the side, Jiang Chen moved toward the edge of the mansion with difficulty.</br>
</br>
As long as he could circle to the other side.</br>
</br>
Warning: Armor damage 80%, please exit the power armor as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, just put me down." Lin Lin put her hand in front of Jiang Chen's chest and gave him a feeble smile.</br>
</br>
"Enough my a*s!" Jiang Chen gritted his teeth as he locked onto the mechanical force rushing in without consideration for loss, "I fu*king said that I would take you to try all the puddings in the world."</br>
</br>
Although he used derogatory words, Lin Lin felt a stream of warmth flow inside her.</br>
</br>
She felt the vibration in the front of her chest and gently closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
[What to do?]</br>
</br>
[The storage dimension is full.]</br>
</br>
With the energy of the nitrogen armor nearly depleted and the increasingly powerful force attacking him, Jiang Chen clenched his teeth and used his spare hand to fire back.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, at where his crosshair aimed, dust erupted and interrupted the bullets coming at him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and raised his head as his expression turned ecstatic.</br>
</br>
[It was the Type-51 helicopter! The Second Corps finally made it!]</br>
</br>
"Direct him."</br>
</br>
"Reloading… completed."</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
"This is Gunship 1, we have arrived at target airspace. General, are you okay?"</br>
</br>
The calm voice rang in Jiang Chen's ears. The electromagnetic cannon destroyed the communication hijacking device, and the communication returned to normal.</br>
</br>
"I'm very… not good. Thank you all. You finally made it." Jiang Chen sat on the ground, on his butt, and forced a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
Finally made it.</br>
</br>
Six black dots dropped down from the sky, and the airborne power armor landed in the backyard of the mansion as they spread out, in formation, to protect Jiang Chen. At the same time, the electromagnetic pulse cannon hovering in the sky unleashed its power against the enemy and smashed the robotic force. The victory was beginning to tip towards NAC's side.</br>
</br>
The communication returned to normal and the teams that fought independently united again.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua in the community center immediately executed the battle plan through the map. She ordered the remaining force in the base and the paratroopers that entered the battle to launch retaliation attack against the remaining mechanical force.</br>
</br>
The outcome of the battle was determined.</br>
</br>
In the space station, Lin Chaoen looked emotionlessly at the pawns disappearing one by one.</br>
</br>
He still didn't understand how Jiang Chen made the robots disappear.</br>
</br>
And the ability to suddenly disappear and appear.</br>
</br>
"Could it be the hidden genetic code? No, that's not possible… The anti-physics ability is not something that the hidden genetic code can achieve." Lin Chaoen slowly closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
On his face, there were no more expressions that mimicked a human. All his computation power was used to analyze the event. But some of the things could not be solved by just computation.</br>
</br>
He let out a sigh and opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Father, I need your intelligence."</br>
</br>
He muttered and pressed the control interface a few times. The antenna he just fixed was pointed to a location in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
The plan half failed. Harmony left the battle, but Jiang Chen was still alive. He wanted to know what he should do next. And Lin Lin was still alive. The outcome from Fallout Shelter 05 was no longer as disastrous as they had thought.</br>
</br>
Just then, Yao Yao who was busy working in front of a computer without much effect finally felt relieved by the fact that the communication returned to a normal state. She suddenly realized an odd wave.</br>
</br>
A wave from space.</br>
</br>
Directed toward…</br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, Yao Yao moved her nimble fingers and quickly pressed on the screens to track the target of the signal.</br>
</br>
The hologram surfaced as the target appeared as a red dot on the map.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was fixated on the map. Her eyes widened and slowly gulped.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao finally achieved something…"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 486: Counterattack</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The battle left the area in shambles.</br>
</br>
Right now, Fishbone base was filled with glass shards, exposed steel, and concrete debris. The apartments near the wall were half-destroyed by grenades and recoilless cannons. The community center was also damaged. Even half of a wall at Jiang Chen's mansion was blown up by heavy machine gun bullets.</br>
</br>
A series of steel scaffolds were set up around the buildings and walls that needed repair with Lu Huasheng leading the survivors to start the restoration project. Wang Qin led the logistics department to start evaluating the loss of supplies and overseeing the military factory to restart production.</br>
</br>
70% of the recruits suffered casualties and 50% of the Hunter Corps was either injured or killed. It was a tragic battle.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen personally led the funeral of the deceased warriors and buried their bodies in the cemetery outside the base.</br>
</br>
The scale of their loss wasn't an exaggeration.</br>
</br>
But it wasn't without some rewards.</br>
</br>
Right now, Jiang Chen's storage dimension was filled with robots and drones that couldn't move. Without commands from the terminal, the robots without intelligence could only move their limbs in the storage dimension while their engines roared and spent their remaining power to search for a non-existent enemy.</br>
</br>
Once the robots lost power, Jiang Chen could take them and send to the Fallout Shelter for technology restoration and improvement work.</br>
</br>
To coordinate the rebuilding effort, Jiang Chen found Jiang Lin. The guy's arm was wounded by a bullet so it was covered by thick bandages and wasn't in the best shape. Although he was sympathetic to his situation, there were still more urgent matters to take care of. Jiang Chen didn't send too many condolences before getting to the main point.</br>
</br>
"It was confirmed that NAC's opposing force controls the God's Cane. Dyou have any way of shooting it down?"</br>
</br>
"The God's Cane?" Jiang Lin looked troubled. "That's going to be hard - that thing is known as the space fortress. With missiles, they might approach the orbit before being destroyed by the laser anti-missile system."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
The God's Cane was a sword hanging in the air. Without taking it out, it would be hard to sleep at night. Even if the tungsten rods were all used up, it was hard to prevent Lin Chaoen from acquiring another round from the synchronous orbit and reloading it.</br>
</br>
"The key is: to what extent did he repair the God's Cane? Even if the laser anti-missile system is repaired, our ability to do high damage is still limited." Jiang Lin didn't seem to have any better solutions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said, "The God's Cane shouldn't be fully repaired. If we use the Northwind-76, could it do damage?"</br>
</br>
"In theory, the Northwind-76 could reach the synchronous orbit. But if it carried conventional ballistic missiles and they exploded in a vacuum environment, it would still be difficult for the resulting shockwaves to damage the shell of the God's Cane," Jiang Lin explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
Since it was the weapon NATO refined for a century, it was too much to ask a forged version of Northwind-76 to take down this "space fortress."</br>
</br>
"What if we carried EMP instead?" Jiang Chen proposed.</br>
</br>
"It's hard for normal EMP to damage the electronic components of God's Cane. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so hard to take down." Jiang Lin shook his head.</br>
</br>
"We don't need to damage the God's Cane." A smile surfaced on Jiang Lin's face. "We just need to take out the robot hidden inside the God's Cane."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to think as he stroked his chin.</br>
</br>
"In theory, it's possible. If the outer shell of the God's Cane is damaged, wide-range EMP weapons should be able to damage the mechanical parts."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave Jiang Lin the problem of solving the issue in the sky before heading to the community center and meeting the leaders of the Three Divisions as well as the leader of the Hunter Division to call for an emergency meeting.</br>
</br>
Just half an hour ago, Yao Yao, who was working hard to break through the communication blockage, happened to intercept the communication coordinates between the God's Cane and a ground facility. The target was inside Wanghai and Jiang Chen wouldn't let this guy escape.</br>
</br>
The target was on the edge of the east side of the city center, the right bank of the Huangpu River. Based on the issues with the relationship to Liuding, multiple rocket launchers didn't have the right bank of the Huangpu River as a target area.</br>
</br>
In simple war mobilization, Jiang Chen sent out the order with Han Junhua establishing a battle plan.</br>
</br>
At the end of the ten-minute meeting, all three corps were prepared and ready to mobilize. With 1000 soldiers left to defend the camp, the three corps departed. At the same time, the eight "Fireball-1s" on the launching ground were fully locked and loaded to cover the area with combustion missiles to eliminate any mutants in the area.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the helicopter transported all the researchers from the Aerospace Technology Research Institute to Shenxiang to change the module of the Northwind-76 deployed from combustible material to a wide-range EMP device.</br>
</br>
Once the module was changed, it would be launched into the geosynchronous orbit to eliminate the robot in God's Cane – Lin Chaoen.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It had been half an hour since the Northwind-76 was launched into the air.</br>
</br>
At the Lin Fallout Shelter, three thousand meters underground:</br>
</br>
The central computer in the middle of the room quietly hummed. Inside the silent space, the only sound was the buzzing of the processors.</br>
</br>
The screen above the central computer flashed a faint light. The middle-aged man on the screen had his hand supporting his chin and he fell into silence inside the empty fallout shelter. He glanced at the nutrient vial underneath the screen. The life support device contained his brain.</br>
</br>
After he abandoned his body twenty years ago, he hadn't looked at it since. But now that he was looking at it, he felt wistful.</br>
</br>
Of course, a heart is an abstract concept. He didn't have a heart and aside from his brain, all his organs were replaced by mechanical parts. When he found a device that could allow mechanics to replace his brain, he could even ditch that last hindrance.</br>
</br>
A cold light slowly illuminated the fallout shelter. It came from the bottom of a hibernation chamber. Suddenly, the inert gas leaked out and the chamber door opened. Ahandsome man walked out.</br>
</br>
The convenience of being a robot was exactly this - even after countless destructions, as long as the backup data was there, they could reincarnate countless times.</br>
</br>
"Father." Lin Chaoen kneeled on the ground.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." He replied and didn't speak more.</br>
</br>
This was a rare time when "father" didn't give any instructions to his son. He only quietly looked at him. Whenever he looked at it, he felt like he was looking at a puppet.</br>
</br>
But he understood the feeling. Due to the insufficiency of intermediate artificial intelligence in dealing with emotions, rather than saying they were individuals, they were more like tools without desires and needs.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, he abruptly said, "What should we do?"</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen looked up and smiled.</br>
</br>
"I was awaiting for your instructions."</br>
</br>
Father let out a sigh and shook his head. Although he was infinitely close to a God, ultimately, before he could digitalize his consciousness, he was a human after all. After he lost the God's Cane, he lost everything. From the satellite image from the God's Cane, the NAC force was moving in his direction. They not only sent an EMP missile to attack God's Cane, but they were now using combustion missiles to wipe out the mutants in the area.</br>
</br>
The original plan was for the robotic force he controlled to attack Fishbone base. Whether Jiang Chen surrendered or died, NAC would collapse. The entire Wanghai region would once again return to chaos, and all the survivors would become believers of the Supreme. He would have the opportunity again to restart the advanced artificial intelligence project and lead all his believers on the path to digitalization.</br>
</br>
But reality and his plan were different.</br>
</br>
Whether it was Lin Lin or Jiang Chen's abilities, they were the variables that affected the outcome.</br>
</br>
Right now, with their coordinates exposed, they had to face the wrath of the NAC.</br>
</br>
"With the computation power of the quantum computer, we still can't calculate the next move?" Father asked.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen didn't reply as he quietly waited for Father's instructions.</br>
</br>
The computer itself couldn't think unless humans told them what to think.</br>
</br>
[It's so close?]</br>
</br>
Father looked at Lin Chaoen kneeling on the ground and entered deep thought.</br>
</br>
But just then, Lin Chaoen abruptly interrupted the silence in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, in that base, I saw Lin Lin."</br>
</br>
The kind father on the screen paused then his pupils began to narrow.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 487"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 487: A Pleasant Surprise</br>
</div></br>
</br>
320 rockets ascended and pierced the dome. They blanketed the New Age Square along the bank of the Huangpu River.</br>
</br>
The rockets penetrated the concrete without any explosion. Blue sparks jumped outside the missiles and loud static buzzed in the area. The machine guns present became fried as the 320 EMP rockets eliminated any unprotected electronics.</br>
</br>
A helicopter hovered above the New Age Square and confirmed the area was secure. The three corps began to pass over the bridge and the force totaling 5000 people were pushed to the square without any resistance.</br>
</br>
In an EMP attack of such intensity and density, even if a chip was built with EMP resistance, it still couldn't be protected from being fried.</br>
</br>
Without any fighting required, the NAC soldiers captured the area easily. But what made Cheng Weiguo puzzled was why they didn't face any resistance or people; it made him feel like his fist hadn't landed anywhere.</br>
</br>
After discussing with Zhao Gang and Wang Zhaowu, Cheng Weiguo ordered the corps to station themselves in the square and he sent out reconnaissance units to scout the area.</br>
</br>
Near New Age Square, the First Corps reconnaissance units discovered a data tower installed on the surface as well as an automated factory. When they found the place, Cheng Weiguo immediately sent out soldiers to occupy the area and obtained two production lines to the Reptile drone and Python drone.</br>
</br>
Compared to the multi-functional "Hummingbird" drone, the Python was a complete war machine. The hovering fixed machine guns along with its elongated design allowed the unit to be agile while carrying six times the amount of ammo capacity compared to the Hummingbird. It possessed an independent attack module which allowed it to operate in offline mode while still detecting friendly units and analyzing the terrain to complete the mission.</br>
</br>
The Reptile drone was just like the Python - it was an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that could still operate in offline mode. It could assist the infantry during battle to act as a mobile supply box and an even more powerful mobile fire platform. The name "Battle Assistant" didn't come out of nowhere.</br>
</br>
It was a pleasant surprise to be able to find so many goodies at Lin Chaoen's base.</br>
</br>
Soon after, the Third Corps found the entrance to the fallout shelter in the metro station near the square. They cleared out the zombies inside the area and secured the location.</br>
</br>
But a new problem appeared.</br>
</br>
They took the elevator underground and secluded themselves there entirely.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo immediately made orders to take apart the elevator platform and sent a knight in power armor. The power armor was tied to a graphene rapport and if anything odd happened, they would immediately drag him up.</br>
</br>
Once he reached the bottom, the knight encountered a situation similar to Fallout Shelter 027.</br>
</br>
</br>
The fallout shelter's door was tightly shut. The thick door didn't look like it could be opened with force. The gear-shaped door was engraved with "Lin Fallout Shelter." Just from the name, the fallout shelter was probably private and not a numbered fallout shelter constructed by the PAC.</br>
</br>
The people inside probably used data towers on the surface to exchange information.</br>
</br>
Facing this circumstance, Cheng Weiguo had to contact Jiang Chen for directions.</br>
</br>
"Although we can't open the door, we can place explosives underneath. We only need an equivalent of 100 tons of explosives to make the 3000-meter tunnel collapse and bury them underground."</br>
</br>
"If we're only burying them, it's still a hazard." Jiang Chen shook his head. "And I'm also curious what's behind the door."</br>
</br>
"But in theory, the door to the fallout shelter can't be opened from the outside with force." Cheng Weiguo had a wry smile.</br>
</br>
It was indeed a difficult problem and Jiang Chen couldn't think of any solutions. It was a turtle shell even a nuke couldn't crack; he didn't have any better solutions.</br>
</br>
"How about this? Standby there and I'll make a trip down."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Cheng Weiguo nodded.</br>
</br>
Communication ended. Jiang Chen closed his eyes and began to think, leaning on his chair.</br>
</br>
But after some deliberation, he still hadn't come up with a solution.</br>
</br>
Just then came some knocks on the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
The door opened and Sun Jiao, without a kinetic skeleton, came in.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin already recovered, but she's still really weak. Tingting in her body used too much energy by using the Klein particle ray. What's going on at the frontlines?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao wearily grabbed a chair and sat in front of Jiang Chen's desk.</br>
</br>
"Lin Chaoen's base is cleared out and we obtained two production lines. The only problem is, their people hid in the fallout shelter… if they have people."</br>
</br>
"Bury them with nukes," Sun Jiao said menacingly.</br>
</br>
Whenever she thought about the bullet holes in the walls and the base in shambles, she felt angry. After living there for so long, this place was her home. It would be hard to ease her hatred unless she wiped out those despicable people.</br>
</br>
"That's a must, but burying them is too easy of an ending for them." Jiang Chen smiled at Sun Jiao gritting her teeth.</br>
</br>
"Then what do we do? They won't come out of their turtle shells." Sun Jiao put her hand on the table and pouted her mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment and said, "I'll make a trip down there."</br>
</br>
"A trip down there?" Sun Jiao looked cautiously at Jiang Chen. "Are you going to do something dangerous?"</br>
</br>
"How's that possible?" Jiang Chen rolled his eyes. "I'm going to see if I can throw the door into the storage dimension."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen with skepticism while laying on her arm.</br>
</br>
"That should be hard. I remember your storage dimension can't cut out items connected to something. In the case of a door, it's attached to the wall."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao conducted an experiment with Jiang Chen that tested to see it was possible to throw other people's guns in their hands into the storage dimension. The answer was no because creatures with life energy above a certain level couldn't enter the storage dimension, and the guns held by people by default were viewed as one. But magnets connected with steel could be transported.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen guessed they might have to forcibly move atoms on the surface. He didn't explain why the items on the floor weren't viewed as being relative to the earth.</br>
</br>
Even now, there were still many secrets he didn't understand from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"How would you do it without testing?" Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Although he knew it was a lost cause, it was worth trying. That place contained the top technology of the Supreme. Two production lines would be extremely helpful and who knew what else was inside?</br>
</br>
He came to the hanger and the two helicopters returned to the base on standby.</br>
</br>
He changed into a new set of T-3 power armor. Just as Jiang Chen was about to board, Lin Lin ran over with small steps.</br>
</br>
He stopped in front of the helicopter as he turned around in shock.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin? Why are you here?"</br>
</br>
"I..." She bent over with her hands on her knees to regain her breath. She looked to the side, slightly embarrassed. "I heard from sister Sun Jiao that you're going there and I'm worried, so I followed along."</br>
</br>
"Take care of yourself first." Jiang Chen looked speechlessly at her and turned around to board.</br>
</br>
"Wait, don't leave! I-I can help! If your opponents are machines, I can use my Klein particle ray to wipe them out." Lin Lin raised her chest with pride with a proud curvature formed on her face. "I just saved you a few hours ago. You'll be safer with me."</br>
</br>
[It's what Tingting wanted.]</br>
</br>
Lin Lin added that in her mind.</br>
</br>
"With your current condition, could you still use that ability?" Jiang Chen asked with skepticism.</br>
</br>
"Of course, yes! I'm mostly recovered, so please bring me along!" Lin Lin nodded with certainty.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed and had to nod.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you have to promise you won't cause trouble."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry! I'm very obedient!" Lin Lin giggled and said cheerfully.</br>
</br>
With how energized she looked, Jiang Chen also felt less worried.</br>
</br>
It was indeed an excellent choice to bring Lin Lin along. The Klein particle ray was the nemesis of robots no matter how strong the robots were. And Lin Lin already knew the secret to his storage dimension. Bringing her along meant there were safety concerns and he didn't need to worry about his secret being leaked.</br>
</br>
Just like this, Lin Lin boarded the helicopter with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
With the guide's instructions, the helicopter slowly lifted off and transported the duo to the city center.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 488: The Not-so-heartwarming Reunion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
1000 meters underground.</br>
</br>
The vertical tunnel down was replaced by a new elevator supported by a durable graphene beam heading directly into the deep underground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, in T-3 power armor, was now on the elevator with his eyes focused on the hologram instructions in the helmet. The decreasing oxygen concentration made Jiang Chen especially wary.</br>
</br>
Just like he expected, the fallout shelter underground wasn't designed for humans.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was standing beside him and she was completely covered by an orange protective suit with a large oxygen tank strapped behind her. Although she was a digitalized human, her brain, and vital organs were still made out of organic matter. Even if a lot of organic parts were replaced by mechanical parts, she was still a human.</br>
</br>
"Open the oxygen supply device." When the oxygen concentration dropped below the threshold, Jiang Chen said calmly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Lin Lin obediently put her hand on her neck and opened the switch.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the temporary camp established at the New Age Square, it was already nighttime. But a thousand meters underground, there was no fundamental difference between night and day. In the beginning, Cheng Weiguo was firmly against the idea of going on until Jiang Chen made an order as the General.</br>
</br>
It made sense that he was worried since this was the enemy home base.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't worry too much as he still had 100 cubic meters in his storage dimension, so even a few Reptiles wouldn't be too troublesome especially since Lin Lin was with him and the Harmony creature hidden inside her was a robot killer. Almost no electronic units could survive under the Klein particle ray.</br>
</br>
When they were close to the bottom, Jiang Chen took out a tactical rifle and turned on the flashlight attached to it.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin beside him gulped and crouched cowardly with a hint of fear on her face.</br>
</br>
[Let me do it.] A contemptuous voice appeared in her heart; it must've been Tingting. After learning how to speak, she was more and more ruthless.</br>
</br>
[Who-who said I'm scared?] Lin Lin's face turned red as she immediately spoke in her mind.</br>
</br>
[It's not me.]</br>
</br>
"Just follow behind me." Jiang Chen noticed Lin Lin's fear and put his hand on her shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?! Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, who was distracted, flinched at Jiang Chen's actions. It wasn't until she realized what happened that an awkward blush appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, puzzled by the sight.</br>
</br>
[Is she really okay in her current state?]</br>
</br>
The elevator slowly reached the bottom and Jiang Chen's rifle locked onto the door of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
But just as he expected, the door was locked shut.</br>
</br>
He took Lin Lin to the door and he put his hand against it.</br>
</br>
[Storage dimension, activate!]</br>
</br>
</br>
There was no reaction…</br>
</br>
"The door and the wall are considered one?" Jiang Chen frowned and muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was deliberating how he should open the door, Lin Lin walked beside Jiang Chen and proposed to him in a small voice:</br>
</br>
"How about I use the ray to take out all the robots inside then we'll go back…"</br>
</br>
"Take them all out? Mhmm, that'll be our last resort. If possible, I want to get the stuff inside." Jiang Chen felt his way all along the gear-shaped door in an attempt to find a switch.</br>
</br>
Since it was the home base of the Supreme, if they could invent something like Lin Chaoen, then they must be advanced in electronic technology. Compared to Harmony's genetic technology, electronic technology was more coherent and applicable to the needs of the NAC.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin seemed scared of the darkness as she looked around the place, feeling unsettled.</br>
</br>
[There seems to be something not good about living inside, could I fire one ray at it?] Tingting said.</br>
</br>
[Let's not do it. If we destroy the stuff inside, Jiang Chen will be angry.] Lin Lin said in her mind.</br>
</br>
[Then we don't have a solution.] Tingting didn't say anything further.</br>
</br>
Without any luck finding a switch, there wasn't even a communication cable similar to Fallout Shelter 27. Jiang Chen took out the laser sword from the storage dimension and stabbed the thick door.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes passed by and the energy of the laser sword was completely drained.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen directed the flashlight at only one hol. The size of a nail was burnt out.</br>
</br>
"What material is this thing made out of?" Jiang Chen cursed and kicked the door.</br>
</br>
The noise echoed back was very deep. Just judging by the sound; the door was at least seven meters thick. It was more fitting to describe it as a wall.</br>
</br>
[Is giving up the only option?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Just as he wanted to ask Lin Lin to use the Klein particle ray at the door, the door suddenly moved.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was alerted and pulled out his rifle.</br>
</br>
"NOOO!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin screamed out in fear and hid behind Jiang Chen's back.</br>
</br>
The gear-shaped wall slowly moved forward and caused rock debris to fall down. Jiang Chen moved back slowly with Lin Lin and established a clear distance from the door. The vibrations continued for half a minute before the door came to a sudden halt and started to roll toward the side.</br>
</br>
[8.1 meters thick, mhmm… I might not be able to penetrate this.] Tingting said.</br>
</br>
[Is there anything you can't penetrate?] Lin Lin was curious.</br>
</br>
[Of course. Although Klein particles can cause strong electromagnetic pulses, it doesn't mean they have infinite penetrative power. You research this area and you should know this?]</br>
</br>
Although Tingting's voice didn't show any scorn, Lin Lin's face turned uncontrollably red. Just as she wanted to rebut, Jiang Chen stood in front of her and suddenly said:</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin, be prepared to fight. Try your best to control the power of the output and don't take apart the noncombat units."</br>
</br>
"Oh, okay!" Lin Lin nodded.</br>
</br>
But from inside the pitch black hole, a man with hands up to surrender walked up.</br>
</br>
When he saw the face, Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes and a red scope was already pointed on his face.</br>
</br>
"Lin Chaoen."</br>
</br>
"That's right. It's me." Lin Chaoen let out a sigh then joked, "I can't believe we meet again, in this fashion."</br>
</br>
"You provoked me multiple times, so you should've expected this day would come." With finger rubbing against the trigger, Jiang Chen spoke emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen shrugged and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Regardless, you won. In the end, Father wants to see you."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen then looked at Lin Lin who hid behind Jiang Chen with a bright smile on her face.</br>
</br>
"And you, my dear sister."</br>
</br>
"Sis… sister?" Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin in shock, but she looked puzzled too.</br>
</br>
"What?" Lin Lin looked at Lin Chaoen, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"You will know once you come in."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen smiled mysteriously at her, turned around, and headed into the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Looking at the pitch black tunnel, Jiang Chen was uncertainty whether it was a trap or if they really did surrender like what Lin Chaoen said.</br>
</br>
After debating for a while, Jiang Chen took out a signal stick, pulled the cord, and threw it in.</br>
</br>
The bright red light luminated the space. Other than rows of hibernation chambers, the basketball court-sized room didn't have any weapons. With his rifle raised, Jiang Chen took Lin Lin into the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Lin Lin hid behind Jiang Chen looked at his helmet anxiously.</br>
</br>
"If they're planning to close the door, shoot that engine at the door." Jiang Chen used a voice that Lin Chaoen could heart.</br>
</br>
"Oh…Okay!" Because she was too nervous, she almost bit her tongue.</br>
</br>
There wasn't too much light in the room other than the signal rod Jiang Chen threw out. The air in the room was filled with concentrated ozone. Because of this, the signal burned brightly.</br>
</br>
A tower-shaped computer sat in the middle of the room with the flashing signal lights indicating it was running. The middle of the computer, a vial with a brain inside and the bottom, was connected with a complex series of wiring to the different machines in the room.</br>
</br>
The room was filled with computers, hibernation chambers and nothing else with a sign of life.</br>
</br>
Other than saying it was a fallout shelter, the place was more of a mechanical city hidden underground. The central computer was its brain, and its heart and the complex wiring was its vein.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen walked beneath the computer and stopped.</br>
</br>
"Father, they are here."</br>
</br>
The screen suddenly lit up and a middle-aged face appeared in the center. The hairstyle looked sleek, the two eyebrows were thick but tidy, the blank pupils looked collected but possessed a degree of sharpness, and the glasses gave him a more educated vibe.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked at the man with pupils suddenly contracted as she took two steps forward.</br>
</br>
"Fa, father…"</br>
</br>
"Don't go." Jiang Chen put his hand on her shoulder.</br>
</br>
"No! That's my father! Let me go—" Lin Lin fought in an attempt to break free from Jiang Chen to run.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned by the situation.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect this could happen. His right hand was still holding the rifle with the left hand tightly grasping Lin Lin's shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin! Your father already went to—, went to the space colonization ship. This is only a video!"</br>
</br>
He almost said "went to heaven" but he changed halfway in the sentence.</br>
</br>
"Father, father! You're back to pick up your daughter, right?" Mist began to cover Lin Lin's eyes as she was about to cry,</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the middle-aged man and aimed at the screen.</br>
</br>
"If you continue to pretend to be Lin Lin's father, I'll shoot your brain!"</br>
</br>
"No—" Lin Lin screamed out.</br>
</br>
"I didn't pretend to be anyone." The middle-aged man on the screen closed his eyes and pointed down there, "I'm here. You should be able to see my brain."</br>
</br>
The room quieted down.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin blankly looked at him with disbelief in her eyes. "Brain? Dad, you…"</br>
</br>
Shock also appeared in Jiang Chen's eyes as he adjusted the aim to the vial.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's small adjustment, the middle-aged man laughed.</br>
</br>
"Is this how you treat your father-in-law?"</br>
</br>
[Father-in-law?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's face blushed as she waved her hands to cover up. "No, no, dad you're mistaken, he is not…"</br>
</br>
It was just that when she said that, she didn't sound like she meant it.</br>
</br>
"Ahem." The middle-aged man interrupted his daughter and looked seriously at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at him without a word. The rifle in hand still pointed at him – the brain.</br>
</br>
"If you feel like this will bring you a sense of security, you can point at it. But I have to let you know that the vial's glass could withstand the bullets of the anti-armor sniper rifle."</br>
</br>
[The Old man who smells like ozone, can I shoot him?] Tingting didn't disguise her disgust to mechanical parts.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin restrained Tingting who was eager to move.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and lowered his rifle.</br>
</br>
"By letting me in, you're preparing to surrender?"</br>
</br>
"I just want to see my daughter." The middle-aged man had a genuine smile on his face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes lit up. He didn't think the situation would evolve into the reunion of a father and a daughter.</br>
</br>
"Dad, where-where are you, the colonization ship—"</br>
</br>
"I didn't board the colonization ship," the middle-aged man told Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's eyes widened as she didn't realize what he said. She didn't know how she felt - shocked? Happy? Sad? Perhaps similar to no one, but close to all of the emotions combined.</br>
</br>
After a while, she squeezed out a few words.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Because there's no need to leave. Space is dark and it's the same going in any direction." The man slowly said.</br>
</br>
He then looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I'm confused. You seem to have a remarkable ability. Instincts tell me it's the primary reason why I'm lost."</br>
</br>
"I don't disagree with your perspective," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
[No sh*t. Without my interdimensional travel and storage dimension, I would've died many times already.]</br>
</br>
The man gazed into Jiang Chen's eyes then he sighed.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Although I hoped I would've lost because of a deeper reason."</br>
</br>
He then looked at Lin Lin, his daughter.</br>
</br>
"I'm not a qualified father. On the path to Supreme, if there is anything I regretted, it would be you."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin eyes teared up, "No, dad, you gave me life, you gave the opportunity to—"</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man interrupted her.</br>
</br>
"Do you know why you had muscular dystrophy?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin stopped, "Is it that because it is congenital—"</br>
</br>
"No." The man shook his head. "I did it."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin became idle with tears freezing on her face then she murmured in a quiet voice, "Why?"</br>
</br>
"It's a long story, if you have patience, watch this."</br>
</br>
His face looked reminiscent and slowly faded on the screen.</br>
</br>
The picture in the screen changed just like the old film tape rolling. It unfolded the history belonging here.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 489: The Path of Supreme</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The fundamental part of life is the journey and not the result.</br>
</br>
Birth, survival, fade to black.</br>
</br>
But in the end, how many people can live a life without regret?</br>
</br>
Immortality is an alluring concept that becomes even stronger when technological advancements reach the forbidden part of life.</br>
</br>
For a period of time, billions of dollars in investments flooded the industry as labs began to pop up like bamboo after the rain. People were willing to pay and people were willing to experiment. The wealthy wished to enjoy their lavish lives for longer, drawn in by the temptation of immortality since they couldn't bring their paper bills with them to the next life.</br>
</br>
But the current resources available couldn't support continuous population growth, even if only a small proportion of the population was immortal.</br>
</br>
Once immortality became a reality, it wouldn't bring human prosperity but rather, it'd be an apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Yes, it would be an apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The immortals would have an endless amount of time to accumulate wealth, reinforce their status, and become toxic to society, the cancer cells of civilization. They would extract nutrients from healthy "cells" and extract resources from ordinary people…</br>
</br>
It would be an apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The Science Ethics Committee was born. Three countries agreed to follow the accord and promised to prevent any technology that would cause public fear to be created while also strictly preventing others from breaking the first rule. In a world divided into three factions, a tacit understanding was easier to reach than in a world divided into more parts.</br>
</br>
Just like the IAEA in the modern world.</br>
</br>
But after the economic crisis in 2150, the tacit understand became threatened. Although the Science Ethics Committee still existed, their influence on the government and control of private capital was far inferior compared to half a century ago.</br>
</br>
The summer of 2160.</br>
</br>
"Doctor Lin Minjie, your research is suspected of violating Science Research Regulations. Please arrive at the court in Wanghai in ten days to face the interrogations of the Science Ethics Committee." A police in black stood in front of him and presented him with his ID.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible! My research is absolutely intended to better mankind! How dare you act on behalf of all of mankind—" Lin Minjie roared at the expressionless police.</br>
</br>
The man in a suit behind the police interrupted his roar as he spoke with contempt in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Because we receive one hundred billion in donations a year, because most people agree with our cause."</br>
</br>
"You only abuse people's fear of the unknown, you despicable, weak-minded fools." Lin Minjie stared at the man, wishing to strangle his neck, but his malicious intent was weaker than the strength of a policeman's hand.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Sorry, I also don't agree with your experiments of putting people's heads into metal boxes." The man in a suit pointed at his own head and smiled at him.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Please remain calm, Doctor Lin Minjie. If you are displeased with the process, please use a civilized process to resolve the problem in the courts. Of course, before that, we have to confiscate your research," the policeman said without emotion.</br>
</br>
"No, you can't take it away! My research is guilty of no crime!" Lin Minjie stared at the policemen flooding into this lab in despair as he watched them taking away his essays and equipment.</br>
</br>
"One more point - only safe technology is innocent." Before he left, the man in the suit smiled.</br>
</br>
After being accused of violating the Science Ethics Committee, his reputation was completely tarnished in the research field. The corporations all drew a clear line between themselves and him to avoid public distrust. Without funding, although he was an information technology and electrical engineering double major, he was unemployed.</br>
</br>
Life became very difficult.</br>
</br>
His beautiful wife left him, leaving behind the half-year-old Lin Lin. He couldn't afford rent for their 24th-floor apartment and had to move into a damp basement, living off PAC welfare.</br>
</br>
He spent six years in agony.</br>
</br>
In 2166, the situation finally took a turn.</br>
</br>
After the 2150 economic crisis, the global situation was visibly deteriorating. Each country was in conflict over resources, airspace sovereignty, and space exploration. In a matter of ten short years, trust fell to an all-time low. And naturally, the influence of international organizations such as the Science Ethics Committee became weaker and weaker.</br>
</br>
The research previously viewed as forbidden now had a resurgence in interest. It included advanced artificial intelligence and digitalized human technology.</br>
</br>
Finally, a renowned businessman found him.</br>
</br>
"Doctor Lin Minjie, although it might be hurtful to say this, but I'm taking a significant risk to meet you in person. You know, the media likes to assume things." While he was also in a suit, this man's attitude was so much better than the man who destroyed everything he owned.</br>
</br>
"I understand," Lin Minjie responded without any light in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Then I hope the risk I'm taking is worth it." The man smiled.</br>
</br>
"What do you want?" Lin Minjie looked up at the man in a suit.</br>
</br>
He signaled his assistant and placed a stack of documents 10-centimeters-thick on the table. Lin Minjie looked at the documents as disbelief appeared in his eyes along with a hint of hatred.</br>
</br>
It was because of this that he ended up in his current condition.</br>
</br>
"Oh… how did you get this?" Lin Minjie asked in a disinterested tone.</br>
</br>
"You're in an age where there's nothing that can't be resolved with money." The man smiled. "We need you to continue your research, and we'll pay for your research."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Lin Minjie agreed without hesitation. "Where's the contract?"</br>
</br>
The man shook his head.</br>
</br>
"You know, your research can't be written on the contract or it would become evidence. Even if the Science Ethics Committee doesn't have as much power as before, the court will still fine us, so—"</br>
</br>
He stopped there and signaled his assistant again.</br>
</br>
The assistant walked up and opened a briefcase on the table.</br>
</br>
There was a syringe inside.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Lin Minjie frowned and looked at the man in the suit, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"With just 10ml, this can make anyone get muscular dystrophy without any evidence and they would be at a terminal stage." The man smiled.</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie blankly looked at him and his devilish smile.</br>
</br>
"What… what do you mean?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing. It's just that if your only family member, your daughter, suffered from muscular dystrophy, then even the Science Ethics Committee wouldn't make too much commotion about a father saving his daughter. At the same time, us, East Pacific Heavy Industrial, will make a donation on humanitarian grounds to fund your research." The man lowered his voice. "With this, you'll be more motivated, right?"</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie looked at the man in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Out of his own surprise, he didn't feel anger or remorse. After experiencing the ups and downs of the past six years, he was thoroughly annoyed at the world and even felt hatred toward it.</br>
</br>
People always applied their own standards to other people and attacked people with different beliefs on supposedly ethical grounds. It would only take a few strokes of a pen on the prosecution document to end the results of ten years of research.</br>
</br>
Even though a family would collapse because of it…</br>
</br>
What exactly is ethics?</br>
</br>
He was lost.</br>
</br>
After that, the six-year-old Lin Lin "accidentally" suffered from muscular dystrophy after a cold and was diagnosed to be in the terminal stage. East Pacific Heavy Industrial donated 1 billion to support her father's research on digitalized humans. They also bought the media to use public opinion to support his cause and forced the Science Ethics Committee to withdraw their prosecution against the "great" father.</br>
</br>
He engraved consciousness onto a circuit board and used currents and mechanics to replace blood and bone.</br>
</br>
Public opinion about digitalized humans, the technology viewed by the world as forbidden, became surprisingly smooth under the support of East Pacific Heavy Industrial.</br>
</br>
The limitations of intermediate artificial intelligence were removed and the development of advanced artificial intelligence along with the body design ran concurrently. Although his feeble daughter stuck in a hospital ward made him feel some guilt, the rapid progress in technology gave him some slight comfort.</br>
</br>
The picture turned again - it was a hospital. Looking at the ward, Jiang Chen thought it looked familiar before he quickly remembered it was where he met Lin Lin for the first time.</br>
</br>
"Once Lin Lin can walk, dad will take you to the movie theater, to the amusement park. Anywhere you want to go, I will take you there." With a lily in the vial on the nightstand, Lin Minjie didn't look at his daughter's face. Instead, he spoke to the pristine white flower petal.</br>
</br>
"The uncle who made a donation is a good person." Lin Lin smiled joyfully.</br>
</br>
Even though all the muscles in her body were affected by the dystrophy, she still believed he could allow her to run freely under the sunshine again.</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie's throat twitched. He looked at his daughter.</br>
</br>
Looking at his daughter's bright smile, he didn't know what to say.</br>
</br>
Finally, he forced on a smile and squeezed out a sentence.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, he is a good person."</br>
</br>
And then, the war erupted.</br>
</br>
The 2150 economic crisis foreshadowed the war in 2171. Humans weren't machines and they could use logic to solve problems. Small problems could be fixed through meetings, but fundamental problems had to be addressed by war.</br>
</br>
East Pacific Heavy Industrial, who funded his research, was acquired by PAC to transform into a military corporation. He then went from being a scientist working for a private company to an academician serving the army, helping PAC to develop killing machines related to artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
He was involved in the development of Reptile and Python.</br>
</br>
Because of the war, the block on research was completely unlocked. War captives were constantly sent into Fallout Shelter 005 to live in a deadly virtual reality experience. The seed of the birth of advanced artificial intelligence was germinating, and the technology of digitalized humans was completed. Once Fallout Shelter 005's testing enabled the evolution from intermediate to advanced artificial intelligence, combined together, a human made up of completely mechanical parts would be born into this world!</br>
</br>
At the time, a sudden dangerous, extreme thought was born.</br>
</br>
If advanced artificial intelligence could replace humans and give birth to a new mechanical civilization, what was the purpose of humans?</br>
</br>
Humans were disgusting, greedy, pedantic, ugly…</br>
</br>
A crazy thought was born.</br>
</br>
He even gave the child that had yet to be born in this world a name.</br>
</br>
It would be called Supreme.</br>
</br>
The Supreme who was above all.</br>
</br>

</br>
"How…" Tears filled Lin Lin's eyes as she stared at the image on the screen and mumbled, "No, this must be a lie. Jiang Chen, tell me, dad is lying to me, right…?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took her into his arms without saying a word.</br>
</br>
Although the cold armor couldn't bring her any warmth, he hoped she would feel better from his embrace.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Chaoen who was still smiling along with the old father who reappeared on the screen – Lin Minjie.</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 005 was a pawn and Lin Lin's presence there wasn't an accident but a necessity."</br>
</br>
"Didn't you find it odd? Why would a fallout shelter used to develop advanced artificial intelligence have a copy of ? And so many people knew it was inside the fallout shelter."</br>
</br>
"It wasn't there to be the hope of mankind but rather a piece of bait to lure naïve survivors to run inside and become subjects for the experiment."</br>
</br>
"If things had gone according to plan, the Dusk organization would've sent people inside the fallout shelter to become fresh subjects for our experiment. But unfortunately, our project had flaws from the beginning. The bug from 'the Harmony' infiltrated the fallout shelter and then you. If I guessed correctly, you should be the person who destroyed x71291. What a stubborn individual - that product saved thousands of lives." Lin Minjie shook his head and cursed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen silently listened to Doctor Lin Minjie's readme file with a perplexed expression.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saved Lin Lin from Fallout Shelter 005 after she realized her father left her to leave the planet, Jiang Chen said this to her: "Perhaps, from another perspective, he left hope on this planet."</br>
</br>
But now, maybe what he said was wrong.</br>
</br>
From before the war, everyone was his pawn on the path to reaching the Supreme.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen hadn't forcefully flipped over the chessboard, perhaps he would've already succeeded.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's whimpering voice interrupted Jiang Chen's train of thought. Her eyes were filled with tears and she looked at her father with certainty.</br>
</br>
"But… I will still use my knowledge to bring hope for our people."</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie stared at his daughter for a while before he started to smile. "Is that so? I'm happy you have dreams, my dear daughter… I genuinely hope you can achieve your dream."</br>
</br>
He paused and looked at Jiang Chen. "Jiang Chen, right? I already know your stance of being a human. Regarding your victory, I graciously accept it, but I won't congratulate you."</br>
</br>
"I never had expectations of receiving congratulations from my enemy."</br>
</br>
"Also, I hope you won't discriminate against my daughter just because she's a digitalized human."</br>
</br>
"Please be assured that won't happen."</br>
</br>
What should be buried wasn't digitalized humans nor artificial intelligence... but dangerous thought. While Lin Lin had fundamental differences from real digitalized humans, her brain was still a brain.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked down and raised the rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin gently pulled at him.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to stop me?" Jiang Chen said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Can you not spare him?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's certainty was his response to her.</br>
</br>
This was the only circumstance where he couldn't show mercy.</br>
</br>
"Then… let me do it. I don't want ... don't want you to become the person who kills my father," Lin Lin spoke with a remorseful smile.</br>
</br>
She stood there with her father's brain in front of her and droplets of tears rolling down her face. She never was a strong person.</br>
</br>
At the end of the road, with his daughter in tears, Lin Minjie seemed to have understood something - the definition of emotion, the algorithm he tried to craft for advanced artificial intelligence had been always within his reach.</br>
</br>
But he couldn't see.</br>
</br>
Because on the path to the Supreme, he had given up too much.</br>
</br>
He watched his daughter kneeling on the ground, crying. He suddenly felt that this outcome wasn't too bad.</br>
</br>
"Inside this server, there is a document numbered 7381 with a 103-page essay about warp drives." Lin Minjie stared into Jiang Chen's eyes. "If you ever face them one day, it might be useful. This is her dowry from father to daughter; I hope you can treat her well because of this gift."</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Although without this gift, he would still treat her well.</br>
</br>
"You don't need to thank me. Because even if you really create the warp drive, your odds of winning only increase from 0% to 1%." Lin Minjie scoffed.</br>
</br>
Communication was tuned into Jiang Chen's communication channel; he didn't make Lin Lin hear his final monologue.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to say something. He took a deep breath to calm himself in a desperate attempt to hide the weakness in his heart.</br>
</br>
"Why didn't you tell her?"</br>
</br>
"In the end, I wanted to experience what it felt like to be a father." He ended with a sentence that had more meaning than met the eye.</br>
</br>
In that instant, Jiang Chen had the impulse to stop everything. He wasn't a coldblooded man and was never indifferent to cruelty. Since Lin Minjie already lost, he didn't need to put the final nail in the coffin. Since he was the father of Lin Lin, even just for… for Lin Lin, maybe he could let his brain survive.</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie seemed to have read Jiang Chen's thoughts as he laughed and spoke in the communication channel: "It doesn't feel good to live with just a brain. The only reason I could live till now was to wait for the day I could abandon this brain too. Won't you allow that day to come?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
"The places I didn't take her to - I hope you can do that for me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. "I promise."</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie smiled at Jiang Chen. A sudden trace of remorse appeared in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by certainty.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he looked at Lin Chaoen who had been smiling the whole time.</br>
</br>
"My son, I'll give you the last order. No, two last orders…"</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen nodded.</br>
</br>
"First, turn off the life-supporting device of my brain."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen's brain was buried low.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin raised her face covered in tears as she looked at her father. Her lips trembled and she whimpered "no" repeatedly.</br>
</br>
Lin Minjie looked at his daughter one last time and slowly closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Second, end your life."</br>
</br>
"Understood, father."</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, Lin Chaoen walked to the side of the central computer.</br>
</br>
"No—" Lin Lin screamed out.</br>
</br>
The cry echoed in the empty fallout shelter. Jiang Chen tried not to look at Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen noticed that before he pressed the button, Lin Chaoen's hand hovered over the switch for two seconds.</br>
</br>
In the end, he still pressed it.</br>
</br>
The bubbles in the vial gradually stopped and the green nutrient levels calmed down.</br>
</br>
If blood and oxygen supplies are cut off, brain cells will stop functioning within 60 seconds. Within four minutes, brain cells will start to die. In 6-10 minutes, the brain will suffer irreparable damage with a large amount of brain cell death.</br>
</br>
Watching that vial, tears rolled down on Lin Lin's mask.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a deep breath and counted in his mind.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen turned around and looked thoughtfully at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"That's weird. For an instant, I had a thought to reject the order."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said quietly, "Congratulations."</br>
</br>
"No, you don't have to congratulate me since I didn't receive a mission to evolve into advanced artificial intelligence." A sudden smile appeared on Lin Chaoen's face. "Goodbye."</br>
</br>

</br>
The arm is not powerful enough? Switch to a mechanical arm. Giving birth is too slow? Raise it in a nutrient chamber. Reaching consensus is impossible in a meeting? Connect everyone's thoughts together. The brain could explode? Use a chip to replace the brain.</br>
</br>
When every part of the human could be replaced, the only thing that can represent the human was its consciousness. And when consciousness could be replicated and mass produced, only efficiency would remain in the world, and the purpose of efficiency would be survival.</br>
</br>
And the purpose of survival is what then?</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen chose to self-destruct along with 71 backup bodies in the hibernation chambers.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he realized something in the end. When he made a choice, he was very calm; without any longing for this world.</br>
</br>
To his choice, Jiang Chen could only lower his gun and didn't ask him to stay.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen surrounded the crying Lin Lin in his arms. He didn't know how to comfort her as he whispered something in her ear before carrying her and leaving the now silent fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instructed the First Division soldiers to take away the quantum computer and other equipment from the fallout shelter. As to the eighty hibernation chambers and the vial, after asking for Lin Lin's opinion, he left them underground.</br>
</br>
Because Doctor Lin Minjie passed away, the fallout shelter lost its sole controller, and its functionality came to a halt. The door of the fallout shelter could no longer be closed. To prevent people disturbing his long rest, Jiang Chen gifted the last grace.</br>
</br>
Five hundred kilograms of explosives collapsed the entire tunnel and buried the fallout shelter 3000 meters underground.</br>
</br>
Although the civilization was never born, it was still the grave of a civilization. It deserved the last tribute.</br>
</br>
It was supreme but was never meant to be accepted by the majority.</br>
</br>
He was a great scientist. This was without a doubt.</br>
</br>
Inside the Lin Fallout Shelter, the NAC obtained an experimental level quantum computer which made the scientists in Fallout Shelter 027 ecstatic. The crowded quantum computer was finally freed from working over capacity which brought a significant bottleneck to NAC's research efficiency.</br>
</br>
The research paper on wrap paper was given to Jiang Lin as he had been keen on this area of research. If the one hundred page paper could bring him some inspiration, then it would be a great contribution to the entire NAC… no, to the entire earth's mankind.</br>
</br>
If the Natural Selection will arrive on Earth, then humans with wrap engine would have a fighting chance. If they can't win, they could still escape.</br>
</br>
Of course, if possible, Jiang Chen still hoped he could solve the problem.</br>
</br>
Regardless, the modern world is his home.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Northwest of Shenxiang, at the intersection of Taifu River and Dianshan Lake.</br>
</br>
</br>
In a place one kilometer away from the lake, ten trucks parked on the cracked rural roads. Slaves hauled beams of steel to the barren land under the direction of the engineer with a blueprint; they inserted the steel beam into the corresponding location.</br>
</br>
The steels formed into a circle several kilometers in diameter with excavators working inside the circular area from the middle. They moved the chunks of soil onto the truck to the empty ground two kilometers out.</br>
</br>
The middle of the circle was paved with concrete. A concrete circular pole stood in the middle with a diameter of five meters. The pole connected to the steel beams like a wheel bearing extended to the edge. At the same time, the bottom of the pole was installed with water outlets and a drainage pipe with graphite filter membrane. The edge of the bearing connected the water treatment plant's pipe.</br>
</br>
It was like a giant grinding disc.</br>
</br>
The soil moved by truck were all dumped there and mixed with fresh water transported from the automated water treatment plant a few kilometers out.</br>
</br>
Just yesterday, the Hunter Division cleared out the Bug Vehicle nest in the water treatment plant and brought the plant under NAC control. Although the nuclear fusion battery stored inside could sustain water treatment for two years, it was still a problem to desert the water treatment plant. The construction of the Garden of Eden required a large amount of fresh water, and the fresh water will be supplied by newly built pipelines.</br>
</br>
Soil, water, and treatment liquid will be mixed together under the "grinding disc" into mud, the continuous water will wash the toxins and radiation residue to the Dianshan river. The washing method to dilute and cleanse soil had a capacity of 1000 cubic meters of soil a day.</br>
</br>
Soil cleansing was the first step in constructing the Garden of Eden.</br>
</br>
Although he could transport soils from the modern world, it would require an astronomical amount of soil to construct a Garden of Eden with a diameter of five kilometers. With Xin's territory, it was not easy to obtain that amount of soil. Even if the soil were imported, it would still be difficult to explain the whereabouts of the soil.</br>
</br>
If it could be solved in the apocalypse, it was better to rely on the resources available in the apocalypse. Since the NAC already had acquired the absolute control of Wanghai, regardless of how reckless they were with the construction, it was achievable with NAC's financial capability and influence.</br>
</br>
This soil cleansing system was only the first one. Jiang Chen planned to construct ten more beside Dianshan Lake.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked at the spinning disc as she gently put on her chest and recollected what Jiang Chen told her when she was in despair.</br>
</br>
"Construct a Garden of Eden for me beside Shenxiang. The soil there is not too bad. By growing mutated fruit and Carm tree sap there, the radiation and pollution in the area decreased by a lot. Although the toxicity level is still high, it'll be easier to change there.</br>
</br>
He paused.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps many years later, that place will become a place where flowers bloom, and birds sing."</br>
</br>
[Perhaps even more beautiful than before the war.]</br>
</br>
Lin Lin had a pleasant smile on her face and added in her mind.</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, the remorse in her chest faded.</br>
</br>
The war was finally over.</br>
</br>
The mutant nests in the city center turned into ash with the strike of the tungsten rod. The smaller nests in the rural areas were in the process of being cleared out. NAC would send out a team of no less than 500 "scavengers" with flamethrowers, heavy machineguns, and the support of armored vehicles to clear out the remaining nests in underground sewer systems and buildings.</br>
</br>
The entire west city center of Wanghai turned from the most dangerous hunting place around on wasteland to a haven in the Suhang province.</br>
</br>
And this Garden of Eden will become the most beautiful place in the Suhang province. Even the most beautiful place on the wasteland in the future.</br>
</br>
"In three months, the Garden of Eden will finish soil cleansing. At the same time, the foundation near the lake will be completed. A month after that, the atmosphere separation membrane will be deployed, and the first phase of the Garden of Eden will be completed." Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen who just walked beside her and had a proud smile on her face.</br>
</br>
"Four months? Then the cannons, port, and defensive buildings along the river should be completed too." Jiang Chen stared into the distance and smiled too.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin rolled her eyes. "Could you not say something that ruins the mood?"</br>
</br>
"To protect the beautiful flower, guns and cannons are necessary." Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
He then paused and looked toward Lin Lin. "But just leave these kinds of unromantic thing to the unromantic me."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin blushed and looked away.</br>
</br>
"… Whatever you want to do."</br>
</br>
Once the first Garden of Eden is complete, the food production in the apocalypse could be self-sufficient. At least grain, wheat, and some crops could be directly grown there. The cost might be higher, it was a good start.</br>
</br>
Then the second one.</br>
</br>
The new biosphere will begin to emerge on the wasteland like a series of air bubbles. The space will first be used to produce food, and then residential areas will be developed…</br>
</br>
With the Sixth Street's increasing population, they can't constantly depend on Jiang Chen to be the "food transporter". Although in theory it was possible, it won't be stable in the long term.</br>
</br>
Self-sufficient in food is the first step to Order.</br>
</br>
And a must step for Order.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Lin Lin provided the construction blueprint for the Garden of Eden, and the construction specifics were the responsibilities of the NAC engineers. Jiang Chen formed a special department named "Garden of Eden Research Institute". Lin Lin had no experience in management, and she personally had no interest in managing people. The department was different from the independent Aerospace Technology Research Institute with the human resources department responsible for managing.</br>
</br>
Lu Huasheng was meticulous with his work which reassured Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
From the start, he was the chief engineer to the construction of the base, so it wouldn't be of worry to let him handle the construction project. Although the technology in the Garden of Eden was somewhat advanced, Lin Lin provided the blueprints for each step of the development. With NAC engineers' wealth of experience, it wouldn't be difficult to construct it.</br>
</br>
The Sun was disappearing on the horizon.</br>
</br>
After completing a tour, Jiang Chen took Lin Lin back to the mansion in the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
As usual, the delicious Yao Yao prepared a dinner equally as delicious as her. The usually adorable Sun Xiaorou studied on the side while helping Yao Yao out. As for Sun Jiao, she was in the kitchen "trying the food out".</br>
</br>
When he just stepped in, the aroma of the food drifted into his nose. Lin Lin who took off her shoes ran into the kitchen shouting and fighting with Sun Jiao for the position of "taste tester". Every time this happened, Sun Xiaorou would comfort the two, but a little devil smile would appear on her face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face would always have a joyful smile looking at the scene in the kitchen.</br>
</br>
If would be great if he could bring his family from the modern world back.</br>
</br>
In the cheerful atmosphere, Jiang Chen and the girls finished dinner. Jiang Chen watched Lin Lin with a pouted mouth head into the kitchen with the utensils as he rubbed his full belly and returned to his room.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the mutants, or Harmony, or Supreme, all of them ceased to exist. Jiang Chen finally had time to research the mutated storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lied on the bed and closed his eyes to immerse his consciousness into the packed small universe.</br>
</br>
The universe expanded exceptionally slowly, in a month's time, the radius only increased by a tiny amount.</br>
</br>
But even then, it was still a decent size. From the 300 cubic meters at the big bang, it stretched into 340 cubic meters. But Jiang Chen didn't understand the mechanism behind the small universe's expansion.</br>
</br>
Inside the pitch black space, Reptile drone and Python drones floated. Their power was almost drained and could be brought out from the storage dimension after a few more days.</br>
</br>
And right now, most of them were scattered around the boundary of the small universe. Jiang Chen still faintly recalled that when these things were first thrown in the storage dimension. They still maintained motion.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Would the motion be lost when it contacted the boundary of the universe?" Jiang Chen pondered with a hand on his chin.</br>
</br>
He was not a physicist and couldn't explain the phenomenon. Even Lin Lin with knowledge in Klein particle couldn't explain it. She roughly summarized it to "The original eleven-dimensional space decayed into three dimensional under the collapse and the big bang."</br>
</br>
According to the superstring theory in M- theory (1), the existence of eleven-dimensional super-gravitational attractions, Jiang Chen's previous storage dimension was similar to what was described in the theory, the dimension created through pure gravity.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen asked about the pros and cons, Lin Lin only gave an ambiguous answer.</br>
</br>
"It is hard to say if it is good or bad. The objective existence of nature has always been irrelevant of good or bad. You can interpret the previous dimension as playdoh that can be freely squished, but now it became a fixed spherical space. There are points, lines, time and all other eleven dimensions and below concepts. But you only foolishly use it as a handy treasure box. Since then, no matter what it becomes, it wouldn't matter to you." Lin Lin rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
But if it could become a bit bigger…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the deep abyss and entered into deep thought.</br>
</br>
Inside the small universe, he was the god of the place. Any of the items inside could be moved with his consciousness. Changing the location of the things inside was as simple as organizing a backpack.</br>
</br>
But the ability to give an object motion would consume the energy of the bracelet. Also, any item that came in contact with the boundary would lose its kinetic energy.</br>
</br>
Inside the entire small universe, only the boundary was out of his control.</br>
</br>
If the universe was bigger, big enough to put a planet inside.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was suddenly shocked by the idea before he shook his head with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
With the current expansion speed, even after his 17th life, it would still not be big enough to put a Wanghai inside.</br>
</br>
Maybe he should throw a few nukes inside and forcefully "expand" this space?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly negated the idea.</br>
</br>
Disregarding if he could gather so many nuclear bombs or blood crystals, and overlooking if Sun Xiaorou can explode the blood crystals, no one was certain if another collapse and big bang could happen in the storage dimension. Would the space dimension fall to the first dimension? If the entire space only stretched vertically, he would have played himself.</br>
</br>
There was also a possibility that the energy of the explosion couldn't meet the energy required for collapsing and the detonated blood crystals in the space would form a never attenuated light ball. In some sense, it would be the most painful situation. The instant he removed the light ball, he would be vaporized by the one million degrees of high temperature, but if he did not remove the light ball, the storage space would be useless.</br>
</br>
There must be a way to increase the size of the storage dimension…</br>
</br>
"But the way is still unknown?" Jiang Chen let out a sigh and moved the robots around a bit.</br>
</br>
But then, he suddenly felt a light motion on his body. Although his consciousness sank into the small universe, he could still feel his body in the real world.</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes, a blushed face appeared in sight.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao, is there something wrong?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao retracting her finger and rubbed her soft head.</br>
</br>
"Hmm, is Brother Jiang Chen going to go back to that side soon?" Yao Yao asked in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I still have things to take care of on that side." Jiang Chen sensed the softness in his palm and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Big Brother is working really hard," Yao Yao said in a worried voice.</br>
</br>
[Not so much working so hard, or rather, it is more relaxing.]</br>
</br>
With her concerned attitude, Jiang Chen felt a bit embarrassed.</br>
</br>
"Hmm, as a way to relax, do you need Yao Yao to give you a massage?" Yao Yao lowered her head, smiled timidly, and played with the corner of her dress.</br>
</br>
[Massage?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen remembered the intimate moment that happened when she massaged him, Jiang Chen uncontrollably gulped.</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that he should reject, but his body nodded with honesty.</br>
</br>
Sometimes he thought that he was too evil…</br>
</br>
(1) Superstring theory is an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings.</br>
</br>
'Superstring theory' is a shorthand for supersymmetric string theory because unlike bosonic string theory, it is the version of string theory that accounts for both fermions and bosons and incorporates supersymmetry to model gravity.</br>
</br>
Since the second superstring revolution, the five superstring theories are regarded as different limits of a single theory tentatively called M-theory.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
A small head with wet hair peeked out from the door of the bathroom. The big eyes covered with shyness scanned around. After confirming that no one was in the hall, Yao Yao was relieved. Her hands tightly squeezed onto the towel that covered her body and ran toward her room.</br>
</br>
Around five minutes later, Jiang Chen walked out from the bathroom feeling refreshed and energized.</br>
</br>
He didn't think it was a big deal to walk out together, but Yao Yao insisted leaving separately with a blushed face. When she remembered the look on everyone's face when they walked together, she wanted to bury her head into the ground.</br>
</br>
"This… really doesn't hide anything." Jiang Chen dried his hair with the towel around his shoulder while he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
[I'll go sleep now.]</br>
</br>
As he thought, Jiang Chen walked toward his own room.</br>
</br>
When he passed by Sun Jiao's room, the door was suddenly pushed open.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao with hair already dried only in a dress shirt was smiling at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Uh, is there something wrong?" Although she looked alluring, Jiang Chen without any bullets left was in "Saint Mode." If he accepted Sun Jiao's invitation, it wouldn't be good.</br>
</br>
Right now, Sun Xiaorou suddenly hugged him from the back.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law, why aren't you going in?" With a devil smirk on her face, Sun Xiaorou whispered playfully beside Jiang Chen's ear.</br>
</br>
[This little devil…]</br>
</br>
With the softness behind his back, Jiang Chen was pushed into the room by Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
He felt that if this continued, it would be the death of his body.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
"Is your body okay?" Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen feebly walking into the office as her eyebrows raised.</br>
</br>
"It's okay." Jiang Chen didn't look her in the face and sat on his throne.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked at him speechlessly and spoke after a while.</br>
</br>
"… regardless of which perspective, you should be more restrained sometimes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen who just sipped tea almost spat it out.</br>
</br>
If it were before, Jiang Chen who slept late would choose to sleep till noon and pass on the work for the next day. But the information from Jia City stated that there would be a visitor from Hang City. For his reputation, Jiang Chen had to climb out of bed.</br>
</br>
He sat in the office for less than an hour before someone knocked on the door. He fixed his collars and said "please come in" before a man in a blue suit that was somewhat bleached stepped in under a NAC knight's guidance.</br>
</br>
It was a familiar face. Jiang Chen remembered his name was Kong Qian. He led the first contact with Hang's Merchant Alliance.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Director." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. General." Kong Qian smiled back and added, "The uncrowned king of Wanghai."</br>
</br>
[The uncrowned king?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased with the title as the tip of his mouth carved up.</br>
</br>
He warmly welcomed Kong Qian to take a seat and instructed the staff at the community center to serve tea for them. Jiang Chen noticed the director's eyes stared at the tea floating in the cup and made a noticeable gulping gesture.</br>
</br>
</br>
Kong Qian took a sip as an intoxicated complexion appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Great tea. If I guessed correctly, it should be West Lake Longjing."</br>
</br>
"Director Kong knows tea too?" Jiang Chen was quite intrigued.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen never sold luxury goods like Longjing and Tieguanying (1) at the Sixth Street; the high-grade stuff was only available in the community center with Blue Mountain coffee and Sri Lanka black tea to improve the quality of life for his officials. If it was Jiang Chen himself, he drank them like water, and everything tasted pretty much the same.</br>
</br>
"I drank it before the war and studied tea a little," Kong Qian smiled, but a regretful expression appeared on his face, "Unfortunately, the West Lake no longer produces tea."</br>
</br>
The harsh natural environment, the ruthless bandits, the bloodthirsty mutants, and zombies. The tea's anti-radiation trait meant that it could grow on most soils. While the quality may not be comparable to before the war, the difficulty of growing this kind of delicacies was extremely high.</br>
</br>
"If Director Kong likes it, I can gift you two packs." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased that the Hang Merchant Alliance listened to his warning and didn't cause trouble when NAC was attacking the mutated humans. According to their agreement, his soldiers stopped at Jia city and didn't push west.</br>
</br>
"Thank you so much." Kong Qian was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
There was nothing else to demonstrate friendship than things that couldn't be bought.</br>
</br>
"No worries." Jiang Chen in a delighted mood continued, "But my guess is that the purpose of your trip is not to catch up with me and drink tea."</br>
</br>
"That's right," Kong Qian sat up straight and cautiously suggested, "I'm here to be certain about our friendship."</br>
</br>
"There is no need to doubt our friendship. One month ago, you already made the correct choice, one fitting for our friendship."</br>
</br>
Kong Qian was relieved.</br>
</br>
After a pause, he proposed with a cautious tone.</br>
</br>
"We are grateful for your party's effort in establishing a clear trade route. To reinforce our friendship, I have a proposal."</br>
</br>
"Let's hear it." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Based on our estimates, there are currently 1121 merchants utilizing the trade route to the Sixth Street. Now that the mutated humans in Jia City and the Seventh Area have been eliminated, the dangerous level of Wanghai decreased significantly. In the foreseeable future, the number will exponentially increase by next year. So we hope we could establish a division of the Merchant Guild at the Sixth Street."</br>
</br>
"Guild?" Jiang Chen looked at Kong Qian feeling intrigued, "Could the Sixth Street council not protect your rights?"</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, Mr. General, you're misunderstanding the situation." Kong Qian rushed to explain, "This guild is not political, it is only here to provide information support to merchants as well as trade fleet security contracts…"</br>
</br>
"The mercenary guild can provide the last item."</br>
</br>
Without other solutions, Kong Qian had to compromise, "We can take out the last item."</br>
</br>
"I obviously won't reject the proposal to establish the merchant guild, but an organization with a guild nature must be established under the supervision of the local government."</br>
</br>
"I want to know the definition of supervision. Do they have to wear NAC uniforms during work?" Kong Qian asked carefully.</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen shook his head. "We'll send out an inspector to be stationed in the guild. We will pay the salary. Other than attending public meetings, he will not interfere with your day-to-day work. Or, as long as you do things that a merchant should do, he won't cause any disturbances to your daily work.</br>
</br>
"Just that?" Kong Qian was skeptical.</br>
</br>
"Just that." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and continued.</br>
</br>
"Relatively, we want to establish a similar partnership with your party. For example, establish a division of the mercenary guild in your jurisdiction. Don't be anxious, other than providing employees, we won't send any military units to be stationed there as we have full confidence that you can protect their lives and assets. We'll provide you with mercenary information, the channels for mercenary hiring as well as credit ratings."</br>
</br>
"On the other hand, if you're interested, we can open up a branch of the Sixth Street Bank in your area. Crystals are currently depreciating at a rapid speed in the Sixth Street. With the trade route being more open than ever, the depreciation would spread to other areas in no time. The Sixth Street trade has mostly eliminated crystals for its trade which would further accelerate the depreciation of crystals. Of course, if you are not confident with the purchasing power of the credit, we won't have to talk about this."</br>
</br>
Kong Qian hastened to say, "No, we are very interested, it's just that we heard the digital channel of the credit could only be done in Wanghai—"</br>
</br>
"It is currently only available in Wanghai. But if we expand our relay station to Hang City, then you will be included in our established network and the area for this payment channel will expand westward by two hundred kilometers." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Kong Qian held his breath.</br>
</br>
Establishing a mercenary guild division and a branch of the Sixth Street Bank, build a relay station, and join the information network of Wanghai. Jiang Chen's offer made it impossible for Kong Qian to refuse.</br>
</br>
The risk that existed in this was also difficult to neglect.</br>
</br>
While NAC promised not to send forces into Hang City, and Jiang Chen did prove his creditability with his action and NAC's noninvasive nature. But anyone would feel instinctively uneasy beside such a powerful neighbor.</br>
</br>
Once the proposal is agreed upon, NAC's influence would without a doubt expand to Hang City. If the influence were setting up for the inevitable invasion, then it would be fearful. But if it only existed to increase trade relationship, then it would only be beneficial.</br>
</br>
"Your proposal is enticing, but it also makes people uneasy," Kong Qian sighed and spoke with honesty.</br>
</br>
"With the current situation of the wasteland, how much people could fit in Wanghai and Jia City?" Jiang Chen asked abruptly.</br>
</br>
Kong Qian thought for a moment, "Around a few million."</br>
</br>
"Then did your military force pose a threat to us?"</br>
</br>
Kong Qian had a wry smile on his face.</br>
</br>
Their people had witnessed NAC's "financial power" the rockets that covered the sky. Despite the lack of technical expertise in that, it was not something that they could do with their production capability.</br>
</br>
"Then why are you afraid." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Kong Qian took a moment to process this before he understood Jiang Chen's message as a troubled but understanding smile appeared.</br>
</br>
The entire Suhang Province had less than one million people, and they didn't need to fight for space to survive. NAC had enough on their plate to develop Wanghai alone. From the power perspective, they didn't pose any threat to NAC.</br>
</br>
There was no need to invade.</br>
</br>
Once credit becomes common, Suhang Province's survivors must depend on NAC's economy.</br>
</br>
"This is a flabbergasting reality. The reason we can survive is that we look harmless." Kong Qian stood up. "I'll send your message to the Merchant Alliance. Of course, I don't think it will hard to pass."</br>
</br>
"Then I'll wish the best for our potential partnership." Jiang Chen also stood up and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"Pleasure to work with you." Kong Qian shook Jiang Chen hand and nodded.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"How many days has it been?" On the roof of the Dark Red Chamber of Commerce building, Cao Guangkai in a suit gazed in Wanghai's direction without many words.</br>
</br>
"The sixth day," The guard beside him said respectfully.</br>
</br>
[The sixth day already?]</br>
</br>
Dawn colored the thin fog into a golden glow. Even in Su City ten kilometers away, he could still smell the fragrance known as order and freedom. It had been clear in that direction, without any smoke, for the sixth day.</br>
</br>
Moments later, Cao Guangkai slowly said.</br>
</br>
"That man, when did he leave?"</br>
</br>
The man he referred to was Lin Chaoen.</br>
</br>
The man who referred to himself as the apostle of Supreme civilization.</br>
</br>
The guard hesitated for a moment and answered with an uncertain voice, "Around two months."</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai nodded.</br>
</br>
"He shouldn't be back then."</br>
</br>
Based on their agreement, if he didn't come back in two months, that meant their agreement was over.</br>
</br>
"Even God could not stop their rise to power?" Cao Guangkai looked to the direction of the Fishbone and raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Not long ago, the Dark Red's division in Hang City brought information that the Merchant Alliance formed a partnership with the NAC in the areas of banking, merchant guild, and mercenary guild. Although NAC soldiers didn't step into Hang City, NAC already exported its influence into Hang.</br>
</br>
The core of a merchant is currency. What's a better way to control merchants than controlling the currency?</br>
</br>
Cao Gunagkai lowered his head.</br>
</br>
He needed to reconsider the future of Dark Red seriously.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street looked prosperous.</br>
</br>
The crystal detector common among the streets of the Sixth Street suddenly disappeared without a trace and was replaced by EP transfer or bill payment. The Sixth Street also injected enough currency into the market in the form of a loan, and the council also signed on the proposal to reduce the tax on credit transactions to promote the use of "credit" in trades.</br>
</br>
At first, people were skeptical about the currency. But with the passage of time, the exchange between credit and crystal began to appreciate. The initial 1:2 rose to what was 1:4 now. If it was not for NAC's strict control on credit circulating in the market, people were desperate to smash their slowly depreciating crystals onto the counter of the bank.</br>
</br>
Because of NAC's control of credit circulation, it resulted in the strong purchasing power of the credit. Continually printing currency would only turn the currency into useless papers. Right now, on the black market, the exchange rate between crystals to credit climbed to an astounding 1:6.</br>
</br>
On the other side, the establishment of the merchant guild provided merchant transaction access to Suhang Province and to even further places with information security. It also brought orders to the Sixth Street factories from beyond Wanghai's territory.</br>
</br>
</br>
The mercenary guild established a division in Hang City and gave the hunters that lost Wanghai as a "hunting ground" a new profession. They either became mercenaries or guards of merchant fleets in expanding the trade route from Hang City.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was walking along the street in the Inner Circle with the company of Chu Nan and the NAC soldiers, touring the ever-changing city.</br>
</br>
"There are a total of 174 mutant nests destroyed, and that accounts for 89% of the progress in capturing the west city center. The remaining 21 nests, because of higher risk ratings, no mercenary organization is willing to take on the mission alone."</br>
</br>
"Then leave it to the NAC soldiers," Jiang Chen was quite intrigued by the prosperous city as he said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"On the other hand, the slave owners from Su City expressed their dissatisfaction with us. Because of the depreciation of crystals, it shrunk their assets by four times."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"And their opinion is?"</br>
</br>
"They want to trade for credit with us at a ratio of 1:2." Chu Nan chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Reject them. Make him speak with the factories in the Sixth Street," Jiang Chen scoffed and said out of annoyance.</br>
</br>
Only Sixth Street factories needed crystals now. Although in principle the bank would provide channels for the factories to purchase crystals with credit, the Sixth Street official promoted purchasing crystals from private owners. And the fact was credit could purchase more crystals at the same price.</br>
</br>
"They won't accept the exchange ratio of 1:6. Their ambassador should be raging at the council and Zhao Chenwu. Do you need to see them?"</br>
</br>
"No. Our people will conduct a military exercise in the no man zone between Wanghai and Su City, the "Fireball-1" will be part of the exercise. Give them a ticket to the VIP seats," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan smiled and replied courteously.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
After they watch the lavish fireworks, anyone who was still discontent would reevaluate their abilities.</br>
</br>
The street was filled with the delicious smell of food. The entire food street was full of different selections. Even though it was just food being sold, this place was the place that made the most money in the Inner Circle other than the casino. Other than typical restaurants, Jiang Chen saw a noodle shop operated by robots and a BBQ shop operated by outsiders. With the steady increase of NAC's food supply, the selection of food at the Sixth Street had much more varieties.</br>
</br>
It was a scene that never could be seen a year ago.</br>
</br>
Soilless farming of pre-war crops, cloning technology to grow non-mutated livestock, even the wealthy could only eat the original luxury goods a few times a year back then. Today, even the ordinary citizens of the Sixth Street, as long as they worked hard, could come into the Inner Circle for a lavish experience.</br>
</br>
At the end of the street was a colorful street.</br>
</br>
But from the arousing signs and intimate colors, it didn't look like a place of decency.</br>
</br>
In the Sixth Street, brothels and casinos could operate legally. Even a council member in the Sixth Street, under the direction of Jiang Chen, ran the largest "entertainment complex" in the Inner Circle. Since most of the survivors that lived here were all once violent bandits that lived on the edge, to these people, only exciting things could give them the feeling of being alive.</br>
</br>
Of course, forced sex trade was strictly prohibited. The Sixth Street didn't prohibit slave trades, but any slave can enter into the jurisdiction of the Sixth Street, the slave trade was not taxed nor protected by the soldiers.</br>
</br>
In the other hand, anyone who stepped into the Sixth Street by default was considered free. Their personal freedom was protected under the constitution.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to go take a look inside? I will keep this a secret." Chu Nan jokingly smiled and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I will pass." Jiang Chen looked away at the girl who was winking at him.</br>
</br>
He couldn't even feed the girls back at home, and he didn't have too much interest in these ordinary girls.</br>
</br>
When the group passed by the red light district, they ended the day's travel plan ahead of schedule. Jiang Chen planned to head to the council building and audit the council work for this quarter, and announce the recruitment and military plan for the next quarter.</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen met with eight local merchants he invited to discuss partnership opportunities.</br>
</br>
After taking a turn, the roadblock on the main street drew Jiang Chen's attention. A few construction vehicles passed through the smooth concrete road and used drillers to leave equally spaced holes in the road. The construction workers in the back surrounded the holes to insert black cylindrical poles.</br>
</br>
"What is that?" Jiang Chen looked at the blocked road.</br>
</br>
"They are paving maglev track, a Hang merchant invested in the project. In exchange, we provided them with two years of exclusive sales rights to maglev vehicles as well as four years of tax-free sales." Chu Nan explained, "Once the maglev track is complete, maglev cars could pass through."</br>
</br>
The maglev track buried under the road had low resistance against explosions, so most of the tracks were demagnetized during the war. Now that the Sixth Street returned to stability with the economy skyrocketing and average personal income steadily rising, the cunning merchants obviously began searching for opportunities.</br>
</br>
[Maglev vehicles?]</br>
</br>
[Finally, a feeling of the future.]</br>
</br>
With the construction vehicles moving forward, a genuine smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
The seed of civilization has been planted.</br>
</br>
He was delighted to see that it has sprouted.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 495: Mutant Pasture</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The group quickly returned to the council building.</br>
</br>
With Chu Nan's guidance, Jiang Chen came into the meeting room and sat at the head of the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, Chu Nan, Zhao Gang, the ten council members, and fifteen industry representatives attended the meeting.</br>
</br>
The meeting first started off with Chu Nan reporting the current work progress of the Sixth Street, and then Zhao Gang reported on the security of the city and the training progress of the Third Division. Following, Zhao Chenwu as the council representative summarized legislations that were passed in the last quarter and stats on Sixth Street's population, production, and economy.</br>
</br>
Reporting work was only a formality. The content was all handed to NAC logistics with the logistics head Wang Qin organizing the data into visuals and delivering them to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Although the dry content made Jiang Chen sleepy, he still pretended to be engaged. Since as the leader of the "country", his attitude and authority was associated with the stability of the government system.</br>
</br>
After the "formal" reporting ended, Jiang Chen coughed and picked up the hologram computer pen on the table and propped up the hologram screen. With the eyes in the room focused on him, he read the recruitment and military plan for the next quarter.</br>
</br>
The focus of next quarter was on building the economy. Now that the internal and external threats were all removed, NAC won a period of a stable growth to consolidate their victory in Wanghai and Jia City.</br>
</br>
The 2,000 recruitment target and the security tax remained unchanged.</br>
</br>
The council members and industry representatives looked relieved when they heard the two keywords. When the decisions to increase the number of military contracts and the firearm reserves were announced, the military industry representative was delighted by the news. With the situation around Wanghai stabilizing, it may be good news for the other industries, but it was negative news for the military industry.</br>
</br>
They were already satisfied that NAC didn't decrease their order, but not only did they retained all existing orders, but they also increased their military spending which provided a positive boost to the military industry at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The reason why Jiang Chen introduced this decision was to make sure the military companies stayed alive and to adjust the Fishbone base's production.</br>
</br>
In the future, the military plant at the Fishbone base would gradually transition to focus on more advanced technology. For example, the combustion rockets used by "Fireball-1", other than the key module and boosters, other parts would be outsourced to the Sixth Street military factory to produce. Not only would it increase the production of the rockets, but it could also decrease production cost which mutually benefited both parties.</br>
</br>
The meeting took two hours before it was finally over. Everyone left the room with a smile on their face. At this meeting, they all more or less got what they wanted to gain.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to rest a bit?" Chu Nan looked at Jiang Chen drinking tea and asked.</br>
</br>
"No need, I prefer to take care of everything all at once."</br>
</br>
The quarterly meeting ended, and there was still a meeting with merchants to discuss their partnership with NAC. It was something that could be done by Wang Qin, but since Jiang Chen was at the Sixth Street, he decided to take care of it.</br>
</br>
'Then I'll arrange it. They are already in the waiting room," Chu Nan said courteously and left the conference room.</br>
</br>
"Don't make them wait too long."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
A moment later, eight merchants followed Chu Nan into the conference room. They were mostly raw material suppliers in Wanghai with farms over 50 acreages in size. They were growing mutated fruits, tea, tobacco, and a recently introduced sweet pea that could not be directly ingested, but it could be used to produce sugar like sugar cane.</br>
</br>
Before they used to produce Carm tree sap, but because of the mass scale production at Shenxiang and due to the saturation of the Sixth Street's plastic and rubber supply, they decreased the production in that area and became the industrial raw suppliers for NAC.</br>
</br>
With the NAC food "production" ramping up, the demand of nutrient supply also took a big hit. With one of its ingredients mutated fruit decreasing in demand, the farm owners all suffered financially.</br>
</br>
Right now around the conference table, the eight merchants anxious exchanged eye contact with each other as they were uncertain about what Jiang Chen was going to say.</br>
</br>
"I believe all of you should know that I plan to discuss a partnership opportunity."</br>
</br>
"What kind of partnership?" A merchant stood up and questioned somewhat tensely.</br>
</br>
"No need to stand up, this is only a casual meeting, just sit." Jiang Chen signaled him to sit down and then tapped his own shoulder gently. A hologram image appeared on the conference table, "We are discussing an opportunity in livestock."</br>
</br>
"This is?" Looking at the image on the table, the merchants had a variety of expressions.</br>
</br>
Some were shocked, some were intrigued, and some were contempt…</br>
</br>
Without bothering with the expression on the merchants' faces, Jiang Chen looked at the creature on the hologram similar to a wild boar and introduced,</br>
</br>
"Long Haired Pig, an artificially created mutant designed by my research institute through genetic engineering."</br>
</br>
"Artificially created mutant?" The expressions on the merchants' faces were interesting.</br>
</br>
"The fur could be used to produce clothes, and meat is consumable. Most importantly, its brain could form crystals without the consequence of hostility." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, the merchants didn't look interested at all. Instead, they looked troubled.</br>
</br>
"Mutant as livestock? We attempted this before, but the higher amount of crystals contained in the mutants, the higher the food they ingested. And right now, crystals are not worth the money. If it is just about producing meat, the doubled-headed cows raised are more than enough."</br>
</br>
"What's the meat quality compared to the mutated cow," a merchant rushed to ask a more critical question.</br>
</br>
The Double-headed Cow's meat texture was terrible and tasted like chewing on sand. But to the typical people that could not afford fresh meat, the meat of the double-head cow was not a bad choice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waited for the merchants to bring up their questions and put up three fingers.</br>
</br>
"I will summarize your questions with three points."</br>
</br>
"First, the Long Haired Pig is easy to raise. The feed mostly consists of mutated fruits, as well as an appropriate amount of catalyst.</br>
</br>
"Second, there is no need to worry about crystal output. A three-month growth cycle with a single pig producing 70-80 crystals.</br>
</br>
"Third, although the meat quality is not comparable to the pre-war livestock raised by NAC, compared to the mutated cow, it is much better."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen said these four sentences, only fervor was left on the faces of the merchants.</br>
</br>
Could be fed with mutated fruits.</br>
</br>
To the farm owners on the brink of bankruptcy, the only thing they didn't lack was mutated fruits!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 496: No matter how difficult it is, we have to do it</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The construction of the mutant farm would be operated by the merchants themselves; the NAC would only be responsible for providing the piglets. The profit would be a three-seven split with NAC taking 30% in the form of a "patent fee."</br>
</br>
Some clever merchants wanted to purchase the piglets at a high cost and buy the patent from NAC, but Jiang Chen rejected the proposal with a smile. Turning profits was only part of it with the priority being that NAC had to control the level of crystals produced. And these piglets must only be strictly raised in NAC territories without leaving the city. If any evidence of a leak was been discovered, NAC would terminate the partnership and issue a hefty fine.</br>
</br>
After an agreement was reached, the eight merchants left the conference room with excitement. The partnership agreement Jiang Chen proposed without a doubt dragged them from the brinks of bankruptcy, so they had no reason to reject.</br>
</br>
And they were even more surprised that Jiang Chen was willing to share such a big piece of the pie with them. Because of NAC's power, they easily had the ability to build their own farm.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made the choice with careful consideration. With NAC's financial capabilities, they didn't need to bother with small profits. All in all, NAC printed the currency, so did he need to care about the profit of a few farms?</br>
</br>
Compared to being a millionaire in the slums, Jiang Chen would much rather be a king among the rich. Other than the food trade and advanced military market controlled by the NAC military government, he had plans to contract out all "non-core profit" to private companies. This was because regarding expansion to new markets, private individuals had more energy compared to officials. As to the reason, history certainly had many lessons.</br>
</br>
He finally took care of everything on Sixth Street. Jiang Chen said goodbye to Chu Nan and thanked him for the arrangements at Sixth Street before he boarded a helicopter to return to Fishbone base before Dusk.</br>
</br>
It was almost late October already and Ayesha's mission was almost done. On the other hand, the Rothschild family invited him to Europe to attend a car exhibition. Since Jiang Chen had a friendly relationship with Carmen, he obviously wouldn't decline this opportunity.</br>
</br>
The apocalypse was on the right track.</br>
</br>
Compared to dealing with threats in the far future, development plans had to shift toward the modern world now.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When the helicopter landed, Jiang Chen noticed through the window that Jiang Lin was waiting beside the helicopter pad.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came out, he immediately walked up.</br>
</br>
"What do you need?" Jiang Chen looked at him with surprise.</br>
</br>
"It's about that warp drive paper." Jiang Lin took a deep breath and said briskly.</br>
</br>
"Is there any progress?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"How is that possible?" Jiang Lin shook his head with a bitter smile. "After reading it through, it gave me and the research institute a lot of inspiration. Can I know who wrote the paper? If possible, please take me to see him."</br>
</br>
"That's not possible. The scientist who wrote the paper already boarded the colonization ship."</br>
</br>
Still digesting that fact, Jiang Lin let out a sigh. "Just as I thought."</br>
</br>
"Anything else?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes, it's about research priorities," Jiang Chen said with seriousness. "Although this research paper provided us with a new, clear research path, it's still extremely difficult to make the warp engine into a reality. In other words, it's almost impossible considering the current conditions…"</br>
</br>
"The priority is the same as other research projects - regardless how hard it is and even if it takes ten or twenty years." Jiang Chen stared into Jiang Lin's eyes. "This has to do with the life of a lot of people."</br>
</br>
Dazed by Jiang Chen's solemn tone, Jiang Lin held his breath.</br>
</br>
Moments later, his voice trembled.</br>
</br>
"Who?"</br>
</br>
"A lot of people." Jiang Chen didn't tell him who but only gave him this ambiguous answer before leaving.</br>
</br>
To be honest, with his current abilities, if the modern world was matched up against the Harmony, he would have no odds of winning at all. With the Sailor Bug that could interstellar travel as well as the weapons in their possession, he couldn't think of any way they could win.</br>
</br>
But if this side could design the theoretically-possible warp drive that could achieve the speed of light, then his odds of winning would increase.</br>
</br>
Although the danger could be foreseen, Jiang Chen still had some time left. The distance of 20.5 light years meant it would take Natural Selection a hundred years to reach Earth.</br>
</br>
But even then, their time was still limited. Although it was superficial to value a civilization's power with history in time, they were still monsters who traveled thousands of years in time.</br>
</br>
And a monster with invasion written in its genetic code.</br>
</br>
It was strictly impossible to tell the world that "aliens" were on a path to invasion. Disregarding the possibility of current technology observing Natural Selection light years away, even if he did convince people in the modern world, it would just create unnecessary fear.</br>
</br>
How would he get the countries around the world on board? How could he make the Earth civilizations possess the power to fight Natural Selection? There were still many problems that Jiang Chen had to solve.</br>
</br>
Development had to be done step by step, but the steps had to be accelerated.</br>
</br>
When he returned to the mansion, after having dinner with the girls, he went into the bedroom with Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had already told them his date of returning to the modern world. After his return from the Sixth Street, he took care of everything he needed to.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao remembered he was leaving, so she was particularly passionate during their night of intimacy as if she wanted to stuff Jiang Chen into her body and fuse their bodies into one…</br>
</br>
It was a long night.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen stood by the bed and stared at the audacious but beautiful face.</br>
</br>
Without any parting words, he kissed her on the cheek.</br>
</br>
Gently covering her body with the covers, he returned to his own bedroom and disappeared from the mansion.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes again, the scenery was different and the world was colored with vibrancy.</br>
</br>
Staring at the elegant chandelier on the ceiling, Jiang Chen laid on the bed for a while before he switched his thought process from the apocalypse to the modern world.</br>
</br>
The first thing he did was check his phone. Without Ayesha being a communicator, it was hard for him to receive messages from the modern world. But as soon as he opened his phone, hundreds of missed calls filled his screen.</br>
</br>
And the missed calls belonged to the same name.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed his screen a few times and immediately called her back.</br>
</br>
The phone only rang for a second before it went through. He couldn't even open his mouth before he heard an anxious voice.</br>
</br>
"Where are you now? Hello? Are you okay on that side?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen listened to her concerned questions as he was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"I… I'm okay. Uhh, I'm in Xin of course."</br>
</br>
After confirming Jiang Chen's safety, Xia Shiyu sounded relieved. But when she realized Jiang Chen was okay and she worried over nothing for one week, her voice carried a hint of blame.</br>
</br>
"As the president, it's better for you to not suddenly disappear. You're in Xin. If you disappeared, I wouldn't even know which phone number to tell the police."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, don't worry, nothing will happen. But because of my job demands, I have to occasionally go to an area without signal. A random island in the ocean." Jiang Chen made up a story.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a deep breath and didn't completely believe Jiang Chen's explanation, but she still accepted it.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about this and get to business."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'm listening." Jiang Chen held the phone with one hand while he used the other to change into a new pair of pants.</br>
</br>
"The company recently received a lot of invitations. Aside from private functions, there are some official invites."</br>
</br>
"For example?" he asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"The Xiangjiang Government as well as Han's invitation."</br>
</br>
[Finally here?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
[With era-defining technology, someone finally felt pained.</br>

</br>
"Arrange a time. Try to set the schedule around mid-November. By then, hmm… I'll visit Hua with the Xin president as a member of the outstanding businessmen.</br>
</br>
As for the Xin president visiting Hua, he just said it nonchalantly. If he told Zhang Yapin, he would immediately prepare for a friendly visit. With the currently friendly relationship between Hua and Xin, the always-nice Hua had no reason to reject, especially if the outcome of a visit would be mutually beneficial to both parties.</br>
</br>
"Does Xin have this arrangement?" Xia Shiyu asked with skepticism.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Because I'm an outstanding businessman, I received some information beforehand." Jiang Chen made up a random excuse.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll reply." Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
"Is there anything else?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. I have two pieces of good news. Which one do you want to hear first?" Xia Shiyu giggled.</br>
</br>
"Two pieces of good news? Of course I want to listen to the better news last." Jiang Chen was intrigued.</br>
</br>
Even Xia Shiyu, who didn't like to laugh, was joking - the good news must be fantastic.</br>
</br>
"It's about the virtual reality experience store - all 1.44 million virtual reality helmets have entered the market. The players were highly attracted by the virtual reality experience project and created a net profit of 500 million USD. Almost all our partner internet cafés requested additional Phantoms."</br>
</br>
With the unit price at 1500 USD and sales of 1.44 million, a profit of 1000 USD was equivalent to 1.44 billion in profit. And the virtual reality experience project created a profit of 500 million in just one month's time.</br>
</br>
Of course, the reason they could make so much money was because of the magical experience offered by the helmet and people's curiosity. Even now, a lot of people still waited in line to experience the virtual reality helmet. But after some time, once the Phantom was officially released, the virtual reality experience hype would gradually cool off.</br>
</br>
And the majority of Future Technology's revenue wouldn't be from the one-time gain of selling the helmet nor from the virtual reality experience project but the actual operations of virtual reality…</br>
</br>
"What's the second piece of good news?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"You don't sound shocked?"</br>
</br>
"I can imagine how crazy people can get for immersive virtual reality technology."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu smiled as she listened to Jiang Chen's confidence and continued.</br>
</br>
"The second good news is that the 2 million Phantom helmets we released for pre-order have all been sold out with a net profit of 1 billion USD. All the pre-ordered helmets were sold out within one minute. A lot of users left comments on our forum hoping we could increase the number of units available for preorder."</br>
</br>
"Sold out in one minute? It looks like the market is hungry enough." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Everything is just waiting for the final push. How's the production rate of the helmet?" Xia Shiyu asked.</br>
</br>
"20 million units of Phantom helmets should've been completed; I'll add a few more finished production lines in a bit and the goal to produce 20 million helmets will be exceeded," Jiang Chen said proudly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was obviously very assured with Xia Shiyu handling the operations and marketing. He only asked a few things about the operation of the company before hanging up.</br>
</br>
He stuffed his phone into his pocket before leaving his bedroom to go to the garage.</br>
</br>
It was October 20th and the 80 days of training were completed. Based on the agreement between Jiang Chen and Ayesha, he would personally pick her up once training ended.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen missed her quite dearly after so long.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The vessel that carried supplies to the island didn't bring any supplies this time. Its mission was to bring back the trainees on the island.</br>
</br>
Right now, the 110 agents were standing on the beach waiting for their last examination. Watching the outline of the vessel on the horizon, everyone had genuine excitement on their faces.</br>
</br>
The training was finally over and the rookie agents managed to make it out alive. Because of this, they completed the transformation from a rookie to a qualified agent and warrior.</br>
</br>
Ayesha not only taught them how to disguise themselves and collect information, but she also taught them everything she knew about combat including sniping, calling airstrikes and even individual combat, which were all part of their daily training requirements. The virtual training and live ammunition training were conducted simultaneously to engrave this information deep down into their bones like instincts.</br>
</br>
80 days ago, they were just a bunch of girls, but now, 110 fully trained agents stood there. With the assistance of carbon Nano bulletproof vests, genetic vaccines, Ghost Sniper Rifles, Type-11 Pistols, heat sensor grenades, digitalized contacts and injected chips, the combat abilities of any one of them could compare to a fully equipped, six-man special force team.</br>
</br>
Once Fallout Shelter 027 could produce optical camouflage and Gauss Rifles, their combat abilities could easily steamroll an entire squadron.</br>
</br>
When he arrived on the island, Jiang Chen resisted the urge to kiss Ayesha. He stood in front of the 110 agents in formation. In front of their reserved but determined eyes, he was pleased.</br>
</br>
He paused and spoke in a loud voice.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, you all passed the test. I see 110 agents and 110 warriors here. I'm happy."</br>
</br>
"In 80 days' time, I trust Ayesha already taught you what you need to know and what you should know." Jiang Chen smiled at Ayesha then looked back at the 110 agents. "I will only emphasize two words here: loyalty and bravery. I won't waste time on anything else."</br>
</br>
"Your work in the future will not be easier than your experience the past 80 days. Or rather, the difficult training you went through is nothing compared to what you will face in the future. Your work may be staying in Xin to conduct 'safe' counterintelligence work, or you could be sent all over the world to execute the most dangerous missions and even take on the elites from the CIB or KGB. But I promise you will be able to easily take them on. And as your boss, I will make all of you believe that your effort is well worth it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen signaled the row of soldiers by the side and they opened the ten briefcases filled with cash.</br>
</br>
Glancing at the green paper bills, even the strongest-willed agents held their breath. Each briefcase contained at least one million in cash and there were ten of them.</br>
</br>
On the entire beach, the only people who were unaffected by the scene was Jiang Chen, who didn't lack money, and Ayesha, who wasn't interested in money. Even the six female assistant trainers gulped at this sight.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased to see the expressions on the agents' faces.</br>
</br>
"The money is all yours. You can spend it however you want."</br>
</br>
"Everyone is rewarded with 100 thousand USD and 10 days of vacation. This is not your pay - it is just a small bonus to you for passing the training."</br>
</br>
"At the same time, I want you to know that you're serving the richest man on the planet. So I hope you won't be foolish enough to be bought by some paper bills. You won't be let down materially. But to match that, I want you to feel a sense of purpose and belonging.</br>
</br>
"Ghost Agents, this is your name."</br>
</br>
"I want all of you to be proud of this name. Our enemies will fear this name."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With the crisp applause, the ten-minute examination was over. When Zhu Yu walked toward the briefcases full of cash, Zhu Yu felt like this was all so surreal.</br>
</br>
The Celestial Trade employees responsible for distributing the cash gave back the agents' luggage so they could store their stacks of cash. Zhu Yu looked at her stuffed backpack then back at the door to the cabin. She felt an inexplicable feeling.</br>
</br>
The moment she boarded the plane to the island, she dreamed of living a lavish but exciting life like 007, but when she was forced to step onto the vessel to the training base, the reality destroyed her hopes for a "perfect life."</br>
</br>
But now with a bag full of cash and an opportunity to board the vessel back to civilized society, she felt empty.</br>
</br>
"What're you thinking about?" The blonde girl named Penny stopped beside her and put her hand on her friend's shoulder.</br>
</br>
"I don't know." Zhu Yu shook her head as her serene face was filled with confusion. "Although at the beginning, I felt pain and despair in my hellish days as I waited for the day I could leave… now that the day is finally here, I just feel empty inside."</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, you graduated," Penny said optimistically.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu looked at her friend, puzzled.</br>
</br>
Penny shrugged and replied, "When I was in university, our state mandated military training. At the end of the training, that's what our trainer told us."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" A relieved smile appeared on Zhu Yu's face.</br>
</br>
Penny laughed and smacked her friend's shoulder playfully. "Don't think too much. It's not good for a girl to be too shy. You can be melancholic when you're old, but now you should think about how you're going to spend the money."</br>
</br>
Penny patted her backpack with a grin.</br>
</br>
"You're right. I'll send some money to my family first or I'll just move my family here. Since I didn't say anything when I left, they must be worried," Zhu Yu said.</br>
</br>
"You eastern people are so problematic - my mom kicked me out when I was 18." Penny looked speechlessly at her friend.</br>
</br>
Aside from these two, the agents all chatted with the friends they made during training. They discussed how they would spend the money and where they would go for their ten-day vacation. The layout of the vessel was different than when they first came - the spacious cabin was filled with delicious food and champagne in a party atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Just like a graduation ceremony.</br>
</br>
Once all the agents boarded, Jiang Chen smiled at the female trainers standing dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"What are you guys waiting for? There's a share belonging to you too."</br>
</br>
As they snapped back to reality, the six trainers walked over in excitement while suppressing their ecstatic moods to accept the 100 thousand that belonged to them.</br>
</br>
After everyone boarded, Jiang Chen signaled the vessel to take everyone to New Moon Island. Once they were on New Moon Island, the Xin National Security Department would complete the paperwork for them, assign equipment, and arrange positions.</br>
</br>
</br>
The busy 80-day training period had ended and the small island finally returned to peace.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gazed at the girl he hadn't seen for a long time and she was gazing at him too. Her dark brown hair reflected an intoxicating brightness under the dusk sunlight. Her camouflage shirt outlined her gorgeous figure.</br>
</br>
Her blue pupils were the most irresistible; they seemed to be speaking - showing him her passion and gentleness.</br>
</br>
Without any words, Jiang Chen walked up to hug her. She gave a light shout when he pushed her onto the training ground sandpit.</br>
</br>
Ayesha felt the cold mixture of sand and seawater as well as the pressure on her chest. Ayesha timidly glanced at the podium she used to stand on when she conducted training and whispered:</br>
</br>
"No, not here."</br>
</br>
She watched the agents crawl through every day, but she didn't think she would fall here one day.</br>
</br>
"Don't you think this is exciting? The place where you trained them with authority." Jiang Chen bit Ayesha's ear with a smirk.</br>
</br>
With her face blushing and no one left on the island, Ayesha began to lose their willpower as she mumbled:</br>
</br>
"I'm not authoritative at all… and the vessel left, how are we going to go back…?"</br>
</br>
"I arranged a helicopter." Jiang Chen blew into her delicate ear. "It will be here tomorrow morning."</br>
</br>
"But it's too dirty here…" Ayesha anxiously looked at the mud on her shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I'll wash it off for you. There are bathrooms in the hotel on the island."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could no longer resist staring at her shirt damp with seawater along with her messy hair.</br>
</br>
Without giving any more opportunities for Ayesha to "resist," Jiang Chen kissed her.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, the helicopter arrived and stopped on the helipad on top of the hotel.</br>
</br>
When they boarded the helicopter, Ayesha looked and reminisced about the island disappearing in the distance. Jiang Chen, who noticed her gaze, gently squeezed her small hand and smiled. "Don't want to leave?"</br>
</br>
"I'm just feeling nostalgic." A smile appeared on Ayesha's lips. "Those children, although they were very resistant in the beginning, they gradually matured after a lot of things happened during training. They are now much more reliable compared to 80 days ago."</br>
</br>
[Children? A lot of them are older than you.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen focused on Ayesha's side profile as he mocked her only in his mind, not wishing to ruin the mood.</br>
</br>
"Will this place be deserted in the future?"</br>
</br>
"It will be the training base for future Ghost Agents, but the training will be done by current agents, your students." Jiang Chen rubbed her soft and puffy hair. "I don't want you to leave for too long."</br>
</br>
A stunning curvature appeared on her cold face as Ayesha rested her head on Jiang Chen's shoulder. She began to draw on Jiang Chen's leg with her finger.</br>
</br>
"What are you writing?" Jiang Chen hugged her thin shoulder.</br>
</br>
"A spell," Ayesha whispered.</br>
</br>
"Can I know what kind of spell? Miss Witch." Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"I will gift you my soul so I can stay with you through eternity… the spell from my hometown."</br>
</br>
At her heartfelt words, Jiang Chen leaned down and pecked her pale forehead.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, this is the most beautiful gift I've ever received."</br>
</br>
Ayesha timidly buried her face into Jiang Chen's shoulder and happily closed her eyes. Her longing for him had been fulfilled bit by bit.</br>
</br>
In the rays of the morning sun, the outline of the helicopter disappeared into the horizon.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 499: Modified Lamborghini</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the training of the Ghost Agents completed, the Xin national security department finally became a functional force. While training, Ayesha carefully documented each agent's talent and personality before providing a detailed summary. People with strong organizational abilities were promoted to a management role, people with strong intelligence were sent to counterintelligence or personal security roles and people with strong executive abilities went abroad for intelligence collection…</br>
</br>
The 110 agents formed a massive net that covered every corner of Xin and expanded its tentacle-like reach to the outside world. They were just like 110 pairs of eyes that monitored the comings and goings of every corner of Xin.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When they returned to Coro Island from the training island, it was almost 11. Ayesha dropped off her luggage in the living room before she ran to the kitchen. Water began to run. By the sound of it, Jiang Chen knew she was cleaning the dusty kitchenware.</br>
</br>
Since Ayesha left, Jiang Chen hadn't cooked at home. He either went out to eat or traveled to the apocalypse. Hence the kitchen was completely deserted.</br>
</br>
Moments later, the fan was turned on before he heard the sound of vegetables being chopped. Jiang Chen watched the figure moving back and forth behind the frosted glass before a genuine smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
[How should I describe the feeling?]</br>
</br>
[Absence makes the heart grow fonder?]</br>
</br>
Although Ayesha always seemed like a newlywed wife.</br>
</br>
After not having Ayesha's cooking for so long, when he ate her delicious food again, Jiang Chen almost ate his tongue.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's cooking style was completely different from Yao Yao's. Due to the cold of the apocalypse, Yao Yao favored stews and hotpots more. But Ayesha's style was a fusion between the east and west. For example, she chopped pepped steak into strips to fry them with peppers. But regardless of her style, there was no doubt her food was delicious!</br>
</br>
If it wasn't for the fact that he injected the genetic vaccine with a digestive and had higher metabolism than typical people, he would be afraid he'd get a food-baby from eating so much food.</br>
</br>
With her arms on the table while gazing at her love feasting on her cooked food, a joyful smile appeared on Ayesha's face.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you hungry?" Jiang Chen noticed Ayesha hadn't even touched her chopsticks yet as he asked curiously.</br>
</br>
Ayesha blinked her blue eyes.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… I feel like I haven't seen you for a while. I want to look at you more."</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen helped Ayesha clean up the dishes and stuffed them into the dishwasher. He also put the clothes from yesterday into the washer and they picked up cleaning equipment to completely clean the mansion covered in dust.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Although Ayesha insisted she would do it herself, Jiang Chen still picked up a broom to help. It would be too embarrassing if she cleaned the whole mansion herself while he didn't do any chores.</br>
</br>
</br>
Especially since there was much inexplicable fun to be had with chores when doing them with the person you loved.</br>
</br>
When the housework was done, it would be time to clean the person.</br>
</br>
Thus, Jiang Chen picked up Ayesha and carried the blushing woman into the washroom.</br>
</br>
The shower ran for two hours straight before it finally stopped.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen relaxed the whole day.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen planned to visit Zhang Yapin in the presidential palace. Yesterday afternoon, he already made an appointment and President Zhang Yapin specifically rescheduled a few meetings so he could meet him for the entire morning.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took Ayesha to the garage and handed her the brand new car keys.</br>
</br>
"Let's get familiarized with our new car."</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at the Lamborghini quite puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Is it different from the previous one?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously.</br>
</br>
"There are too many differences; you'll see once you get in."</br>
</br>
Ayesha, with a skeptical look, put her hand on the front engine cover and gently tapped it. Instantly, her expression became surprised.</br>
</br>
"The exterior of the car was completely replaced with super-plastic steel and repainted. The car windows were replaced with organic bulletproof glass that's capable of blocking anti-armor sniper rifle.s Aside from the car being slightly heavier by a few kilograms, the defense of this Lamborghini is comparable to an armored vehicle." Jiang Chen walked beside Ayesha as he explained the car to her.</br>
</br>
"Is… is this the technology from that side?" Ayesha ran her hand along the surface and murmured.</br>
</br>
"Yes. Aside from all that, there's a button below the steering wheel that can launch heat sensor grenades from the spare exhaust. Targets can be locked onto from the screen."</br>
</br>
Although it was the technology from the apocalypse, it didn't require too much expertise. They only built an exterior based on the specifications and added a grenade launcher. A lot of wealthy people before the war were keen to collect heavily-taxed diesel vehicles. So when Jiang Chen took out the odd-looking Lamborghini from the Sixth Street repair shop, they didn't look surprised at all.</br>
</br>
The entire modification process took only 500 credits, which was well worth the money. If it wasn't for the fact that the trunk was in the front, thus creating a lack of space, Jang Chen would've installed two Python rocket launchers on it.</br>
</br>
Just as Natasha reminded him, since he was in a position of power, it was better for him to be cautious about his own safety. Jiang Chen wouldn't permit anything that happened on Coro Island to happen again.</br>
</br>
Ayesha sat in the highly modified Lamborghini and tested the handling with a spin outside the garage then she stopped the car right in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned on the passenger seat, put on his seat belt, and Ayesha started the car again.</br>
</br>
From Jiang Chen's experience as a passenger, aside from the vehicle being more stable compared to before, there was nothing else too different.</br>
</br>
They arrived at the garage of the presidential palace. With the guidance of the employees, Jiang Chen stepped into Zhang Yapin's office.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin stood up when he saw Jiang Chen to greet him.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to drink?</br>
</br>
"Thank you, coffee is fine." Jiang Chen smiled and sat across from Zhang Yapin.</br>
</br>
The honor of the president personally making coffee for him was something only he could enjoy. But it wasn't without reason since Jiang Chen's Future Group and Celestial Trade directly provided 10000 job to Xin and indirectly facilitated at least 40000 employment positions. While the large number of foreigners raised the cost of living in the short term, it also made the locals wealthy.</br>
</br>
Just thinking about the prosperous industries at Ange Island and the tourism growing by the day on the other eight islands, the president just couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
"How have you been?" Jiang Chen took a sip of his coffee.</br>
</br>
"Busy but it feels pretty good. Because of Moro's independence movement, Country F can no longer be self-sustaining. Australia plans to increase trade with us, but we still have a small disagreement regarding the tariffs. Their people and our people have been in nonstop debate for the past few days, but it's under friendly terms." With his fingers crossed on his knee, Zhang Yapin said pleasantly, "So, the question we are discussing today is...?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down his coffee and said two words.</br>
</br>
"Visiting Hua."</br>
</br>
"Visiting Hua?" Zhang Yapin raised his eyebrows. "But with the F civil war continuing to escalate, being too close to Hua could make UA suspicious."</br>
</br>
"Then we'll visit them together."</br>
</br>
With December approaching, whether it was for the smooth launch of virtual reality helmets or the full expansion of Xin's tourism industry, an official diplomatic visit was necessary. And as a representative of Xin's corporations, Jiang Chen would be present.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 500: The Meeting in the Presidential Palace</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Visit at the same time? What's the order then?"</br>
</br>
"Based on the distance, we'll visit Hua first then UA. The timing will be at the end of the year. I'll go with you," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"The end of December, after the UA election?" Zhang Yapin touched his chin.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"It should be feasible. Once the election ends and the UA government completes its transition, we'll request a visit. Considering the time it takes to reply… let's set the date to December 25th?" Zhang Yapin proposed.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What's the topic of discussion?" Zhang Yapin continued.</br>
</br>
"Of course it's about trade and discussion since maintaining absolute neutrality is one of our fundamental principles. You should be more familiar with the diplomatic rhetoric than me."</br>
</br>
"Okay… I'll request my assistant to set up the schedule as well as the list of accompanying personnel." Zhang Yapin nodded.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem. With the current economic growth of Xin, we do need to establish a friendly diplomatic relationship with the superpowers. Our original plan was to conduct diplomatic visits earlier next year, so we're only ahead of schedule by a month," Zhang Yapin said while taking a drink of his coffee.</br>
</br>
The Xin economy was transiting from a primal farming economy to a tourism economy with light support from industry. At the same time, Future Mining's deep-water mining technology shipped large amounts of excessive molybdenum to the global market. The Xin domestic market alone obviously couldn't consume these resources and it would require the president to act as "sales" to take a bunch of businessmen to search for business opportunities.</br>
</br>
And based on the desire to win over support and export influence, the superpowers wouldn't let the small countries leave empty-handed.</br>
</br>
"Is that all?" Zhang Yapin put down his cup and crossed his fingers again.</br>
</br>
"There's one other thing." Jiang Chen paused and looked at him. "I need to launch satellites."</br>
</br>
"Launch satellites?" Because this was mentioned so spontaneously, Zhang Yapin took a moment to process it.</br>
</br>
"That's right. I plan to build a space center on an empty island near the equator for the purpose of research, rocket launches and weather observation," Jiang Chen said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to consider renting the rocket? For example, Russia seems to be an expert in that area, and you have a pretty good relationship with them," Zhang Yapin suggested.</br>
</br>
"Renting the rocket isn't a long-term solution. I don't want Celestial Trade's satellites to be dependent on someone else. And based on the consideration of national security, Xin must possess the ability to launch satellites independently, especially since we are close to the equator with a unique geographical advantage. If we don't utilize like it, we're wasting a God-given opportunity."</br>
</br>
</br>
"But launching satellites isn't as simple as you think." Zhang Yapin let out a sigh and began to explain to Jiang Chen the difficulties involved.</br>
</br>
"First, following tradition, the plan to launch a satellite must be reported to the International commercial Aerospace Organization, the Internal Maritime Organization, and the International Telecommunication Union."</br>
</br>
"Secondly, since Pannu acceded to the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which are commonly referred to as the 'Outer Space Treaties,' Pannu has the obligation to inform the United Nations on space launch activities. Although the regime has changed, the new countries inherited the former Pannu regime of the United Nations seats, so we inherited the treaty by principle.</br>
</br>
"Just reporting? Then get your assistant to write a few documents," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"It's not that simple - all kinds of international organizations will come to investigate our launch status to confirm we're launching a satellite and ICBM. And we can be certain that country F will protest against our launch plan and use all forms of political means to disrupt our launch plan in the name of national security." Zhang Yapin shook his head.</br>
</br>
A sneer appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"There's no need to worry. They don't even have the ability to take care of themselves; they won't have the energy to focus on our launch plan. I'll submit the complete launch plan to you in three days. We're launching commercial telecommunication satellites that are in accordance with international law. As for the 'international tourist groups,' they can feel free to visit."</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen's mind made up, Zhang Yapin let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Okay, if you insist. But allow me to be blatant; does Celestial Trade have the ability to launch satellites? It's not as simple as lighting fireworks."</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about that; I'll take care of it."</br>
</br>
[We can't do it today but that doesn't mean we can't do it tomorrow.]</br>
</br>
With so many private aerospace companies on the verge of bankruptcy, he only needed to spend money to buy the equipment and manpower. He'd leave the restricted equipment there and he didn't want the outdated stuff anyways. He only needed a group of experts responsible for the launch and equipment maintenance.</br>
</br>
He'd bring the rockets and satellites from the apocalypse and familiarize the experts with the equipment operational menu. The real "Aerospace Technology Research Institute" wasn't in the modern world; they were only in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Launch rockets had great strategic and economic significance; space rockets were the prerequisite of the intercontinental missile and so were not worth mentioning. Any country with the ability to launch space rockets had the capability to strike globally. And this ability would be a deterrent to other countries.</br>
</br>
As for the economics, from establishing a wireless power grid to the construction of the space elevator to the development of moon resources, all depended on the most fundamental technology of rocket launching.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hoped the experts in the modern world could gradually digest the space technology from the apocalypse. Since he was not a scientist himself, although he could easily transport materials from the other world, the digestion of the future technology depended on the scientists of the modern world.</br>
</br>
[Talent reserve must be started as early as possible - it's a long-term investment.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finished his coffee before departing.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen opened the door, the senior advisor in a suit was about to enter. Jiang Chen smiled at the tall man and passed him.</br>
</br>
The advisor's eyes stopped on Jiang Chen's back for a moment as his forced smile disappeared and he stepped into the president's office.</br>
</br>
"Mr. President, is this really appropriate?"</br>
</br>
"What are you referring to? My senior advisor." Zhang Yapin put the coffee cups down again and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Allow me to be honest. From what I see, you're not the person sitting in the president's seat. That man is." Zhong Wei took a deep breath and said with honesty.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong with that? 80% of the tax revenue of Xin is either directly or indirectly related to his Future Group. This year's GDP increase is expected to exceed 100%. This is a first in history," Zhang Yapin said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"But an oligopoly is extremely dangerous. In dire times, they could potentially overthrow—" Zhong Wei spoke with his voice slightly raised.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhong Wei, you know this country was overthrown by them before." Zhang Yapin looked at Zhongwei emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
In an instant, the president he was so familiar with gave him a distant feeling.</br>
</br>
"And it's me who's the president, Mr. Zhong Wei. If I continue to work like this, it's always going to be me."</br>
</br>
"And from what you saw, compared to one year ago, did our citizens' quality-of-life improve or worsen?"</br>
</br>
"It certainly… improved… a lot."</br>
</br>
Although Zhong Wei disagreed with Jiang Chen ordering the president around like a puppet, he had to admit that it was because of Jiang Chen's large investment that Pannu Island's economy woke up. From building apartments to improving citizens' living environments to investing in infrastructure development, Celestial Trade didn't do anything that harmed Xin's interests, but their good deeds couldn't be counted with the fingers on both hands.</br>
</br>
"Then that's enough." Zhang Yapin smiled.</br>
</br>
"But—"</br>
</br>
Zhong Wei still wanted to say something, but Zhang Yapin interrupted him.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhong Wei. The reason why I hired you as a senior advisor is because of your economic doctoral degree from Harvard as well as your excellent ability in international relations and trade. I didn't hire you because of comical political awareness and boring ambition. This isn't the Rainbow Mansion, this is the Xin Presidential Palace. Do you understand what I mean?"</br>
</br>
After a long while, Zhong Wei nodded his head with great difficulty.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
"So some things can't be mentioned again in the future, understand?"</br>
</br>
"… I understand."</br>
</br>
</br>

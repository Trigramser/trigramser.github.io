</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen sat up on the bed while rubbing his still sleepy eyes.</br>
</br>
A faint smile appeared on his face while looking at Ayesha, who was still curled up in blankets, sleeping like an adorable cat.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, there were no words for what happened last night.</br>
</br>
Maybe it was just his imagination; however, it seemed that from that night on, Ayesha had started becoming clingier. Although she remained expressionless in public when it was just the two of them...ahem, there's no need to say the rest.</br>
</br>
Yesterday he took Ayesha around all the major tourist attractions, along with hundreds of photos carrying their beautiful memories, it could be considered as the perfect culmination of their Kane trip.</br>
</br>
He leaned against the headboard, brooding for a short while, and then taking care not to disturb the still sleeping Ayesha, he sneaked out of bed.</br>
</br>
He went to the bathroom, took a shower, and then took out his phone to call Robert.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, buddy, I heard you've solved your problem. Uh, sorry, I—" As soon as the phone connected, Robert's apologetic voice immediately came through.</br>
</br>
"Ok, I didn't come here to listen to you apologize," Jiang Chen yawned and wandered to the balcony of the room. "Niger, last stop, how are things over there?"</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, everything will be smooth sailing from here on. I already personally made the trip to ensure everything is ready." Robert touched his nose with embarrassment and his laugh echoed through the phone</br>
</br>
"You personally made the trip? When did you become so diligent?" Jiang Chen asked, looking baffled. "Your "old friend" is not monitoring you?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and leaned leisurely against the carved metal fence.</br>
</br>
"Has the infrastructure construction been completed yet? I've already solved the training problem."</br>
</br>
"Of course, I know a Portuguese builder who's an expert in this area. He previously assisted the French army to build a military outpost in Mali. In short, this guy was good at building military infrastructures. Asking price is not expensive—$15million. I went and inspected it yesterday. It's already finished and the quality was also excellent."</br>
</br>
[Hmm, not bad.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with satisfaction and changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"What about the refugees?"</br>
</br>
"Done."</br>
</br>
"Great. Wait for me in Niger." Jiang Chen then hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
All of a sudden, he felt a piece of clothing gently draping over his back. Upon turning around, he was greeted by Ayesha's tender but fiery eyes.</br>
</br>
"You're up." Jiang Chen smiled and gently held the small hand on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, it's a bit cold here, especially in the morning. Are you hungry? I'll make you breakfast," Ayesha said softly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes bore into Ayesha's eyes.</br>
</br>
Being stared like that by Jiang Chen, Ayesha's cheeks turned scarlet and whispered, "What?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I've just realized you're becoming more and more beautiful." Jiang Chen grinned wickedly while staring into her eyes.</br>
</br>
Gently clutching her panicking hands, he pulled Ayesha back into the house.</br>
</br>
"Come on, we're getting that breakfast."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Breakfast at Primir Hotel was exquisite though somewhat bit expensive.</br>
</br>
After eating breakfast, Jiang Chen checked out at the front desk, and then while holding Ayesha's hand, boarded the taxi and headed to Boris Boer International Airport.</br>
</br>
What luggage? Just store them directly in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
After getting off the vehicle, Ayesha returned to her usual cold expression and followed Jiang Chen half a step behind.</br>
</br>
At the airport gate, Jiang Chen met Nick along with ten Kane men who were hauling their suitcases.</br>
</br>
He greeted Nick and turned to look at the ten soldiers of the former 92nd Mechanized Infantry.</br>
</br>
"It's such a great honor. You've made the right choice," Jiang Chen smiled and extended his arms in a welcoming gesture.</br>
</br>
"Not like we have much of choice," the man named Ivan shrugged. His stiff face contorted slightly before continuing, "But the opportunities you provided are sure very attractive."</br>
</br>
Laughing, Jiang Chen expression was very cordial. "Of course, I've always been very good with my people."</br>
</br>
"At least the old guy Anderson doesn't need to worry about housing anymore," said a huge bald man with a smile as he pounded the back of his comrade standing next to him.</br>
</br>
"House?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Ivan rolled his eyes and shrugged. "I served the army for 25 years when the former Soviet Union still existed. Unfortunately, I have been enlisted in the Kaneian army. I was on the list for housing in 1987, but with how things are looking, it would take 100 more years before it would be my turn."</br>
</br>
"That's nothing," said the bald guy, patting the guy who continued to remain quiet. "It's even more unfortunate for Anderson. It was already his turn when his name was replaced by someone else."</br>
</br>
"Don't keep using me as an example. Whoever wants to fight for those swindlers can go right ahead. This country has nothing to do with me anymore," Anderson softly rebuked with an unhappy expression.</br>
</br>
"Ok, guys, why don't we chat in the waiting area."</br>
</br>
A group of people standing in front of the airport looked out of place however you look at it. Jiang Chen noticed that the police in the front door was deliberately looking in their direction.</br>
</br>
It was a critical period after all, so any group of people gathering around would cause suspicion.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
There was still an hour before the plane took off and Jiang Chen was fooling around with Nick in the waiting area. Ayesha was sitting impassively beside Jiang Chen and was holding a fashion magazine provided by the airport. It seemed like, after the shopping spree, some kind of strange interest was awakened in her.</br>
</br>
"Where have you been to these past few days?"</br>
</br>
"Went back home and then traveled for a bit," Nick responded succinctly and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, you didn't bring your family to Los Santos?" Jiang Chen asked, somewhat surprised.</br>
</br>
"They can't." Nick's face revealed a rare melancholic expression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what to say. He seemed to have realized something as a wry smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Looking at the flight information over his head, he appeared nostalgic and said, "Do you remember the wooden cabin in Oesk? That's my home."</br>
</br>
"Sorry for making you remember something bad," Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, it's all in the past."</br>
</br>
Previously, Jiang Chen only heard Robert mentioning about Nick's hometown being in Kane. However, he didn't think that it would be in Oesk and his house would be that cabin.</br>
</br>
Due of the heavy atmosphere, the conversation was halted.</br>
</br>
After looking at the time, Jiang Chen got up and walked towards the restroom. Before boarding the plane, he decided to take it easy first.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to leave the restroom, he unexpectedly ran into someone, who he's expecting to be there.</br>
</br>
The same gray vest, aquiline nose, Willie Agent he met the day before yesterday in the ice cream shop.</br>
</br>
"You finally came looking for me. Speaking of which, I still don't know your name." Jiang Chen extended his hand with a smile.</br>
</br>
"My job means that it's inconvenient for me to reveal my name, but you may call me Merlin." Merlin shook his hand, but his eyes were locked on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Merlin? Magician? Your overtime is over?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. Thanks to you." Although he said thank you, there was not a trace of gratitude on his face.</br>
</br>
"Where is the sniper?" Merlin cut straight to the point.</br>
</br>
"In a house in Oesk. I heard the endurance of snipers is not bad, so before I left I feed him well. Should be enough to sustain him for three days without a problem." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The expression on Merlin's face had not changed and his hawk-like glare was still piercing.</br>
</br>
"His exact location. According to the agreement, you said you'll give us his coordinate before leaving the country."</br>
</br>
"It's on this USB." Jiang Chen casually took out a thumb-sized USB and handed it to Merlin.</br>
</br>
Merlin silently reached out to hold the USB only to find out that Jiang Chen wasn't letting go. He cast a suspicious look at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I haven't boarded yet," Jiang Chen stated with a smile.</br>
</br>
"We'll keep our end of the bargain." Merlin's exerted a bit more strength.</br>
</br>
"But I don't trust that." Jiang Chen's grip on the USB remained firm.</br>
</br>
"Why?" Merlin's facial muscle was all wound up due to the pressure.</br>
</br>
"There is still half an hour before we board the plane. To ensure that I'll safely get on the plane and land safely at my destination, I just want to remind you one thing before giving this to you," Jiang Chen paused, smiled when he saw the tension on Merlin's face, before continuing, "I have encrypted the contents inside this USB. After inserting it in the computer for one and half hour, it would automatically unlock the encrypted information inside. If anything happens to me during this trip, I'm sorry, but KGB might get their hands on the sniper's coordinate location first."</br>
</br>
One hour was enough for the plane to land in Nigeria.</br>
</br>
After saying his piece, Jiang Chen let his hand loose without warning. Merlin clutched the USB awkwardly and bumped into the washroom door, stumbling a few steps backward.</br>
</br>
Staring intently at Jiang Chen, Merlin suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect you to be a programmer."</br>
</br>
His original plan was to wait until they acquire the sniper's location and then immediately arrest Jiang Chen. There are far too many reasons for Willie Society to do this. As for the organization behind Jiang Chen—ridiculous, why would they be afraid?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged, "No, but I am the boss, I have a lot of competent employees."</br>
</br>
Naturally, the codes in the USB were Yao Yao's masterpiece</br>
</br>
"Good, I hope you never set foot in Kane again," Merlin took the USB, left words dripping with threats and walked away.</br>
</br>
"I hope you'll be able to receive your salary sooner before your boss goes bankrupt," He shouted at his leaving figure before returning to the boarding area with a smile.</br>
</br>
He sat next to Ayesha, who was still holding the same fashion magazine.</br>
</br>
"Those people left." Ayesha lowered her voice.</br>
</br>
The secret agents who had been sitting nearby had already left, and the waiting room seemed deserted for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Yes, I had a talk with their boss. Which dress do you like? Jiang Chen skillfully changed the topic.</br>
</br>
Ayesha blushed as her fingers rubbed against the page.</br>
</br>
"This one—ah! No, I already have enough clothes..."</br>
</br>
"Hmm, this one should fit you nicely. Alright, let's buy it! Copy the website, and I'll show you how to shop online..."</br>
</br>
Nick glanced at the two people and cracked a smile on their display of "affection." He then looked at the clock on the wall again.</br>
</br>
It was almost time to board.</br>
</br>
[Farewell, my hometown. I wish you peace.]</br>

</br>
Niger, Niamey International Airport.</br>
</br>
"Buddy, haha, we meet again." Robert passionately greeted and embraced Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen awkwardly shoved him away. "Ahem, I think it's better if we just shake hands."</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, this is to sincerely express my remorse." He pounded Jiang Chen's back quite vigorously. Then he walked in front of a Hummer and exaggeratedly opened the door with a teasing smile. "Please get in the car, Your Honorable Dictatorship."</br>
</br>
"I still have a long way to go," Jiang Chen retorted with a smile.</br>
</br>
He took Ayesha to sit at the back of the car, while Nick naturally took the passenger seat in front.</br>
</br>
"Now that you think about it, I do believe fate has brought us together in the desert." Robert stepped on the gas, held the stirring wheel and started the ignition. He remarked while smiling, "Last time, it was in the desert in Iraq too."</br>
</br>
"Last time, I was there to wipe your ass for you. Hopefully, you won't get into trouble this time," Jiang Chen couldn't resist the temptation to mock him.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, aren't you missing the point here? There's a guy from UA who runs an errand all over the world for you, a Slavic who went to the frontline with you, and a beauty sitting beside you," Robert jested and looked at him through the rearview mirror of the car.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, although there was no visible change in Ayesha's expression, her face turned into a crimson shade.</br>
</br>
"Just focus on your driving. Stop talking nonsense anymore," Jiang Chen laughingly reprimanded him and then paused before asking, "Where's the location of the base?"</br>
</br>
"Sahara desert, Niger. It's an undeveloped area in Agadez Region. Better prepare yourself mentally as it could be quite desolated out there," Robert reminded.</br>
</br>
The outside of the airport was in Loess Hill, and there were hardly any buildings in sight. Aside from the road, there were dust and yellow sands everywhere. A gust of wind would occasionally sweep a layer of dust.</br>
</br>
Moreover, it was probably the only airport Jiang Chen had seen without a taxi lane, a bus stop, let alone a subway.</br>
</br>
"Damn, how could this place be so poor!" he swore while he stared out of the window into the endless sand dunes that went as far as the eyes could see.</br>
</br>
How can you say that this is the capital? At the very least, it shouldn't be this undeveloped.</br>
</br>
"Downtown is much better. It's like the suburbs of Los Santos." Robert laughed. "10 kilometers more to go. We're not that far. Speaking of poverty, Niger's Minister of Commerce Armani would like to meet you and invite you to dinner."</br>
</br>
"To attract foreign investment?" Jiang Chen asked dispassionately. He leaned back on the chair and yawned. "Why don't you go on my behalf? I already bought 20 acres of wasteland. I'm temporarily not interested in investing in any other projects."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ahem, no, there's actually more to it. Basic necessities such as water, power supply, food, ammunition that will be used in training, and so on," Robert reminded him.</br>
</br>
Those indeed posed as a concern. Jiang Chen pondered on it while pinching his chin.</br>
</br>
"Military supplies, that I can solve. As for the others...what do you suggest?" Jiang Chen looked at Robert.</br>
</br>
"For the power supply, my advice is to buy a few sets of fuel generators or a batch of solar cells. The sun is pretty intense here, so I think solar power would be our best choice. As for the water, it seems to be illegal to drill well in here. And I also don't suggest engaging in squabbles with the local tribes. I heard that even the Niger government couldn't control them, so it's best if we outsource them. Food and basic necessities can be purchased locally. The cost of living here can be quite cheap, especially the food."</br>
</br>
"Then let's do that," Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"If that's the case, you definitely need to meet Armani. But before that, I'll send you to the hotel where you'll be staying." Robert shrugged and smiled.</br>
</br>
The car finally drove into the downtown area.</br>
</br>
Niger River ran through the city. The river was lush verdant, just like an oasis in the desert.</br>
</br>
In fact, it was not as bad as what Robert made it out to be. At the very least, Nieamay, the capital of the country, didn't seem that bad. Although he hadn't seen the suburbs of Los Santos, when they reached the downtown area, the surrounding buildings looked rather sophisticated.</br>
</br>
He only stayed at the hotel for a short while before he changed into a suit Robert had prepared for him and got into the car.</br>
</br>
This time, instead of Robert's Hummer, it was Niger Department of Commerce for receiving VIP guests.</br>
</br>
They got off at a restaurant where they apparently received foreign guests. A black man in a suit walked toward him and greeted him with a smile</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Jiang Chen. You must be the oriental billionaire Robert was talking about." The elderly black minister warmly held Jiang Chen's right hand and shook it firmly.</br>
</br>
Much to Jiang Chen's surprise, Armani could actually speak in Han.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Armani," he responded to his enthusiastic greetings.</br>
</br>
"I knew a lot of Han comrades as outstanding as you. We have a lot of comrades here in Niger coming from Hua, so you can think of this place as your second home. Niger welcomes you," Armani said warmly, speaking in a rather fluent Han.</br>
</br>
"Haha, of course."</br>
</br>
Pleasantries completed, Jiang Chen and Armani walked into the restaurant with an entourage of bodyguards and other personnel in tow. This "welcome ceremony" was quite lavish.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, a sudden strange idea popped up into Jiang Chen's mind.</br>
</br>
He was wondering when he returns home for New Year, would his major bring a congregation of people to welcome him in a grand fashion such as this? He was, after all, the man who appeared in the Wall Street Journal. The government newspaper also lauded him for his achievement in the technology sector. Even in the entire province, not a lot of people could outshine him.</br>
</br>
Sheesh, it would be so cool to go home and be welcomed in such a grand fashion.</br>
</br>
Despite being in overseas, distance did not interfere with his wish-fulfillment fantasies.</br>
</br>
Armani invited him to sit with him. The side-by-side seating arrangement spoke volumes about how highly the Minister of Commerce regarded him.</br>
</br>
Naturally, looking from this angle, one could also see how poor Niger was.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of the presence of numerous Han investors in Niger, Armani chose to discuss business during dinner. He clearly knew the intricacies of their culture as he perfunctorily drank two glasses before deciding to stop.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he was drinking while talking business according to"Han custom".</br>
</br>
After another exchange of greetings, Armani naturally led the topic into the right track.</br>
</br>
"Thank you very much, Mr. Jiang, for investing in Niger. Is there anything we can assist you with to make this process easier? The basic economic condition is excellent and we're now in the stage of rapid development. There are a lot of business opportunities to invest in..."</br>
</br>
Listening to Armani's passionate speech or drivel, Jiang Chen couldn't help but ridicule him in his mind. [You don't even have cab at your airport, yet you have the audacity to say that your economic situation is good!]</br>
</br>
But even if the heart said so, the words could not be said out loud.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I am very optimistic about the domestic development of your country. And that's exactly the reason why I'm establishing a security company and building a training facility here." Listening to this black uncle speaking for a long time, Jiang Chen still maintained his composure.</br>
</br>
The meaning behind these words was: I have no interest in investing now.</br>
</br>
However, Armani was apparently not ready to give up that easily as he continued to enthusiastically discuss some other projects in great details. His meaning was obvious: give me some money right now.</br>
</br>
"How about this, I have a proposal—to facilitate seamless transportation of goods, I intend to invest in road construction from the provincial capital of Agadez province to the undeveloped area." In fact, this idea was brewing in his mind for a while now, and it was an excellent opportunity to bring it up.</br>
</br>
As soon as Armani heard about the road construction, his eyes instantly brightened. If they could build roads, not only it would drastically improve the livelihood of people in the undeveloped areas, it would also strengthen the government's control over the rebellious tribes.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Niger citizens will surely be very grateful for your generosity and friendship, Mr. Jiang."</br>
</br>
"Don't mention it. It is up to you to study the specific planning of the road, and then we will discuss it further based on your proposal," Jiang Chen responded with a smile while looking at the eagle-eyed Armani.</br>
</br>
Finally the dinner concluded in a harmonious mood. The minister of commerce personally sent him back to the hotel where he was staying.</br>
</br>
"How is it, my friend?" Robert asked while grinning at him. He was standing at the entrance of the hotel.</br>
</br>
"Annoying. Do ministers always talk this much? They're so damned desperate for an investment."</br>
</br>
That Armani was a rather interesting character, a politician with a flair for public speaking. There was nothing wrong with soliciting investment, but when Armani sensed his lack of interest, he became more assertive and went on forever. For a while there, although he knew that Armani was speaking Han, he had no idea what he was talking about.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha!" Robert started to laugh hysterically and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"My friend, now you understand my pain? The first day I was here, he basically serenades to me for the entire day. But I cleverly brought your name up and said that I was only working for you, and the real person with money is a guy named Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
"That's not funny." Jiang Chen glared at him and entered the hotel.</br>
</br>
Robert caught up to him and started getting down to a more serious topic.</br>
</br>
"Simply put, it could be quite annoying to talk business with black people, but we can't just give them some candies and send them away. Tomorrow we'll head over to Agadez province to inspect your military base.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, it's a training facility for a security company."</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter since everyone already knows," Robert commented carelessly.</br>
</br>
Stopping in front of the elevator, Robert nudged him with his elbow and quipped, "We'll depart early morning tomorrow so don't go crazy tonight."</br>
</br>
Without waiting for his reaction, Robert dashed into the elevator that's about to close.</br>
</br>
"This pervert," Jiang Chen said with amusement and shook his head.</br>
</br>
But at that moment, an image of Ayesha dressed in a white floral dress last night appeared in his mind.</br>
</br>
[Uh, okay,] Jiang Chen decided.</br>
</br>
[I'll sleep a bit later tonight and accompany her to try on a few clothes.]</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 153: The Tuareg Tribe</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the morning, the tranquil Sahara desert welcomed a group of strange guests.</br>
</br>
Three Hummers galloped the vast endless expanse of sand, leaving three trails of dust behind the undisturbed desert.</br>
</br>
"How much longer?" Jiang Chen asked in boredom while sitting in the back with his arms crossed.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who was sitting beside him, had the same emotionless expression, but from the dark, deep circles under her eyes, it was evident she didn't get enough sleep.</br>
</br>
"It's just right ahead of us! But first, we need to greet the chiefs of the nearby tribes," Robert yelled enthusiastically while driving.</br>
</br>
"Why do I feel that you get really excited when you're in the desert?" Jiang Chen glanced at him.</br>
</br>
"This feeling of freedom is something that you'll never understand!"</br>
</br>
This guy is crazy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen mulled things over while looking outside the window.</br>
</br>
The other two Hummers sat ten veterans recruited as instructors; compared to the energy here, theirs was much quieter.</br>
</br>
Soon the vehicle drove into small sand dunes with a harder surface.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen's vision suddenly cleared, he saw rows and rows of small huts.</br>
</br>
Primitive, ignorance, poverty.</br>
</br>
These three words summed up his first impression.</br>
</br>
Yellowish gray house and courtyard piled up from gravel. Withered branches were tied together and used as the gate of the courtyard, and the windows were covered with dyed cloths like an ancient Arabic town in the 12th century. Every household kept a camel. It was said that here a man's social status was measured by how many camels he possessed.</br>
</br>
"I'm a bit confused. Perhaps you can explain to me our purpose of coming here?" Jiang Chen asked helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Er, it might be a tad difficult to understand based from the modern perspective. Afterall, we already paid the money and purchased the land from the government of Niger. A portion of that money was also used to compensate them for taking up their ranch. As far as the contract is concerned, the 20 hectares of land not far from here are ours, but according to the local customs, our identity is still that of a "guest". So following their tradition, we must obtain their recognition first before we can "settle" here," Robert explained.</br>
</br>
"That troublesome?" Jiang Chen's mouth twitched.</br>
</br>
"In fact, it's only a formality since they are more or less secularized," Robert shrugged and slowed down the speed of the car, "Still, there are some benefits from respecting their local tradition. At the very least, we can harmoniously co-exist without worrying about them giving us trouble, and they may even stand by our side during critical moments."</br>
</br>
"I don't quite understand what you're saying. So who is the owner of this piece of land? Is it Niger? The Tuareg tribe?"</br>
</br>
"Hmm, you can think of it as Niger as the king of the middle age, and Tuareg tribe as the lord of this piece of land." Robertsrolled his eyes as he gave an unlikely metaphor.</br>
</br>
</br>
"If we get into a conflict with them, which side would the Niger government be on?" Jiang Chen asked a dangerous question after listening to Robert's explanation.</br>
</br>
A troubled smile appeared on Robert's face upon hearing Jiang Chen's question.</br>
</br>
"The Niger government will be delighted if we could wipe them out, but that's kind of impossible. Tuareg men are scattered throughout the desert. And rumor says that they have some unusual relationship with extremist organizations like Al-Qaeda. The Tuareg guerrillas also fought alongside Al-Qaeda during a riot in Mali."</br>
</br>
Robert paused when he noticed Jiang Chen's unresponsiveness. For fear that Jiang Chen might do something harsh, he immediately added, "Uh, I suggest we better not clash with them. The people here are quite tough, and despite being poor, every household has an AK lying around."</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, I was just asking," Jiang Chen quipped.</br>
</br>
When the car drove into the tribe, all natives cast the vehicles with a curious look. Due to the poor road condition, Robert rolled down the window and signaled the two vehicles behind to stay outside of the tribe.</br>
</br>
It was not a big deal, following the local tradition shouldn't take long to complete.</br>
</br>
"That's the food market over there, but I don't recommend you trying out the things they sell there."</br>
</br>
"What a coincidence, I'm also not interested." Jiang Chen looked outside the window. A kid on a camel gave him a curious look, and his father, who was wearing a veil, led the camel out of the tribe.</br>
</br>
Ayesha subtly glanced at the window and muttered one phrase: "Heresy."</br>
</br>
The car stopped, following the direction of a black woman, Jiang Chen and Robert walked into the building of the central tribe.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Tuareg tribe, a nomadic ethnic confederation mainly distributed in the suburbs of the Sahara Desert in Africa, and a branch of the Berber clan spread throughout the vast region of North Africa. Renowned for their writing, language, and unique nomadic life, which were substantially different from those of their surrounding neighbors. Instead of a matriarchal social organization, Tuareg was a matrilineal society. Although they believe in Islam, women were not required to wear a veil. On the contrary, men 25 and above must wear a veil in the Tuareg clan society.</br>
</br>
What was more striking was its open marital values wherein women could have multiple marriage partners, and in case of divorce, all assets would belong to them.</br>
</br>
Apart from these strange customs, they were naturally born warriors. There was a notable local motto: "The desert holds no secret to Tuareg people." In this desert, they knew how to fight better than anyone else. During the Mali civil war, Tuareg guerrillas delivered consecutive losses to the government forces.</br>
</br>
Moreover, because of its strong combat ability, there were a lot of Mediterranean dictators and warlords who were interested in their fighting prowess. The most famous one was Gaddafi, who particularly favored Tuareg mercenaries. After the outbreak of the civil war in Libya, Gaddafi even offered the Tuareg tribe a lucrative remuneration of $1000 USD a day to help him quell an anti-government militant. Of course, no one knew if the money had actually been honored or true in the first place.</br>
</br>
Robert had, in fact, recommend to Jiang Chen that since they chose Niger as the location for the base, recruiting Tuareg people might not be such a bad idea. However, after some consideration, Jiang Chen still rejected his proposal.</br>
</br>
The main reason was Jiang Chen's lack of trust in their culture and religion and also to avoid potential issues that could arise in the future. At least those refugees who fled their hometown would not suddenly clamor to go home. In any case, the refugees were more reliable.</br>
</br>
In the relatively spacious house, Jiang Chen saw the legendary tribal chief.</br>
</br>
"Distant visitors, may your wealth be endless like the sands of the Sahara." The dark-skinned Female chief nodded slightly, her hands clasped together.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because she often dealt with French people, her French was rather fluent. But regardless of how fluent she was, Jiang Chen who only knew English could not understand a thing, so he simply stood there and kept mum while waiting for Robert's next move.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your generosity in sharing your land. May your tribe flourish and your camels grow in flocks," Robert responded in fluent French. Even now, Jiang Chen could not figure out just how many languages this guy knew.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this, the elderly female chief cracked a smile, her wrinkles scrunching up together.</br>
</br>
The following ceremony was quite simple. A man, whose head was wrapped in a frighteningly thick turban, carried two bowls of camel milk and placed them in front of them. According to the local's custom, the thicker the turban and veil were, the more respect they were showing to their guests.</br>
</br>
It was said that in the past whenever a male guest visited here, he was also required to wear a headscarf, or at least his mouth must be covered. But now it appeared that they have made some concessions to foreign cultures in the process of adapting to modern times.</br>
</br>
It was unknown whether the female chief was chanting a mantra or praying, but she spoke for a long time before she gestured to the two people with a smile.</br>
</br>
Looking at that bowl of cloudy camel milk in front of him, Jiang Chen could not help but wonder if it was just freshly squeezed out. When he looked at Robert, the noticed that this man's eyebrows were furrowed as well.</br>
</br>
"Is this really potable?" Jiang Chen whispered in English.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but trust me, you won't drink it again after you have your first." Although Robert expression was somewhat bitter as he attempted a herculean feat of downing the camel milk with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
From the looks of it, this was his second time drinking this awful stuff.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was secretly speechless.</br>
</br>
Seeing Robert's swift action, the smile on the female chief's face became more brilliant. The faster the guest drank, the more it reflected their respect for the host.</br>
</br>
When she looked at Jiang Chen, however, her eyes grew even brighter.</br>
</br>
Robert had not even put the bowl down, Jiang Chen had already put the empty bowl on the table.</br>
</br>
It took Robert a while before he finally finished and placed the bowl on the table with a quivering hand. Thus when he saw Jiang Chen's empty bowl, his eyes almost popped out from its sockets.</br>
</br>
After coming out from the tribal chief's house, the two men received a warm farewell.</br>
</br>
Back in the car, Robert hummed as he wiped his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, I feel like I've got a layer of grease in my stomach," Robert complained as he looked at Jiang Chen oddly, "You okay with that strange smell?"</br>
</br>
"What strange smell? It was okay." Jiang Chen laughed loftily as he leaned back and then put his arms behind his head.</br>
</br>
Other than the grease that barely touched his mouth, he didn't drink a single drop and all of it was sent to the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
He was getting more adept at using this ability.</br>
</br>
After their friendly interaction with the neighbors, the three Hummers returned to the road once again.</br>
</br>
Finally, Jiang Chen saw a "castle" in the middle of the desert - Future Security.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 154"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 154: Future Security</br>
</div></br>
Barbed wire fences, concrete watchtowers, and buildings—these structures greatly resembled a small military base.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?" Robert turned around and smiled proudly.</br>
</br>
"Not bad." There was also a satisfied expression on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Very neat.</br>
</br>
The three Hummers stopped at the checkpoint at the entrance. The patrolling soldiers wearing dark sunglasses approached the car, and after verifying Robert's information, they performed a simple military salute and then released the checkpoint post.</br>
</br>
The soldiers patrolling here were mercenaries hired from a security company in South Africa. With Jiang Chen's arrival, 20 people in a camouflage combat uniform wielding M-series automatic rifles quickly assembled in a neat formation in the center of the base.</br>
</br>
These people only knew how to follow money and would not ask any questions. Their price was entirely based on the degree of danger of the mission, and Robert was able to negotiate with them for the price of $70,000 USD.</br>
</br>
As the situation in the region escalated, Jiang Chen made some adjustments to the refugee's recruitment plan after deliberating it with Robert. The original plan was to hijack refugee ships, and then forcibly transfer them to the military base here. It was later changed to heading directly to the Syria border and masquerading as UA troops responsible for escorting the refugees, and tricking them to getting on the vehicle that would originally lead them to Europe.</br>
</br>
As for tricking them, the answer was quite simple.</br>
</br>
A flyer and a poster.</br>
</br>
&lt;European Labor Migration Program:</br>
</br>
Any male between 18-25 may register here. You can bring your spouse with you.</br>
</br>
Those who are interested may register here. The agency will arrange jobs for you.</br>
</br>
Required: 100.&gt;</br>
</br>
Seeing that not only you could bring your spouse and there was also a guaranteed work to boot, and not to mention these people were equipped with UA weapons, the registration turned out to be popular.</br>
</br>
After those who managed to qualify got into the vehicle, it didn't take long for them to realize that something was amiss.</br>
</br>
Upon confirming that they were heading in the wrong direction, the refugees began panicking and frantically scampered to get off the truck, but the mercenaries, who were merely doing their responsibility to complete their mission, remained unperturbed, and they forcefully dragged all the refugees back inside.</br>
</br>
After completing their "escort" duty, their mission was changed into guarding the refugees and preventing any attacks from extremist organizations or any other unforeseen situations.</br>
</br>
According to the contract, as soon as Jiang Chen's group arrived, they would immediately hand over the control of the base and depart. For them, this was probably the easiest task they ever had, even though the pay wasn't much.</br>
</br>
</br>
Seeing the retreating figures of the mercenaries, Jiang Chen gestured for the ten Kane veterans to line up behind him and signaled Robert to turn on the speaker and gather the refugees to the square.</br>
</br>
The refugees were already converging in that direction.</br>
</br>
After witnessing the mercenaries, who had turned over the control of the base to Jiang Chen, drove away, they felt an amalgam of complex and confusing emotions.</br>
</br>
They previously thought those people were UA soldiers, who would take them to a safe location or at least a refugee camp near the border of a European country, but they didn't expect to be taken to a completely opposite direction and deep into the desert.</br>
</br>
At first, they thought it was the base of an extremist group, but it did not look quite like it in all respects. Other than preventing them from leaving, they didn't make many forceful demands. The soldiers put a number on them and even arranged rooms for them that were much more spacious than those from a refugee camp.</br>
</br>
And even if no one stopped them from leaving, there was nowhere they could go.</br>
</br>
This place was in the middle of the Sahara desert. Without any means of transportation and sufficient supply, how far would their feet be able to take them? They would surely die if they met a sandstorm or if they got lost in the desert.</br>
</br>
After going through the initial phase of restlessness, they chose to wait and observe. At least these people didn't torture them, and there were not many restrictions on food and water. One could even say that life here was better than any refugee camps.</br>
</br>
Perhaps this place was the new refugee camp planned by the United Nations. After all, Europeans didn't want them to migrate to their country, so they funded the construction of facilities in the depths of the desert...there were a number of people with this kind of naive thinking.</br>
</br>
However, they were doomed to be gravely disappointed by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Any gain had a price to it.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Looking at the refugees standing all over the place, Jiang Chen tilted his head slightly and asked Ivan, who was standing on the side, "What do you think about these people? Do you have the confidence in training them?"</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this, a glimpse of pride flashed on Ivan's face.</br>
</br>
There was a time when he thought that he would only serve under a president, who was not worthy of his allegiance, and serve as a cannon fodder for the sake of ideals that were not worth sacrificing for. However, as he stood there looking at the advanced training facility, and receiving the promised high salary, and when the boss asked him: "Are you confident..."</br>
</br>
The answer was a no-brainer.</br>
</br>
"That would depend on what the boss wants," Ivan raised his head and replied firmly, as though he had just regained his pride as a soldier.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows, his chin pointed toward the doorway, "Similar to the group of people that had just left."</br>
</br>
"Yes, boss!" Ivan shouted vehemently, "But, boss, I have a problem!"</br>
</br>
"Oh? Say it," Jiang Chen nodded, pleased with his determination.</br>
</br>
"I might go overboard," The soldier's eyes were burning with a fierce fighting spirit.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen paused and then unexpectedly laughed.</br>
</br>
"If you go above and beyond, I'll be sure to give you a bonus."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted his shoulder quite vigorously and stood on the podium while smiling in front of the refugees.</br>
</br>
Sensing that an authoritative figure had stood up, the refugees mustered their courage to voice their doubts.</br>
</br>
"Who in the world are you?"</br>
</br>
"Why did you take us here? We want to go to Europe!"</br>
</br>
"I heard Frankberg provided refugee camp. Why didn't you send us there?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored these questions, and continued fiddling with the microphone and turned on its switch.</br>
</br>
Buzz—!</br>
</br>
The deafening static blared through the four corners of the square, and aside from Jiang Chen and the ten instructors, almost everyone covered their ears while ducking down.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, seems like the mic is now working. You all can understand English, right? Then I'll start."</br>
</br>
He ignored the pairs of frightened, angry, confused, and helpless eyes. He paused while renewing the feeling from the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"You might think that you've been deceived. Why didn't you disembark in Greece but had been taken to Central Africa instead?" Glancing around the crowd, Jiang Chen laughed and continued, "That's right, I did trick you."</br>
</br>
The crowd instantly erupted.</br>
</br>
"This is unlawful!"</br>
</br>
"Are you not afraid of being prosecuted by International Court of Justice? This is is against the law..."</br>
</br>
"Send us back..."</br>
</br>
"Send you back? Sorry, I'm not obliged to do so. But if any of you wants to leave, you can go right ahead, the door is open," Jiang Chen said with a smile as he spread out his hands.</br>
</br>
Nobody spoke. Everyone knew that it would be stupid to cross the desert without any means of transportation.</br>
</br>
"Warm shelter, delicious food, and clean water, you can't deny that your life here is much better than your refugee camps on the Syria border."</br>
</br>
"But at least we would still have our freedom," someone muttered in the crowd.</br>
</br>
"Ah, freedom. You're so poor, you only have your freedom and that's why you got on the truck, right? If you have money, you definitely could afford the ticket, isn't that right?" Jiang Chen smiled as he stared at the young man who interrupted him.</br>
</br>
The young man didn't expect to be stared at by the person on the podium, he swallowed and shrank back a little.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen did not seem to be looking at him and instead raised his hand and continued, "If you go to Europe, what then? You'll hole up in a government-provided shelter while spectating someone else's happiness? Quit your delusions. That place doesn't belong to you. You are but a refugee to them. Oh, you might say that you'll work hard, but when their natives are still unemployed, what kind of competitive edge do you think you'll have?"</br>
</br>
Hearing this, a lot of people lowered their head. They had given this problem some thought, but they never dared to think that far ahead. If one dwelled too much on misery, the courage to continue to move forward would become even slimmer, and not to mention the possibility of finding happiness in the future.</br>
</br>
"Receiving donation, eating relief food and becoming the type of person, who people would find suspicious wherever you go. I'll take the responsibility of telling you that indeed, you'll be able to survive, but you'll also stay in the shelter for the rest of your life. One day when your child wants to go to an amusement park, but because you have no money, you can only rack your brains on how to persuade your child that it's not a fun place. I don't know how would you then feel about it.</br>
</br>
"Do you still want to go to Europe so bad after hearing all that?"Jiang Chen looked at the audience whose eyes had lost their vigor due to his momentum. Seeing this, he could not help the touch of smug smile slipped through his face.</br>
</br>
"Where else can we go if we don't go to Europe?" A young man could not help but voice it out.</br>
</br>
"Even if I did trick you, it's not exactly a lie." Jiang Chen ignored his question and opened his arms and said while smiling, "Work, I've already arranged it for you. If you work for me, I'll provide you a stable living environment and a salary of $200 USD a month. Your salary will increase gradually depending on your performance."</br>
</br>
"The contract period is 3 years, and after 3 years, you can then decide whether to leave and take your savings to any other country in the world or stay. But trust me, in less a year, you won't be thinking about that dumb thought."</br>
</br>
"If you don't tell us the nature of work, how are we supposed to believe you?" There was another jarring question from the crowd again.</br>
</br>
"Nature of work? Isn't that obvious?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen acted like he was surprised and made a show of looking around for a moment before continuing, "This is a military base, other than soldiers, what else would it need?"</br>

Another uproar.</br>
</br>
Naturally, the crowd flared up again.</br>
</br>
They thought that they would only be mining at an obscure place or engage in a hard labor, and the military facility was only there to supervise them, but what they did not expect was Jiang Chen wanted them to become mercenaries!</br>
</br>
Was this a joke? They left their home for the very reason of avoiding the war. If they were to participate in the battlefield again, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of fleeing?</br>
</br>
Someone asked this question out loud and denounced Jiang Chen that no one had the right to force civilians to wield weapons and set foot on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, all Kane veterans guffawed.</br>
</br>
"You're asking me what's the point? You'll understand that in the future. I'm too lazy to talk nonsensical things. You're asking what right do I have? Of course none, but like I've said, if you want to leave, go right ahead and leave. You have half an hour to decide, and if you still remain in the base after half an hour, then I would consider that you acquiesce by default."</br>
</br>
After delivering his speech, no matter how these people protested, Jiang Chen directly did an about-face and left the podium.</br>
</br>
There obviously won't be an applause for him, and he certainly didn't need one.</br>
</br>
Just like the Fishbone Base at the beginning, when they found themselves unable to resist and living, in fact, a comfortable life, they would gradually accept sooner or later.</br>
</br>
Moreover, Ivan would naturally train them to be absolutely loyal to the organization and shaped them into becoming a soldier.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went next to Ivan and patted him on the shoulder. "I'll leave them in your care."</br>
</br>
"Yes, boss!" the East Slavic soldier bellowed as he saluted and maintained his military posture.</br>
</br>
He nodded his head with satisfaction. He then waved at Ayesha, who was standing quietly in the shadow, and then walked together towards the headquarters.</br>
</br>
While walking, Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha and suddenly asked, "Say, Ayesha, your hometown is in Syria, right?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
After a moment of hesitation, he continued, "Umm, would my actions make you feel uncomfortable?After all, it's your hometown—"</br>
</br>
"No, I will always stand by your side," Ayesha shook her head, her cold face suddenly revealed a gentle smile, "And you are a very gentle person."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost choked on his own saliva.</br>
</br>
[Are you kidding me? What do you mean by gentle?]</br>
</br>
"Ahem, although the first one moved me, I beg to differ on the latter part." He had never hesitated when killing except for the time when he made his first kill.</br>
</br>
Just then, a small hand reached out to clasp his hand.</br>
</br>
It seemed that after the night by the river, she fell in love with the feeling of holding hands, and she would always inadvertently reach out to his hand.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Do you remember the time when you were in the truck?" Ayesha asked quietly.</br>
</br>
Although it was not clear why she mentioned the past, he still smiled and squeezed her hand nonetheless.</br>
</br>
"Of course I remember. How could I forget?"</br>
</br>
It was quite interesting to think that back then, he didn't even notice that Ayesha was a girl.</br>
</br>
"Even to a stranger like me, you still lent a helping hand when you saw my hungry eyes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, "Do you mean those biscuits? Those were cheap."</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head and clenched Jiang Chen's hand. Her mouth was slightly curved in a smile.</br>
</br>
"But you still chose to share rather than to sit on the sidelines and watch." Being alone on her quest for freedom, she was already numb to apathy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly lowered his head and fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
[Shared? Have I really? Is this how people look at me?]</br>
</br>
Ayesha took a peek at Jiang Chen and smiled tenderly.</br>
</br>
"There was once an emperor who was generous, kind, and brave. His territory stretched from west of Thrace, east of Indian River Plain, north of Amu Darya to the south of Persian Gulf.</br>
</br>
'"He acted as a conqueror in Damascus but gained the respect of the people he conquered. The Egyptians built a city in the desert to honor his meritorious deed," she muttered to herself as though she's recounting a legend.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"But the empire was only short-lived." Was she referring to Alexander?</br>
</br>
Towards to this remark, she merely smiled and did not disprove.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he could have just used bullets to suppress them, used their loved ones to threaten them, used force to make them surrender, made them live in tents, and made them live by his rules.</br>
</br>
But he didn't. The living condition here was much better compared to the refugee camp. He even provided them with a salary and hope.</br>
</br>
Feeling the warmth from his hand, Ayesha closed her eyes, her lips curved into a smile.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
[What kind of joke is this? Trek across the desert?]</br>
</br>
The refugees were abuzz with protest.</br>
</br>
However, their objection fell on deaf ears as Ivan and the other instructors ignored the faces filled with righteous indignation and stood there like statues. The public outcry escalated but was cordoned off violent encounters.</br>
</br>
Force would always the best deterrence.</br>
</br>
All the trainers wore a pitch back automatic rifle at their waist, the dark muzzle warned anyone who dared to incite violence.</br>
</br>
Half an hour passed quickly.</br>
</br>
Ivan cracked a smile and signaled his nine compatriots to surround the refugees.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the command post, Jiang Chen and Robert stood side by side in front of the window while watching the situation in the field in good humor.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, didn't think that you'd have the gift of the gab," said Robert, his cigarette dangling in his mouth and his arms were resting on the windowsill.</br>
</br>
"I have a lot of talent." Jiang Chen grinned, he was also leaning against the windowsill.</br>
</br>
Rather than talent, it was more of unceasing practice. Three months ago, if he were to talk in front of more than 100 people, he doubted if he would be able a single word. And now, the did not even need to prepare a speech.</br>
</br>
"Do you know what I was thinking when you were giving that speech?"</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen casually asked, his eyes were still on the field.</br>
</br>
A commotion started to break out in the field. Someone tried to grab Ivan's rifle but was easily suppressed with a single move.</br>
</br>
"Hitler." Robert made an amusing version of Führer and laughingly remarked, "But you didn't learn his way of provocation. You should have given them a loaf of bread and tell them: 'You can eat it as long as you swear your allegiance to me.'"</br>
</br>
"There was no need." Jiang Chen chuckled and got up from the window. "I've already given them enough incentives."</br>
</br>
With that, he left the command center.</br>
</br>
Staring at Jiang Chen retreating figure, Robert shrugged his shoulders and once again resumed observing the square.</br>
</br>
There the riot was already over.</br>
</br>
Perhaps due to the experience they gained in Kane which trained them to be an expert in suppressing uprisings, Ivan was able to lead his nine comrades to successfully control the situation.</br>
</br>
Although the refugees wore a scowl on their face, they still obediently divided into ten columns, each led by a respective trainer. Their spouse and children were taken back to their assigned housing.</br>
</br>
The training started immediately. The first mission was to run two laps around the 20 hectares of the base.</br>
</br>
They would only be able to eat once they finished.</br>
</br>
Don't want to cooperate? Then starve together with your wife and children.</br>
</br>
If they only have themselves to think about, some of them would perhaps attempt to resist; however, hearing that it was not just them who would starve but also their family...</br>
</br>
Everyone chose to compromise.</br>
</br>
Under the scorching sun, figures could be seen running around the base, leaving trails of dust behind them.</br>
</br>
When they dragged their exhausted body after finally finishing two laps, they all dropped to the ground. Not only did the ruthless instructors show not an iota of mercy, the devils also announced that the run would become part of their routine.</br>
</br>
Although they wanted to complain, they couldn't muster enough energy to do so.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, evening came which meant that the training for today was official over.</br>
</br>
When they dragged their beaten body to the cafeteria with their family and received their share of a hot meal, they suddenly felt that it didn't seem to be so bad.</br>
</br>
Roasted golden turkey, stewed mutton soup, bright green salad...</br>
</br>
As far as food is concerned, it was day and night compared to those of refugee camps.</br>
</br>
Maybe it was because of exhaustion after the exercise which stimulated their hunger, the dinner was especially delicious.</br>
</br>
A lot of people even had extra portions, and Jiang Chen didn't skimp on food.</br>
</br>
Hassan sat down beside his wife, Mary, carrying a bowl of mutton soup, and then grabbed a bun, dipped it into the soup, and took a big bite.</br>
</br>
Looking at her exhausted husband, Mary anxiously reached out to him and wiped the dust off his face.</br>
</br>
"What did they make you do?"</br>
</br>
"Other than running, not much, but who knows what they'll do later? Dammit, those trainers are simply inhumane," Hassan cursed as he devoured the food in front of him. Because he expended quite a significant amount of energy, his appetite was huge enough to devour a camel.</br>
</br>
It was not clear whether it was intentional, but everyone there appeared to be a modern Christian, so there was no sign of veils and headscarves in the cafeteria.</br>
</br>
Hassan was munching his chicken and bread, while he pondered about on the future.</br>
</br>
He was 20 years old, his wife 19. They were planning to have a baby last year, but the conflict suddenly escalated overnight, as the shadow of IS enveloped half of Syria. Because he was considered a "heretic," he naturally did not dare to stay in his hometown, so he took his wife away and came to the refugee camp on the border.</br>
</br>
Not knowing whether he should consider himself lucky or unfortunate for being taken here.</br>
</br>
Becoming a mercenary? He never considered this position.</br>
</br>
But now it seemed that there were not many options left for him.</br>
</br>
"Will you... go to the front line?" Mary reluctantly asked.</br>
</br>
"If I become a mercenary, probably," he grimaced and grunted as he stuffed his mouth with bread. He glanced at the trainers who were also having dinner in the cafeteria.</br>
</br>
He was very confused about what would happen in the future.</br>
</br>
But that 3-year contract gave him some hope.</br>
</br>
"After 3 years, let's have a baby. I will work hard to give you and the children a stable environment," Hassan promised.</br>
</br>
Mary stared at him, her eyes were covered with mists, and then she lowered her head shyly.</br>
</br>
"Ok."</br>
</br>
In any case, since his family was already here, he would just need to do his best for them.</br>
</br>
He would just wait and see whatever happened in the future.</br>
</br>
Hassan's thought reflected the thought of other recruits in the base.</br>
</br>
At least for this meal alone, there's nothing to complain about.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 156: Finally going home</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Early next morning, a team of ten men was running outside the base wall.</br>
</br>
They were led by their respective trainers and would have stamina training 10 kilometers away from their location.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's requirement for Ivan was he only had half a year regardless of what method he utilized. Six months later, he wanted to see disciplined and fast-moving troops. Moreover, this unit should be loyal to him alone.</br>
</br>
It was easy to ensure the loyalty of the soldiers: first was money, and second was electronic collar.</br>
</br>
Other than the job contract, Jiang Chen also signed a 10-year confidentiality agreement with the ten Kane instructors. Under the terms of the agreement, they must wear the electronic collar with information detection ability to protect themselves from information leaks in the entire duration of the term.</br>
</br>
In this regard, the ten Kane trainers did not put up any resistance because it was only 10 years, and they did not have any intention of disclosing anything.</br>
</br>
Six months' time was very short, it would be impossible to train a special force capable of a mixture of combat requirement, other new recruits would have to stay in camp for 7 months. Although relying on the virtual reality system for efficient training would only require 1-2 months to complete the new recruit training regimen; however, in the absence of a basic foundation, carelessly bringing these high-tech products out in the open would be highly unwise, more so because he did not have 100 training equipment in the first place.</br>
</br>
But of course, Jiang Chen also made it clear to Ivan that he didn't need a special force, but a competent and modern infantry capable of siege warfare. They didn't need to be able to execute special missions, merely being capable of fighting would suffice.</br>
</br>
As for their combat ability, there were a lot of ways to make up for it.</br>
</br>
Not enough stamina? Then give an injection.</br>
</br>
An E-grade genetic vaccine was really cheap and common in the Sixth Street. Although it was not as powerful as Jiang Chen's C-grade injection, it was enough to improve their constitution to that of special force level. The only reason he did not inject them yet was he wanted them to train their perseverance and endurance. They would be given an injection over the course of training.</br>
</br>
Although Ivan and the trainers were skeptical about the drug that could improve their physical shape, upon seeing the certainty in their boss, they finally believed it was real. In spite of their misgivings, after being injected, they were surprised to discover that their strength and reflex improved by leaps and bounds, only then their skepticism finally disappeared. They were now more confident with the 6-month deadline training mission.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didn't tell them it was a genetic medicine. He only told them it was a mysterious Han medicine.</br>
</br>
</br>
Mhmm, that's right, it's a traditional Han medicine.</br>
</br>
To begin with, from a foreigner's perspective, Han medicine in itself was a very mysterious thing. And precisely because of its mysterious nature that he was not pressed to explain himself.</br>
</br>
It was also worth mentioning that genetic vaccine functioned by fine-tuning the genetic sequence of somatic cells and stem cells without affecting genes in certain cells. In other words, there was no need to worry about genetic issues.</br>
</br>
Bad marksmanship? Then make the technology shoot for you.</br>
</br>
AK47? M4A1? Obviously, they won't be using these junks.</br>
</br>
100 years in the future, these seemingly decent rifles would be extremely weak. Just like how Thompson submachine gun could still be used now, almost all new rifles could definitely outmatch its performance.</br>
</br>
The 150 Reapers Assault Rifles that Jiang Chen brought from the Fishbone Base, whether its stability, penetration, and accuracy, it outshined all modern firearms. After all, there was a fundamental difference between the structure of warfare in the future and the present.</br>
</br>
Even light infantries wore nano combat suist as well as kinetic skeletons. Not to mention the heavy infantries that were fully equipped with power armors. If the rifle penetration was low, it would be difficult to even penetrate the enemy's armor. Since this was a NATO standard Reaper assault rifle, its penetration capability was naturally unequivocal. Although it was normal in the future with highly advanced science, it was ridiculous in the modern world where it could easily penetrate through steel or concrete.</br>
</br>
Logically speaking, the higher the explosive power, the more recoil the solider would receive, but because of the special design of firearms, the recoil was significantly reduced.</br>
</br>
Furthermore, because of its compact internal design, needless to say, the accuracy was superb.</br>
</br>
The only problem was the ammunition. Because they couldn't use a modern ammunition without a secure base, Jiang Chen did not dare to move the bullet production line, so he could only carry the ammunition himself.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the trade between the Fishbone Base and the Sixth Street had just been finalized, and the additional batch of ammunition he purchased had arrived just in time. He shipped six months worth of training ammunition to the armory which temporarily solved the problem.</br>
</br>
Other than rifles, with the development in the apocalypse side, Jiang Chen would continuously transport even more ridiculously incredible equipment to this world.</br>
</br>
Such as kinetic skeletons, heat sensor grenade...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen entrusted all responsibility of training to Ivan. The veteran was well-respected among his peers, and so he was more at ease in leaving him with the day-to-day operation of the base.</br>
</br>
As for logistics, it was also easy to solve.</br>
</br>
According to Robert's suggestion, he set up an office for the Future Security in Niamey and hired local experts to handle the problem. The only thing he needed to worry about was to provide the operating cash flow to the company's account, and the daily expenses, salary, and logistics, and other aspects of affairs would be coordinated by the office.</br>
</br>
At the end of each month, there would be a detailed bill sent to his email.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After spending two days traveling between the base and Niamey, Jiang Chen finally settled everything on this side.</br>
</br>
The manager of Future Security was a man called Barkley whom he found in the talent market in Niger. Despite being only 35 years old, he already had 15 years of relevant work experience. He looked stable and trustworthy.</br>
</br>
The labor cost in Niger was very meager, $400 USD monthly salary was already considered high in the local market. Towards such generous paycheck, the black guy was ecstatic as he promised to take care of everything with perfection.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased with his eagerness because it meant he could worry less about it.</br>
</br>
With the base starting to operate on the right track, it was finally time to go home.</br>
</br>
When they headed to the airport, they took Niger Ministry of Commerce vehicle. As a good host, the Minister of Commerce Amani personally sent them to the airport.</br>
</br>
"We hope you come back soon, Mr. Jiang. You will always be Niger's friend." Armani shook hands with him enthusiastically with a bright smile on his face.</br>
</br>
$2 million worth of investment to build a road from the national highway to the undeveloped area. He had gained a lot from this friend of his from the East, and so he was naturally very enthusiastic.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I wish our friendship will last through eternity. Thank you for your warm hospitality. Farewell." Jiang Chen released his hand and then led Robert, Nick, and Ayesha into the airport.</br>
</br>
After passing through security, Robert heaved a sigh of relief and rolled his eyes.</br>
</br>
"I can finally leave this goddamn place. Heck, when I get back, the first thing I'll do is to take a nice, long shower and then go to the hospital to get a gastric suction."</br>
</br>
"Then spread your seeds to some Hollywood chicks?" Jiang Chen teased.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, of course, nightlife is necessary to relieve some stress at work, you know. The next time you come to Los Santos, I'll take you to experience it." Robert chuckled. "What about you? What are you planning to do when you get back?"</br>
</br>
"Shower, sleep and then rest for a few days." Jiang Chen shrugged and sat on the chair in the waiting room. Ayesha sat right beside him, eyes looking everywhere. However, much to her disappointment, unlike the airport in Veit, there was no magazine to pass her time on.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so boring, you have to learn to enjoy life properly." Robert sat on the opposite side of Jiang Chen, crossed his legs, and leaned comfortably against the seat. "Then what's the use of making so much money?"</br>
</br>
Nick scanned the lobby of the waiting room and then headed for the coffee machine.</br>
</br>
"Haha, how do you know I didn't enjoy myself? Let me tell you, when I made my first money, the first thing I did was to spend it lavishly," Jiang Chen said proudly, not in the least bit ashamed.</br>
</br>
"Oh? I didn't expect this...Haha! By the way, buddy, I've got a fun idea. Why don't we share what we did with our first money?" Robert was suddenly interested and sat up straight.</br>
</br>
Meanwhile, Nick came over with a coffee and sat down next to Robert.</br>
</br>
"We'll get Nick to go first." Robert patted Nick on the shoulder while laughing.</br>
</br>
Nick took a sip and looked at Robert with confusion. After hearing the explanation, the taciturn Slavic man gave the most ordinary statement.</br>
</br>
"Bought a house in Los Santos and then got a dog." As far as UA citizen's lifestyle was concerned, his couldn't be any more average.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I take back what I said, Nick is the most boring person." He ignored Nick's confused look and then coughed and continued, "My turn...I remember it was five years ago, I was still helping a Mexican smuggled illegal firearms. On the day of payout, he gave me $50 thousand, and the first thing I did was..."</br>
</br>
At this point, Robert's face went red out of nowhere, scratched his nose, as he was too embarrassed to continue.</br>
</br>
"Ahem. Uh, I found two 16 years old high school students at the bar... In short, I got rid of my...virginity." Robert had completely abandoned his sense of shame. He then looked at Jiang Chen, "Ok, buddy, your turn."</br>
</br>
[This old pervert.] Jiang Chen laughingly thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
"The first sum of money..." He wanted to say what happened in Sanya but suddenly halted as he awkwardly looked at Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Uh, he seemed to be somewhat similar to Robert, the old pervert. After making money, the first thing he did was go to Sanya and got himself a lover.</br>
</br>
Sensing Jiang Chen's gaze, Ayesha looked back at him puzzled.</br>
</br>
However, her pure expression made it even harder for Jiang Chen to open his mouth.</br>
</br>
Robert smirked and then whispered, "I understand, we're all men here."</br>
</br>
"No, wait, my situation is a little different from yours."[In any case, saying it's his first...]</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, no need to explain, I understand."</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, what do you know!]</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 157: I'll teach you fitness?</br>
</div></br>
This past couple of days, Jiang Chen was very idle.</br>
</br>
The first step of the island capture project had been completed, and Sixth Street had also been stabilized.</br>
</br>
Out of nowhere, he suddenly found himself free.</br>
</br>
He walked out from the bedroom, yawning. After a brief wash, he went to the kitchen and sat across Ayesha while stretching.</br>
</br>
"Did you stay up late again?" Ayesha asked with concern.</br>
</br>
"Uh, played a bit too late last night." Jiang Chen reached out and grabbed a slice of toast.</br>
</br>
Coffee, toast, and omelet for breakfast, Ayesha's cooking was getting better...While munching, he reached out and turned on the TV.</br>
</br>
"Don't sleep too late," Ayesha reminded softly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." He took a sip of coffee, and the bitterness made his brain sober.</br>
</br>
The widescreen TV was playing the news.</br>
</br>
"Yesterday noon, a crossfire occurred in the northern suburbs of Oesk, Kane, the largest one since the turn of the year. The civilian forces used cannons, self-propelled artillery, and other heavy weapons against the government-controlled area. Currently, Minsk Agreement is in name only. On the other hand, UA accused Russia of deploying artillery on the border...</br>
</br>
Watching blankly at the artillery bombardment on the news screen, Jiang Chen took a bite of the toast,</br>
</br>
"Did they start fighting again?"</br>
</br>
Truth be told, seeing the cannon homing on the screen could not be compared to the astonishment of seeing it in the frontline.</br>
</br>
Ayesha appeared to be indifferent towards these things and was concentrating on her breakfast.</br>
</br>
"I'm going rusty these days," Jiang Chen complained out of boredom.</br>
</br>
Ayesha put the omelet on the toast, blew a few times, before taking a huge bite.</br>
</br>
After hearing how Jiang Chen felt, she hesitated a little before suggesting, "How about I teach you a good workout?"</br>
</br>
Workout?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stupefied.</br>
</br>
"Eh? I've taken the injection, so even without exercise, I can still maintain my body in tiptop condition."</br>
</br>
He simply had to praise the beauty of science and technology.</br>
</br>
"Um, in addition to physical fitness, there are still other benefits to exercise such as maintaining your figure and keeping your body flexible," Ayesha muttered.</br>
</br>
"Figure... Umm, speaking of this, I still haven't touched the fitness equipment that we bought. It's always you who have been using it." Jiang Chen scratched his chin thoughtfully and suddenly clapped. "Then it's decided, later you can teach me to exercise."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Ayesha smiled tenderly and nodded.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Shortly after breakfast.</br>
</br>
The two stood face-to-face on the yoga mat. Ayesha had already changed into a workout outfit of a small black top, her brown color was tied into a ponytail.</br>
</br>
Looking lively and enticing.</br>
</br>
Curves outlined by tight clothes, bumps faintly visible...</br>
</br>
</br>
Uh, guess it would be troublesome if he continued to stare.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen subtly moved his line of sight.</br>
</br>
A dazzling selection of fitness equipment comparable to those of outside gyms was located on the third floor of the home gym. At the corner, a virtual reality training chamber could be seen, and before entering the password, it looked like an oddly-shaped, covered bathtub.</br>
</br>
"Fitness is divided into two kinds, one is aerobic exercise such as treadmills and bicycles. The other is non-aerobic exercise such as sit-ups and weightlifting." Without noticing the strange look from Jiang Chen, Ayesha went to the next exercise equipment and started explaining earnestly.</br>
</br>
When it came to exercise, she was naturally quite experienced. After all, she spent almost all her days in the gym. If it was not completing her daily "homework" in the virtual reality, it was using this equipment to exercise her body.</br>
</br>
After listening to Ayesha explained the key concepts, the next step, of course, was the practical application.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen twisted his neck, as he eagerly stepped on the treadmill and started it under Ayesha's guidance.</br>
</br>
&lt;Speed: 10&gt;</br>
</br>
[Um, I don't seem to be feeling anything.]</br>
</br>
According to the value on the EP, his muscle strength was already at 30, his reflex was nearing 29, and thus this type of exercise was indeed too simple for him.</br>
</br>
Impatiently, he pressed the plus sign button making the speed increased until it finally stopped at the limit of 30.</br>
</br>
His feet were practically dancing, but he still didn't feel an iota of pressure.</br>
</br>
"There's no point in running so fast," Ayesha smiled wryly.</br>
</br>
"Why do I feel that this treadmill is pretty much useless to me?" Jiang Chen had a similar wry smile and pressed the minus button until the treadmill came to a slow stop.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen got off from the treadmill, Ayesha took over. She took a deep breath and pressed the start button.</br>
</br>
&lt;Speed: 5&gt;</br>
</br>
"Although the injection of that weird medicine improved a lot of aspects of your body quite significantly, daily exercising to maintain your health is still important. Not so fast, jogging should suffice. This helps tone the body and keeps the body flexible..."</br>
</br>
While jogging in constant speed, Ayesha was explaining it to Jiang Chen simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Flexibility? Body coordination? Jiang Chen nodded thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
But when he thought about body shapes...</br>
</br>
For some reason, the first thing that came into his head was the sexy vest line of her waist.</br>
</br>
And looking at her shoulders and arms moving rhythmically along with the jiggling of her firm and small breasts...</br>
</br>
Not good! Nosebleed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen embarrassedly covered his nose and quickly looked away.</br>
</br>
A good thing that nothing came out of his nose.</br>
</br>
Ayesha gave him a puzzled look. Done with her demonstration, she turned off the treadmill and jumped off.</br>
</br>
"Now for the non-aerobic exercise. Um, where should we begin...Ah! Let's start with that." Looking around, her eyes lit up when she spotted the elliptical trainer near the door.</br>
</br>
An odd-looking equipment connected to all four sides, which Jiang Chen had seen before in the university gym. Put simply, by sitting there, you can perform pull-ups, core exercise, parallel bars and other series of complex exercise.</br>
</br>
"I rarely use this because it will easily build up muscles, but it's suitable for guys." Ayesha sat on top of it and smiled softly at Jiang Chen. "I'm going to demonstrate for you."</br>
</br>
She adjusted the weight to 20 kg, took a deep breath, and extended both of her arms up high while holding the bar.</br>
</br>
Too much power.</br>
</br>
A weight of this level was naturally very easy for someone like her with a genetic vaccine, but even so...</br>
</br>
Due to the tension made from the exertion of her arms, the round softness on her chest looked like it was about to pop out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen unconsciously swallowed his saliva.</br>
</br>
Although he knew it was bad to gawk at certain parts of a girl, still he was unable to move his gaze away.</br>
</br>
However, this wasn't the most troublesome thing.</br>
</br>
Having finished with the stretching exercises of her upper and lower muscles, Ayesha, who remained oblivious to his gaze, put her arms against the pad of the butterfly clips and then both of her arms snapped towards her chest.</br>
</br>
Because of the pressure, the soft protrusion was squeezed under the force of her arms.</br>
</br>
Worse still, because of the aerobic exercise, Ayesha's forehead was sweating profusely. The small top was becoming more transparent as it got stuck on her skin.</br>
</br>
"What's the problem?" Ayesha looked perplexedly at Jiang Chen who was covering his nose.</br>
</br>
"Uh, nothing, my nose is just a little bit itchy. Ha ha ha." Jiang Chen laughed dryly.</br>
</br>
He did not want to admit that he was thinking of naughty things while she was teaching so earnestly.</br>
</br>
While still confused, Ayesha didn't pursue the subject. She pressed her legs against the pad, ready to demonstrate the next set of moves.</br>
</br>
However, at this time, she accidentally saw something she shouldn't have seen.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen was also wearing workout clothes, the design of the sports pants was rather loose.</br>
</br>
That tent-shaped bulge...</br>
</br>
Ayesha's cold face turned crimson, she ducked her head down shyly, fingers rubbing absentmindedly against the training equipment.</br>
</br>
"Do, do you want to?" she uttered in a quivering voice.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, it was Jiang Chen's turn to blush.</br>
</br>
His conscience told him that he should refuse this time to show his integrity and solve this "misunderstanding".</br>
</br>
"Yes," He nodded without thinking.</br>
</br>
Although his thought was very praiseworthy, his mouth and body, on the other hand, were both very honest.</br>
</br>
"Umm, then let's go to..."</br>
</br>
"Here is good!"</br>
</br>
"Eh?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It's already lunchtime when they left the gym.</br>
</br>
Seeing the time on the EP, Jiang Chen could not help but smile wryly.</br>
</br>
Now with Ayesha feeling disoriented, she definitely would not be able to cook anymore.</br>
</br>
What a blunder.</br>
</br>
He shook his head and went into the kitchen.</br>
</br>
He turned on the rice cooker, poured half a cup of rice into it, and mixed it with water.</br>
</br>
Putting on the apron, he took a spatula and cooked the scrambled eggs with tomato, which he hadn't cooked for a long time, and then he made a cucumber soup.</br>
</br>
This was the limit of his cooking, as he certainly didn't know how to cook lamb and beef.</br>
</br>
But this should be alright for today.</br>
</br>
He brought the dishes on the table while humming. He then returned to the kitchen and removed the dough from the fridge.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was still not used to eating rice. It was usually Jiang Chen who ate rice, and she with her bread.</br>
</br>
He stuck the dough into the microwave, patted his hand, and pressed the start button.</br>
</br>
Watching the golden bread spinning in the microwave, he narcissistically touched his chin while nodding.</br>
</br>
[Why am I so talented? Capable of doing business and capable of cooking...wait! This shouldn't be how a man is described!]</br>
</br>
Just then, he suddenly felt a soft touch behind him. A small hand came around him from behind and embraced him.</br>
</br>
"Hmm? Ahem, sorry, I've been too rough. Are you feeling better?" Jiang Chen said as he turned around and scratched his head awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm...thank you."</br>
</br>
"Thank you? Eh? Wait, what are you crying for?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha's face was tightly pressed against his warm back, she didn't respond and only rubbed the corner of her eyes against his clothes.</br>
</br>
Just ten minutes ago, she slowly recovered from her woozy state.</br>
</br>
When she realized it was already lunchtime, as a "competent wife", which she'd always strictly told herself to be, she immediately got up, leaned on the wall for support, and dragged her body to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
When she saw the dishes on the table, for some reason, she felt her eyes tearing up.</br>
</br>
She gently moved to the kitchen door and saw the hot bread that Jiang Chen made for her.</br>
</br>
She stepped forward and embraced him, her face pressing tightly against the warm and strong back, and her delicate eyelashes closing.</br>
</br>
"Uh, sorry for hurting you, in the future—"</br>
</br>
"No, this is good." Ayesha murmured happily.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After lunch, Ayesha returned to the gym saying she was going to clean the place. After all, she had been injected with a genetic vaccine, and thus she was almost completely recovered at the moment.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was sitting on the sofa while watching TV to pass the time. Yawning, he was about to get up and go back for a nap when his mobile phone suddenly rang.</br>
</br>
He took out his mobile phone and read: Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
He pressed the answer button and lazily put the phone to his ear.</br>
</br>
"Hello? What’s up?"</br>
</br>
"Mhm, I have something to tell you. It’s about a game," Xia Shiyu’s excited voice came through which made Jiang Chen extremely surprised.</br>
</br>
"I guess it's a good news." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"That’s right," Xia Shiyu leaned backed against the office chair with a rare proud smile appearing on her face. "After a period of marketing and beta testing, our company’s first mobile game 'New Era' is now officially live! According to the recent daily statistics that had just been released, its first day of downloads exceeded 15-million mark, setting a record for highest downloads for mobile games!"</br>
</br>
After practicing in front of the mirror numerous times, when Xia Shiyu finally shared the good news with the boss, her voice still went off-key due to extreme excitement.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k!" The news practically made Jiang Chen jumped up from the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, no cursing please," Xia Shiyu admonished lightly before continuing, "According to the server's data, the highest number of concurrent users broke through 5 million…it’s better for you to come to the company this afternoon, so I can show you the back end stats directly."</br>
</br>
"I’ll be there right away." After saying that, Jiang Chen hung up the phone and was immediately out the door.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Wanghai University, men's dormitory.</br>
</br>
A guy with a pair of glasses was staring at the screen of his mobile phone, his fingers moving swiftly on the touchscreen. His spectacles reflected the fighting scene of a roleplaying game character.</br>
</br>
"Four eyes, what are you playing? Or are you watching porn?" Tian Zhongjie, his bunkmate, moved his chair closer and stretched his neck to take a peek at his screen.</br>
</br>
Tian Zhongjie had just finished playing 'League of Legends' and had almost smashed his keyboards because of those noobs. He was so angry that he didn’t want to play anymore. After 20 losses, he closed the game directly, and then opened the file, and uninstalled the game.</br>
</br>
This was his tenth time of uninstalling this game.</br>
</br>
Most online games were either filled with RMB players (1) or filled with cheats. Although a lot of noobs played 'LOL', the quality of the game itself was still quite good. At least, the RMB skins wouldn't increase the user's attack damage. Thus, after his anger had abated, he would find himself unable to stop from downloading the game again. Despite that, every time he finished uninstalling, he would swear that he would chop his hand off if he ever installed it again.</br>
</br>
</br>
Chen Hong cast his friend a sidelong glance before returning his gaze back to the screen and then controlled his character to the direction of the main city.</br>
</br>
"What are you being so mysterious about?" Tian Zhongjie had just AFKed, so he had nothing better to do. He then got up and stood behind him.</br>
</br>
Chen Hong ignored him and continued to stare intently at the screen.</br>
</br>
Just then, the dormitory door opened and Gao Fei, who had just finished playing basketball, walked in.</br>
</br>
"Yo, four eyes, didn’t you say that only dumbass play mobile game? Then why are you playing it?" Gao Fei quipped. He curiously stood behind Chen Long trying to see what he was playing.</br>
</br>
"What, no way! Is this truly a mobile game?"</br>
</br>
As a result, Gao Fei was also unable to peel his eyes off the screen either.</br>
</br>
The texture of the image, the detailed character design, as well as the spectacular gameplay, those 3D mobile games are nothing compared to this! No, not just mobile games, even 'Skyrim' on his desktop couldn't compare to this game!</br>
</br>
"That’s right, this is not a mobile game, and that's why I'm playing it," Chen Hongteng pushed his eyeglasses up and scowled at the completely stunned Tian Hongjie.</br>
</br>
Gao Fei gulped and jeered, "The graphics is so good, the game content must be meh."</br>
</br>
Chen Hong glanced at him before continuing, "Open world and 2:1 continental-scale map. It combined the adventure element of an RPG and the management element of an SLG. Player can choose to roleplay as an adventurer or become a lord managing a piece of land. You can also open a business and become a merchant to fight pirates in the sea. Whether it's the graphics or the content, even if it's compared to PC games, it's a 3A godly masterpiece" Chen Hong said with absolute certainty. Although he had always been extremely critical when it came to games, he had yet to find any flaws in 'New Era'.</br>
</br>
"Could your crappy phone even handle a map with a size of two continents?" Tian Zhongjie's jaw was about to drop to the ground, he felt like his 'LOL' addiction was still not beyond redemption!</br>
</br>
"The game is only 300 MB."</br>
</br>
"300 MB, you're pulling my leg!" Gao Fei uttered in complete disbelief.</br>
</br>
"The company stated that they used the newest data compression technology as well as cloud computing technology...Anyway, I don't understand any of that stuff, I only can care about playing. O For a day, I consumed 10 MB of data, so it's not very high."</br>
</br>
Chen Hong killed another monster and deftly picked up the loot of silver coins and equipment and then locked onto the next one.</br>
</br>
"I can see that you have been killing monsters for a while now, don't you find that boring?" Tian Zhongjie noticed that he had only been killing monsters after watching him play for a long time. Sure, the fighting scene and graphics were great, but wouldn't it be too boring to be hacking monsters constantly?</br>
</br>
"Would you still feel bored if there's money involved?" Chen Hong responded to him as though he was talking to an idiot.</br>
</br>
"Money?"</br>
</br>
"RMB, you know that, don't you?" he added, sighing.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k, the in-game currency can be exchanged for RMB?" Gao Fei asked in disbelief, his eyes almost popping out.</br>
</br>
"The game operator doesn't exchange gold coins, but they offer a platform similar to 'Diablo 3's' auction house. Players are free to price and sell gold coins on a consignment basis. This system is somewhat similar to the stock price, where the lower price is given preference. The game operator will only collect 5% commission fee, and they only take 10% commission for the equipment auction."</br>
</br>
While speaking, Chen Hong's eyes were burning with passion like crazy.</br>
</br>
"During beta testing, Future 1.0 distributed a high amount of activation code to VIP members. There's quite a number of wealthy players playing this game according to the official data collected during the beta phase."</br>
</br>
"That's to say, there is a high probability that RMB players would beat your sorry ass." Gao Fei said in derision.</br>
</br>
"That's how an average person would think." Chen Hong cast him a haughty look. "'New Era' didn't create an item mall. The purchased points can only be used to expand the warehouse or purchase skins that don't affect the balance of the game."</br>
</br>
"In other words, it's s similar to LOL's store?" Tian Zhongjie's eyes lit up, and he suddenly felt an urge to download and play the game.</br>
</br>
Chen Hong ignored his friend's question and muttered, "Do you remember what I said before? There are many ways to play this game. You can be an adventurer, a lord and so on."</br>
</br>
"Does it has anything to do with those RMB players?" Gao Fei asked, frowning.</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Chen Hong's eyes were practically indistinguishable from gold coins. He licked his cracked lips before continuing, "The condition to become a lord is one has to buy a city lease for 100,000 gold coins and then get the city qualification. Imagine if you were a rich player, would you rather hunt monsters like what I'm doing, or would you rather become the lord of a city with countless followers?"</br>
</br>
"That's nonsense!" Gao Fei scoffed, but he seemed to have suddenly thought of something as his eyes widened, "Wait, if the city lease costs 100,000 gold, the auction house..."</br>
</br>
"That's right, if you play the game normally, it would be impossible to obtain 100,000 gold coins in such a short amount time. Killing a single boar would only drop 2 silver coins and killing 50 would barely give you 1 gold coin. So to become a lord, the only way to acquire gold coins is through the auction house!"</br>
</br>
"But would there be that many people willing to buy a city lease?" Tian Zhongjie asked.</br>
</br>
"Let me give you a straightforward data. At present, the price of a single gold coin in the auction house is set to 5 RMB. So for every 10 boars I kill, I would make 1 RMB." The more Chen Hong talked, the more motivated he became.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k, a land lease will cost half a million RMB? That is insane!" Gao Fei uttered in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"You noob, there are rich people who are not afraid to squander 1 million while playing 'Plants vs. Zombies'. Don't you know building a territory is similar to "farming"? Moreover, through taxation, production of materials and other ways to earn money, would you still be worried about not making a return?"</br>
</br>
"I'll tell you a rumor that I heard from one of my friends. Have you heard about Blood Sea guild of 'Sword 4'? Because of the popularity of 'New Era', they are planning to switch to this game. They are also currently raising funds in preparation for something big. Not only wealthy people, a lot of game workshops are also eyeing this city lease, so you can just imagine the future of this game."</br>
</br>
"Isn't 'Sword 4' a PC game?" Tian Zhongjie could not help but ask out loud.</br>
</br>
"If the mobile game is more fun than PC game, would you rather play a PC or a mobile game? The future belongs to the mobile platform!" Chen Hong himself was becoming passionate about the future.</br>
</br>
"Not only that, it can also be said that city building is the biggest feature of the game. The sandbox-like settings would allow the players to design their city based on their own preference. The city can be built anywhere from a certain distance from another city. And depending on the terrain and the map itself, the established city will receive a corresponding reward that would allow recruitment of special NPCs to attract other solo players.</br>
</br>
"Do you know what this means? This means the earlier the city is established, the higher your advantage will be! You can get mines that produce iron ore, coastal areas fit for ships to dock, as well as unique NPCs roaming on the map...All major guilds are buying gold coins in order to seize those good spots!</br>
</br>
"My plan right now is to kill monsters to gain gold coins and then sell the gold for money. Once I leveled up, I will explore the deeper parts of the continents. It'll be great if I can trigger some hidden mission. That would be really crazy!" An ambitious expression appeared on Chen Hong's face.</br>
</br>
"But wouldn't the value of gold depreciate after a while if everyone purchased the city lease?" Gao Fei asked anxiously.</br>
</br>
The reason why he was asking was because he suddenly had the idea of making money from the game. Just killing ten monsters would earn him 1 RMB. This was something really enticing for someone who doesn't have much pocket money.</br>
</br>
"You're overthinking it. Wouldn't you need to build establishments after building a city? Wall, city hall, residential buildings, farm, ect., all of which cost money. In addition to city lords, there are sea explorers! Although putting up a shop would not cost 100,000 gold, a small shop would at least be 500. As for the mega vessel, it costs 1,000 gold and above."</br>
</br>
The auction house wouldn't interfere with game content, and the difference between the demand for gold and RMB would prompt frequent trading between the players. As long as the operator continued to push new game contents which would prevent the value of gold from depreciating, the game would continue to survive.</br>
</br>
Considering the impeccable game quality, the number of users, as well as the continued growth of Future 1.0...</br>
</br>
Gao Fei's eyes turned brighter and brighter the more he thought about it.</br>
</br>
"Four eyes, I have an idea. Why don't we, of dorm 101, start a game workshop..."</br>
</br>
(1) RMB players: the equivalent of pay to win players.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 159: The Trap</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Whenever Lingyu Technology's name cropped up, most mobile games fanatics would automatically think of games with unique designs and outstanding gameplay, such as 'I am ATM' and 'Dota History'.</br>
</br>
Inside the Lingyu Technology building in Wanghai City, Ling Zhongtian was sitting in front of the office table with a dark face as he silently looked at the information on his table. The manager responsible for mobile game development, Qian Haiming, had his head lowered while sweating profusely and waiting for the boss' reprimand.</br>
</br>
After a long while, Ling Zhongtian finally spoke.</br>
</br>
"In one month, 'Dota History's' ACU dropped by 10% and KPI indices decreased by 17%...This is the goose that lays a golden egg you're telling me about? And what about 'I am ATM'? What's your team doing for the past month?" His voice was trembling due to rage.</br>
</br>
ACU referred to the average concurrent users, while KPI referred to key performance indicators. The first was related to the sustainability of the game, while the latter was related to the game's profitability. At this moment, however, in front of him was a report that showed the stats of their two most profitable mobile games were in great decline.</br>
</br>
[It was still fu*king okay last month!]</br>
</br>
BANG! Ling Zhongtian threw the document in his hands on the table with great force, his lungs were on the verge of exploding due to anger.</br>
</br>
The scolded Qian Haiming had a face of being greatly wronged. It was really not his fault.</br>
</br>
Swallowing, he tried to organize his sentence in his head before explaining quietly to his boss, "Boss, this really cannot be blamed on us."</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Ling Zhongtian picked up the cup on the table to take a sip of tea, and gradually calmed the anger in his chest.</br>
</br>
"It's that 'New Era', right?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Qian Haiming felt secretly relieved that the boss understood the situation, but the atmosphere remained tense as ever.</br>
</br>
These two games of the company were very profitable, and 'Dota History' had a record of a staggering cash flow of 200 million per month. Although the result was somewhat watered down, it was not far off from the truth.</br>
</br>
The issue had to do with 'Dota History', despite running for over a year, had nothing new to offer. Unlike PC games, mobile games' real-time interactive capability was already very limited; thus, it was destined to severely limit the player's likelihood to stick to the game through social interaction. It could be said that when mobile game players quit the game, the reluctance to part with the game would be mainly due to the equipment and diamonds and not because of their good friends in the game.</br>
</br>
After last year's success, the active users of 'Dota History' had been gradually decreasing. However, Qian Haiming had still a bit of skill, as he led the entire project team to devise numerous unique events which allow the KPI to barely hit the mark.</br>
</br>
</br>
But who would have thought that a highly competitive game would take the market by storm and took a huge piece of the pie away?</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian fell into a deep contemplation while looking at the report on the table.</br>
</br>
As the president of a corporation, he obviously would not be clueless about the existence of the most promising mobile game in the market.</br>
</br>
The game's massive content made it difficult for players to get bored due to repetitive gameplay.</br>
</br>
It also offered real-time interaction comparable to that of PC games which meant that when players play the game, it really felt like an online game rather than playing just with a single list of friends.</br>
</br>
And more importantly, how come it didn't consume a lot of data?</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian was so jealous that he wanted to spew forth profanity, or perhaps he had already cursed in his mind.</br>
</br>
The three points above were the major limitations of today's mobile game development. All major game developers that wanted their share of the market were racking their brains to come up with the best possible solutions to overcome these three major hurdles.</br>
</br>
Too much game content? If users saw a game with a few gigabytes, they would be too lazy to download it. High hardware specs? This would cause lag and make the phone hot. High data usage? This might make telecom companies happy, but this would definitely enrage the users; thus, the game would naturally be unable to survive.</br>
</br>
How to use software packers to include more game contents that most of the mobile phones would be able to run, and would not consume too much data. This has always been a great source of concern in the industry.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, came a software which realized the inspiration of many programmers.</br>
</br>
It was Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
By simplifying the algorithm, the performance of mobile phones was increased by three times, and energy consumption was reduced twice as much. This would undoubtedly enable them to recapture the ideas that had been cut off before.</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian was indeed a man with foresight. When he saw the download record of Future 1.0 continually being refreshed, he immediately issued instructions to Qian Haiming to gather people from project development team to develop high specs "large-scale mobile game".</br>
</br>
The idea was undoubtedly insane.</br>
</br>
At present, there was not a single mobile game that could meet the standard of the so-called "large-scale mobile game" in the market despite every developers' bluff and bluster. To deploy a large amount of technical resource to venture into an entirely unknown market was unquestionably a huge gamble.</br>
</br>
The reason for making such decision was because he was able to foresee the change in the future of the development of mobile games.</br>
</br>
Given how Future 1.0 had turned out, the future would have high-quality games with high resolution and rich, diverse game contents that could compete with PC games to fill the gaps in the current market. PC and console games would continually be pushed out of the market, and the mobile game industry would only going to get bigger. The only thing he needed to consider was how to gain the upper hand and acquire a bigger slice of this pie.</br>
</br>
However, his ambition was already deflated before it was realized.</br>
</br>
Turned out that Future 1.0 had a far greater ambition.</br>
</br>
Before they gained a foothold in the market, they quickly launched an independent game and ventured into the mobile game market.</br>
</br>
'New Era'?</br>
</br>
In the beginning, Ling Zhongtian had not given their promotion of: "open game world", "sandbox game map", "the strongest freedom in history" much thought yet...</br>
</br>
Who didn't know how to brag? Which developers did not vaunt their own game? Not just the players, even their own marketing staff didn't believe in the marketing.</br>
</br>
But when the game went online, Ling Zhongtian's expression instantly turned green with envy.</br>
</br>
He heard a lot of empty promises before, but it was his first time seeing all the promises got fulfilled.</br>
</br>
Its unbelievable game quality set a whole new record in terms of gameplay. With the support of the Future 1.0's user base, 'New Era' took the market by storm with no less than the impact that Future 1.0 produced and once again become a hot topic of the media. Future 1.0 made headlines again.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, 'New Era' had seized the initiative and took the lead in this market, which he had such high hopes for.</br>
</br>
"How are things going on your end?" Ling Zhongtian no longer reprimanded Qian Haiming, and instead asked about the "large-scale mobile game" that was currently under development.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Qian Haiming looked inconceivably bitter.</br>
</br>
"It is almost developed and currently in alpha phase, but compared to 'New Era'..."</br>
</br>
As the project manager, no one knew better than him the product his own team was developing.</br>
</br>
If the quality was almost comparable, he would at least try to boost his own project by a bit to let the boss see they really tried and achieved some results, however, after personally playing 'New Era' for a few hours...</br>
</br>
Mhmm, he went on playing for a while, and it was undoubtedly fun that he couldn't help but expand the warehouse.</br>
</br>
They had completely lost.</br>
</br>
"INo hard, just do everything you can to utilize your ability and creativity. Try a bit harder in the operations," Ling Zhongtian advised exhaustedly as he rubbed his temples.</br>
</br>
"Yes, boss." Qian Haiming nodded and quickly left the office.</br>
</br>
Elbows on the table, Ling Zhongtian stared at the report blankly.</br>
</br>
He's already 50 years old, and regardless how tough his body was, his temple already had a white streak on it. After being in business for so many years and starting with only a handful people in a 10-sqm studio to gradually becoming the industry leader in the mobile game development, it was his first time experiencing such troublesome issue.</br>
</br>
What made it troublesome was not the game itself, rather the chain reactions that came with it.</br>
</br>
The mobile game industry was huge, too big to imagine, so no matter how voracious the appetite of the Future Technology was, it would be impossible to completely dominate the industry. In most users' phone, it would be impossible not to have more than one game. Thus, even if they lost the "large-scale" game market, Lingyu Technology still maintained a strong market share within the industry.</br>
</br>
However, with the emergence of this large-scale mobile game, users' spending habits would undoubtedly have a huge impact. Lingyu Technology's continuous profit decline during this period was a clear indicator of this problem.</br>
</br>
Similar to the analogy that if you have an excellent game on your phone, would you still pay for a game like Tetris? Even if you did, it probably wouldn't be much.</br>
</br>
The mobile industry had been divided for the longest time where everyone had similar games comparable to one other, and not one company had been able to monopolize the market.</br>
</br>
However, that was before that game was launched.</br>
</br>
'New Era' quickly gathered all players who were already bored with monotonous mobile games in the market. It revolutionized the perspective of users about the mobile games having "monotonous content" and "poor real-time interactive capability".</br>
</br>
[Since the inception of this game, their days began to become difficult. and from the looks of it, it's not only Lingyu Technology's that got the short end of the stick...] while Ling Zhongtian mulled this over, he lightly tapping on the table with his finger.</br>
</br>
[Perhaps it's high time to give this "rookie" a lecture?]</br>
</br>
While thinking of this, Ling Zhongtian grimaced. He picked up the phone and called his old rival.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Wang Zong. Haha, how have you been?"</br>
</br>
"Ok, enough chitchat. It's been a tough day for everyone. Don't you think we should do something..."</br>
</br>
Shifting the public opinion, providing funds for development of hacks, exploiting 'New Era's' vulnerabilities, hiring hackers to attack the server...</br>
</br>
There were still many things they could do to preserve their interests.</br>
</br>
Just be careful not to get caught in the act.</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian hung up the phone, his mouth curved in a sneer.</br>
</br>
[Regardless how powerful Future Technology is, how would they be able to ward off attacks from all sides?]</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 160: What's a National Husband?</br>
</div></br>
Driving to Guanglu Building, Jiang Chen closed the door and narcissistically looked in the car mirror before striding towards the front door.</br>
</br>
He was slightly embarrassed—as the president, he was fairly certain that he came to the company not more than ten times.</br>
</br>
Most of the companies that chose Guanglu as their office space dealt with information technology, similar to Future Technology. The commonality between them all was that their lunch breaks were really short. It was only 1:30, but there was nobody to be seen in the lobby. Just as he was about to take the elevator up, he heard his name.</br>
</br>
"It's Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, seems like it is him...."</br>
</br>
Hearing the gossipy discussions, Jiang Chen dumbfoundedly looked over at the lobby reception.</br>
</br>
Two female receptionists whispered to each other as they giggled. When they noticed Jiang Chen looking over at them, they didn't stop but rather waved at him.</br>
</br>
"Hey, Yingying, he looked over."</br>
</br>
"Wait, let me send a Weibo!"</br>
</br>
Weird.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered to himself as he got on the elevator.</br>
</br>
When the elevator stopped on the twelfth floor, a proud smile surfaced on his face as the words &lt;Future Technology&gt; came into view.</br>
</br>
Three months ago, Future Technology existed only in Xia Shiyu's word document, but now it had already grown to this scale.</br>
</br>
He made a beeline towards Xia Shiyu's office.</br>
</br>
Sitting behind the front desk was a beautiful girl. Jiang Chen didn't recognize her; she was most likely one of the new hires. As for the previous two receptionists, they must have been transferred to other departments.</br>
</br>
Compared to when the company just started, the number of employees had already doubled. Considering the company's new project team, Xia Shiyu went ahead and rented the thirteenth floor to be used by the &lt;New Era&gt; team.</br>
</br>
When the beauty sitting at the front desk saw Jiang Chen, her eyes immediately lit up as she greeted him with a cheerful smile.</br>
</br>
"Hello, President! Welcome!"</br>
</br>
"What welcome," Jiang Chen casually said as he laughed and greeted her. Afterwards, he asked, puzzled, "You're new here, right? How did you know that I'm the president?"</br>
</br>
On the left of her chest was a name tag that read "Su Mengqi."</br>
</br>
"President, don't you know that you're extremely popular right now?" With both elbows on the table, Su Mengqi smiled.</br>
</br>
Her voice had a unique tone that made others feel peaceful. Xia Shiyu indeed had an eye for choosing people. With a talent like this, after some training, she'd be great in the sales department.</br>
</br>
"Popular?" Jiang Chen looked lost for a moment. While he knew he was considered a public figure, he didn't think he was popular.</br>
</br>
When he came out of the airport a few days ago, he didn't see any cameras pointed at him.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Haha, when is the last time President went online? Oh, I remember you have a Weibo account, unless that one is fake?" Su Mengqi asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I do have Weibo, but how did you know?" Jiang Chen took out his phone and logged into his long-forgotten account.</br>
</br>
He recalled that the only person he followed was Liu Yao. After that, he didn't bother sending out a single Weibo. But when his eyes landed on the numbers, he jumped.</br>
</br>
&lt;Followers: 8.21 million. Following: 1&gt;</br>
</br>
"Hehe, I am also your follower." Su Mengqi shook her phone as coyly blinked her eyes. "Everyone calls you National Husband."</br>
</br>
"Huh?" Jiang Chen glanced over the rows of at symbols, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
He randomly opened a few. It was either "I want to make babies with you," or "Please notice me, I can warm the bed." Many passionate females added a selfie in the message, but most belonged to the type that had "no photoshop at all."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was secretly shocked at his popularity.</br>
</br>
But he would pass on the babies part.</br>
</br>
It made sense, however—Future Technology was now valued at over five billion USD by Wall Street analysts, and this was the number given to the press a month ago. After the introduction and success of their revenue model, as well as the era-defining game New Era, Future Technology's value could easily have doubled.</br>
</br>
Without exaggerating, Jiang Chen's net worth was easily over ten billion USD.</br>
</br>
Moreover, he was quite good-looking, and someone revealed that he was only twenty-three years old.</br>
</br>
New to the business, young and rich, and also single—</br>
</br>
Immediately, all spotlights were focused on him.</br>
</br>
Even without sending out a single Weibo, social media officials acted on their own and verified the account, making the number of followers explode.</br>
</br>
Uh, he was very curious. How did the Weibo officials know about his Weibo account?</br>
</br>
"What do you think? It's not bad to be popular, right?" Su Mengqi smiled happily at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Not bad." He scratched his nose while laughing shyly.</br>
</br>
His sudden public stature felt surreal.</br>
</br>
"Hehe, oh yeah. President, you still don't have a girlfriend, right? I'm also single. Do you think I can pursue you?" Su Mengqi coyly said in a half-joking tone of voice.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was about to reject her, a light cough transmitted from the end of the hall.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was standing there.</br>
</br>
Her silky, black hair was pulled up, and her black suit was paired with a white dress shirt, black stockings, and a black pencil skirt. She demonstrated the office lady vibe to perfection.</br>
</br>
Still stunning.</br>
</br>
Su Mengqi playfully popped her tongue out and immediately put her phone away. It was evident that Xia Shiyu was well-respected in the company.</br>
</br>
"Don't use your phone at work. Remember this next time." After giving Su Mengqi a brief lecture, Xia Shiyu glanced at Jiang Chen. She paused before saying, "Haven't seen you in a long time." Her tone somehow seemed to carry a hidden bitterness.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said apologetically, "Uh, I was about to go find you."</br>
</br>
"Then follow me." Xia Shiyu nodded, then she turned around to lead the way to the office.</br>
</br>
After the two left, Su Mengqi patted her chest with relief.</br>
</br>
Her best friend walked over with a briefcase and gently tapped her.</br>
</br>
"Qiqi, do you have a death wish? You dared to hit on the president in front of the CEO?"</br>
</br>
"Hmm? What! Could they...." Su Mengqi's eyes suddenly popped out as she realized the relationship between the two.</br>
</br>
Her best friend Li Fengying whispered mysteriously, "Let me tell you since you're new and don't know. The reason why the CEO still hasn't found a boyfriend yet is because of President Jiang...."</br>
</br>
"W-what do I do then? Will CEO Xia make trouble for me over this?" Su Mengqi began to feel anxious. She didn't actually plan to pursue Jiang Chen; it was only a joke. If she got in her boss' bad books, it would not be good.</br>
</br>
Future Technology's salary and benefits were extremely competitive.</br>
</br>
Her best friend suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"You dare to laugh. Give me back my Haagen Dazs." Su Mengqi said with mock anger.</br>
</br>
"No, haha, don't worry, CEO Xia is not that type of person. She usually looks serious, but she's not the narrow-minded type to give you trouble."</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen heard this word, he would have a shocked expression.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu did exactly that to fire him.</br>
</br>
So people do improve?</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 161: Hacker Attack</br>
</div></br>
"This is our backend data." Xia Shiyu leaned down to press a few buttons on the laptop, then she turned the screen towards Jiang Chen with a rare prideful look displayed on her face.</br>
</br>
It was the server management system designed by Yao Yao from which server activities were monitored.</br>
</br>
25.27 million registered users.</br>
</br>
The number wasn't overly high, considering Future 1.0 was a one-person-one-account registration system. Therefore, &lt;New Era&gt; was linked to Little White, which didn't allow fake accounts.</br>
</br>
This made it so that the number reflected the number of people actually playing the game, unless they had multiple phones.</br>
</br>
The reason behind eliminating smurfs was simple—to avoid having people open multiple accounts with the intent to disturb the economy within the game and use up server resources. &lt;New Era&gt; operated on one server in the entire country and used cloud computing to transfer calculation data from the client to the server. Even with Yao Yao's magically modified server, there was an inordinate amount of stress placed on it.</br>
</br>
"The peak concurrent users have hit 15.03 million and the average concurrent user number is 8.14 million. It's nothing short of a miracle." Xia Shiyu couldn't seem to stop talking.</br>
</br>
"What about the profit?" Jiang Chen immediately asked.</br>
</br>
He was concerned about their new revenue model. Would such an innovation fit the market? He knew the game was online for just two days which was too early to tell, but he still couldn't help but ask.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu smiled and clicked the screen.</br>
</br>
"This is the current total auction amount, already exceeding 14 million. With a five percent commission fee, revenue has reached 700 thousand within the first twenty-four hours of operation."</br>
</br>
"So much?" Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
He wasn't surprised by the revenue within the last twenty-four hours but rather by the auction amount of 14 million. It reflected the people's interest in game-spending.</br>
</br>
"And it'll only increase." Xia Shiyu's voice was emotional, her voice trembling. "The player's current method of obtaining gold in the game is still slow, making a huge gap in demand. The current ratio of gold to RMB has even risen to a high price of 1 to 5.6."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's initial reaction to Xia Shiyu's words was to pause. He didn't allow joy to overwhelm his thoughts; rather, he became more cautious.</br>
</br>
"Do you think someone is manipulating the auction house price? Just like with stocks—prop it up high, get players to accumulate gold, and then massively over-flood the market?"</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen raise his concern, Xia Shiyu's eyebrows also tensed.</br>
</br>
"I've already considered this possibility, but for now, the operations department has yet to come up with a workable plan. Some suggested that we follow the rules from the Han stock market and establish a circuit breaker in gold exchange prices to prevent market manipulation. Some proposed establishing a bank organization within the game internally so that once the gold rises above a tolerable range, they would sell or purchase back the gold. But both of these solutions have their own pros and cons and are still under debate."</br>
</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen almost burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning on changing the epic magical genre into a financial one?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu seemed lost.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, just joking around. Let's get to the main point. We can look at the broader economic balance in the game. Since the auction house is similar to securities, how could a bunch of game operators come up with a solution? We can follow what Valve did with DOTA 2—hire someone studying finance to monitor the auction house."</br>
</br>
Hearing his suggestion, Xia Shiyu's eyes lit up. The problem that hounded her was solved with a simple sentence, making her consider him a few more times.</br>
</br>
"Why are you looking at me?" Feeling slightly shy from her gaze, Jiang Chen scratched his nose.</br>
</br>
"I just realized that you're actually quite smart." She smiled, and it was like a beautiful flower blossoming on her gorgeous face.</br>
</br>
Dazzled by this brief glimpse, Jiang Chen jokingly replied, "I also just realized that you're quite beautiful when you smile."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu blushed and coughed before hastily changing the topic.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm.... On the other hand, based on the current skins available in the store, there has only been 150 thousand in revenue, but this number is expected to steadily increase. Also, after the one-time warehouse expansion, just on the first day of operation alone, it managed to rake in an impressive 4.21 million. However, this number is expected to drop as the number of new users decreases. These are the operational results from the past two days."</br>
</br>
As she spoke, Xia Shiyu opened another window to show to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The revenue from the first two days was 10.41 million. Seeing this number, Jiang Chen couldn't help but gasp. From this result, &lt;New Era&gt; easily destroyed the majority of mobile games that made that much in a month. If they maintained this upward trend in profit and user base, it wouldn't be a stretch to say &lt;New Era&gt; would break a monthly revenue of 200 million.</br>
</br>
Subtracting costs and tax expenses, this revenue combined with Future 1.0's made Future Technology a mega-corporation with a 50 million monthly profit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was so ecstatic when he heard the news that he immediately declared a bonus of ten thousand to everyone in the operating team.</br>
</br>
"With a boss like you who gives out bonuses so frequently, the project team can just depend on those bonuses." Xia Shiyu smiled at Jiang Chen's ecstatic expression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed. "Then the employees would want me to check up on them every day."</br>
</br>
Just as Xia Shiyu was about to mock him by saying, "Then why don't you come by every day," the laptop on the table flashed a red alert symbol.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was confused, but Xia Shiyu sighed as if it wasn't a big deal.</br>
</br>
"This already the twelfth time today. They were heavily grouped around the morning hours, but then here we go again.</br>
</br>
"Network being infiltrated?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"That's right. It was more frequent yesterday." Xia Shiyu continued, "In the beginning, our programmers were highly focused on dealing with the attacks, but when we found that they couldn't even break past the server firewall, we began to ignore it. Speaking of which, how can we get rid of this alert? It always forcefully increases the volume and stays in the middle of the screen."</br>
</br>
[It would be funny if they managed to infiltrate the firewall], Jiang Chen muttered in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I'll get the overseas team to make some adjustments." He only had to have Yao Yao tweak it, very simple.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu ignored the hacking alert on the laptop, in an apartment 100 kilometers away was a man in a black tracksuit. He resembled a zombie with his deep eye sockets as he typed furiously on the keyboard.</br>
</br>
The veins on his arms were abnormally prominent, and his bloodshot eyes seemed as though they would pop out at any time. A pallid face showed from beneath his hoodie and with his small figure, he looked underage from all perspectives. The typing speed he demonstrated, however, would embarrass any professional writer.</br>
</br>
Of course, he was not a professional writer but rather a hacker.</br>
</br>
"How can this be possible, how can this be possible!"</br>
</br>
Lines of code—or at least, lines of error codes—were reflected on his pupils.</br>
</br>
The typing stopped when the screen flashed multiple red crosses.</br>
</br>
No matter how many times he tried, it was the same result. They had to have a security team of at least ten professionals.</br>
</br>
As soon as his hands left the keyboard, the room quieted down, and all that could be heard was the humming of the computer fans.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh, can't beat it." Xie Lei raised his head, and he sank into the chair feeling defeated. He stared blankly at the ceiling as he mumbled, "It's only fair. If they could do something as insane as artificial intelligence, there's no way their security would be terrible."</br>
</br>
Bored, he took out his phone and poked Little White's stomach. Seeing him giggle adorably, Xie Lei genuinely laughed.</br>
</br>
Honestly, he didn't hold any animosity towards Future Technology.</br>
</br>
[To be able to develop such a fun software....]</br>
</br>
At that moment, the phone suddenly rang. When he saw who the caller was, his smile cooled considerably.</br>
</br>
&lt;Caller: Black Dragon&gt;</br>
</br>
"Hello?" Xie Lei said grimly upon picking up.</br>
</br>
"How's the job you're working on?" Black Dragon laughed.</br>
</br>
Black Dragon was obviously not his name, but if a hacker exposed his identity, it would be the same as stripping naked and running out onto the street. Which of them didn't do anything illegal before? Exposure meant "death."</br>
</br>
". . ."</br>
</br>
With the knowledge that they controlled "evidence," Xie Lei's face twisted for a moment before he took a deep breath. "Future Technology's security is too strong. No matter how hard I try, I can't go around the firewall. You're also in the business. You should know how difficult—"</br>
</br>
"Can't do it?" Black Dragon interrupted. "My suggestion is for you to take it more seriously. This is for an important person. Based on our longstanding relationship, I'll give you twenty thousand allowances after this is finished," he said slowly.</br>
</br>
"Twenty thousand? Since when are you so generous?" Xie Lei mocked.</br>
</br>
Black Dragon, who was usually too cheap to give a few thousand, was now offering twenty thousand? The client this time must have offered more than a million.</br>
</br>
"Don't bullsh*t me. If you don't want it, fine, I was only pitying you and you mock me? Let me tell you, Green Bird, or Xie Lei, if you don't do a good job, just wait for the cops to show up at your door."</br>
</br>
After finishing, Black Dragon hung up.</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Xie Lei flung the phone to the side and buried his head between his knees. Green Bird was a renowned name among hackers, but it was useless. The Xie Lei in front of the computer screen was only an ordinary teenager.</br>
</br>
"Dammit!"</br>
</br>
His smashed his fist onto the table.</br>
</br>
On the phone screen, Little White curled back anxiously. He couldn't see Xie Lei's expression since the camera was covered, but he could detect agony from the sound waves.</br>
</br>
Just as Xie Lei was despairing, a tiny hand patted his head.</br>
</br>
"Brother?" a young girl stood behind him and whispered.</br>
</br>
Her face was similarly pallid, but it looked graceful in a way that healed when seen. The only unfortunate part was that she had no color in her pupils.</br>
</br>
She couldn't see.</br>
</br>
Xie Lin, his sister.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei placed his hand on hers and tightly held onto it with a forced smile.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, Brother is here."</br>
</br>
Even though he knew she couldn't see, he struggled to smile.</br>
</br>
The girl continued to smile gently.</br>
</br>
"Don't tire yourself out."</br>
</br>
Seeing the bright smile on his sister's face, there was only remorse in his heart.</br>
</br>
"Listen to Brother. I got another deal. The boss is generous and offered twenty thousand in compensation."</br>
</br>
"Woah, Brother is so impressive." Her hands clasped together in front of her chest as she slightly opened her mouth in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, your brother is really impressive.... Therefore, I will heal your eyes." Xie Lei desperately kept his tone normal while his fingers tightly clenched onto the armrests.</br>
</br>
He was not afraid of going to jail. He was done with Black Dragon's manipulation.</br>
</br>
But what stopped him from going was his sister Xie Lin. If he went to jail, his only source of income would disappear. Not only would he be unable to treat her eyes, it would also be difficult to live....</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath, his mind already made.</br>
</br>
Although the hope was slim, he had to take a gamble.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 162: Company Gathering</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen announced a bonus of ten thousand for everyone, the employees all began to cheer in joy.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu who stood beside him rubbed her face. She whispered, "Didn't you say a bonus only to the New Era project members? How did it become everyone?"</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen paused before immediately laughing it away. "That's fine! Everyone contributed, so everyone should be rewarded. There are a lot of employees in Future Technology, but no one is an extra!"</br>
</br>
"Boss." Chen Lulu in the legal department put her palms together as if she was praying to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"You look like you're glowing."</br>
</br>
At the edge of the circle, Su Mengqi stopped clapping along with her colleagues.</br>
</br>
As she watched Jiang Chen, who was surrounded, there was a different light flashing in her eyes, like a magpie that had just discovered shining jewelry.</br>
</br>
"Girl, are you thinking about someone?" her friend said with a smirk. She stood beside Su Mengqi and poked her friend in the arm.</br>
</br>
"Fengying," Su Mengqi murmured, as if she hadn't heard her friend's words.</br>
</br>
Seeing the lost face on her friend's face, Li Fengying looked at her confusedly.</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"Who do you think is prettier? Me and CEO Xia?" Su Mengqi said with a pout, her eyes drawn to the person in the center.</br>
</br>
"Psh! Wait? You...."</br>
</br>
"I have decided!" She suddenly clapped her hands, a fighting light burning in her eyes. "I've changed my mind."</br>
</br>
Future Technology had a total of 34 employees. With a bonus of ten thousand per person, that came out to only 340 thousand—this was a drop of water in the vast sea of Future Technology's future profits. Following the growth of the company, their monthly salary would eventually be far greater than that number.</br>
</br>
But what Jiang Chen didn't know was that the employees were touched not by the ten thousand bonus but rather by what he said at the end.</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of employees in Future Technology, but no one is an extra!"</br>
</br>
Nothing else instilled such a sense of belonging as having one's own value recognized. They spent days and nights drafting plans, discussing marketing strategy, and handling the details of the operation—other than working for the salary, did they not want to be recognized for their values?</br>
</br>
No one felt this as strongly as Jiang Chen did ever since he was fired at will. He was a small employee working in the sales department of a clothing store. He knew in his heart the powerless feeling that no matter how hard he worked, he would never receive any recognition.</br>
</br>
Sometimes, people were more easily touched than expected.</br>
</br>
These words were later printed in Future Technology's employee manual as the company's culture used to encourage new employees.</br>
</br>
But this is an afterthought.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
</br>
With everyone's moods at an all-time high, Jiang Chen immediately announced a gathering at Xinrong Restaurant, with all expenses paid for by the company.</br>
</br>
A boss this generous naturally received the praise of the employees. Most people disliked business gatherings, but upon hearing that they would have the opportunity to have a meal with the mysterious but legendary boss, they began to look forward to it.</br>
</br>
After getting off from work, the group of thirty plus people arrived at Xinrong Restaurant.</br>
</br>
Befitting its five-star reputation, Xinrong Restaurant was magnificently built.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had already reserved a room, so when the restaurant manager saw the crowd of thirty people, he put on his brightest smile and personally ushered them to the private room. He also courteously gave Jiang Chen a VIP card that gave 20% off the tab.</br>
</br>
The dinner table was a bustling scene.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen happily accepted his employees' toasts, but considering that he had to drive, he took care not to drink too much and placed the remainder in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Sitting beside him was the second-in-command, Xia Shiyu. Jiang Chen was surprised to find that she was quite popular in the company as she received many proposed toasts as well.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu accepted them all without refusing a single one, but because of her tolerance, she used a small cup. Regardless, her face turned red after a few shots, which couldn't look more attractive on her.</br>
</br>
The mood became heightened as Jiang Chen didn't act like a boss at all, boasting instead with the employees about anything and everything.</br>
</br>
The topic soon turned to personal questions about the "internet famous" president's personal life. Everyone was quite curious.</br>
</br>
"President, let me propose a toast. I wish for your greater success!" At this time, Su Mengqi stood and raised her cup with a smile.</br>
</br>
Based on the alcohol culture in China, it was disrespectful to propose a toast to the boss before the direct manager did so. Because of the lack of employees, however, Future Technology did not yet have an established Human Resources department, and so Xia Shiyu was in charge of everything; therefore, Su Mengqi's direct manager should have been Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
But CEO Xia, either from shyness or other concerns, didn't propose a toast to Jiang Chen from the start of the dinner until now, despite sitting beside him. Despite that, Su Mengqi toasting Jiang Chen did not befit the culture.</br>
</br>
Of course, there was also an unwritten rule that beauties were the exception.</br>
</br>
"I'll accept your kind words." Jiang Chen stood and also raised his cup before throwing back the drink. Su Mengqi simultaneously finished the drink in her cup, and two red clouds appeared on her cheeks. Her watery eyes shimmered. Under the influence of alcohol, she gazed into Jiang Chen's eyes and asked, "President, can I ask you a question?"</br>
</br>
"Ask away, as long as it's not for my bank password," Jiang Chen laughed as he joked.</br>
</br>
"Then my question is, does President have anyone he likes?"</br>
</br>
It was a bold question, drawing a wave of chattering, and the mood at the dinner table was suddenly pushed to a climax. Su Mengqi's face with light makeup began to blush even more under the cheers of her colleagues, but her watery eyes didn't move away.</br>
</br>
Many people speculated that CEO Xia had feelings for the president, but when she remained unperturbed by the question, people began to question their suspicions.</br>
</br>
Everyone was already an adult; there was no way she was this reserved.</br>
</br>
"Yes, President. If you don't tell us because we're men, then shouldn't you reveal some information to the beautiful lady?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes, our Miss Su is already giving you hints, so you should say something."</br>
</br>
Recalling that the president was still single, the crowd began to root for the two.</br>
</br>
Su Mengqi was indeed a gorgeous girl, and she seemed interested in the president. Many times, it worked out like this—although they didn't hold strong feelings for each other, under everyone's influence, they would somehow develop feelings for each other.</br>
</br>
It was a top priority to help the president stay away from the single life. If it ended up working out, their fussing now would become an assistance later! Not only were there benefits, but in the future, it would be a favor. If they ended up getting married, with Jiang Chen's generosity, a hefty red envelope would come their way.</br>
</br>
And even if it didn't end up working out, it was a light jest at the dinner table, so not many thought too deeply on it. For some reason, Xia Shiyu buried her head and poked at her fish, feeling wronged. She had the urge the stand up and do something, but she didn't know exactly what, so she couldn't find a reason to get up.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave a troubled smile. This was a difficult question to answer.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao and Yao Yao.... were from the other world. Ayesha's identity and age were unique, so it wasn't good to expose them. Liu Yao was a celebrity and would not be good to expose as a mistress. F*ck, he thought he had so many girls, but not a single one could be brought home for New Years.</br>
</br>
"Uhh, yes?" After careful deliberation, Jiang Chen gave an incredibly vague answer.</br>
</br>
Even after hearing the response, Su Mengqi didn't give up. Just as she was about to ask, "What do you like about her," Future 1.0's Project Manager Nin Huajian suddenly stood and proposed a toast with a smile.</br>
</br>
"President Jiang is young but achieved! I have worked in the IT industry for five years and have seen a number of industry prodigies. But the only person whom I respect from the bottom of my heart is President Jiang. I'll finish the drink."</br>
</br>
Nin Huajian chugged the alcohol in his cup and flipped it to show his respect, making the crowd cheer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood that Nin Huajian was helping him get out of an awkward situation, so he gladly raised his cup.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen finished his drink, the three sat down.</br>
</br>
Su Mengqi also realized that she was rushing it. Thankfully, Nin Huajian saved her from persisting, or else she would have committed the taboo of putting her boss in a difficult situation.</br>
</br>
Besides Su Mengqi's anxious emotions, Xia Shiyu's heart was also turbulent.</br>
</br>
She recalled the scene during the last press conference.</br>
</br>
At that time, Jiang Chen seemed to have indicated that he didn't like anyone.</br>
</br>
But there now there was someone.</br>
</br>
Who could it be?</br>
</br>
He barely showed up at the company this month and barely saw her. Could it be someone he met overseas on a business trip...?</br>
</br>
Eh? Why do I care about his personal life?</br>
</br>
Just as Xia Shiyu was in a mental quandary, the topic at the table switched directions.</br>
</br>
"CEO Xia, thank you for your support and guidance. Let me propose a toast to you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently poked Xia Shiyu with his elbow.</br>
</br>
"Ah! Okay...." As if waking from a dream, Xia Shiyu hastily stood and raised her cup.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu, perplexed. It was rare to see such a frantic expression on her face.</br>
</br>
In this relatively harmonious atmosphere, the dinner came to an end.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 163: Please close your eyes at night</br>
</div></br>
After the closing remarks of the boss, the dinner officially concluded. People began to leave and started to head home.</br>
</br>
The total spending was 70 thousand. Jiang Chen swiped his card without a blink of an eye.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to leave, he realized that someone was still there.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was leaning on the table. Her blood, red blush could be faintly seen on her half exposed face, she looked like she drank too much.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Jiang Chen helplessly let out a sigh and walked towards her.</br>
</br>
For some strange reason, the girl somehow started to drink shot after shot and got herself drunk. She didn't cause a scene after becoming drunk as she just quietly lied on the table till now.</br>
</br>
"No one forced you to drink, did you think you were drinking water?"</br>
</br>
"Huu-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put her arms around his neck and used a slight amount of force to lift her up onto his back.</br>
</br>
Feeling the softness on his back, Jiang Chen's face turned red. Although they were not big, they were surprisingly soft.</br>
</br>
He quickly coughed to hide his awkwardness as he cleared his mind. Avoiding the dubious look of the waitress, he quickly secured her on his back and left through the door.</br>
</br>
"I, I am not drunk, taxi..."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes, that's what all drunk people say."</br>
</br>
The warm breath on his neck made his mind go elsewhere, especially coupled with the softness on his back; it was making him lose his mind.</br>
</br>
.</br>
</br>
He suppressed the wild thoughts in his mind as he strenuously stuffed Xia Shiyu into the front passenger seat and put the seatbelt on her. When his finger unintentionally slid across her silky waist, he gulped, urged back any more "unintentional" moves, and closed the door.</br>
</br>
He started the car and drove his Maybach to Xinxuan community.</br>
</br>
The smell of alcohol began to rise in the car, Jiang Chen glanced at the completely passed out girl as he sighed and murmured.</br>
</br>
"You know you are very attractive right now?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu ambiguously muttered something, but it was probably just her sleep talking.</br>
</br>
Because he was afraid that she would get cold from the wind, Jiang Chen let the alcohol smell build up in the car and didn't open the window.</br>
</br>
Finally bringing this girl to her front door, Jiang Chen couldn't care more as he used his free hand to search her body, before finding the key and opening the door.</br>
</br>
He dragged Xia Shiyu, who was drunk like a pile of mud, into her place before he finally got a chance to breathe. But just as he was about to leave, he froze in place.</br>
</br>
Her white neck was a soft shade of red, her slightly messy hair partially covered her gorgeous celebrity-like face, her bright red lips were parted, breathing a warm but intoxicating smell, her delicate eyebrows furrowed due to discomfort...</br>
</br>
</br>
Seeing Xia Shiyu's letting her guard completely down, Jiang Chen gulped and took a subtle step forward.</br>
</br>
If he did something now, she probably wouldn't know.</br>
</br>
But just as the devil-like thought emerged in his mind, he refocused, scared by his own thought. He quickly took two deep breaths and forcefully shook his head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen helped her take off her suit and then to make her more comfortable, he unbuttoned the first button on her button down shirt.</br>
</br>
After doing all this, he put the sheet on her before sneaking out from the room.</br>
</br>
He poured himself a cup of water in the kitchen, the cold sensation of water passing through his stomach calmed his heart.</br>
</br>
After standing for a moment, he looked at the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
&lt;10:32&gt;</br>
</br>
"It's already this late?" Jiang Chen yawned as the feeling of confliction rose.</br>
</br>
Xinxuan community was in the complete opposite direction of Mingxing community. If he drove back now, it would be 12 before he arrived at home. Besides, he was already so tired that he really didn't want to drive an hour back.</br>
</br>
Stay here for the night?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped as it was an enticing thought.</br>
</br>
[I did carry her back. It would be okay if I stayed without her permission for one night right?]</br>
</br>
Thinking, Jiang Chen took out his phone and texted a message to Ayesha.</br>
</br>
&lt;I am busy tonight, I won't be back.&gt;</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a long breath of air. He then stretched and scanned the two-story apartment.</br>
</br>
There was a bedroom on the second floor, but probably never cleaned out since only Xia Shiyu lived here.</br>
</br>
"Looks like I am sleeping on the sofa tonight... I'll take a shower first."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered as he walked to the bathroom.</br>
</br>
Within the mansion, Ayesha had her leg placed on the bar as she gently leaned her body forward, her chin slightly touching her knees. The elegant posture was not only difficult but also aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Only such exercises could stretch the tendons in the leg to increase the flexibility of the body. This was something genetic vaccine did not provide. Flexibility was one of the most common things that benefited her in all areas, such as fighting, such as doing other certain things...</br>
</br>
But suddenly, the lightbulb went out.</br>
</br>
Power outage?</br>
</br>
Ayesha's movement stopped. With her body still pressed against her leg, she quietly listened.</br>
</br>
She didn't rush to check the circuit as she smelled something odd.</br>
</br>
Her cat-like pupils slightly narrowed in the darkness, giving off a dangerous vibe.</br>
</br>
As if she had found her prey.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Since he couldn't break through the firewall, he could only capture the program developer and figure out the code the hard way.</br>
</br>
Xin Lei's blood-shot eyes reflected the light on the screen. His lips rose slightly under his hoodie as he spoke in a screeching voice into the Bluetooth headphone.</br>
</br>
"The security system is hacked, your personal information is whitelisted."</br>
</br>
For a hacker that is ranked third in Hua, and had been flagged on the front page of some unscrupulous organizations, this type of security was too easy for him.</br>
</br>
Though he hasn't done these types of things without pay for a long time.</br>
</br>
"Confirmed." A female voice came from under the hood of a purple tracksuit.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan, the childhood honey of Xie Lei. She has a black belt in taekwondo, even though she is only 17. Her swift moves could easily beat 5-6 adults. Due to her affection towards Xie Lei, she agreed to this dangerous plan without much hesitation.</br>
</br>
"It's taken care of, let's go." She waved at the two people behind her, and Yan Xiaoyan led the way to the high-end community.</br>
</br>
Lu Dahu, known as the chubby tiger is a good friend of Xie Lei. He was three years older, spent a few years in the military, and is currently unemployed.</br>
</br>
Zhang Chao, also Xie Lei's good friend. They met a long time ago on the internet. He was around the same age as Xie Lei. Although he lacked knowledge about computers, he was a huge of fan of the military. He was not tall but was skillful with almost all military gadgets.</br>
</br>
After Xie Lei confessed his trouble, they agreed without hesitation.</br>
</br>
The plan was simple: sneak into the mansion, control Jiang Chen, drive his car and take him out of the community to the agreed on spot.</br>
</br>
They only had one and half hour. Once the clock hit 12, the server would reset, and the access control gained by Xie Lei would be lost.</br>
</br>
His eyes locked onto the screen as Xie Lei already infiltrated the camera within the community. Seeing his three friends successfully pass identification at the front door and walk inside of the mansion, he took a deep breath and pressed a few more button.</br>
</br>
The memory of the camera connected to the server was erased, the write function disabled. The camera tonight would not record anything. Once they left, they only needed to delete their personal information from the server.</br>
</br>
As if they were never there.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei knew that he and his friends were playing with fire. If they were accidentally caught, all of them would go to jail.</br>
</br>
"People here are all veteran soldiers," Lu Dahu lowered his hat as he mumbled.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you a veteran as well?" Zhao Chan with a backpack mocked.</br>
</br>
"It's different." Lu Dahu forced a smile, as his square looking face looked rather helpless. "Based on the vibe I'm getting, they were at least special forces from the army."</br>
</br>
"Be quiet." Yan Xiaoyan, half a step in front of them, whispered.</br>
</br>
Xie Lin's fingers typed on the keyboard. He constantly changed between cameras while drawing with his right hand and marking the route of the patrol team.</br>
</br>
"Turn right in the front, avoid patrol team A, walk straight into the intersection before turning left. Try to avoid contact with anyone, your guys look odd."</br>
</br>
"Understood." Yan Xiaoyan lowered her voice as she held onto the Bluetooth earphone. She then signaled the two people behind her to quickly move to the street on the right.</br>
</br>
Although they already passed the check at the front door, wandering around this late would easily cause suspension. They were not prepared to be questioned because the backpack Zhang Chao carried had all the tools for crime.</br>
</br>
Three sticks, handcuffs, ropes, three night vision goggles, and one signal jammer.</br>
</br>
Zhang Chao bought everything from an exclusive channel. They were all authentic product from UA ATN corporation which shocked Lu Dahu, the veteran soldier. Of course, Xie Lei paid for it.</br>
</br>
The three of them sneaked into the mansion at the deepest part of the community.</br>
</br>
The European style high wall, the cut green grass, and the straight brick trail. The building's structure shone with elegance.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, people here must be ridiculously wealthy. Do you think there are bodyguards inside?" Zhang Chao mustered as he took off his backpack.</br>
</br>
"If there are any, I'll take care of it." The girl in the purple suit said confidently. She pressed the earphone again. "We are in position."</br>
</br>
"Ok." Xie Lei took a deep breath and clicked his tongue.</br>
</br>
Sparks suddenly came out of the generator on the north side. In an instant, the entire community fell into darkness.</br>
</br>
With fingers on the keyboard, he simultaneously locked the electrical room's password so that even if they started the backup generator, it would take awhile.</br>
</br>
He had to thank the highly digitalized design of the community. If it were a mechanical lock, there would be nothing that he could do.</br>
</br>
Without wasting a second, Yan Xiaoyan took out a card from her pocket and swiped it on the metal gate. Xie Lei who already acquired the password information from the database and had copied the key onto the black card. The card in her hand was equivalent to the actual key and easily opened the door.</br>
</br>
"Quick! Put this on."</br>
</br>
Zhang Chao excitedly threw the night vision goggles and sticks into their hands and put one on his hand skillfully as well.</br>
</br>
The night vision goggle not only allowed them to obtain vision in the dark, but it also hid their faces.</br>
</br>
They quickly sneaked into the mansion and approached the door.</br>
</br>
Pressing against the door, Zhang Chao took out a lock pick and opened the door with a few clicks. Then he signaled the two companions to enter.</br>
</br>
The mansion looked rather empty; there was no one on the first floor.</br>
</br>
Based on the lights they saw from the outside, there should be people on the third floor.</br>
</br>
The three quietly waited against the wall.</br>
</br>
The electric valve was outside. If someone came down to check, they must pass by where they stood.</br>
</br>
"Why is there no noise at all? Typically shouldn't they all check the valve?" Lu Dahu's eyebrows tightened as he said with his voice lowered.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan also raised her eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Not only were there no footsteps heard upstairs, but there was also no lights from a phone or candle.</br>
</br>
Could it be that Jiang Chen was already asleep, and just forgot to turn off the lights.</br>
</br>
"Let's go to the bedroom." Yan Xiaoyan suppressed her voice as she led the way, sneaking upstairs.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It would be up to them once they enter the mansion. The camera in the community could not monitor inside the mansion as it was for the consideration of residents' privacy.</br>
</br>
The mansion was in a frightening darkness.</br>
</br>
But the darker it was, the more advantageous it was for them since they had night vision goggles...</br>
</br>
The camera in the community was installed with internal batteries so that even though the power went out, it could still last for a few more hours.</br>
</br>
Seeing his friends have already entered the mansion, Xie Lei let out a sigh and leaned against the chair.</br>
</br>
"Now just need to catch Jiang Chen, get the firewall security code from his mouth, hack into &lt;New Era&gt; server, and delete the user information and gate data clean... Pity, the game is not bad." He shook his head, stared at the open gate, and mustered arrogantly.</br>
</br>
"Please close your eyes at night."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 164: Is there a need to have a reason?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Water poured down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the knob before he shook off the droplets of water on his head, he then walked out of the shower as he grabbed a towel beside him and wiped himself.</br>
</br>
It felt much better after the shower as if the all the alcohol and weariness was washed away.</br>
</br>
But the faint fragrance in the room put him in an awkward spot physiologically. He thought while he wiped his hair with the towel.</br>
</br>
But as he wiped, his hand froze in the air.</br>
</br>
[This is... Xia Shiyu's towel?]</br>
</br>
Thinking that towel once covered a pure blossoming flower, and countlessly wiped the mists off of the leaves...</br>
</br>
He stared at the towel in his hand as Jiang Chen's expression on his face suddenly turned awkward.</br>
</br>
But at this time, a blurry, but shaky figure suddenly appeared on the opaque glass in the washroom. Jiang Chen, who realized what happened, was about to stop her before the bathroom door was pushed open first.</br>
</br>
Ka.</br>
</br>
Seeing the haggard Xia Shiyu arduously holding on the door frame. Just as she was about to come in, she was stunned at the doorstep.</br>
</br>
The cynical thing that appeared in her field of vision made her briefly lost her ability to think.</br>
</br>
It was hard to describe the expression on her face, should it be wry? Shocked? Or humiliated.</br>
</br>
The air of silence filled the air between the two.</br>
</br>
"Hi." Jiang Chen first broke the silence rigidly. He moved the towel to cover the inexplicable part while keeping a straight face.</br>
</br>
Perhaps maybe she was drunk, or perhaps the image was too shocking, Xia Shiyu didn't scream, but rather she calmed down and silently closed the door.</br>
</br>
Looking at the closed the door, a bitter smile appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Uh... Maybe I should have screamed?"</br>
</br>
Since he already used, and also was seen, might as well finish drying himself.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shameless dried his entire body, then washed her towel before putting his clothes back on. He then left the bathroom.</br>
</br>
He turned to the living room as Xia Shiyu was already sitting on the sofa. When Jiang Chen came out, her vision immediately gazed onto him.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was mentally prepared for the "pervert" "sick-minded," the expected anger didn't arrive.</br>
</br>
"Uh, are you going to ask me something?" He felt a bit frightened by Xia Shiyu's silence, Jiang Chen careful sat across from her as he said apologetically.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu still didn't say anything, with the aid of the moonlight, it was visible that on the usually cold face, the bright red lips were slightly trembling.</br>
</br>
[Because she is so angry she couldn't express it?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen drilled deep into his mind and still couldn't figure out the current mood of this girl. The prideful ice beauty realized after waking up that she was lying on the bed, with clothes slovenly, the first button of the dress shirt unbuttoned, and also a man (pervert) using her washroom to take a shower, using the towel that she had always used...</br>
</br>
</br>
From any perspective, she must not be in the best mood.</br>
</br>
"Ummm, you were drunk." Jiang Chen awkwardly tried to explain.</br>
</br>
With the direct stare, Jiang Chen didn't know if she was thinking or mooning out.</br>
</br>
"You were sleeping on the table, so I carried you back on my back. Your car is still there, remember to drive it back tomorrow." Seeing Xia Shiyu did not react, Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"Why?" Seemed like she reacted to this sentence, Xia Shiyu murmured as if she was whispering in her dream.</br>
</br>
"Why? Is that even a question." Jiang Chen had a bitter smile, "I can't leave you there by yourself. You live alone, and you drank yourself like that, be more cautious next time. If a human trafficker is pretending to be someone to be close to you, you don't even know if you were sold to some desolate mountain areas."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Xia Shiyu looked over and made eye contact with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, even to her disbelief, she asked, "Then would you come to save me?"</br>
</br>
He was shocked by the sudden question, Jiang Chen thought for a glimpse.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Why?" It was still the dreamy mutter.</br>
</br>
Expectation? Or perhaps just confusion?</br>
</br>
"Does there need to be a reason?" Jiang Chen sighed as he asked rhetorically.</br>
</br>
Humans were never a pure logical animal, what's the point of excessive need for reasons?</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was not pleased with Jiang Chen's response. The graceful top lip bit on the bottom one, the rather blank expression seemed like she still hasn't gained a clear mind.</br>
</br>
Seeing that she hadn't said anything, Jiang Chen coughed and gently said.</br>
</br>
"You are drunk. Don't drink this much in the future, now go get some rest."</br>
</br>
Although he didn't know what she was so fixated about, based on this response, she was not angry?</br>
</br>
She stood up wobbling, just as Jiang Chen let a sigh thinking she was going back to the room to sleep, she moved across and stood in front of him.</br>
</br>
"You, who do you like?" The voice carried some intoxication, but the tone certainly carried CEO Xia's authority.</br>
</br>
The random questions threw Jiang Chen off.</br>
</br>
He forced a smile and didn't answer. He didn't know how to answer.</br>
</br>
After the last press conference, he already had a sense for Xia Shiyu's feelings towards him.</br>
</br>
Although she always put on a cold expression that kept people a thousand miles away, her heart was still that of a child.</br>
</br>
As to why he said that, it was because only a child would believe coldness meant maturity.</br>
</br>
If it were someone without boundary, it wouldn't whatever, but Xia Shiyu...</br>
</br>
She definitely would not accept him being with other women. Or should we say any "normal" women would not. Jiang Chen asked himself. He certainly had feelings for her, but his feelings were just beginning to develop. As to giving up something for her, he could not do it.</br>
</br>
"I," Jiang Chen hesitantly opened his mouth, but the words were stuck in his throat.</br>
</br>
"I don't want to hear it." She shook her head, as her slightly messy but luscious hair waved.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, she made a move that completely left Jiang Chen dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
A delicate hand reached out as two fingers audaciously squeezed his chin. Jiang Chen stared at the pair of crystal clear eyes. Her mouth opened slightly, and she moved in closer.</br>
</br>
His conscience told him, she was drunk, you should wake her up.</br>
</br>
But seeing the approaching, blushing, attractive face, he could not say a single word.</br>
</br>
The devil-like thought spun in his head as Jiang Chen gulped.</br>
</br>
[She is the one being proactive. If I pretend I don't know...]</br>
</br>
But suddenly, an untimely ringtone disrupted this tranquil moment. Xia Shiyu's action stopped abruptly. The misty eyes regained a hint of clarity as she looked at Jiang Chen ever so close to her.</br>
</br>
"I, I'll take a phone call." Jiang Chen got up and escaped.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu froze blankly there. Her face began to turn red. Even under the not so bright moonlight, it was apparent.</br>
</br>
[What did I do?]</br>
</br>
Fine droplets of sweat began to surface on her heated body. The alcohol evaporated with the sweat as she began to sober up.</br>
</br>
Without thinking, she dashed into the bedroom without turning around.</br>
</br>
Bam!</br>
</br>
The door slamming sound transmitted behind him as Xia Shiyu fleed into the bedroom.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen forced a smile as he looked at the phone.</br>
</br>
It was Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put his hand against the wall as he picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
He sensed some strangeness to Ayesha calling him now.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With a stick in her hand, Yan Xiaoyan gently pushed open the door.</br>
</br>
No one was there.</br>
</br>
She shook her head at the teammate behind her, signaling Lu Dahu to walk to the adjacent bedroom.</br>
</br>
Even if she carefully controlled her footsteps, the contact between her runners and the expensive wooden floor made a faint sound.</br>
</br>
Because they didn't know which bedroom Jiang Chen slept in, they had to use the dumbest method, which was to search the rooms one by one.</br>
</br>
Zhang Chao stayed on the first floor to prevent Jiang Chen from escaping. At the same time, he opened the signal jammer to prevent the target from calling the police.</br>
</br>
In the spacious living room, Zhang Chao scanned his surroundings.</br>
</br>
The bright green vision in the night vision goggles made the darkness not so frightening.</br>
</br>
Seeing the home theatre on the wall, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
"85 inches 4K smart TV, as well as the TV screen. This at least cost upwards of half a million," he mustered in his mind as he felt anxious.</br>
</br>
It was his first time kidnapping, and they were just not kidnapping an ordinary person. They were kidnapping the wealthy and influential president of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
He could only pray that Yan Xiaoyan was clean with her moves and their faces won't be revealed to Jiang Chen. Or else, Jiang Chen had hundreds of ways to make sure they never live in Wanghai City again.</br>
</br>
Just as he was still debating in his mind, something forcefully struck the back of his neck.</br>
</br>
Before he could react, he lost his conscious and fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
On the other side...</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan was already on the third floor.</br>
</br>
To increase efficiency, she and Lu Dahu decided to advance separately.</br>
</br>
Just as she got to the gym, the room that previously had the lights on, she felt suddenly alerted. Without thinking, she immediately swept the stick behind her.</br>
</br>
The sound of air breaking echoed as the hit obviously missed. Easily dodging the strike, Ayesha, with a grim look, moved.</br>
</br>
When she thought the situation couldn't get any worse, Yan Xiaoyan immediately kicked up her leg and blocked the lightning-fast roundhouse kick.</br>
</br>
"Ouch-!"</br>
</br>
Sharp pain transmitted from her legs.</br>
</br>
Cold sweat began to drop from Yan Xiaoyan's forehead as fear began to overwhelm her.</br>
</br>
They were not on the same level. She was part of the national competition before, but even in the championship match, she never felt such powerful force.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan quickly moved back, but she was already backed up against the window.</br>
</br>
The pristine moonlight shed into the room as she felt her vision increase drastically.</br>
</br>
She pulled off the annoying night vision goggles, only leaving the mask on her face. Yan Xiaoyan stared at the girl approaching her.</br>
</br>
The girl was not tall; she could even be described as tiny. Her wavy hair was tied into a ponytail. She had an exotic, gorgeous face, but all these factors were not critical. What made Yan Xiaoyan frantic was the grim looking eyes. They were looking at her as if she was a dead body.</br>
</br>
The desire to kill was immense!</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 165: A Farce</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hearing noise coming from the gym, Lu Dahu quickly rushed over. When he saw Yan Xiaoyan confronting Ayesha, he held his breath and sneaked up behind her in an attempt to choke her from behind.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan also held her breath when she saw Lu Dahu approach Ayesha from the back. Her heart was about to jump out. When she thought the plan was about to work, she saw a sneer from the corner of Ayesha's mouth.</br>
</br>
She moved like a leopard.</br>
</br>
The girl turned around and performed a roundhouse kick. The swift action directly landed on Lu Dahu's unguarded chest. The power, disproportionate to her size, kicked the almost two hundred pounds, well-built man, away.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan looked at the scene in disbelief as the hand carrying the stick shook uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
Although she held a weapon in hand, it did not bring her the slightest sense of safety.</br>
</br>
However, she didn't back down.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at her in silence. Then, grabbing the box-shaped signal jammer from her back, she turned off the power.</br>
</br>
"Static-, Xiaoyan, how's the progress going." Seeing the communication channel was restored, Xie Lei desperately asked.</br>
</br>
"Lei. I might-" Yan Xiaoyan said with bitterness in her voice.</br>
</br>
But before she finished her sentence, the communication channel ceased again.</br>
</br>
Ayesha restarted the signal jammer, tossed the device away, and opened the EP on her wrist.</br>
</br>
The wireless tracker in her pocket already sent the communication information to the EP. It marked two related red dots on the EP map.</br>
</br>
Utilizing the brief window when the communication channel was restored, she located the "commander's" coordinates.</br>
</br>
The magic of future technology was something these "primitives" would never understand.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan was shaking when she saw Ayesha's series of moves. She didn't know what she was doing. The calmness before had completely vanished. The confidence she built based on her fighting ability was quickly shattered by the clean moves of the girl in front of her.</br>
</br>
But, for him...</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan's eyes were reignited with courage when she thought of Xie Lei. She gritted her teeth and dashed at Ayesha, kicking with lightning speed.</br>
</br>
Since she was at a disadvantage in terms of defense, she must attack.</br>
</br>
This kick was aimed directly at Ayesha's head.</br>
</br>
But the girl remained calm. Unlike what Yan Xiaoyan had imagined, she easily dodged her kick. Then, with cat-like agility, Ayesha was behind her.</br>
</br>
As Yan Xiaoyan had guessed, they were not on the same level.</br>
</br>
Before she was able to react, a sharp pain came from the back of her neck, making her lose consciousness. She immediately fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Someone attacked the mansion," Ayesha concisely reported.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression changed immediately, "Are you okay?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"I'm okay. The attackers had some creative ideas, but the techniques they used were that of an amateur's. Based on the skill levels of those people, they must have someone strong assisting them to avoid the patrol team. Based on initial speculation, that person should be a hacker proficient in cyber warfare," Ayesha said softly as she looked grimly at the three people lying in the basement with their hands and feet tied up.</br>
</br>
Hearing Ayesha was safe, Jiang Chen was relieved. But then he quickly realized that his worry was a bit unwarranted.</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, Jiang Chen asked in an undertone, "Do you know who sent them there."</br>
</br>
"Not clear yet. But I already have the coordinates of the hacker. I'll send it to you by phone."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll take care of it." Jiang Chen hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Shortly after, Little White shook as a picture of the coordinates were sent to Jiang Chen's phone.</br>
</br>
Two dots were connected. One dot was located in his mansion, while the other one was located in the rural area of Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
He looked in the direction of Xia Shiyu's bedroom and hesitated.</br>
</br>
But in the end, he sighed. He decided not to go up and knock on the door. Instead, he put on his shoes and left the apartment.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With her back against the cold wooden door, Xia Shiyu hugged her knees as she buried her head in her arms. However, through her arms, the red hue on her gorgeous face could still be seen.</br>
</br>
[Wooo, I want to die... What did I just do.]</br>
</br>
A soft whimper escaped her mouth as her ostrich-like head buried deeper between her legs.</br>
</br>
Her thoughts were a mess. The furious pounding in her left chest was too distracting.</br>
</br>
[What if he knocks on the door?</br>
</br>
Should I open it? But... I almost just did that kind of thing.</br>
</br>
Ahhhhh! I want to die. This is so embarrassing.</br>
</br>
But I should open the door. It would be rude just to leave him hanging in the living room. If I explained, it would get rid of the -]</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The sound of the door closing transmitted through from the outside.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu paused for a moment as she slowly lifted her head up.</br>
</br>
Seemed to be the front door.</br>
</br>
He left?</br>
</br>
He just left?</br>
</br>
While she let out a sigh of relief, for some reason, she felt disappointed.</br>
</br>
But as to why she felt disappointed, she couldn't give a reason.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Driving furiously on the road, Jiang Chen glanced at the red dot on the GPS before he fixated his gaze back onto the road.</br>
</br>
He let out a sigh as he held onto the wheel.</br>
</br>
"It would be better to find a chance and talk to her," He mumbled. Jiang Chen turned the steering wheel before parking the car near the target's community.</br>
</br>
Since it was a hacker proficient in cyber warfare, the community's cameras should be under their control?</br>
</br>
Definitely a possibility.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen locked the door and walked towards the back door of the community.</br>
</br>
It was almost 12. Only a few windows in the community still had their lights on.</br>
</br>
He avoided a few obvious cameras as he approached the electric substation of the target's building. He opened the box and put his right hand inside.</br>
</br>
Charging the interdimensional bracelet.</br>
</br>
The energy of the bracelet was suddenly full. The brute intake of electric current instantly exceeded the threshold value of the substation. Without a doubt, the entire building lost power.</br>
</br>
A mocking smile appeared on Jiang Chen's face. He closed the box, put his hands in his pocket, and walked into the shadow.</br>
</br>
It was 12 at night.</br>
</br>
People who were still awake, and desperately wanting to restore the power rather than going to sleep, would probably be the only ones providing assistance.</br>
</br>
Regardless who it was, he only needed for the fish to take the bait.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Xie Lei's eyes locked onto the screen as he nervously waited for his companion's response.</br>
</br>
The communication signal was interrupted. Did they get caught? Can't be. If they did, they would use the phone to communicate with me, the perpetrator.</br>
</br>
"Dammit!" Xie Lei's fist slammed onto the table.</br>
</br>
He did not consider a backup plan. He never thought about the changing variables within the plan. He started to regret the tracksuits. Even if he was out of solutions, he never should have come up with kidnapping. The evidence Black Tiger controlled would at max get him ten years, but kidnapping...</br>
</br>
His face turned pale as he prayed.</br>
</br>
"Xiaoyan, Chubby Tiger, Xiaochao... Please be safe, please!"</br>
</br>
But then, the entire building suddenly lost power. This made the already tense Xie Lei jump.</br>
</br>
"The fuse short-circuited? Can't be a power outage. There was no notice posted," He mustered as Xie Lei left his seat.</br>
</br>
In the assumption that someone was caught, the opposing force must have obtained my location through interrogation. Then, I should have been caught already. The door definitely won't be able to block anyone. However, since no one is here, that means they should not have been caught but entered into a stalemate with the target.</br>
</br>
Without electricity, there was nothing he could do.</br>
</br>
Regardless, he must quickly restore power. Once it passes 12, the server would reset. If he wanted to provide support, he must hack into the server again.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei left the room.</br>
</br>
Squeak-.</br>
</br>
He carefully opened the door, cautiously looking into the pitch black hallway. When he didn't see anyone, Xie Lei let out an uneasy breath.</br>
</br>
"Am I being too anxious..."</br>
</br>
It made sense. If they already knew my location, what's the whole point of using the trick of cutting the power?</br>
</br>
But what he didn't know was that in the near distant future, there would be a device that could locate communication signals. A device used by future snipers. Though of course, there will be signal jammers in the future, but right now... it was as easy as breathing for Ayesha to location the coordinates of the communicator.</br>
</br>
The night's breeze was quite chilly.</br>
</br>
The pale hand of the teen tightened the zipper of his tracksuit. His entire face was hidden under the shadow of the hoodie.</br>
</br>
It was already autumn. Maybe it was time to buy Xie Lin some thicker clothes?</br>
</br>
When he thought about his sister, a gentle smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Although the first reaction of most people was gloom when they first see him, she was the only one that didn't think so.</br>
</br>
Just like an angel.</br>
</br>
[Yes, that's right, I will protect my sister!]</br>
</br>
He screamed in his mind as the sudden adrenaline pushed away some of his fear. He went downstairs and headed straight to the electric substation that he was so familiar with.</br>
</br>
He opened the box but was stunned.</br>
</br>
Not right.</br>
</br>
He knew what a short fuse looked like, but he didn't see the entire meter being burnt out.</br>
</br>
"You are the perpetrator behind the scenes," a sluggish voice said from behind him.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei turned his head and saw a young man standing there with his hands in his pocket. He was observing him with interest in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Your left foot moved half a step back. I guess you want to run, but I suggest you don't do that." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Seeing his thoughts exposed, Xie Lei became calm as he locked his eyes right onto Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Xiaoyan... you caught all my friends?'</br>
</br>
"You can say that. My bodyguard's comment about you guys was, it was well thought out, but clumsily executed." Jiang Chen laughed before continuing, "First time doing this?"</br>
</br>
"..." Xie Lei didn't answer. His mind spun furiously as he desperately tried to think of a way to escape.</br>
</br>
"What was the intention of entering my mansion? If you don't answer, I will just default it to murder. Trust me, I have enough money to convince the judges."</br>
</br>
"Kidnap. To obtain the key to the server," Xie Lei squeezed out a few words in vain.</br>
</br>
Threatening worked.</br>
</br>
His face was extremely pale. It looked like that of someone who hadn't been outside for a long time. Around 1.60m tall, he had a slim built and looked like a teen. Jiang Chen couldn't comprehend why this teen he has never met before wanted to kidnap him.</br>
</br>
"For money? Or for other reasons? I don't want to use the truth-telling liquid on teens, it will have an uncontrollable effect on the developing brain," Jiang Chen mocked, but his tone held a hint of truth.</br>
</br>
"You are Jiang Chen?" Xie Lei abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged. "Did you just realize? I recommend you answer my question before I use force.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei let out a sigh as he confessed, 'Black Tiger made me do this."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised as he didn't immediately believe his words.</br>
</br>
"Who is Black Tiger?"</br>
</br>
Xie Lei laughed in agony. "I don't know. If I knew, I would not be manipulated by him."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 166: I can give you a chance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"For your friends' safety, I have no choice but to invite you to take a walk with me." It was useless to object as Jiang Chen said this with an unrefusable tone.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei's eyes strained for a moment before his shoulders finally loosened.</br>
</br>
"I can go with you, could you give me 10 minutes?"</br>
</br>
.</br>
</br>
"That depends on what you are going to do with this 10 minutes."</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath as Xie Lei said, "Don't worry, just leaving a note."</br>
</br>
He thought for a moment, as Jiang Chen didn't refuse his request, he got a go-ahead gesture.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen agreed, the teen was relieved and turned around to go upstairs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's hands were in his pocket when he followed the teen up, holding onto a pistol. But the teen didn't play any tricks with him. He took out the key, opened the old looking door, and walked inside into the room closest to the door.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei took out the phone and turned on the flashlight which lit up the small room immediately.</br>
</br>
Four desktops, two screens, wires tangled together and connected to unknown electronic equipment.</br>
</br>
"Your work?" Jiang Chen was slightly shocked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Xie Lei didn't seem to want to say anything else about the question as he answered concisely.</br>
</br>
He saw that the teen searched on the table for a while before picking up an MP3. It was uncommon to see such an out-of-date device.</br>
</br>
He seemed to have opened the voice recording function as he put the MP3 close to his mouth and said.</br>
</br>
"Linlin, I am sorry. Brother has to go somewhere really far. Although it is a bit shameless to say this... please forgive your unresponsible brother, I..."</br>
</br>
"Are you saying your will?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei ignored Jiang Chen as he took a deep breath and continued to say a few more things, such as "take care of yourself" and "the bank password is."</br>
</br>
"Done?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen felt sympathetic, he didn't plan on letting him off.</br>
</br>
Since he already committed to the act, he must have been mentally prepared for the plan to fail.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei nodded as he looked seriously at Jiang Chen, "I'm done. My sister is blind, I hope you don't hurt her."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I don't hurt the innocent."</br>
</br>
Without saying anything else, Xie Lei obediently followed Jiang Chen to the car and then to the mansion.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The power outage in the community caused quite a commotion. Especially since they found out it was caused by human intervention.</br>
</br>
After the security confirmed the safety of every resident, they were surprised to find out there was no thief.</br>
</br>
Regardless, it was a good thing that nothing was lost. Since people who lived here were either influential or wealthy. If something did happen, then Wanhua Real Estate's reputation would suffer major damages.</br>
</br>
</br>
Therefore, after confirming each household, they categorized this power outage as an accident and did not inform the police.</br>
</br>
The power was restored.</br>
</br>
At the same time, in the basement of the mansion.</br>
</br>
Ayesha crossed her arms in front of her chest as she looked expressionlessly at the three people with their hands tied behind their backs. Looking at her cold gaze, Yan Xiaoyan felt her body shake uncontrollably. She had never been so frightened before. The fighting ability she had been so proud of, could not last two moves in front of this girl.</br>
</br>
At the time, footsteps came from upstairs.</br>
</br>
The iciness in Ayesha's eyes suddenly melted.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan gulped as she looked with disbelief at the eyes that turned gentle instantly.</br>
</br>
"You are back." Ayesha stood up.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen rubbed her head, and then looked at the three people in the basement.</br>
</br>
"Lei, how did you-" Yan Xiaoyan couldn't control her voice. No one revealed his location. How did he get caught?</br>
</br>
"I got caught." Xie Lei revealed a bitter smile as he conscientiously extended both of his hands to Jiang Chen. "Tie me up."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at him as he signaled Ayesha to put handcuffs on him. Then he looked at all four of them. "Good. Since all the rats are caught, let's solve this problem once and for all."</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen took out the truth-telling liquid from his pocket, passed it to Ayesha, and stared at Xie Lei.</br>
</br>
"I ask, you answer. If I feel you are lying, then I'll use the truth-telling liquid."</br>
</br>
The interrogation began. Xie Lei, without resistance, confessed to everything Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
First, it was the identities of the four.</br>
</br>
Veteran, unemployed military fanatic, female sports university student, and Xie Lei, the high school dropout hacker.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei was quite impressive in his ability. Known as Green Bird, he placed third place within the Han Hacker Alliance. The most impressive achievement was hacking into an unscrupulous organization's server for two years consecutively and raising the flag on its homepage.</br>
</br>
Usually, he lived off of commission by completing missions for hire.</br>
</br>
Because of one mistake, a hacker called Black Tiger obtained his identity which directly ended his brief career. Then he became the money making tool of Black Tiger. The missions he accepted began to leave the boundary of the law.</br>
</br>
He was not afraid of going to jail, but what worried him most was his blind sister.</br>
</br>
If Black Tiger revealed his information, he would definitely be in there for quite a long time. He could not imagine, without him, how his sister would survive.</br>
</br>
After feeling conflicted for a long time, he decided to take this risk along with his three good friends. He decided to plan and execute a kidnap.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, it failed.</br>
</br>
"You guys are great friends. He asked you guys to kidnap, and you guys agree? Would you guys murder people if he asked you to?" Jiang Chen looked mischievously at the three as he laughed.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chang retracted his neck, frightened by Jiang Chen's look, but Lu Dahu seemed clam.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen looked at the university student named Yan Xiaoyan.</br>
</br>
"You? Seeing that your boyfriend is in trouble, you could risk going to jail for him?"</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan blushed. Just as she was about to argue they were only childhood sweetheart, Xie Lei interrupted.</br>
</br>
"I already told you everything I needed to tell you. I am willing to take full responsibility as long as you let my friends go." After he finished, Xie Lei slowly lowered his head and kneeled on the ground.</br>
</br>
Everyone held their breath.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Yan Xiaoyan wanted to defend for him, but she quickly realized that she had no excuse to do so.</br>
</br>
Including herself, they were all criminals.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen expressionlessly overlooked Xie Lei.</br>
</br>
"Do you think you have the right to discuss terms with me?"</br>
</br>
"No." Xie Lei lowered his head.</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, Jiang Chen suddenly began laughing.</br>
</br>
"Although this comical gong show did not cause me any material losses, that doesn't mean I am openminded enough to let you go consequence free. But considering you were under the threat of someone else, I can give you a chance."</br>
</br>
"I am willing to accept as long as you let my friends go."</br>
</br>
"Lei..." Yan Xiaoyan looked at Xie Lei with tears in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Are you not going to ask what it is before accepting?"</br>
</br>
"I will accept anything... This is my own fault. I don't want to trouble my friends anymore," Xie Lei took a deep breathe as he said calmly.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen nodded, looking rather pleased.</br>
</br>
"Since you have agreed, then your request is easy. After everything is done, your friends can leave."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused as he asked lightheartedly.</br>
</br>
"How do you usually communicate with Black Tiger. By phone?"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 167: Following the vine</br>
</div></br>
Black Tiger; real name, Zhang Hao. A premium member of the Han Hacker Alliance but his skill was rather ordinary. However, by coincidence, he managed to enter the personal computer of the renowned Green Bird and collected some critical evidence.</br>
</br>
When Xie Lei found out, it was too late. Zhang Hao already saved the information and pulled the cord.</br>
</br>
It was the most shameless way, but that was the most effective way. Regardless of how insane one's computer skill was, there was nothing one can do if the other person doesn't connect to the web.</br>
</br>
After that, he had reached the "peak of his life." He controlled the personal information of the third-ranked hacker in the Han Hacker Alliance. He used this to blackmail him into completing challenging missions and then collecting the lucrative commission for himself.</br>
</br>
Not long ago he received a deal.</br>
</br>
5 million RMB commission. The mission was to hack into &lt;New Era&gt;'s server, delete all user information, and delete the game data inside the game's server.</br>
</br>
5 million! It was enough to live half of his life in comfort.</br>
</br>
Black Tiger's eyes immediately turned red as he accepted the mission without hesitation, and then flung it to the hands of Xie Lei and threatened him to complete it. As to if Xie Lei had the ability to finish this mission, Black Tiger never questioned it for a single second.</br>
</br>
In his eyes, if he could hack into the server of an organization with a notorious reputation, there was no way he couldn't take care of a server of a private enterprise.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, Xie Lei was completely out of sorts.</br>
</br>
When he was forced into the corner, Xie Lei had to take the riskiest route.</br>
</br>
And because of this, Xie Lei managed to get himself into serious trouble.</br>
</br>
In the morning, what woke Black Tiger from his sweet dream was his ringtone.</br>
</br>
He drowsily picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
Doooo-.</br>
</br>
The phone hung up?</br>
</br>
Black Tiger was lost for a moment as he looked confusingly at the phone. However, he didn't bother finding out who it was as he fell asleep again.</br>
</br>
What he didn't know was, the second he picked up the phone, his coordinates were marked on a map.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The person named Black Tiger was also in Wanghai City. This saved Jiang Chen quite a bit of trouble.</br>
</br>
He drove the car onto the highway as he looked at the dot on the GPS. A mocking smile appeared on his face. Ayesha was sitting in the front passenger seat, her long eyelashes swept together and eyes closed as she rested.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei sat in the back seat. The teen took off his hood and revealed a sickly pale face with anxiousness written all over it. As well, on his neck, he wore an electronic collar.</br>
</br>
"Now that you are on your way to see your enemy, how do you feel?" Jiang Chen casually asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
"...If possible, I want to punch him," Xie Lei mustered in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Haha, you'll have the chance." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Yan Xiaoyan and the gang were still locked in the mansion's basement. Before the whole event is resolved, they weren't allowed to leave.</br>
</br>
As to Xie Lei, he already reached an agreement with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen won't go after his friends, and in exchange, he'll work for Jiang Chen for the next ten years.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen needed a talent capable of cyber warfare. Although Yao Yao's computer skill was impeccable, he couldn't bring it over to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Three days later, Xie Lei will be flying to Niger. There, someone will pick him up. To maximize his ability, he'll receive military training for half a year, and learn more advanced computer knowledge.</br>
</br>
The source of the advanced computer knowledge naturally came from the digital library in the apocalypse. As to how advanced, around ten years more advanced than the modern world. Although Jiang Chen was clueless, Yao Yao would organize the information for him.</br>
</br>
As to his sister Xie Lin, Jiang Chen will pay to send her to Frankberg to receive the most advanced eye treatment.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, I think you are quite similar to the typical protagonist in a novel," Jiang Chen glanced at Xie Lei in the mirror as he joked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Xie Lei looked confusedly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Both parents are busy. You have a sister and an apartment."</br>
</br>
"...Both of my parents are not busy. They passed away a long time ago. This joke is not funny." A gloom fell over the teen's face.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, sorry. Let's try another one? Let me think... King of special forces, possess a unique ability, returned to city after ten years-"</br>
</br>
"I think you are more similar to a protagonist," Xie Lei abruptly interrupted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Do I?" Jiang Chen subconsciously asked rhetorically but was astonished.</br>
</br>
Eh? Pretty f*cking similar.</br>
</br>
The target was not too far from the Mingxing Area. Another hour drive before the three arrived at their destination.</br>
</br>
The six-story high apartments lined up in rows. The dull and unruly grass looked like it hasn't been taken care of for a long time. From any angle, the community was average.</br>
</br>
Because they went during work hours, there was not a lot of people in the community. Therefore, there was no one standing on the balcony looking curiously at the three people.</br>
</br>
However, they only knew Black Tiger's coordinates; they could not precisely locate his room.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen had other ways to determine the precise location.</br>
</br>
He stood under the apartment as he signaled Ayesha, who already went upstairs, and called Black Tiger's number again.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" A male voice yawning transmitted from the other side of the phone.</br>
</br>
Ayesha held the signal jammer as she gradually moved up floor by floor.</br>
</br>
"Hello. Do you make fake IDs? Can I get 10? Are you trustworthy?" Jiang Chen threw a bunch of questions in his face.</br>
</br>
"What?" Black Tiger was dumbfounded as he held the phone completely clueless.</br>
</br>
"I thought you made fake IDs! Your number is written on the wall. And that's why I called..." Jiang Chen used a serious tone as he continued to make up elaborate lies. Xie Lei, standing beside him, raised his eyebrows as he could not bear to watch any more of this.</br>
</br>
"You are f*cking ret*rded-"</br>
</br>
The voice ceased. Though, at the same time, Ayesha was holding the signal jammer, standing in front of Apt 402.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone, waved at Xie Lei, and went upstairs.</br>
</br>
"Go knock." Jiang Chen patted Xie Lei's shoulder.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei hesitated for a moment before walking up and knocking on the door.</br>
</br>
"Who is it?" Following the voice, footsteps could be heard gradually approaching. Then, the door quickly popped open.</br>
</br>
A man in his 30s peaked his messy-haired head out. The unshaven face looked sloppy, the sleepy eyes indicated that he had yet to wake up, and his right hand was holding onto a phone.</br>
</br>
When he saw Xie Lei's face, his expression instantly changed.</br>
</br>
"Looks like it is him." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect someone with a pseudo name as cool as Black Tiger to be someone this wretched.</br>
</br>
Black Tiger immediately tried to slam the door shut. But, one of Xie Lei's foot was already wedged inside, and he simultaneously lifted his right hand to prevent the door from closing.</br>
</br>
His fist then forcefully smashed into Black Tiger's nose, making him fall backward with a "Bam" as he hit the shoe rack.</br>
</br>
"You, what are you doing? Wait, how did you find me here?" Black Tiger looked in horror at the enraged teen sitting on top of him.</br>
</br>
"F*ck you!" Blowing the anger off of his chest, Xie Lei threw another punch right at the disgusting face.</br>
</br>
Black Tiger desperately tried to fend him off, but Xie Lei already acquired the "geographical advantage". His punches, from up to down, made it impossible for Black Tiger to fight back as his face had the take every single punch.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei breathed heavily as he gritted his teeth and raised his hand once again.</br>
</br>
But this time, Jiang Chen held onto it.</br>
</br>
"Enough. If you keep hitting him, he will die."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Xie Lei stared at the faintly breathing Black Tiger as he finally stopped.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked speechlessly at the bruised up Black Tiger as he let out a troubled sigh.</br>
</br>
"Whatever. It's hard to interrogate you now in this condition. Just put on some medicine."</br>
</br>
Black Tiger didn't see Jiang Chen's face which saved him a lot of trouble. Although truth-telling liquid would make him lose part of his memory, Jiang Chen didn't want to risk it.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who came in last, closed the door. She helped Jiang Chen drag Black Tiger into the living room, tied him to the chair and took out the truth-telling liquid.</br>
</br>
In around a minute's time, the man in his 30s rolled his eyes and stared blankly at the wall in front of him. It looked like the drug was effective.</br>
</br>
Seeing the look on Black Tiger's face, Xie Lei gulped. He thought about how the drug was almost used on him as he felt a shivering chill down his spine.</br>
</br>
"Name?"</br>
</br>
"Zhang Hao." A zombie-like response.</br>
</br>
"Age?"</br>
</br>
"32."</br>
</br>
"32."</br>
</br>
"Who sent you the mission?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know. I registered on an intermediary website. After accepting the mission, the details were sent to my email."</br>
</br>
"What's your email and password?"</br>
</br>
Black Tiger, without resistance, recited out his email and password.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen ignored Black Tiger as he turned to look at Xie Lei with a smile.</br>
</br>
"You first mission is here. Now that you have the email and password, as well as the device that accepted the mission, I want you to find out who the client was."</br>
</br>
Xie Lei shook his head with a troubled smile.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible. Since contact with the client was made through the intermediary website, then the email must be sent on behalf of the website."</br>
</br>
"Then you should hack into the server of the middleman, through the backend, and dig the client out."</br>
</br>
Xie Lei was shocked. Though looking at the stern expression on Jiang Chen's face, he took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"This is crazy! Hacking into the server of the intermediary website for hackers... Let me try."</br>
</br>
"Be bold. There is someone here that's the scapegoat." Jiang Chen glanced at Black Tiger on the chair and laughed delightfully.</br>
</br>
When Xie Lei passed Black Tiger, he stopped and asked him.</br>
</br>
"Where is the evidence used to threaten Green Bird?"</br>
</br>
"On the computer, and on the USB drive that is on the second level of the bookshelf..."</br>
</br>
When he got the answer he needed, Xie Lei walked quickly into Black Tiger's room and managed to find the USB.</br>
</br>
He slammed the USB on the ground and smashed the nightmare that had threatened him for so long into pieces.</br>
</br>
He then found Black Tiger's personal computer. Although the unfamiliar device did not feel smooth, it was not a big deal for a hacker his level.</br>
</br>
He opened the computer and began to furiously type on the keyboard.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
&lt;You haven't played with me for so long, are you just leaving me here?&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen imagined her bitter expression and smiled, as his fingers began to type on the screen.</br>
</br>
&lt;Miss me?&gt;</br>
</br>
Buzz-, the response speed of this girl was still shocking.</br>
</br>
&lt;I have been busy. I made a trip overseas...&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;*Rub head* Busy. Do you need me to reward you? ^_^&gt;</br>
</br>
Seeing the cute emoji, the tip of Jiang Chen's mouth curved up.</br>
</br>
Adorable, can warm the bed, understanding, knows her limits. Although not the best girl to marry, a perfect mistress nonetheless. After coming back from Wanghai University, Jiang Chen paid for her breach of contract so she could gain her "freedom," and also become unemployed.</br>
</br>
Although he did become her sugar daddy, he still never delivered the movie promise...</br>
</br>
&lt;I'll be on a vacation at Pannu Islands soon, do you want to come?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;I do~~&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt exasperated. Though, just as he was about to reply, Xie Lei came out of the room.</br>
</br>
"I found it. This is the phone number and email of the client, based on all signs... The client is Lingyu Technology."</br>
</br>
Lingyu Technology?</br>
</br>
A sneer appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Excellent. Time to take care of this problem."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 168: The Malignant event and Aftermath</br>
</div></br>
October 16, 2015.</br>
</br>
It was not an ordinary day for Lingyu Technology.</br>
</br>
"What is going on? Tell me what is going on!" Ling Zhongtian clung on to Qian Haiming's collar as he roared out with bloodshot eyes.</br>
</br>
Qian Haiming's mouth twitched, but he couldn't say a word.</br>
</br>
"Boss, please, please calm down. Our programmers are fixing the server. I have also called the police, the deputy assured me that he would quickly..."</br>
</br>
"Quickly my *ss!"</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian pushed Qian Haiming away as he breathed heavily. He used one hand to hold onto the table, while the other trembling hand pulled out a drawer and he grabbed his cardiac medication.</br>
</br>
His shaking fingers took several tries before twisting open the cap.</br>
</br>
Finally pouring a few capsules into his hand, Ling Zhongtian stuffed the medication in his mouth and chugged down some water with it.</br>
</br>
He closed his eyes to regather his breath before finally opening them again. His emotions seemed to have calmed down.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the boss was no longer angry, Qian Haiming who stood on the side afraid to talk, finally let out a breath of air.</br>
</br>
But when he raised his head, he was shocked to find that the respectable boss was no longer there.</br>
</br>
The person who replaced him was a pale looking old man that lost his ability to speak.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Morning.</br>
</br>
Players from I am ATM, Dota history logged onto the game as per their usual routine to finish their daily quest. But when they logged in, they were enraged to find out that their account returned to level 0? The diamond they obtained from gold, equipment, and real money...</br>
</br>
Were all f*cking gone?</br>
</br>
There was only a brief explanation posted on the official site regarding this incident.</br>
</br>
&lt;Last night at around midnight, the server received a malicious attack from hackers. Programmers are currently working to restore lost user data and upgrading system security. For the inconvenience it may cause the users, Lingyu Technology express their deepest regret...&gt;</br>
</br>
Deep regret my *ss!</br>
</br>
The enraged players almost blew up Lingyu Technology's customer service. The customer service representatives would receive another call immediately after hanging up.</br>
</br>
However, there was nothing they can do to resolve the complaints of the players since they were not responsible for the operation. They could only follow the procedure of explaining the current situation to the players and asking them to remain calm. As well as assure them that the programmers were currently working to resolve the problem, and for them to please be patient...</br>
</br>
But it was futile. For the millions of angry players, the one hundred customer service representative team was a drop of water in the vast ocean.</br>
</br>
When the angry players saw that the problem was not resolved and that the helpline was constantly busy, they directly dialed 315 to file a violation of rights against Lingyu Technology.</br>
</br>
</br>
They have purchased the diamonds, spent their time leveling up, and now it was all gone?</br>
</br>
However, these complaints were meaningless against Lingyu Technology as at the time of registration, there was a clause added at the bottom to offset such incidents. The final interpretation of this agreement was up to the discretion of the Operator. Also, Han laws were ambiguous when it came to intellectual property protection, rarely would there be a case where players have won a lawsuit against a game operator.</br>
</br>
But the negative reputation caused by the lost user data was hard to erase. Official forums had an influx of complaining players. The moderators had to increase the requirement for posting and began muting and banning people. Not only did this not control the status quo, but the players without a place to express their rage also began to flood into other forums.</br>
</br>
Major BBS (1) forums were all pulled into the midst of this event, as the few justice seeking posts were instantly upvoted to the top.</br>
</br>
Every post under the influence of the internet army unified their statement, and in the name of holiness, began a crusade on the evil operator.</br>
</br>
Protecting their rights!</br>
</br>
Everyone selectively chose to forget that Lingyu Technology was also a victim; the real person that made them suffer losses was the hacker that attacked the server.</br>
</br>
As to how it escalated to this point, the internet army had their fair share of contribution. Once they swayed the opinion during the first outburst of anger, there was not much suspense in the remaining battle.</br>
</br>
Lingyu Technology not only lost in skill but also public opinion.</br>
</br>
The players part of the internet crusade realized that the operator did not compensate for their loss. The promised "1000 crystals for every player" could not compensate the loss of the players that paid for 2000.</br>
</br>
The project department's "lack of action" and the customer service's perfunctory were interpreted as arrogance.</br>
</br>
In the midst of disappointment and anger among the players, seeing that their votes by hands were useless, they began to vote with their feet.</br>
</br>
The crusade ended, because they had already given up on the game. Instead, they chose a better mobile game.</br>
</br>
There were better games on the market. The only reason they stood their ground on an almost out of date game was because of the emotional attachment, as well as the time and money sunk into it. But emotional attachment was certainly a fragile thing as the attitude and response of the operator indeed broke the heart of the players that stood their ground.</br>
</br>
Seeing the account that they spent countless hours on being erased was more painful than seeing the game being shut down completely.</br>
</br>
Based on market analysis, the server operated by Lingyu Technology lost 89% of their users due to this data postage. While the servers operated by other companies did not receive a malicious attack, the after effect of the event resulted in a significant amount of users being lost.</br>
</br>
As if in one night, the Lingyu Technology that forged miracles collapsed.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the new Future Technology was using its era-defining - &lt;New Era&gt; to rise to dominance.</br>
</br>
The stars seemed to have aligned.</br>
</br>
New Era was foretelling the end of the old era.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Within the international airport at Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
"Come back early..." Yan Xiaoyan's eyes were brimming with tears. She gently bit her lip as she gazed into the teen's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. I will." Xie Lei felt his face burn from her stare.</br>
</br>
Zhang Chao hooked onto his neck with a smirk, "Nice buddy. When did you get together with Xiaoyan. She is so violent-"</br>
</br>
A deathly stare shot over as Zhang Chao backed away, causing a forced a laugh.</br>
</br>
"Sorry...."</br>
</br>
Xie Lin frightenedly stood behind Xie Lei and held onto her brother's hand.</br>
</br>
It was her first time being on a plane. Though she has also never seen plane before.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei seemed to have sensed his sister's anxiousness as he gently squeezed her hand. The pale face that lacked sunlight displayed an unfitting tenderness.</br>
</br>
With her head lowered and face blushing, Xie Lin had a lot of things to tell her brother, but she could only faintly squeeze out one word.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Xie Lei had a relieved smile as he rubbed his sister's head.</br>
</br>
He didn't know when Lu Dahu walked up to him put felt him pat his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Take care."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Xie Lei nodded firmly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the group of four from afar as he exclaimed arrogantly, acting on his seniority, "It's good to be young."</br>
</br>
Ayesha who stood beside him tilted her head. Her cold face displayed a confused expression.</br>
</br>
The goodbye was over.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei took his sister's hand, took a deep breath, and walked in Jiang Chen's direction.</br>
</br>
"Ready?" Jiang Chen smiled amiably.</br>
</br>
Although this teen did orchestrate a plan against him, surprisingly he did not hold any grudges.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because he didn't suffer any material damage? Or perhaps because he thought this person wasn't inherently bad. Regardless, the actual people that should be punished was already punished.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Xie Lei nodded and then bowed while looking at him genuinely. "Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem. You can think of it as an exchange." Jiang Chen pointed at the electronic collar around his neck.</br>
</br>
Although it was an electronic collar, it was not thick. It was only a thin layer of silica gel, which didn't make it uncomfortable to wear. It would also easily pass through security screening, a convenient tool.</br>
</br>
Xie Lin looked curiously in her brother's direction and then in Jiang Chen's direction. Then, the adorable young face displayed a tender smile. She cutely bowed too as she said in a still childish voice.</br>
</br>
"Thank you~"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that the color of her pupils was faint, as if it was covered by a thick layer of film.</br>
</br>
Even though she couldn't see, she could blossom a smile this powerful?</br>
</br>
"No problem," Jiang Chen kneeled down and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed Xie Lei staring right at him. He paused for a second before he began to laugh.</br>
</br>
"Are you really a Meiko (Japanese culture, someone who likes their own sister)." He stood up, patted the slim shoulder of the teen and said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
The teen didn't answer, but rather looked away with a flushed face.</br>
</br>
Xie Lin tilted her head as she confusedly pulled on Xie Lei's hand. She was still not at the age where she understood the meaning of Meiko.</br>
</br>
"Haha, be assured. Train while you are there. Get more tanned, and you will look more lively." Jiang Chen used force when he patted the teen's back. "When you get to Niger, there will be someone waiting for you at the airport. You can call him Uncle Ivan, he'll be responsible for training you like a man."</br>
</br>
"What do you mean like-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Xie Lei's protest as he interrupted him, "You and your sister will stay for a day in Niger, then your sister will head to Charlotte Hospital in Frankberg under the supervision of advanced caregivers. That's enough. Stop standing around and go, now."</br>
</br>
"... Thank you."</br>
</br>
"Don't waste time, go board now."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Seeing the departing silhouette of the brother and sister, Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed, and the corner of his mouth curled up.</br>
</br>
"What Ayesha, do you have any questions?" Jiang Chen noticed her rubbing her hair and the confusion in her eyes.</br>
</br>
Face slightly red, Ayesha asked hesitantly, "They are your enemy. Why did you let them go, and on top of that help them..."</br>
</br>
"Not every enemy is a real enemy." Eyes narrowed, Jiang Chen watched the brother and sister board and left Ayesha a confusing answer.</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head, she didn't quite understand the meaning behind it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out his phone and called Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"Get the legal documents prepared. We are going to change our headquarters." When he said that, a bright smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
For the real enemy, he will show no mercy.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 169: You should thank me</br>
</div></br>
The earthquake has yet to settle 15 days after the Lingyu Technology data hostage incident that shocked the country's mobile game industry,</br>
</br>
The perpetrator's intention was extreme malicious and didn't leave any ground for recovery.</br>
</br>
Despite how hard the Lingyu Technology programmer tried, he couldn't manage to recover the lost user information. Based on industry experts' estimations, Lingyu Technology's direct loss was as high as 1.4 billion RMB, the magnitude of the indirect damage was even harder to quantify given the scale.</br>
</br>
Regardless, the well-praised brand built through time has been tarnished. Even if Lingyu Technology tried to separate gamer operation from its business focus and shift to primarily game development, it would still be futile.</br>
</br>
No matter how good the game was, players refused to buy into it for no reasons other than the fact that the game came from Lingyu Technology. Without players, no operator would dare to carry the game.</br>
</br>
The game data was lost out of nowhere. Even if Lingyu Technology was a victim, why were their servers the only ones down while the others were fine? Couldn't they spend more money increasing the security of the servers?</br>
</br>
All in all, once the reputation had spread out, it was impossible to erase. Even the long-term partner of Lingyu Technology, 361 Corporation, maintained a cautious attitude with the newly developed game.</br>
</br>
This malicious internet crime not only shook the industry, the ripple even spread to other aspects.</br>
</br>
The angry players clearly escalated the incident, once the industry news became a society topic, bureaus had to respond to the situation.</br>
</br>
Internet security was once again put on the table.</br>
</br>
&lt;Renren News&gt; published a headline that condemned the usage of criminal attack using hacking technology. It also indicated that the bureaus are currently in discussion for improving the law...</br>
</br>
At the same time, the investigation is currently ongoing. A team of internet security experts was quickly formed.</br>
</br>
The attackers' IP was quickly locked. Even after layers of masking, it still didn't escape the tracking of experts. Regardless of how skillful the hackers are, as long as they are here, they must leave some sort of clue.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hao, the Black Tiger, was quickly arrested. Although he cluelessly indicated that he was not involved, he still couldn't prove his innocence.</br>
</br>
The computer conducting the crime was found in his room.</br>
</br>
The frightened Zhang Hao frantically confessed the deal with Ling Zhongtian and Xie Lei. He insisted that he was framed and that it must have been Xie Lei. He was the third-ranked "Green Bird" on the hacker alliance. Only he had the ability to hack into Lingyu Technology's servers.</br>
</br>
But it was useless, he couldn't provide evidence.</br>
</br>
When he found out that the USB on his shelf disappeared, and the evidence stored in his computer vanished, Zhang Chao was completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
</br>
Because Xie Lei already left the country with the reason of taking his sister to Germany for medical treatments, there was not enough evidence to prove his intent despite the suspicious source of funding. Xie Lei's personal account did not change, only a securitized foreign account paid for the plane tickets and the medical expense. Although the action was mysterious in nature, mysteriousness could not be used as evidence.</br>
</br>
After spending a long time gathering evidence, the investigating team couldn't find any connection between the event and Xie Lei. However, they did find something interesting.</br>
</br>
A few days ago, there was an illegal deal between Zhang Hao and Ling Zhongtian. A deal to attack Future Technology's servers...</br>
</br>
However, the mission was canceled from Zhang Hao's side, the reason being the commission was too low. Of course, he had no recollection of this. The explanation behind this is simple - because Xie Lei used his computer, logged on his account, and canceled the quest.</br>
</br>
The case was closed.</br>
</br>
The perpetrator, Zhang Hao, terminated the contract because of the commission conflict with Lingyu Technology's president, Ling Zhongtian. Therefore, he infiltrated Lingyu Technology's server, and permanently deleted the user data which caused an insurmountable amount of economic loss to Lingyu Technology. Based on the extreme negative influence caused by society and the high value associated with the case, the supreme court's verdict was a life sentence.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hao appealed, but the supreme court directly rejected the plead for appeal and maintained the verdict.</br>
</br>
As for Ling Zhongtian, although he conducted illegal activity, it was merely an unsuccessful attempt, and thus it was hard to define the nature of the crime. He was not sentenced under the law for this reason.</br>
</br>
But it was yet to be over. Ling Zhongtian's hiring of a hacker to attack Future Technology was quickly exposed online by "conscientious people" and Ling Zhongtian's identity instantly changed from the victim to the villain.</br>
</br>
Those who previously felt sympathy for him immediately turned against him and joined the new round of internet crusade against Lingyu Technology.</br>
</br>
Of course, a small amount of voices suggested that it could be the conspiracy of Future Technology. After all, the collapse of the long-time industry leader Lingyu Technology, would benefit them the most. Of course, those voices were quickly labeled as conspirators and they vanished in the waves of public debate.</br>
</br>
With Future Technology's ability, why would they need to have a conspiracy against the competition? Lingyu Technology's shit*ty games are comparable to &lt;New Era&gt;?</br>
</br>
The quite interest thing was that the people defending Future Technology were the hardcore fans of Dota history and I am ATM. Because they cared so much, they hated it even more. When they were so disappointed at Lingyu Technology and decided to give Future Technology's &lt;New Era&gt; out of boredom, they instantly realized that the game they defended for was a pile of sh*t. Therefore, Future Technology easily took the influx of Lingyu Technology players and the number of registration broke through 50 million with an estimated revenue breaking through 400 million RMB, shattering two records in the mobile game industry consecutively.</br>
</br>
Its dominance could not be challenged.</br>
</br>
The victory was already decided on the main battlefield, but the crossfire had yet to cease.</br>
</br>
Following the series of negative press and the direct result of downward pressure on revenue, Lingyu Technology's stock price triggered 10 consecutive circuit breaks and led the index in stock depreciation as the poorest performance company after the June stock market collapse.</br>
</br>
The total market cap was slashed off by 70% and broke through 1.5 billion. To avoid triggering loan clauses, Lingyu Technology had to increase collateral assets and pledged the about to be completed Lingyu building at the value of 530 million to the bank before it finally stopped the plunge.</br>
</br>
Deep in red and excessive loan, Lingyu Technology was pushed into the corner without any solution.</br>
</br>
But at the time, Future Technology began making its moves.</br>
</br>
First, Future Technology published a statement on its official site to directly respond to the public opinion and condemn the majority shareholders Ling Zhongtian's illegal action against Future Technology, and officially sent the lawyer letter to Ling Zhongtian.</br>
</br>
Was Future Technology prepared to sue Lingyu Technology? Regardless of the result of the lawsuit, investors were hopeless with Lingyu Technology's future.</br>
</br>
The next day, Lingyu Technology once again triggered the circuit breaker. Four days later, Lingyu Technology ended the week with 980 million market cap. Within four short days, Lingyu Technology lost the value of a building. To avoid triggering the clause, Ling Zhongtian had to increase the pledged asset, this time it was 33% of his share.</br>
</br>
He had no other choice, if he didn't pledge in more asset, the company would be forced to go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. When that happens, not only will he lose everything, he will also have to carry a debt of 300 million.</br>
</br>
The about to be completed Lingyu building costed 870 million and it was built with debt. The new game development and promotion had eaten away most of the profit, from the current status quo, the investments were unrecoverable.</br>
</br>
The lawyer letter was like declaring war. It only ignited the prelude to the battle.</br>
</br>
When Lingyu Technology broke the record for the highest monthly decrease, Future Technology's president began to increase Lingyu Technology's share on the secondary market and became the biggest shareholder at 37%. Because it was not disclosed, Jiang Chen was fined 600 thousand by the security commission for an illegal transaction.</br>
</br>
But comparable to the profit he gained by shorting Lingyu Technology, the punishment was pocket change to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Lingyu Technology ultimately changed hand.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Lingyu Technology building had yet to finish the renovation, but under the demand of the new president, they organized a conference room with a row of table and chairs.</br>
</br>
Also based on the demand of the new president, a special shareholder meeting was announced.</br>
</br>
As to the identity of the new president, it was obviously Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Every shareholder's face was gloom... No, to be more precise, other than the people sitting at the end of the table, everyone's face was gloom.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned against the chair as he scanned all the shareholders present. Other than the Ling Zhongtian with white hair, he was surprised to find someone he knew.</br>
</br>
Sensing Jiang Chen's sight, Zhang Jianfeng smiled friendly at him.</br>
</br>
[Why is he here?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still had some impression with Zhang Jianfeng. He represented 361 Corporation before during the negotiation with Future Technology. Although nothing came to fruition, in the end, Jiang Chen had high praises regarding this talent.</br>
</br>
361 Corporation want to be involved in this?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered in his mind, but his expression didn't change in the slightest. He still maintained the bright smile and started speaking.</br>
</br>
"Everyone, I think you should all thank me."</br>
</br>
[Thank your mom!]</br>
</br>
All the shareholders cursed in their mind, but no one dared to speak out loud. As to why-</br>
</br>
"If it wasn't for me to increase the holding of your company's share which halted the plunge of Lingyu Technology's share price, the share in your hands would be scrap paper." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian slowly looked over, the aged face no longer resembled this once proud prodigy. He once made his goal to become the Steve Jobs of mobile games, but in those blurred eyes, there was only a deep weariness left.</br>
</br>
"To be the meat on someone's chopping board is to be at someone's mercy." The cracked lips opened and squeezed a sentence full of hatred.</br>
</br>
"If you knew today would happen, why did you do it." Jiang Chen directly responded.</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian was out of words and didn't say anything else, he just stared at the document on the table and blanked out.</br>
</br>
&lt;Lingyu Technology Asset Restructure Proposal&gt;</br>
</br>
"Ahem, based on the current performance of the company, as the President, I think I should do something," he paused, Jiang Chen looked at the crowd holding their breath, a faint smile flashed across his face. But then the following sentence he said made every shareholder's mood plunge into the abyss.</br>
</br>
"That's right. We are planning to initiate asset restructure... So first, I plan to sell the building-"</br>
</br>
Who to sell it to? Is that even a question?</br>
</br>
Left hand to right hand, Future Technology needed a headquarter fitting for its name.</br>
</br>

"This is impossible! You can’t do this!"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, please don’t bring your personal grudges into the shareholder meeting. I understand differences exist between you and ex-president Ling Zhongtian…"</br>
</br>
"This is called asset restructuring? This is robbery! Your motion will not be passed. Even if you are the biggest shareholder, Lingyu Technology will not permit you to do whatever you wish!"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sipped from his tea on the table. Then, he sank into the chair relaxingly with his eyes narrowed, looking at the outraged shareholders. His gaze stopped on Ling Zhongtian for a brief moment, but the old man didn’t look at him. He was still gravely staring at the documents on the table.</br>
</br>
He had already lost hope.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he looked at the only person calmly sitting there – Zhang Jianfeng.</br>
</br>
361 Corporation held 5% of Lingyu Technology. Although the ownership percentage was not high, it must have been purchased at a premium. This time Lingyu Technology’s share plummet definite had an impact on 361 Corporation.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, as the third-party platform, 361 Corporation operated the servers for Dota under the consent of Lingyu Technology. Although 361 Corporation’s server didn’t suffer the same fate as the permanent loss of Lingyu Technology’s user data, it certainly was negatively affected.</br>
</br>
As the representative sent by 361 Corporation, Jiang Chen didn’t quite understand the motive behind Zhang Jianfeng's smiling face.</br>
</br>
What is 361 Corporation thinking?</br>
</br>
But regardless of what they had in mind, Jiang Chen was going to put the final nail in the coffin for Lingyu Technology.</br>
</br>
"Before the vote, I want everyone to consider this. Lingyu Technology has fallen from cloud nine and has become an unprofitable corporation. Without exaggeration, it is facing the risk of being delisted. However, I am still here. If I leave, do you know what that means? After the shareholders meeting, the stock will resume trading this afternoon. Whether it is going up or going down, would be based on the decision of everyone here."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s words turned everyone, but Zhang Jianfeng, pale.</br>
</br>
Because of the shareholders meeting, the temporary suspension of the stock garnered a chance for Lingyu Technology to breathe. Furthermore, Jiang Chen’s recent increase in his holdings definitely added a shot of adrenaline to the investors. If it became a signal for using Lingyu Technology as a shell company to list, after Lingyu Technology consecutive circuit breaks, it would be unrealistic for the stock to skyrocket.</br>
</br>
But if the restructuring plan failed, and Jiang Chen decreases his holding of Lingyu Technology, then it would be adding salt to Lingyu Technology’s already massive wound. Once the stock resumed trading this afternoon, Lingyu Technology would not be able to escape the fate of its continuous freefall.</br>
</br>
</br>
Therefore, whether or not the stock in all the shareholder's hands become a piece of scrap paper would be at the discretion of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
At this time, someone stood up and threatened, "361 Corporation is also one of the shareholders, even if you forfeit your shares, they will start-"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, 361 Corporation maintains the same stance as the new president. If President Jiang chooses to decrease his holding, for 361 Corporation, your company will lose its investment value." Zhang Jianfeng shattered that person’s fantasy.</br>
</br>
Seeing the person sit down at a complete loss, Jiang Chen looked at Zhang Jianfeng in surprise, but he didn’t say anything.</br>
</br>
"If there are no other opinions, let's start the voting process," Jiang Chen announced as he scanned everyone in the room.</br>
</br>
After the death like announcement, all the shareholders cast their dispirited vote.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The proposal passed without a doubt. Only Ling Zhongtian voted against it.</br>
</br>
The restructuring plan was as follows:</br>
</br>
First, Lingyu Technology is renamed Chenfeng Entertainment.</br>
</br>
Lingyu Technology will sell the about-to-be-completed Lingyu Technology building at a price of 600 million, and also bear the obligation for debt repayment.</br>
</br>
Because of a major error caused by his decision, ex-president Ling Zhongtian will be removed as a shareholder following company protocol, a vote where greater than two-thirds of shareholders agree, and his held shares will be forcefully transferred to other shareholders at market price.</br>
</br>
Based on the distribution plan negotiated, Jiang Chen’s shares will increase to 40%, 361 Corporation’s holding changes to 21%, becoming the second-largest shareholder.</br>
</br>
Everyone knew Ling Zhongtian would lose a lot once the restructuring is complete. It would not be impossible to recover the market cap, but no one wanted to speak to him.</br>
</br>
Ling Zhongtian accepted the result in silence. He shakenly stood up from his spot and left the office.</br>
</br>
Everything here had nothing to do with him anymore.</br>
</br>
He started to feel regret, but what could regret do now?</br>
</br>
Business is like a battlefield. Any mercy could be fatal.</br>
</br>
After the partnership with Future Technology and 361 Corporation, Lingyu Corporation’s future would be bright.</br>
</br>
But why would that matter? It had nothing to do with him anymore.</br>
</br>
He received the same fate as the Steve Jobs he idolizes, leaving the company he started. The only difference was, he could never come back.</br>
</br>
Seeing the trembling figure leave, Jiang Chen fell deep in thought.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When the meeting ended, the shareholders began to leave, but Zhang Jianfeng stayed behind.</br>
</br>
As if Jiang Chen expected him to stay, he also remained seated and looked at him with a smile.</br>
</br>
"We meet again, President Jiang." Zhang Jianfeng walked toward Jiang Chen and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
In less than two months’ time, Future Technology has already developed to the point where they could sit equally on the same table.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. What do you think of the hand I had just played?" Jiang Chen shook Zhang Jianfeng's hand as he smiled mischievously.</br>
</br>
"Ruthless," Zhang Jianfeng only gave a one-word response.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed as he leaned on the chair, not responding.</br>
</br>
If Ling Zhongtian successfully destroyed Future Technology’s server data, he would definitely do the same thing.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, that was the reality of things.</br>
</br>
"With a thunderous stance, a critical hit was given to his opponent, worthy of the name "dictator", was the headline of BBC."</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhang is overrating me." The odd time Jiang Chen was humble.</br>
</br>
"But President Jiang doesn’t think this decision lack consideration?" Zhang Jianfeng pulled up a chair and sat beside Jiang Chen as he began to talk in a casual tone.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen responded in a disagreeing tone.</br>
</br>
"Are you involved with Lingyu Technology’s server?"</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"The security system was customized by 361 Corporation."</br>
</br>
"That’s unfortunate. Ling Zhongtian only bought insurance for the server but didn’t buy it for the game's data. Would you pay the penalty for this?"</br>
</br>
"For the loss of data, our programmers have already provided support to the police," Zhang Jianfeng casually said.</br>
</br>
"Isn’t the hacker already caught?" Jiang Chen also responded in a nonchalant tone.</br>
</br>
"There is a hacker called Xie Lei. He has been in contact with Black Tiger before." Zhang Jianfeng locked his eyes onto Jiang Chen’s.</br>
</br>
"You are still bloating like usual, but you know it is useless on me." Jiang Chen picked up the teacup on the table as he smiled at him.</br>
</br>
Funny. Would the contact person be enough to confirm a crime? If so, it would be a pity for those people.</br>
</br>
Without evidence, everything was bullsh*t.</br>
</br>
The silence ensued for half a minute.</br>
</br>
"President Jiang doesn’t seem to care about the interest of Lingyu Technology?" Zhang Jianfeng’s topic suddenly changed as he looked in the direction of the door.</br>
</br>
"Do you think &lt;New Era&gt; needs the resources of Lingyu Technology? We already controlled the high grounds of the market," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly as he put down the cup in his hand.</br>
</br>
[The best part is about to come.]</br>
</br>
"Would you not consider a partnership? If it utilized 361 Phone Helper’s platform, &lt;New Era&gt;’s user base would climb to new heights."</br>
</br>
"&lt;New Era&gt; currently will not consider opening third-party servers," Jiang Chen rejected expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
[Funny. Not only would it involve cloud computing, but even if I gave the game to you, without the modified server, maintenance cost alone would make you go deep into the red.]</br>
</br>
"Since President Jiang is confident that you can control the premium game market, what’s your opinion on casual games?"</br>
</br>
Even with the existing high-quality premium games, casual games have not lost their market.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen obviously considered pushing out a few casual games like Angry Birds, and Temple Run, but the plan was never fulfilled.</br>
</br>
The reason was simply that those games depended on creativity, not software. Although the apocalypse’s technology was impeccable, it was pointless for casual games. Future Technology didn’t possess any talents in game development. Therefore, the plan had to be rejected.</br>
</br>
But Zhang Jianfeng brought it up again.</br>
</br>
"You mean?" Jiang Chen was quite interested.</br>
</br>
"We can work together." Zhang Jianfeng crossed his finger and genuinely looked at Jiang Chen. "Lingyu Technology, no, Chenfeng Entertainment. Right now, it is a company we control together right? We can definitely collaborate together with our talent base, and start a new project with the main focus being on the downstream market. Using 361 Phone Helper and Future 1.0, we could use both channels to promote it."</br>
</br>
"With the power of the two companies, we can easily split the entire mobile game market!" In the end, Zhang Jianfeng was almost annunciating word by word.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a second before he started laughing.</br>
</br>
"Did you selectively choose to ignore Baidu and Tencent?"</br>
</br>
"On the mobile platform, our ability is no less than any of them. Maybe President Jiang should be more confident with our alliance." Zhang Jianfeng smiled.</br>
</br>
"I don’t plan on giving this building up." Jiang Chen stared at the ceiling.</br>
</br>
"Of course, as a trophy. The fact that it belongs to you now won’t change."</br>
</br>
The building with a cost of 870 million was sold at a discount of 600 million. They were at least the second-biggest shareholder of Chenfeng Entertainment, 361 Corporation was certainly willing to cut the lost.</br>
</br>
"What about the previous Chenfeng employees?" Jiang Chen asked softly.</br>
</br>
He originally planned to cut them completely, but now it seemed like it would be a waste to not use them.</br>
</br>
"Work at the previous location? Or lease a floor in this building? It would be your decision." Zhang Jianfeng had a bright smile on because he knew Jiang Chen was tempted.</br>
</br>
No one would reject a cake that was put right in front of their mouth.</br>
</br>
"If you brought up the partnership, in the beginning, we could have worked together a long time ago." Jiang Chen suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"But it is still not too late right?" Zhang Jianfeng got up, extending his right hand once again.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. Because I think we should split this market."</br>
</br>
Also standing up, Jiang Chen held onto the extended hand with a triumphant smile on his face.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 171: The Preparation before returning to the Apocalypse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The same afternoon, Lingyu Technology announced a statement. The shareholders passed the restructuring proposal. Ling Zhongtian was removed from the board, the company was officially renamed Chenfeng Entertainment, and the company's stock would remain suspended until the completion of its asset restructuring.</br>
</br>
The news spread to all the shareholders like a long due storm finally passing a draught-dried land, and they began cheering. The people that cut their loss were depressed by their decision of not having confidence in the company...</br>
</br>
All in all, these people thought of Jiang Chen as Jesus Christ.</br>
</br>
Future Technology and 361 Corporation both possessed shares. One has been valued at over a billion by Wall Street Analysts at its inception, while one was already listed on Nasdaq with a market cap of over ten billion.</br>
</br>
It left too many people too much room for the imagination.</br>
</br>
Graciously, Jiang Chen made headline again.</br>
</br>
The young billionaire once again enters people's vision. The charming smile, the calm attitude, attracting the heart of countless girls...</br>
</br>
Ok, they really don't care about Jiang Chen's looks.</br>
</br>
Being famous didn't seem to create too much of a hassle in his life. Different from celebrities in the entertainment industry, most of his fans were very rationale.</br>
</br>
The people that want to marry into wealthy would not flap towards him like bees. It would be too unclassy. They would often pretend to be a frail and innocent girl, "encountering" him under his building, and "accidentally" starting a "rich CEO fell in love with me" drama...</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, Jiang Chen was known to not go to work and the community he lived in was also somewhere random people could not enter. Their plan ultimately would fail.</br>
</br>
The "irrational" fans used the security team in the community to sent him love letters and attached a duck face selfie inside.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen at first was looking forward to reading the letters to see how the beauties have been conquered by his "charm", and how they have fallen under his jeans. Don't question, Jiang Chen never said he didn't like to hear flattering words.</br>
</br>
But he was quickly bored.</br>
</br>
All the love letters had the same content, revolving around "I want to give you a baby," and "let's hook up?"...</br>
</br>
The directness even made Jiang Chen, who was proud of his lack of boundaries, "shy."</br>
</br>
He gave the rest of letters to Ayesha and told the security to throw all letters of this kind into the garbage. After telling them not to bother him with it, he left this in the back of his mind.</br>
</br>
Han was indeed a deep and profound language. What Jiang Chen meant by taking care of them was to throw them out, but Ayesha interpreted as examination.</br>
</br>
Obviously misunderstanding Jiang Chen's intention, she had the thought of picking another wife for her husband as she patiently read through a few love letters.</br>
</br>
</br>
As a "qualified wife," she will not be jealous towards husband's other partners, she will obediently share with her and take care of him...</br>
</br>
Take back what she said, she also gave up.</br>
</br>
As a "qualified wife", instincts told her that these women have impure motives.</br>
</br>
These love letter finally didn't escape the fate of the paper shredder.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was already November, and based on Miss Sun Jiao's description, the apocalypse must be covered in thick snow.</br>
</br>
But Wanghai City was still sunny and mild. Even deep into the fall, it still didn't feel cold at all.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen not only once had the thought of not going back to the other side.</br>
</br>
Since he already was a winner in his life here.</br>
</br>
Luxurious mansion, top-end car, and beautiful girls. Everything he ever dreamt of was achieved.</br>
</br>
But on the other side, there was only danger.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he relaxingly lied beside his private pool on top of Ayesha's legs and was getting his ears cleaned out for him.</br>
</br>
The side of his face felt the softness of her legs. Her fragrance lingered around his nose. The tip of her hair occasionally brushed across his face and tingled with his heart. The soft and gentle breathing beside his ear...</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! It's done now." A delighted smile appeared on Ayesha's face as she gently blew on Jiang Chen's ear and put away the ear pick.</br>
</br>
"Eh-, done already? A bit more." Because it was so comfortable, it was the odd time Jiang Chen was demanding.</br>
</br>
"But, it's already clean. It would hurt you if I do more," Ayesha said faintly with a blushed face.</br>
</br>
"No problem! Please continue."</br>
</br>
Facing her husband's unreasonable demand, Ayesha face burned as she began debating. Although it was the duty of a "qualified wife" to satisfy the husband's demand, if she continued, it would damage her husband's ear.</br>
</br>
In this case, she must think of a compromising plan...</br>
</br>
"Umm, could I lick it?" She suppressed the shyness in her heart as she whispered into Jiang Chen's ear.</br>
</br>
"?!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, in the sluggish mood, clearly was drawn into it.</br>
</br>
Seeing her husband was interested, Ayesha's face became a deeper shade of red. She looked at the cleaned out ear as she stuck her tongue out and buried her head in it.</br>
</br>
The soft tongue, along with the warm breathe, approached slowly...</br>
</br>
But an untimely phone call interrupted this intimate atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked away with a blushed face, licking someone's ear was too embarrassing for her.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't pretend to be lazy anymore as he got up to pick up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" Jiang Chen picked up with an unpleased tone.</br>
</br>
"Hmm? Voice sounds angry... Did I annoy you?" Liu Yao said coyly.</br>
</br>
"You ruined my good time," Jiang Chen said "fiercely". Ayesha, standing on the side, heard it as her red face turned brighter. She lowered her head, as her mind went elsewhere.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to compensate you?" Liu Yao said energetically.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, what do you mean."</br>
</br>
Oh no, he was hard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned, so his back was facing Ayesha.</br>
</br>
But what he didn't expect was that the blushed Ayesha got closer and stood in front of him.</br>
</br>
A shy but tender smile surfaced on her face as she slowly kneeled down. A pair of smooth hands self-assertedly reached for his clothes.</br>
</br>
"Oooh-!"</br>
</br>
"Why are you making a weird sound?" Liu Yao asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, nothing. Umm, if you have something to tell me, be quick."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not in the most ideal state.</br>
</br>
"It's nothing special. A lot of entertainment companies have sent me invitations to star in movies."</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen accepted Liu Yao as his mistress, Jiang Chen paid the penalty of one million for breach of contract. After that, Liu Yao had been staying at home with nothing to do.</br>
</br>
"Why did you suddenly got famous?"</br>
</br>
"Because of you," Liu Yao said in a sweet voice.</br>
</br>
"Me?" He gazed at the pair of eyes below him as he experienced mental and physical sensation at the same time. Jiang Chen took a deep breath as he almost didn't manage to hold on.</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes, you have a Weibo account right? Other than the default followers, you only followed me, therefore..." Liu Yao's voice sounded frail as if she was afraid Jiang Chen would get angry. So, she carefully said, "Therefore people thought there was something between us... Therefore."</br>
</br>
"Siiiiii... Ah? No, that's fine, I don't care about this news," Jiang Chen squeezed out a few words between his teeth as his hand gently rubbed Ayesha's luscious hair.</br>
</br>
She felt the gentleness on her hair as her blue eyes narrowed happily.</br>
</br>
But then, it was even harder for Jiang Chen to resist.</br>
</br>
"That's great! I was worried that you would not like me doing that anymore because of this..." Liu Yao was delighted.</br>
</br>
"Nope!"</br>
</br>
"Umm, can I go act in a film then? No problem! No kissing scene-" Since she was now his mistress, Liu Yao was afraid Jiang Chen would be jealous.</br>
</br>
"Okay!"</br>
</br>
"And also, the film producer wants to acquire your investment..." Liu Yao carefully asked.</br>
</br>
"Granted!"</br>
</br>
"Love you lots, muaaa~ Oh, when are we going to Pannu Island for vacation. I heard it's summer there all year round... Hmmm? Are you listening?"</br>
</br>
"Yes!" No, Jiang Chen couldn't hold on any longer.</br>
</br>
"Wait," Liu Yao held the phone as her eyes turned suspicious. She suddenly covered her mouth realizing something. "Ah! You must be doing something naughty!"</br>
</br>
"N...No."</br>
</br>
"Wait, no, this sound would not be wrong! You must" She sensed the voice was off.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
Fine. Seeing the gentleness in her eyes, Jiang Chen was too joyful to lie to his body any longer.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
If it were not for the people that he couldn't let go of, he probably wouldn't go back.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen made a trip to Xinlong Food Processing Plant.</br>
</br>
Following his instructions, Zheng Hongjie cleaned out a new warehouse to store the surplus goods. The goods inside would also not be registered on anything. Although he didn't know the boss' intention, he didn't ask.</br>
</br>
But he was not here to acquire food. He already prepared enough food to pass through the winter.</br>
</br>
He directly found Zheng Hongjie and ordered him to arrange the export, and then increase production as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
The deepwater port at Pannu Islands had already been completed, the next step of Island Conquering mission could begin.</br>
</br>
After taking care of the miscellaneous tasks, Jiang Chen headed back to the mansion and started to time travel.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 172"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 172: Winter is coming</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Rather than saying winter was coming, it was more fitting to say winter was here.</br>
</br>
His vision was covered by the monochrome silver as the entire pool was filled with snow. A thick layer of snow covered the mansion, and the edges of the roof were decorated with daunting icicles. Like a castle standing in the northern kingdom. Solemn. Proud.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was not in the mood to enjoy the atmosphere of his mansion. He only wore a thin t-shirt.</br>
</br>
The second he stepped into the apocalypse, he began to shiver uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
[This weather is too f*cking cold.]</br>
</br>
Even with his body condition strengthed by the genetic vaccine, he couldn't withstand it anymore.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen covered his arms with his hand as he dashed into the mansion from the backyard. The last time he was here, he started his time travel beside the pool because he was lazy, but he sure suffered on his way back.</br>
</br>
Different from the extreme conditions outside, the mansion was as warm as spring. The broken wall and window had been long repaired by Sun Jiao, and after a series of modifications and improvements, as long as the window was closed, the mansion would not be bothered by the severe wind chills outside.</br>
</br>
But before he even gained his footing in the mansion, Sun Jiao, who also ran toward him, pushed him onto the sofa.</br>
</br>
"You are finally back." This girl's voice certainly had a hidden bitterness to it.</br>
</br>
"Uh, a lot happened over there." Jiang Chen said apologetically.</br>
</br>
Although it was not entirely accurate, he did become lazy after having to much fun.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen seemed to have sensed something, but she didn't point it out. Her beautiful eyes dreamily gazed into his.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked away as he was shy from the passionate gaze, but he discovered Sun Jiao was holding something in her hand.</br>
</br>
"Eh? What is this?"</br>
</br>
"Ah, this is, umm, this is..." Out of nowhere, Sun Jiao's face immediately turned red as there was a sense of panic to her voice.</br>
</br>
"Towel?" Jiang Chen asked with uncertainty.</br>
</br>
"It's a scarf! Fool!" After seeing her proud work being slandered as a towel, Miss Sun Jiao was immediately enraged.</br>
</br>
The furious Sun Jiao gave a solid punch in Jiang Chen's chest, and then she pulled out the scarf, forcefully putting it around his neck out of shame.</br>
</br>
"Cough cough! Are you trying to strangle me!" Although the softness was continually squeezing onto him because of the violent action, the suffocating feeling around his neck canceled the sensation.</br>
</br>
"Stop, stop moving, just resist a bit longer!" Sun Jiao with a blushed face said fiercely.</br>
</br>
"Wait, why do I have to resist against wearing a scarf-"</br>
</br>
"You are so talkative!"</br>
</br>
After awhile, the scarf was finally put around Jiang Chen's neck.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao got up from Jiang Chen's body with a blushed face as she looked away.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Looks pretty good. It would be even better if you give it to me normally. Especially because this is not how you wear a scarf..." Sun Jiao, with a troubled smile, pulled the scarf around his neck. This girl was clearly confused about the difference between a rope and scarf.</br>
</br>
The pure black scarf was without any pattern. With a beginner's skill, it would be too difficult to put any patterns on it. But being able to knit the scarf was an accomplishment nonetheless.</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's praise, Sun Jiao's eyes immediately lit up. As to the ridicule of "method of tying the scarf," she selectively ignored the sentence.</br>
</br>
"Really! Haha, this is what I am saying. How could I mess up on a scarf." With a red face, and scratching the back of her head, c*ckiness was written all over her face.</br>
</br>
"So why did you think about knitting a scarf?" After putting on the scarf properly, Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Because..." Sun Jiao's mind drifted again. Her face changed to a bright red hue. "In the magazines before the war, it said, girlfriends should knit scarves for their boyfriend. Therefore..."</br>
</br>
"It is not a requirement, or the better way to put it, the girl that is willing to knit a scarf for her boyfriend would be a rare species." Jiang Chen let out a sigh as she smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was quite touched by her.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean a rare species!" Sun Jiao gave Jiang Chen a dirty look.</br>
</br>
"It means adorable," Jiang Chen rushed to explain.</br>
</br>
"Adorable?!" Her expression suddenly softened, and her bright eyes looked around shyly.</br>
</br>
At this time, Jiang Chen suddenly noticed Yao Yao standing on top of the stairs. This small loli pouted her lips as the cute eyes stared straight at the scarf around his neck.</br>
</br>
"Ooo! Too devious..."</br>
</br>
As if she heard the noise in the living room, Lin Lin walked in from the side door with her pure white hair.</br>
</br>
Still not hesitant to bad mouth people.</br>
</br>
"Psh, it's only a dumb devil couple. Why would you guys display affection in the living room? Go close the door and do what you did-." But before she finished, the words were stuck in her throat. A grim sight instantly locked onto her vision as she was forced to swallow her unfinished sentence.</br>
</br>
"Ahem. I think as the owner of the mansion, I need to do something now," Jiang Chen mustered to himself.</br>
</br>
"That's right. For example, building a wooden shack outside for her." A devil-like smile spread on Sun Jiao's face as she also enjoyed the feeling of bullying Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
In the end, she still could not be defiant.</br>
</br>
"You are all bullying me." With tears, Lin Lin escaped back to her room/lab with a sad expression.</br>
</br>
This narcissistic and bad-tempered girl, always instantly forgets to stand her ground.</br>
</br>
Seeing Lin Lin's fleeting figure, a smile appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
[I wonder if she finished her task yet. I'll pick a time to take a look.]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
There was no fireplace in the future. Except for the poorest survivors, no one would use fire to generate heat. Jiang Chen's mansion obviously didn't have that either. The reason the place was so warm was due to the heating grids placed within the wall. This device was extremely convenient, and it would provide heat as long as it was connected to electricity.</br>
</br>
The heat resistant electric wire would not be burned by EMPs. Therefore, the heating grid became one of the few electronic devices that was not destroyed by the nuclear blast.</br>
</br>
In the top floor office, Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao stood together and gazed into the distance.</br>
</br>
The thick snowflakes twirled in the north wind as they raided through every corner of the world. The ice shards that occasionally smashed on the window played a whimpering noise as it crashed into the frozen window.</br>
</br>
Even if he was just looking, he could still feel the coldness that could freeze one's soul.</br>
</br>
"Such heavy snowfall." After a while, Jiang Chen could only produce four words while looking outside.</br>
</br>
"This is not too bad. Usually, it would start snowing in October." In regards to the snow, Sun Jiao's expression was rather calm. "It was rumored that when the war just ended, the entire world was covered by nuclear winter. It was the same cruel scene every day. I wonder how did the people outside of the survival shelters survive."</br>
</br>
Outside of their walls, apartments built with concrete were built for residents of Fishbone base. The Fishbone base that "didn't lack money" would obviously not mistreat its people. Every family was connected with heat and electricity. The life here was so much better than in the ghetto.</br>
</br>
On the empty streets, a pickup truck, modified to be a snow shoveling vehicle, was working hard to push the snow out of the base. The patrol on the wall regularly walked around to watch for any incoming danger. The white winter suit made him look like a snowman carrying a rifle.</br>
</br>
"With a snowstorm this big, the mutated humans shouldn't be able to invade us." Although it certainly was inconvenient to the construction of the base, the thick snowfall gave a hint of tranquility.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of mutated humans, Zhao Gang, who you sent out scouting, brought back some interesting information."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"There are at least three thousand mutated humans in the 7th area. A lot of signs indicate that they are preparing war supplies."</br>
</br>
Every mutated human was a natural warrior. If there were actually three thousand of them, even if they sent one thousand people, it would be an unstoppable force that the Fishbone base could not resist with only a population of two hundred.</br>
</br>
No, it would be difficult even for the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Hopefully this snow will bring them some trouble." Jiang Chen watched the flying snowflakes as a worried expression flashed on his face.</br>
</br>
"Mutated humans are known for their cold resistance. This amount of snow will do nothing to them. We can only pray that this storm will kill more of their slaves. That is the only way that would make things difficult for them," Sun Jian's voice was stern.</br>
</br>
Slaves? Speaking of this, How did the dancers in Jia City survive under the violent force of the mutated human?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he put his thoughts away. Then he asked, "Is that all?"</br>
</br>
"Also, based on Zhao Gang, when he returned from the 7th area, he encountered a group of survivors fleeing from Shenxiang Town."</br>
</br>
"Survivors fleeing?" Jiang Chen touched his chin in thought.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. They originally belong to the survivor groups in Shenxiang Town, but the survivor group was wiped already. Zhao Gang brought them back. I ordered people to keep them outside of the base for now." Sun Jiao nodded before she took out a tablet to show a map to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Shenxiang Town is between Qingpu and 7th area. It is on the Taifu River, a way for the mutated humans to enter Wanghai City. There were around seven hundred survivors there, and because of the lack of mutant activity around the area as well as the lack of external threat, they lacked an organized system. They only established a simple defense outside of the town with a civilian force of 21 people..."</br>
</br>
"Therefore they were enslaved by the mutated humans?" Hearing this, Jiang Chen guessed the outcome.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Sun Jiao nodded, "A force of 40 mutated humans were stationed in Shenxiang Town as they established an out post there. Based on this, they are indeed going to take the route through Shenxiang town to Wanghai City."</br>
</br>
That meant that they would go through Qingpu, not Songjiang.</br>
</br>
It was the worst outcome. Deep in Jiang Chen's heart, he hoped to avoid direct conflict with mutated humans. Even if they really arrived in Carmen Pharmaceutical and obtained the improved FEV virus, they would only torment Jia City.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a deep breath as he asked in a serious tone.</br>
</br>
"What about the seven hundred survivors?"</br>
</br>
"Based on the survivors who are there, because of the snow blocking the roads, they are temporarily imprisoned in Shenxiang Town and have not moved yet." Hearing this, Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Snow blocking the road? A "singled out" mutated human out post.</br>
</br>
Watching the snow on the window, a smile suddenly surfaced on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"This is an opportunity."</br>
</br>
"You mean?"</br>
</br>
"Take them out! Reinforce Shenxiang town's defense, and intercept the mutated human force there, blocking them out of Qingpu!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 173: Kinetic Skeleton</br>
</div></br>
Comparing direct firepower, a soldier wearing a T-3 power armor had no inherent difference to a mutated human with a steel plate covering the front of its body.</br>
</br>
In a one on one scenario, power armor, with its high mobility and adaptability, would quickly take down the almost defenseless back of the mutated human. But if it escalated to a full-scale battle, the power armors advantage would be mitigated as the battle would usually turn into cover fire.</br>
</br>
During the last crossfire with the mutated human, Jiang Chen already learned his lesson.</br>
</br>
The 10 T-3 power armors had no advantage in firepower against the thirty something mutated human. It was even fair to say that they were at a disadvantage the entire time. In the end, they barely won with the advantageous positioning they had, but they lost with the cost of one power armor and multiple backup fuel rods.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen had a few more cannons, the situation would be drastically different.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the ability to produce heavy weaponry was fundamental to the existence of a survival base.</br>
</br>
From any perspective, Fishbone Base must develop its own heavy weaponry!</br>
</br>
So Jiang Chen already started doing that.</br>
</br>
The electric pulse cannon technology he purchased from Zhao Chenwu had been completely understood by the scientists at the base. Although the production condition at the base was still limited, after half a month, the Fishbone Base workers still managed to use the limited facility to manufacture six electric pulse cannons.</br>
</br>
This vehicle mounted electric pulse cannon was used as the primary weapon on the tank during the war, but right now it was obviously not feasible to acquire a tank. Therefore, Jiang Chen thought of a compromise.</br>
</br>
Wield the electric pulse cannon onto the improved truck, and use steel reinforcement to strengthen the armor of the truck. Then, place a soldier on top to fire the cannon.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the odd looking electric pulse cannon vehicle was created by Jiang Chen's wild imagination.</br>
</br>
Also, he gave this thing a name that couldn't be more childish - Tiger.</br>
</br>
Low armor, medium mobility, high range, high damage. It was extremely effective in rural areas with scattered structures, but it was a target in the city. Although the design was extreme, they had to work with what they had.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the other hand, following the production of the hummingbird drone, patrolling outside of the base has been passed on to those palm sized little guys. The hummingbird drone has built up a force of over one hundred units, which was more than enough to create an attack force. Although those little guys carried a limited amount of ammo, once there were enough of them, they were capable of deadly attacks.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The attack on Shenxiang Town was set to be five days later. The survivors in the base had since been busy.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although attacking in the winter didn't sound like the smartest decision, since it was the boss's decision, they would relentlessly execute it.</br>
</br>
The military production factory worked around the clock, and the workers under Jiang Chen's instructions installed the electric pulse cannon on the back of the modified trucks. The training ground then became crowded as the soldiers in winter suits, under the command of Cheng Weiguo, began to train.</br>
</br>
Although everyone was preparing relentlessly, Jiang Chen wasn't too concerned about this attack.</br>
</br>
It was only a force of 40 mutated humans. Not only did the Fishbone base have the fire support from the Tiger, but they also had helicopters that acted as gunships.</br>
</br>
Leaving the mansion wearing a thick winter suit, Jiang Chen headed straight to Jiang Lin's lab.</br>
</br>
For the scientist passionate about aerospace, Jiang Chen had a keen interest in him. Not only did Jiang Chen clean out a lab for him, but he also gave him a budget of 1000 crystals a month to purchase related equipment.</br>
</br>
Although aerospace technology was not helpful to the Fishbone base now, if rockets were created, not only can they be shot into the sky, but if they're shot downwards, they could be used as missiles.</br>
</br>
Of course, the purpose of the trip was not to inquire about the missiles, but for something else.</br>
</br>
When he pushed opened the lab door, Jiang Chen stepped into the room, and quickly closed the door behind him.</br>
</br>
He shook off the snow on his body before walking inside the room.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, what are you working on?"</br>
</br>
A dazzling amount of electronic parts were randomly stored in the corner of the room. Some of them were needed for the launch of the rockets, and some of them were junk he brought back from Fake Leg Specialty store. Although Jiang Lin didn't plan to continue his father's business, he still moved his stuff here.</br>
</br>
"Rocket engine..." Jiang Lin wore protective goggles with a welding tool in his hand as he concentrated on the parts on the table.</br>
</br>
Looking at the grease covered hair, Jiang Chen didn't want to guess the last time he showered.</br>
</br>
It's great to be passionate about your own business, but...</br>
</br>
"Did you complete the task I gave you?" Jiang Chen walked over to a mechanical leg lying on the ground as he stood beside him.</br>
</br>
"Done. It's on the shelf to your right, and the manual is on the shelf next to it." Jiang Lin said as carefully wielded a single microchip onto the engine, not turning his head.</br>
</br>
"Just need to wait till the weather clears up... Install a smart power control into the engine, and then install signal blockage at the tip of the rocket. I am a genius," Jiang Lin mustered to himself as he looked ecstatic.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen didn't know why.</br>
</br>
"Kinetic skeleton, model K1". A line of small words was engraved on the metal strip as Jiang Chen read it out loud.</br>
</br>
He looked at the mechanical frame in his hand and began to play with it. But after awhile, he still didn't have a single clue how it works. So, he took out the manual and began to read it step by step.</br>
</br>
The light plastic steel metal attached to the four limbs, and the spine position was covered by scale like metal plates.</br>
</br>
To put it simply, this thing was like a metal skeleton. Although it had a metallic feel to it, it didn't feel cumbersome to wear.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved his limbs and clenched his fingers, but he still didn't understand how it worked as a confused expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Seeing that boss wearing his masterpiece, Jiang Lin dropped what he was working on, cleaned his hand, and walked over.</br>
</br>
"The start button is on your neck. You can try pressing it."</br>
</br>
Following Jiang Lin's instruction, Jiang Chen skeptically placed his finger on his neck and quickly found a button. Then he tried pressing it down.</br>
</br>
A faint static noise was heard as Jiang Chen felt a temporary numbness on the back of his neck. The next second he was completely shocked.</br>
</br>
It was a surreal feeling. As if the metal strip became a part of his body. What maneuvered his body was no longer his own skeleton, but rather the metal skeleton attached to his body.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved his limbs as the shock on his face intensified.</br>
</br>
Describing the feeling was difficult. Precisely, it seemed like the metal skeleton was really his own hand, but his real hand was only a tool he was using.</br>
</br>
"Model K1 kinetic skeleton. Fake Legs Specialty store's masterpiece." A proud smile appeared on Jiang Lin's face, as he took a curved plastic steel plate from the side and pressed it onto the empty slot in front of Jiang Chen's chest.</br>
</br>
"Removable armor made of supramolecular polyethylene. It is bullet-proof, so it can easily protect you against normal assault rifle bullets. The outside is sprayed with a reflective layer, so it has some defense against laser rifles. Of course, I don't recommend you take a few shots to test the strength of the armor.</br>
</br>
After he finished, Jiang Lin brought over several curved armors and slotted them onto Jiang Chen's stomach, legs, and shoulders.</br>
</br>
"Almost done." Jiang Lin stood up and clapped his hands together. He then took a tablet from the table and connected a wire to Jiang Chen's armor.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him as his fingers typed furiously on the screen. Quickly, the numb electrocuted sensation from the back of his neck disappeared and was replaced by an astonishing connection of his nerves to his muscles.</br>
</br>
It was not only simply the metal maneuvering his body, but the metal and body were simultaneously controlled by his brain.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved his limbs as he became more and more shocked.</br>
</br>
Seeing the expression on the boss's face, Jiang Lin smiled and quickly backed away. With a please gesture, he said proudly, "Try hitting the sandbag."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen clenched the fist covered by the thin layer of armor as he used his entire strength to punch.</br>
</br>
Boom-.</br>
</br>
Dust blew everywhere.</br>
</br>
The violent force caused the sandbag to cave inward as the metal hanging the sandbag began to squeak in a whimpering noise.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful! Let me see. 971 kilograms, not bad." Jiang Lin nodded his head as he scratched his chin and began to adjust the data on the tablet.</br>
</br>
[Not bad? This is insane!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen astonishingly stared at his hand as he ridiculed in his mind.</br>
</br>
A force of nearly one ton! An ordinary person's punch would be around 100 kilograms; he remembered Tyson could only punch with a force of 400 kilograms.</br>
</br>
But the sandbag didn't get punched through. Its quality must be excellent.</br>
</br>
While being shocked, Jiang Chen gave a few extra looks at the sandbag.</br>
</br>
"Try the strength again." Jiang Lin quickly walked to the end of the room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved his leg around to test. When he realized that his coordination was not hindered, he walked over.</br>
</br>
There stood a metal box the size of a closet. The exposed part seemed similar to the weight of the sandbag.</br>
</br>
A white metal covered signal light flashed unknowingly, the monitor on the side produced a faint light.</br>
</br>
"Put your hand on the bar, and then use your maximum power to lift it." Jiang Lin passed a bar-like thing to him as he smiled.</br>
</br>
Following his instruction, Jiang Chen put his hands on the bar and lifted it up with his entire force.</br>
</br>
&lt;Strength: 64&gt;</br>
</br>
"Perfect!" Jiang Lin snapped as he said with excitement.</br>
</br>
Compared to Jiang Lin's excitement, Jiang Chen's mood could be described as ecstatic.</br>
</br>
With only a few metal frames, it could allow people to acquire strength greater than the genetic vaccine. If every solider wore a set, Fishbone base's combat power would more than double.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 174: Out of stock?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
If the power armor were the full body armor of the knight, then the kinetic skeleton would be an infantry's chainmail.</br>
</br>
The entire mass was less than ten kgs. The supermolecular polyethylene could guard 7-12 rounds of point-blank shots from a 7.62 mm assault. If it were an assault rifle from the modern world, it would not even make a dent in the armor.</br>
</br>
Afer equipping, the maximum weight carried by a single soldier would increase to 300 kilograms.</br>
</br>
The power source was two pieces of battery the size of a fist and was placed above the pelvis area. After a complete charge, it would allow the equipped person to run at a speed of 12 km/hour carrying the 300 kilograms for one hour. Or, it could operate in normal combat conditions for 12 hours. The power could be charged through solar cells, or it could instantly be replenished with crystals.</br>
</br>
It was fair to say, other than the aerospace technology that has yet to see results, a significant factor that Jiang Chen considered when recruiting Jiang Lin was the kinetic skeleton technology of the Fake Leg Specialty store. Although he didn't manage to continue the family business, being forced by his father, he still learned the essential skills.</br>
</br>
When he personally experienced the power of Model K1 Kinetic Skeleton, Jiang Chen immediately proposed the feasibility of mass equipping the force.</br>
</br>
"Equipping the force?" Jiang Lin was confused when he heard Jiang Chen's question, but then an odd expression appeared on his face. "Do you know the time and cost to produce a set of kinetic skeleton like this?"</br>
</br>
"How much?" Jiang Chen asked carelessly.</br>
</br>
"Based on the official price in the Sixth Street, the current set you are wearing cost around 900 crystals. 900 crystals could purchase more than ten slaves if you give them rifles. Regardless of what kind of super soldier, they can't beat ten something rifles." Jiang Lin let out a sigh as he started to calculate the economics for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"But the Sixth Street no longer sells population."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed the button on his neck as the faint static noise rose again and he took off the kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
"The Sixth Street doesn't sell population, but other places do. For example Su City. They have the biggest slave market in Suhang province. They'll come to the Sixth Street next spring-" Jiang Lin tried to convince his boss.</br>
</br>
"But we can't wait till next spring." Jiang Chen, with a smile, carried the kinetic skeleton in his hands. "When the snow melts next year, the mutated human will invade from 7th area to Qingpu. We are the only force that's capable of putting up a defense. Therefore we will face the most pressure from them."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Lin's face immediately turned white.</br>
</br>
He has never heard about this before. If he had heard about it, he would not have come to work here even if they beat him to death. The reason why he tried to convince the boss to give up the idea of mass production of the kinetic skeleton was the fact that he was worried his own research time for the rocket would be limited.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Do you regret coming here?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin gulped as he looked away, dishearted. "No."</br>
</br>
"Don't be afraid. Your heart beat already told me you are regretting it." Jiang Chen smiled as he patted him on the shoulder without criticising his fear. "It is okay to be afraid. People fear death for a reason. Since you are afraid, then follow what I have said."</br>
</br>
"I heard that there are a few thousand mutated humans in the Seventh Area," Jiang Lin strugglingly said.</br>
</br>
"To be exact, there are three thousand. Perhaps a bit more than that, but it's not something you need to worry about. Kinetic skeleton must be mass produced. Regardless how many crystals we spend, you must manufacture 50 sets before next year January," Jiang Chen used an irrefutable voice.</br>
</br>
Even with a cost of 900 crystals per set, 50 sets would only be 45,000 crystals. Fishbone base didn't lack money. It was time to convert the wealth accumulated in the early phases into power.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin gulped again as he saw the seriousness in the boss' eyes as he nodded arduously.</br>
</br>
"I'll try my best... But it can't be done with just me. I need help."</br>
</br>
"Just tell me how much assistance you need."</br>
</br>
"Let me think... The hand crafted metal skeleton would require ten people, welding the microchips would take 4, drawing the circuit board would need 8, as well as modifying the power system... Based on my estimation, I would require 40 workers to be able to complete a streamlined process. In this case, I could probably manage to complete 50 sets of kinetic skeletons before January." Jiang Lin had a troubled smile.</br>
</br>
There was a total of 200 people in the base. Everyone had their own duties and responsibilities, it was impossible to assemble a team of 40.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's following words shocked him.</br>
</br>
"I'll give you 80 people. Could you double the production?"</br>
</br>
"Sure, but is there enough people in the base?" Jiang Lin had to ask.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about it. We'll have plenty of people soon. Right now, you only need to figure out how to design the production line, how to train your team, and what materials must be purchased. The production force will be ready in 5 days." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The Fishbone base didn't have the people, but Shenxiang Town had them.</br>
</br>
The seven hundred survivors captured by the mutated humans. He just needed to bring them back.</br>
</br>
As to whether they would be obedient or not?</br>
</br>
On the wasteland, there was no inherent difference between being captured and being saved.</br>
</br>
If they wanted to continue to live, they must be obedient.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After coming out of Jiang Lin's lab, Jiang Chen headed to the community center to find the warehouse keeper Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came to the office, the girl with freckles was going through her books as usual. When she saw Jiang Chen, her eyes lit up, as she stopped what she was doing, and got up to greet him.</br>
</br>
"I am just here to check the status of the supplies in the base. Don't be so anxious," Jiang Chen gently smiled as he joked.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin's face blushed shyly. She pushed her glasses up as she took out the tablet terminal and began to display the data to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
First, it was crystals.</br>
</br>
After the accumulation of several trades, the crystals stored in the Fishbone base had reached a frightening number of 790 thousand. Because of the addition of several production lines, the crystals spent last month reached 30 thousand. This included the purchase of raw materials, as well as direct consumption for fuel in industrial production.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked Wang Qin to save half a million crystals as liquid assets to purchase shares of the about to be established Sixth Street bank.The rest of the 290 thousand crystals would be used as production spending. Even with the addition of a kinetic skeleton line, the current amount of stored crystals was more than sufficient.</br>
</br>
Then, it would be the firearms storage.</br>
</br>
There were two hundred thousand rounds of ammo stored in the base, with sixty percent directly manufactured by the base. After they acquired Huizhong Mercenaries' ammo production line, Fishbone base began to work towards producing its own firearms.</br>
</br>
Then, it would be the 5kg bombs. This is the standard ammo for the electromagnetic cannon.</br>
</br>
Following the completion of the Tiger, the military factory's production has been shifting towards bombs. The current stock was two hundred rounds, with fifty being produced each day.</br>
</br>
After a period of consumption, as well as the large quantity of replenishment since the last time he returned, the base currently stored 8 tons of rice, 2 tons of potato, and easy to store vegetables like cabbage and carrot totaled 5 tons. Sausage, marinated meat, and other preserved food added up to 2 tons. After Jiang Chen realized it was cheaper to purchase fresh food than canned food, Fishbone Base's cafeteria no longer provided canned food. All cans were only sold, or as an award to survivors that contributed to the base.</br>
</br>
With the assumption of one pound of rice per day per person, this food would last the group of two hundred two years. But considering the addition of seven hundred survivors soon, the rate of food consumption would undoubtedly increase. Even with an increase in survivors, the current storage of food would last at least half a year.</br>
</br>
"Also, the base is preparing to add a new kinetic skeleton production line. Jiang Lin will send the list of purchases over in a bit. Send someone to purchase it from the Sixth Street."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Wang Qin nodded and then wrote Jiang Chen's words in the tablet. Following the increased quantity of supplies, one warehouse keeper was not enough. After asking for Wang Qin's opinion, Jiang Chen added a logistics department to the base's administration, responsible for managing warehouse supplies, daily consumption, and trade related tasks. Trade was previously the responsibility of Sun Jiao, but she seemed to get a headache with "small tasks" containing minuscule details, so she threw the duties to the logistics department.</br>
</br>
The logistics department was of course led by Wang Qin. The department increased to five people, managing a total of six warehouses.</br>
</br>
"I said you don't have to be so anxious." Seeing how the girl was taking notes seriously, Jiang Chen couldn't stop laughing.</br>
</br>
Although she had matured compared to when she just got to the base, the trait of blushing did not change at all.</br>
</br>
"Also, what's the status of Zhou Guoping's bar in the Sixth Street?"</br>
</br>
After recollecting her previous calmness, Wang Qin pushed her glasses up and said in a focused tone, "4000 cans of beer were consumed in October resulting in a total profit of 40,000 crystals."</br>
</br>
Hearing the news, Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He didn't care about the profitability of the bar. He was more keen on using the traffic generated to bring him intelligence. The beers were only a few bucks in the modern world which was nothing.</br>
</br>
But of course, as the saying goes, although mosquitoes were small, meat was still meat, and the income from the beers was quite good.</br>
</br>
"Also, there is something else," Wang Qin saw that Jiang Chen was in a good mood, but she hesitated for a moment before she spoke.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"The raw material used to produce the automatic rifles and hummingbird drone, the Carm Tree sap, is out of stock."</br>
</br>
"Out of stock?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
It was a big problem.</br>
</br>
The threat of mutated human was approaching fast, the Fishbone base was working around the clock to produce firearms, and now Carm tree sap was out of stock?</br>
</br>
"The plantation that provided us with Carm tree sap terminated the contract, and paid us 1000 crystals as the penalty," Wang Qin said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Reason?"</br>
</br>
"Following the increase in production on the Sixth Street, the price of Carm tree sap rose by 20%, which is much higher compared to the price signed on the contract. They also signed a large quantity long term deal with other companies. Therefore, they shamelessly terminated our contract." Wang Qin said in anger.</br>
</br>
"So how much is left in the base?" Jiang Chen said in a serious tone.</br>
</br>
"2 tons left. Enough to maintain production for one more month."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll take care of this." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
[If the Sixth Street can't supply it, the Fishbone base can just produce it on our own.]</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 175: Produce Ourselves</br>
</div></br>
"Growing Carm Trees?" Sun Jiao thought for a second before a troubled look appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem? We could probably buy the sapling on the market. If we can't, I'll get Zhou Guoping to think of other ways." Jiang Chen didn't understand.</br>
</br>
"No, it's not the problem with tree saplings, tree saplings are easy to obtain." Seeing that Jiang Chen seemed to be misinterpreting her meaning, Sun Jiao forced a bitter smile. "The problem is growing them."</br>
</br>
"Growing? I remember these mutated plants were able to survive in the apocalypse's soil, is there any problems?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Typical crops could not grow in the nuclear and biological contaminated soil, but mutated plants that survived the war could. Logically, anything that could grow in the Sixth Street, the Fishbone base could grow the same thing.</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's question, Sun Jiao facepalmed as she began patiently explaining the fundamentals.</br>
</br>
"To grow anything on the wasteland, there are two factors to consider. One is radiation level, and two is soil contamination level.</br>
</br>
As long as there is material exchange with the outside world, it can not avoid the impact of radiation. There is nothing in the apocalypse that is free of radiation. Not even the drinking water treated by the automatic water purifying equipment. It doesn't negatively affect humans because of the existence of the EP and special medication that reduces the radiation level to below the danger threshold. However, plants are not so lucky.</br>
</br>
To ensure the planted apple does not mutate, the radiation level must be controlled to below 1. If the radiation level is above 5, even normal seeds buried into the ground will become abnormal. With the Sixth Street's technology, it is able to control the radiation level to around 3, which certainly reflects how valuable the fruit cans you brought are.</br>
</br>
But the mutated plants that survived through natural selection are not that delicate. Their resistance to radiation is quite high. Take Carm trees for example. As long as radiation levels are below 40, it can grow normally. Most of the places on the wasteland have a threshold value between 10-20. As long as it's not in a nuclear crater, the radiation level will not reach 40.</br>
</br>
The soil contamination is relatively easier to solve since soilless planting technology is incredibly mature in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the plantations in the apocalypse can be divided into two kinds.</br>
</br>
One is the kind that uses soilless technology to grow crops.</br>
</br>
There is a distinct advantage to growing crops this way is that it can easily control soil contamination, and the production area would also be greater compared to soil plants. The disadvantage is also evident. Mainly being the high cost. To use soilless technology to produce industrial raw materials like Carm tree sap would undoubtedly bankrupt the business. It normally would be used to grow luxury goods, such as not completely mutated fruit.</br>
</br>
</br>
The signature building in the Sixth Street includes a soilless plantation tower. Of course, because of the appearance of fruit cans, this industry was on the brink of bankruptcy.</br>
</br>
The other kind is normal soil plantation.</br>
</br>
Simple and straightforward, planting the seeds and watering them would yield plants. Whether it would be done by human labor with scythe spreading the seeds or mechanical plantation, it would be up to the preference of the owner. It is used to mostly produce non-expensive mutated plants, such as the industrially used Carm tree sap, and different flavors of tobacco...</br>
</br>
The advantage of this method is the low cost, but it has a strict requirement for the quality of the soil.</br>
</br>
Take Carm trees for example. Only plants with soil contamination less than ten can be used to grow these trees. This type of soil is also extremely rare on the wasteland, so Carm tree sap production is not high even on the Sixth Street. Previously, this raw material had minimal demand, but during this period, demand far exceeded supply."</br>
</br>
"Couldn't we just purchase soilless equipment?" Jiang Chen was refusing to give up.</br>
</br>
"Using soilless equipment to grow Carm trees, how much crystals would you use to obtain one ton of Carm tree sap." Sun Jiao facepalmed feeling helpless.</br>
</br>
[This is problematic now.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows began to twist as he fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
But then, he suddenly remembered Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
[Yes! The Garden of Eden Project!</br>
</br>
If it is possible to change the local biosphere, there is no reason there is no technology to change the condition of the soil!]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Did you think of something?" Sun Jiao looked confusedly as Jiang Chen's always changing expression.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." The tip of Jiang Chen's mouth curled up, "Looks like the "little slave" in our mansion is finally going to be useful."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao instantly understood as a sign of joy also flashed across her face.</br>
</br>
"What? Reduce soil contamination? Why should I help you?" With fingers holding onto the test tube, the smooth and silky silver hair hid the disdained expression on Lin Lin's face as she said without any consideration.</br>
</br>
The one red and one black pupil were the same as when he left before. It seemed that she became used to having an odd creature living inside her body.</br>
</br>
"Because you need to eat," Jiang Chen let out a sigh as he said righteously.</br>
</br>
He was already becoming bored of looking at her humiliated expression, but this girl seemed to think otherwise?</br>
</br>
"Do you feel great about being bullied now?" Seeing the slightly sad Lin Lin drawing on the touch board, Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
With such a gorgeous face, she had to have such a terrible expression.</br>
</br>
"Go die." With her finger finishing the last line, Lin Lin gave Jiang Chen a hard stare and popped out her tongue to give him a scary face.</br>
</br>
"What is this?" Jiang Chen ignored her action as he got closer to the touch board."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, foolish-" Lin Lin straightened her back while the tip of her lips curved up.</br>
</br>
"Ahem."</br>
</br>
"Ahh! Enough! Fine, I'll say it." Lin Lin pouted her mouth in sadness as she touched the screen. "The first step is to neutralize the soil. The second step is to use ion membranes to permeate out the heavy metal ions, the third step is..."</br>
</br>
"Hold on, what is an ion membrane?" Jiang Chen interrupted her as he was completely lost.</br>
</br>
"A thing that can easily filter through the ion particles should be pretty common," Lin Lin said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
[What. I have never heard about this before.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly recalled that Lin Lin had always stayed in the research facility, for she wouldn't be so clueless about the situation of the apocalypse otherwise. In this case, the "common" in her mind probably meant common in the lab.</br>
</br>
[Did not think this through...]</br>
</br>
"Let me first ask, how many steps does this process include?" Jiang Chen was feeling speechless.</br>
</br>
"Not that many, only 24 steps. I have taken a sample of the soil here before, and the contamination level is 68. It's hard to believe in a land this toxic weeds can grow." When the topic revolved around her field of interest, Lin Lin became keener.</br>
</br>
"Does your lab not consider costs when you experiment?" Jiang Chen ridiculed."</br>
</br>
"Costs? Of course," Lin Lin disagreed.</br>
</br>
"Then tell me after 24 steps, what is the cost?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen strangely.</br>
</br>
"Are you misinterpreting something? &lt;Project Garen of Eden&gt; is not a soil purification project. Since it is a subproject of space colonization, then why do we need to understand how to treat the pollution on Earth. Using organics as well as minerals on other planets, we could produce soil. It is too troublesome to purify it. "</br>
</br>
"Produce soil?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. It is not difficult to produce soil. At least easier than washing the ground. But since all the "finished goods" are contaminated here, it would not be easy to find raw ingredients to form clean soil." Lin Lin let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Produce soil? Other planets?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly smacked his own head as he cursed in his mind.</br>
</br>
[F*ck, why didn't I think of this before. It is not that difficult. I can interdimensional travel! If I can carry back food, how difficult would it be to transport a couple of hundred cubic meters of soil?]</br>
</br>
Since the problem was solved, Jiang Chen didn't plan to ask further, so he changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"Okay, let's not talk about this... Oh, did you finish the task I gave you?"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 176: Wormhole</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Since it has been a while, the Death Claw and mutated lead skin human research should be completed?</br>
</br>
"Of course. Who do you think I am?’ Lin Lin let out a sigh as a confident expression appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Follow me." She crooked her finger at Jiang Chen as she turned around, swaying her silver white hair, and walked to the giant vial in the back.</br>
</br>
A naked monster with its flesh exposed was in the middle of the vial. The dark green liquid occasionally had bubbles blowing upwards. It seemed like the work of a science freak in American comics. But Jiang Chen didn’t focus on that. Rather he looked at the bottom part of the monster.</br>
</br>
Just like the rumors say, no d*ck.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin pointed her delicate finger and pressed the touch screen on the side of the vial. Several orange lights shined into the hologram screen in front of them. The list of data on the screen had Jiang Chen completely lost.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, standing beside him, looked at him contemptuously in secret. She imprudently made fun of Jang Chen’s "ignorance" in her mind before speaking with her head held high.</br>
</br>
"Muscle strength or body strength 63, bone strength 47, reflex 20, brain cell strength 9. From a human perspective, without overexerting the body's capabilities, this is the limit of the body's strength."</br>
</br>
"Umm... Speaking of this, is this guy still considered human?" Lin Lin had her finger on her chin as she muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her. [Is this girl still considered human?]</br>
</br>
"The cell in the body is modified by the FEV virus. Similarly, the skin is implanted with heavy metal… The lead skin could be compared to C-type steel, and it could easily defend against standard bullets. The regeneration of the cell is ridiculously fast. Based on the data of the body's DNA, even if it lost an arm, it would be able to grow one back in a week's time. Although I never fought before, if this thing was put in the battlefield, it should be invincible right?" The pacifist Lin Lin even started to exclaim about the battle ability of this thing.</br>
</br>
"Does it not have any weaknesses?" Jiang Chen had a troubled smile.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Lin Lin nodded, "First because of the influence of heavy metal. Their nervous system is extremely weak. The brain cell strength is as low as 9. Also, their life is limited. Based on its DNA and regeneration calculation, their life expectancy is only 30 years. Also, if their head or heart is destroyed, they will die instantly."</br>
</br>
It was the same as not saying anything. Which creature would still live without a brain or heart?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Looks like there is no shortcut to this. To destroy this dangerous thing we would have to depend on "Tiger". Using its pure explosive power of electromagnetic cannons to blow this thing into pieces."</br>
</br>
"Also, can I ask a question?" Lin Lin abruptly spoke out.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"When I first acquired the body I was utterly astonished. What did you do to destroy every single cell in the mutated human's body?" Lin Lin looked oddly at Jiang Chen as she was clueless.</br>
</br>
[It was time travel.] But he did not dare to tell her yet.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen subtly looked away as he began to come up with a vague response.</br>
</br>
"Well, I used a special weapon that instantly ended all cell activity. Speaking of this, what do those cells look like under the microscope?"</br>
</br>
"The cell membrane broke. Based on the way it broke, it appeared to be due to extremely low temperatures that caused the fluid in the cell to freeze? It is peculiar… As if without preparation, it traveled through a wormhole with entropy infinitely approaching 0," Lin Lin doubtingly said, as she stared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
[Extremely low temperatures? But there was no temperature change during time travel.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly raised his eyebrows and didn’t notice Lin Lin’s look of doubt.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen had no reaction, Lin Lin continued.</br>
</br>
"Passing through an area with entropy infinitely approaching 0 would have no impact on dead things, but for something alive, it would be nearly impossible for them to remain alive. But as the shortcut to intergalactic travel, passing through a wormhole is a topic that can’t be avoided, as "how to travel through wormholes" had a lot of interesting hypotheses in the physics world. Among them, Doctor Klein’s hypothesis had the most authority."</br>
</br>
"Klein?" Jiang Chen felt that he had heard this name before.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. To put it in a simple analogy, mass and energy through two completely parallel tunnels cross the wormhole." As she said this, Lin Lin grabbed a pen to draw a cylinder on the whiteboard. Then she drew two parallel lines, one pass through inside the cylinder, and another pass through outside the cylinder.</br>
</br>
"As long as you send the energy at the entrance of wormhole through the tunnel into another dimension to the end of the wormhole and meet with the mass that passes through the wormhole there, it would avoid the part where entropy decreases in the wormhole."</br>
</br>
"Detach the energy? Wouldn’t that creature die instantly?" Jiang Chen didn’t understand.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, this is the brilliance of Doctor Klein." Lin Lin sighed. She drew t1 and t2 at the ends of the whiteboard and gave then a value to 0.</br>
</br>
"Time. Based on research, within the wormhole, time, space, and all physic principles are ambiguous. To put it in simple terms, you could spin around a few times before walking to the exit, or you could instantly head for the exit when you enter the wormhole. As long as you find the "perfect route," you could decrease the time to pass through the wormhole to 0."</br>
</br>
"I’ll give you an analogy. A door frame is put in front you. You have a ball in your hand that represents your temperature. Based on the rule, when the ball passes through the doorframe, I will take it away from you. So instead, the instant you're about to cross the door frame, you throw the ball up and the ball would fly above the doorframe. Then, once you go through the doorframe, you catch the ball, and successfully passed through the door with the ball."</br>
</br>
"I see." Jiang Chen half understandingly nodded his head.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, how did you pass through the door?"</br>
</br>
"I don’t know. I used the bracelet…" Suddenly, Jiang Chen looked cautiously at Lin Lin and narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"You are setting me up."</br>
</br>
"The fool wants to say it himself," the tip of Lin Lin's mouth raised in proudness as she said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"You are playing with fire."</br>
</br>
She seemed to have sensed the grimace in Jiang Chen’s tone as Lin Lin sacredly moved back. The proud expression completely vanished. "I...I am only curious. I have no other intention. Al…Also, you suddenly appeared from the tent last time. I already had an idea… After seeing so much food in the base, you must be an alien right?!"</br>
</br>
An alien?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment before he burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"What, what are you laughing at," Lin Lin worked up her courage and fainted protested.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, nothing. Since you already guessed most of it, I’ll tell you." Jiang Chen smile, "I am a time traveler from the past, from the year 2015."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin took some time to think before she raised her pair of serene eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Time traveler? From the past?"</br>
</br>
"You already said all physics principle doesn’t apply in the wormhole since it could avoid the space continuum, time continuum would not be a problem too, right?" Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Based on the theory yes. Although out of the six colonization ships, three passed through the wormhole. As to the specifics of passing through the wormhole, only they would know." Lin Lin nodded, but then looked at Jiang Chen doubtfully. "I didn’t know that this stingy devil could tell me this secret."</br>
</br>
"What if I told you," Jiang Chen with a smile looked at the one black and one red pupil, "I don’t plan to ever let you go."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Lin Lin’s face instantly turned red as it was the rare time she didn’t bad mouth back, but rather shifted her eyes to the side.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t realize the other meaning in his words as he looked at the girl "forced to be obedient" pleasingly.</br>
</br>
"Also, what about that Death Claw? Is the result out?"</br>
</br>
When he mentioned the Death Claw, Lin Lin, rarely tense, turned serious.</br>
</br>
"I found some odd things on the Death Claw."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After leaving from Lin Lin’s lab, Jiang Chen fell into deep thought thinking about what she just said.</br>
</br>
Everyone knew that the starting point of the x1 virus was to purify radiation, but because it experienced uncontrollable mutation under the radiation environment, it turned into the frightening virus.</br>
</br>
But x2’s design philosophy was rather dubious.</br>
</br>
As the improved version of the x1 virus, x2’s purification ability was increased. But the food for thought element was that the effect of infiltrating creature’s nervous system was not removed, but rather strengthened. It also increased the structure of the cell, making it harder to be eliminated by the immune system.</br>
</br>
As if it was designed to eliminate all humans along with the radiation.</br>
</br>
The fortunate part was that because the cell's DNA structure was too stable, it could not split through binary fission. It could only produce through the 'mother's' body. Therefore, after Jiang Chen cleared out the source in the area, the x2 virus slowly began to vanish.</br>
</br>
"Could it be born through x1’s own mutation? Since there is radiation everywhere…"</br>
</br>
"Impossible," Lin Lin shook her head as she rejected Jiang Chen’s doubt with certainty. "The Death Claw evolved to have armor, simplified its molecular chain to develop claws, and these were all part of natural selection. To survive, creatures would be forced to adapt and evolve certain traits, but not put a lock on its own life. The complicated breeding mechanism has no practical meaning for survival, and it is impossible that x2 was born through evolution."</br>
</br>
She paused, before continuing, "The only possibility is that someone created the x2 virus. But what I don’t understand is, the x1 virus data should already have been onboard with the colonization ship."</br>
</br>
"Could it be another scientist that didn’t manage to make it onto the ship created it?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"I am not sure," Lin Lin shook her head, "But one point is certain, and that is the people who developed the x2 virus definitely have no good intentions."</br>
</br>
Someone wanted the humans on the wasteland to become extinct.</br>
</br>
But who could it be?</br>
</br>
Mutated humans have enough of a reason, but a virus that the Death Claw couldn’t even handle, could they resist it?</br>
</br>
But if it was not the mutated human, who had the motives to do this?</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a frightening thought popped into Jiang Chen’s mind.</br>
</br>
If wormholes could create time travel, then where did the three space colonization ships go? Did they really completely abandon this planet?</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"Seatbelt check. Ready to depart." Chu Nan closed the hatch.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I checked already." Jiang Chen, wearing the kinetic skeleton, pointed at his shoulder and smiled.</br>
</br>
"This is procedure... Okay, lift off." Chu Nan opened the engine switch while signally the "apprentice" in the co-pilot position to keep an eye on the monitors on the right side.</br>
</br>
Woohoo-!</br>
</br>
Outside of the helicopter, high voltage static began to hum. Under the push of the furious vortex flow, the 51 helicopter began to lift off slowly.</br>
</br>
Sitting across Jiang Chen was the gunner. The young man wearing orange protective gear felt shy with the base leader sitting across from him.</br>
</br>
"Don't be anxious." Jiang Chen gave him a friendly smile.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The young man shouted out, just as he wanted to stand up to salute, he was comically pulled back by the seatbelt.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed as he waved his hand signally there was no need. Then he focused his gaze on what was happening outside the window.</br>
</br>
It stopped snowing, but the snow had yet to melt.</br>
</br>
It was the first time overseeing the entirety of Wanghai City in the sky.</br>
</br>
A frozen world. The city at dawn shone brightly. The glittering colors seemed to have fended off the gloom of the radiation dust in the air.</br>
</br>
If it was not for the occasional zombie, as well as the unhealthy colored smog, he could almost forget that he was in the apocalypse, and was instead in a snowy city in the Northern kingdom.</br>
</br>
"From this view, the city is quite beautiful," Jiang Chen exclaimed while looking through the window.</br>
</br>
"The first time is indeed powerful. But if you fly every day, you'll get used to it." Chu Nan laughed.</br>
</br>
"Yeah?" Jiang Chen smiled as he didn't disagree.</br>
</br>
5 Tigers, one armored vehicle carrying supplies, 30 light infantry carrying Reaper assault rifle, as well as two snipers equipped with ghost sniper rifles.</br>
</br>
The destination was Shenxiang Town. This was Fishbone Base's first attack on the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't need to come but considering they needed the seven hundred captured survivors at the base. It would be best for the Fishbone leader to stand out and say something.</br>
</br>
Also, to observe the battle from above was something he looked forward to.</br>
</br>
"About to be in contact with radiation dust. Put on the mask," as he spoke, Chu Nan pulled the mask down over his helmet.</br>
</br>
"Received."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed a few buttons on the kinetic skeleton, picked up the helmet on the chair beside him, and connected the extension to the slot.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It snowed, but this level of coldness was as indifferent as the spring breeze to the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Even if they were fully exposed to the external conditions, they could still stand tall in the chilling snowstorm, ignoring the furious wind, and unleash the full firepower of the guns in their hands.</br>
</br>
</br>
They were natural warriors. Viewing highly of themselves, they were the terminators of the old civilization.</br>
</br>
Even if their bodies were unafraid of the cold, long winter journeys were still extremely difficult for them.</br>
</br>
Additionally, the stronger the body, the higher the supply consumption. Since west of Zhufeng Road had been entirely blocked by the snow, it meant it was nearly impossible for vehicles to traverse across it and this fact put the already short supply line under more pressure.</br>
</br>
There were only two options in front of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
One, send a team to Shenxiang Town across the Taifu river bank to establish an outpost, and then send the primary force to Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
Two, wait till next spring to invade Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
There was no possibility of the mutated humans and humans to reach a peaceful negotiation. Once they encountered each other, it would be a bloodbath. As for the decision to invade Wanghai City and engage in conflicts with the local human force, the mutated human leader was cautious. Different from the scattered survivors in Jia City, as the hotspot during the war, Wanghai City had multiple survivor camps that inherited frontier military technology before the war.</br>
</br>
If they had to engage in conflict with the human force, the mutated human would rather have it happen during the winter.</br>
</br>
If they waited for spring, the advantage of the mutated humans being able to fight in harsh climates would be non-existent. At the same time, hungry mutants would wake up from hibernation which would make the trip into city center more problematic.</br>
</br>
Because of the above reasons, the mutated humans decided to go with plan one for now.</br>
</br>
Although the highway between 7th area and Shenxiang Town was completely blocked by snow, the road condition from Shenxiang Town to Wanghai City was relatively smooth. As long as they establish an outpost to store supplies, the pressure of the supply line would be greatly alleviated. A winter crusade would be possible.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the captured survivors in Shengxiang Town were not immediately escorted back, but rather were forced to construct defensive structures by the mutated humans there.</br>
</br>
Outside Shenxiang Town, the outline of the reinforced concrete wall was starting to become visible.</br>
</br>
The sides of the road were piled with wood chips and were placed as obstacles and barriers to block the major roads outside of the town. But when the mutated humans arrived, the flimsy barrier could not bring even the slightest sense of security to the survivors hiding behind cover. The monster wielding steel carried machine guns and the bullet storm destroyed the mental fortitude of every defender.</br>
</br>
In the shack not far away from this place, the painted concrete wall was cut in half by the coilless cannon. On the shambles were terrifying bullet holes, and the blood stains on the wooden floor in the room were still clearly visible.</br>
</br>
The survivors defending behind cover could not cause a single casualty to the attacking mutated humans. But when the first mutated human passed through the wooden barrier, tens of bodies were already on the ground, which forced the survivors to raise the white flag and surrender.</br>
</br>
The recalcitrants' body was pierced by wooden spears, hung in the snow being eroded by the snowstorm, and eaten by the mutated rats. Just like a flag, declaring the cruelty of the victors.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin, with cold eyes, stared at the frail humans as they dragged concrete and steel through the snow with difficulty, building up their outpost.</br>
</br>
"Move quicker you damn pests. Who said you could stop, mhmm?" A horrific looking mutated human held a whip as he cursed at the slaves. His whip regularly beat at the weak figures, without any care if they actually made a mistake or not.</br>
</br>
The frightened faces instinctively made him feel joyful.</br>
</br>
Since he couldn't acquire pleasant sensations physiologically, the body full of male hormones could only be alleviated through primal violence.</br>
</br>
"Luke, don't accidentally kill them. Even if they are pests, they still have value in entertaining us." Wang Pin strolled beside the supervisor as he flashed his mouth full of fangs. Looking at the boy lying in the snow, he did not hide his eyes full of disgust and disdain.</br>
</br>
The mutated human after being "reborn" would rename themselves, abandoning the ancient ethics along with their name.</br>
</br>
"Haha!" Luke flung the whip in his hand as he laughed. "Cowards, all eyes on me."</br>
</br>
The people carrying bags of concrete all stopped.</br>
</br>
Men, women, elderly, and children.</br>
</br>
The white snow circled around them, but it could not hide their terrified looks. They could not scream, nor be anger. The chilling cold already caused their facial nerves to lose any sense of feeling. The bloodthirsty mutated humans made them forget the dignity they had.</br>
</br>
He looked at the numb faces with satisfaction. Luke lowered his head and looked at the boy trembling in the snow. With a grimace, he lifted his foot and stepped on the youthful face.</br>
</br>
"Ahh..."The suppressed scream came from the bottom of his foot, as the frozen fingers tightly grasped onto the ground as he crashed into the freezing snow.</br>
</br>
The father of the boy stood on the side with his shoulders trembling. His bloodshot eyes widened at the scene.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans on the side carried their rifles as they mockingly looked at the slaves being humiliated. The lack of entertainment meant that the thing they loved to do the most was to humiliate the helpless slaves.</br>
</br>
FEV virus was magical. The magical part was that it would make the modified person forget any previous reluctance and experience the sensation of evolution. They would forget about their hatred towards the mutated humans and willingly join the new party, and in term shift their hatred onto the old species unwilling to accept evolution.</br>
</br>
"No-!" A deafening scream broke the silence. A woman with messy hair leaped onto the snow as she tightly held onto the mutated human's foot while desperately trying to save the boy being stepped on.</br>
</br>
"Mom..." The boy's eyeballs were protruding because of pressure, his mouth weakly moved.</br>
</br>
Luke apathetically observed the woman from above. Coldly staring at the plea and despair in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Get out." The cold words left his mouth.</br>
</br>
Luke lifted the foot stepping on the boy's face as he kicked her chest mercilessly and sent the woman flying.</br>
</br>
She struggled to stand up from the snow, the edges of her mouth had blood dripping down as she coughed.</br>
</br>
But her eyes didn't look at Luke, and instead looked at the boy freed from under his foot.</br>
</br>
A tender smile appeared on her face as she crawled to the kid.</br>
</br>
For some reason, the expression on the woman's face enraged Luke.</br>
</br>
"Stop," he arrogantly ordered.</br>
</br>
The woman ignored him as she shakingly moved her arms in the boy's direction. Seeing his mom was getting closer, the boy looked relieved.</br>
</br>
But then, a rifle was pointed at her head.</br>
</br>
She blankly looked at it as despair appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Could, could it not be here," She used her trembling voice to plead.</br>
</br>
The second she leaped out from the crowd, she knew her fate.</br>
</br>
The people who dared to defy them all died, no exception.</br>
</br>
If possible, she didn't want to die in front of her child.</br>
</br>
Luke's face held a disdained grimace. This person wanted to discuss terms with him?</br>
</br>
"Let her go."</br>
</br>
A man stood out, but his legs and shoulders trembled. Luke scorned.</br>
</br>
"I am willing to die for her." This sentence seemed to have taken all of his courage.</br>
</br>
The woman looked at the man with eyes wide open as the sign of life began to vanish from her face.</br>
</br>
The cracked mouth opened as a powerless voice whispered out.</br>
</br>
"N...no-"</br>
</br>
"Then go die." Luke immediately fired. The bullet penetrated his chest, and even hurt the elder behind him.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh-!"</br>
</br>
The crowd howled. The woman's scream was filled with heartbreak, and the boy's eyes opened wide as he watched his father fall into the snow.</br>
</br>
Seeing the woman on all four scrambling to crawl to her husband, Luke's face revealed a psychotic but satisfied smile.</br>
</br>
He lifted his gun again as he was about to execute the woman that dared to dirty his feet.</br>
</br>
But just at that moment, Wang Pin, standing on the side, gently put his hand on the lifted rifle.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
The woman covered her husband as the body's temperature began to drop. The woman desperately tried to use her own heat to warm him, to save his fading life.</br>
</br>
"I love you."</br>
</br>
"No, no, I won't allow you to go." Droplets of tears rolled down the woman's cheek, splattering on the blood soaked jacket.</br>
</br>
"Sorry..."</br>
</br>
"I don't want your apology! I don't-!" The heartbreaking scream could not stop the body's temperature from dropping.</br>
</br>
Luke moved his eyes away from the two as he looked confusedly at his companion. He didn't understand his intention.</br>
</br>
"It's too boring to kill them, buddy. You haven't learned the essence of torture." Wang Pin patted his shoulder, pretending to sound wise as he cracked a smile.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Luke raised his eyebrows as he stuffed the gun into his lap. "Go ahead then."</br>
</br>
Wang Pin took the gun with a grimace on his face. He ignored the woman looking at him with anger and fear, and turned to the other pigs.</br>
</br>
"Pigs, listen up. Now, anyone who r*pes her will be given freedom."</br>
</br>
The crowd became unsettled, but no one came up.</br>
</br>
Luke looked as his colleague, not understanding his intention. He didn't know what was the purpose of seeing herds of humans in intercourse.</br>
</br>
That's right, "herds". From the mutated human's perspective, humans were only livestock. Due to traces of memory being left from before their transformation, they didn't eat human flesh like cannibals. However, they would not shy away from any cruelty to obtain a sense of joy from the howling humans.</br>
</br>
"No one? If I remember correctly, this woman, to your standard of beauty, should be quite attractive," Wang Pin continued to hold his rifle and said slowly.</br>
</br>
"Is there any purpose in this?" Luke was still confused.</br>
</br>
"Of course, buddy, learn from me. Other than killing, there are a lot of other ways to dig out the despair in their hearts."</br>
</br>
Wang Pin smiled with a grimace as he licked his dry lips. He then looked at the frightened woman backing away from him.</br>
</br>
"Lying on top of her husband's yet to be cold body, under the watch of her son, and humiliated by countless people. What kind of despair would be on such a face? The idea is making me excited. Isn't the whole purpose of the existence of civilization to blossom the glimpse of light under the torture of the primal? Hahaha!"</br>
</br>
The cruel laughter was deafening, shaking off the snow on trees that were a few kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Luke blankly looked at the psychotic smile on his colleague as an excited expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, you are a genius. Oh, devil! You must be an artist in your previous life."</br>
</br>
"Who knows?" Wang Pin smiled as he used his gun to point at the closest man.</br>
</br>
"You, go fu*k her."</br>
</br>
The man gulped, gritted his teeth, and defiantly said.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I can't do it."</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
Like a piece of paper, he fell onto the ground. The man's face still maintained a defiant expression, with a glimpse of disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Next." Wang Pin pointed the gun at the next man, a middle-aged man holding his bleeding arm.</br>
</br>
Trembling, the middleaged man walked a few steps, before finally kneeling onto the ground.</br>
</br>
"I-"</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
Wang Pin didn't give him the opportunity to explain as he immediately blew up his head.</br>
</br>
Red and white splattered everywhere and even splashed onto the person behind him.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin raised his chin and targeted the next person.</br>
</br>
Perhaps terrified by the horrific scene, the third person only hesitated slightly before looking down and running to the woman with trembling steps.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, please forgive me." The man was afraid to look at the expression on the woman's face as he merciless reached for her collar.</br>
</br>
"N...No." The woman's eyes widen in despair.</br>
</br>
The man ignored her struggling plea. He ignored all the morals and dignity of the human civilization and pushed her down on the body that was still slowly losing its temperature.</br>
</br>
In his mind, he was desperately trying to comfort himself. If he didn't do it, he would die. He was doing it, but it was not his intention.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin pleasingly looked at the man's action; the joy of ripping the civilization apart was almost making him shake in excitement. Luke, standing on the side, also had his eyes wide open. He was only a mutated human for less than two years, and it was the first time he witnessed such a joyful moment other than from violence.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin raised his gun again, pointing at the next person. Just as he was about to speak, he heard the shout of the patrol.</br>
</br>
"What is that?!" The mutated human carrying an assault rifle pointed at the black dot in the sky.</br>
</br>
He raised his eyebrows as Wang Pin looked up, "What is-"</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Mixed with thick smoke, the snow on the ground blew up like an avalanche as it flew over the crowd.</br>
</br>
The shockwave flipped people onto the ground as the frightened crowd ditched the concrete and steel bags in their hands. They ran to the nearest barrier or ducked into the field.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans didn't stop them because their situation was not any better.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, what is it!"</br>
</br>
Wang Pin crawled up from the ground as he looked at the thick smoke ten meters away with horrid.</br>
</br>
The bloodthirsty pupils contracted as a rare sense of fear surfaced.</br>
</br>
....</br>
</br>
"Direct hit."</br>
</br>
"Beautiful!" Jiang Chen smiled as he gave a thumbs up to the gunner.</br>
</br>
The furious wind blew through the hatch door as the orange protective suit gusted in the chill. The gunner wearing his mask turned and nodded his head to express his gratitude towards Jiang Chen's praise. Then, without stopping, he carried another 10kg bomb and stuffed it into the cartridge as the cannon began to charge.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen had a tablet in his hand. The flashing picture on the scene was of the entire battlefield. The camera located below the helicopter holistically presented the overview of the battlefield to the commander.</br>
</br>
The green dot hidden three kilometers away from the town was Fishbone Base's light infantry. The five tigers were scattered behind buildings, only exposing the electromagnetic cannon. The vehicle was also covered with white cloth, which camouflaged the vehicle perfectly with the snow. This only left the pitch black cannon visible.</br>
</br>
The red dot signaled were enemy units marked out by the sniper, while the gray dots were civilians.</br>
</br>
The thick smoke rising from the ground was the truck destroyed by the helicopter cannon. The anti-air machine gun had yet to unleash its power before being blown up into metal shards.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans who lost their air defense began to flee.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen observed the battlefield.</br>
</br>
It was like playing a game.</br>
</br>
Also worth mentioning, the command system attached to the helicopter was the masterpiece of Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"The purpose of civilization is to punish the primal brutality."</br>
</br>
As if it was meant to rebuttal the clamor, Jiang Chen mustered to himself.</br>
</br>
[Since the grim reaper has already arrived on the battlefield, then you bastards must go die.]</br>
</br>
He coldly overwatched the fleeing figures on the screen as his finger pointed at the red dot on the screen.</br>
</br>
Woosh-!</br>
</br>
The trident shaped cannon began to flash a faint blue electric light, followed by a screeching homing noise.</br>
</br>
The orange arc smashed to the ground. The noise of the bomb breaking the sound barrier almost covered the screaming Northen wind.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 179: Smite</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The orange arc explosion penetrated the cloud shaped sound barrier.</br>
</br>
Followed by the explosive homing, the cylinder shaped bomb rapidly spun, just like god smiting the sins in the world, it smashed directly into the fleeing mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Snow knee deep blew up into the air and mixed with shattered soft lead debris as it rained down onto the surrounding area.</br>
</br>
Without the need for explosives and just using pure mechanical power, the 10kg bomb blew up in the enemies' base.</br>
</br>
Soft lead made bombs allowed the bomb to break into thumb sized pieces and scatter under the heavy air pressure. This instantly blew the mutated humans nearby away like paper. The concrete wall nearby completely collapsed. The debris ten meters away even left bowl sized holes on the wall.</br>
</br>
"F*ck, what is that damn thing!" Wang Pin struggled to stand up from the snow. He lifted his blood filled face and frightenedly stared at the black dot in the sky.</br>
</br>
Luke was already dead. He saw the head meters away from the body. The poor guy had his neck blow off by debris as his entire head was severed from his body.</br>
</br>
"It's a helicopter! Dammit, why would Liuding Town's people be here?!" The mutated human hiding behind the barrier raised his binoculars as he said with a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
Liuding Town?!</br>
</br>
When he heard the word, Wang Pin instant felt a chill overwhelm his body. His limbs felt cold. Without hesitation, he got up and ran for his life to the concrete-made barrier.</br>
</br>
Based on rumors, on the wasteland near Wanghai City, only humans on the aircraft carrier inherited flight units before the war.</br>
</br>
But why would they show up here while they were located hundreds of kilometers away?</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
The deafening blast ended his thought as the snow and debris covered him.</br>
</br>
The bomb didn't just come from the sky. It also came from the horizon.</br>
</br>
As if it was an agreement, five arcs smashed into the mutated human base like iron fists. The half completed reinforced concrete wall was instantly shattered into pieces. As the pieces of concrete flew backward, the mutated humans taking cover behind it all dropped to the ground. The ones yet to be killed crawled into the town.</br>
</br>
Although the electromagnetic cannon used 5kg bombs, it was not inferior compared to the strike from the dome.</br>
</br>
"God, please stop!" Crawling into the corner of a room and covering his head, a mutated human roared with a whimpering voice. The rifle along with his arrogance were all thrown into the snow.</br>
</br>
"D*mmit, where is the anti-air cannon! We-"</br>
</br>
Under the far fire range, the mutated human's machine guns were like toys. The only purpose of their shouting was to unleash the fear in their hearts. The occasion bomb that flew to Fishbone base's side smashed into the building used as cover without any accuracy.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, on the Fishbone Base side, with the guidance of snipers as well as aerial coverage, the five tiger fired simultaneously and accurately, eliminating the mutated human's firepower and shattering their morale.</br>
</br>
"Someone seems to be using rifles to shoot at us." Jiang Chen looked at the screen and smiled. His finger lightly drew on the screen as he circled a few red dots.</br>
</br>
Debris flew up as the red dots were blown up to pieces by the bombs.</br>
</br>
"Only that anti-air machine gun is a bit threatening. Even if the assault rifle bullets could hit this far, the airflow would make it lose its accuracy." Chu Nan laughed, initiated automatic hovering, and moved his hands away from the controls.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen answered absentmindedly, his eyes were focused on the red dots on the screen. He then pressed his finger on the guy covering his head and ducking into the snow.</br>
</br>
Although those monstrous humans did not deserve mercy, the apathetic feeling of killing people through a screen still shocked him.</br>
</br>
Oh right, correction. They were not human.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of something else, how's that wife of yours?" Jiang Chen dragged his finger on the green dots and pointed on the location of the road. After receiving the command, 20 something light infantries began to move to the target location. He then pointed a few more times on the screen, and the other 20 light infantries crossed the barriers, pushing forward to the target area through the front.</br>
</br>
"Not bad," Chu Nan answered concisely as he didn't seem to want to continue on the topic.</br>
</br>
"Oh..." Even if he accepted, his heart must not feel so great.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't ask further.</br>
</br>
Over half of the mutated humans stationed in Shenxiang Town were eliminated. The remaining ones were under the heavy fire suppression of the electromagnetic cannon. The steel plate in front of their chests could block bullets, but when the bullets changed to electromagnetic cannons, it was as good as paper.</br>
</br>
While maintaining fire suppression, the two squads of light infantry quickly captured the mutated humans hiding in the barriers. As to the mutated human still reluctant to give up, merciless canons awaited them.</br>
</br>
Beep!</br>
</br>
A screeching alarm began to sound.</br>
</br>
"What's that noise?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"What else could it be. RPG "Flying Sword" anti-air missile. The mutated humans probably dug it up from a PAC armory," Chu Nan said casually as he simultaneously pressed a button beside the control panel.</br>
</br>
Click.</br>
</br>
Within the vision of the tablet, a few flashing sparks began to fall. The approaching anti-air missile directly hit one of the rubbles and scathed by the helicopter.</br>
</br>
"Electromagnetic lure. These things that chase after high-frequency electronic devices are easy to deal with. The anti air machine gun is more reliable." Chu Nan laughed contemptuously as he put his hands behind his head and sank further into the chair.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed his finger at the guy reloading the RPG, but Jiang Chen didn't use electromagnetic cannons this time. Instead, he commanded the infantry to attack him.</br>
</br>
He was very interested in the anti-air missile.</br>
</br>
If he could seize it, why would he destroy it?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo leaned tightly against the cover as he checked the coordinates on the EP. Then he signaled the team on the other side to throw a smoke bomb as they quickly pushed further into the town.</br>
</br>
An unfair battle.</br>
</br>
With the firepower advantage, the mutated human's muscles and their strength in numbers were not worth mentioning.</br>
</br>
They already crossed their defensive structure. At this point, his force still maintained zero casualties.</br>
</br>
Pointing the rifle out of cover, Cheng Weiguo aimed at the mutated human, with half of his body exposed carrying the RPG, and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
Tata-!</br>
</br>
The bullets instantly forced the mutated human to take cover and shredded more of the already in shambles concrete wall into pieces.</br>
</br>
The soldiers on the other wing quickly rushed in, just like how they were trained in exercise.</br>
</br>
The gunshots afar began to disappear. The force attacking from the side already controlled the south area of the town. The battle in the east should also be over.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo tugged at the thick scarf around his neck. His beard covered with ice shards, he breathed out a few white puffs.</br>
</br>
"Team A attack the town center and control the warehouse. Team B follow the boundary to clear out the area. Team C take control of the captives. Move!"</br>
</br>
"Yes, Sir!" The synched roar echoed within the communication channel.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo put the rifle on his arm, looked up at the black dot in the sky, and he saluted.</br>
</br>
But at this time, the snow beside him suddenly moved as he immediately pointed the gun at the pile.</br>
</br>
He maintained shooting position as he slowly moved to cover, using his feet to remove the snow.</br>
</br>
It was a face.</br>
</br>
The boy feebly looked at him with a bruise printed on his face.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Cheng Weiguo quickly kneeled down, used the handle of the gun to sweep the snow off of him, and dragged him out from the snow.</br>
</br>
"Sa...Save my mom..."</br>
</br>
Looking at the boy's face, the feeling of yet to extinct justice made him feel enraged.</br>
</br>
"Where is she?" He held onto the boy's hand and said firmly.</br>
</br>
"There..." The boy faintly pointed at the pile of snow on the side.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo put him on a concrete bag as he carried the gun and traversed through the snow to the pile.</br>
</br>
He dug through the snow and found a man. He was slightly shocked, but soon saw the woman below the man.</br>
</br>
The woman's body was exposed, her hair messy. Her breathing was faint as if she could lose her life at any second.</br>
</br>
The man on top of her already lost his breath. The soft lead debris penetrated his body. The shattered glasses was covered in blood.</br>
</br>
At the moment, Cheng Weiguo didn't understand the relationship between them, especially when he saw that there was another man under her.</br>
</br>
Regardless, saving her life was more important.</br>
</br>
He dragged the already dead man out of the snow. Cheng Weiguo then helped the sandwiched woman up.</br>
</br>
"It's all over. Your son is beside you."</br>
</br>
But in an instant, the woman's eyes became widened as she stared at something behind him.</br>
</br>
Suddenly alerted, Cheng Weiguo hugged the woman and rolled onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Dong-!</br>
</br>
A steel beam pierced the location he previous stood in as it deeply penetrated into the concrete bag.</br>
</br>
The blood covered Wang Pin stared at Cheng Weiguo in rage as he leaped towards him roaring.</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, he raised his gun, and the rifle unleashed its power on the mutated human's chest as blood began to splatter. But the mutated human did not back down as he took the bullets and pushed Cheng Weiguo onto the ground.</br>
</br>
"Roar-!" The mutated human clenched onto the reaper assault rifle, attempting to take it from Cheng Weiguo's hands.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo tightly clenched his teeth, his face entirely red. Obviously, he was no match for the mutated human's strength as the gun began to move in the mutated human's direction.</br>
</br>
Seeing he could not outmatch the mutated human's strength, he immediately let go.</br>
</br>
Because of the sudden jerk, Wang Pin's body immediately tilted up with the rifle, Grasping onto the opportunity, Cheng Weiguo swiftly grabbed the dagger on his leg and swung it at Wang Pin's throat.</br>
</br>
The dagger flashed through as blood began to splash all over the ground.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin dropped the rifle onto the ground as he covered his throat, pouring out blood. His mouth was open, but he couldn't say a word. He could only use the blood and his widened eyes to show his disbelief and bitterness.</br>
</br>
Grabbing the rifle on the ground, Cheng Weiguo, without hesitation, pressed the gun to his forehead and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
There was more blood.</br>
</br>
Wang Pin's shoulder loosened as he fell backward, deep into the thick snow.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the woman's shoulder began to loosen up too.</br>
</br>
[Alive...]</br>
</br>
Kneeled on the ground, she leaned her face against the snow pile beside her. She couldn't feel the coldness on her face anymore...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 180: Colony</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The battle ended swiftly, completely in contrast with the stalemate they were in when they encountered the mutated humans last time.</br>
</br>
The 30 infantries, who entered the town, did not suffer any casualties, and only one unlucky guy was shot in the leg by a recalcitrant mutated human. The bullet happened to pass through his artery. Although the blood gushing out was quite frightening, the combat medic was quick to rescue, and the man was no longer in a life-threatening condition.</br>
</br>
A total of 35 mutated humans were killed including 29 who died from electromagnetic pulse cannon and six of which died from of assault rifle and sniper attacks. Five were captured, and although mutated humans would rarely take the humiliation of being captured by a human lying down, under that overwhelming firepower, instinctive fear prevailed over the ridiculous pride.</br>
</br>
A total of 721 human captives were rescued. If the bodies outside the town were all dead, the population of the town should be 779 before the mutated humans came.</br>
</br>
There were bullet holes the size of a bowl throughout the exterior buildings outside of the town, and collapsed concrete buildings could be seen everywhere. Half of which were destroyed by the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The Fishbone Base infantry maintained the order of the queue as they recorded all the rescued townspeople and then provide them with the nutrient supply that originally belonged to them.</br>
</br>
The five Tigers didn't drive into the city but stopped at the bridgehead of Zhufeng highway. A few soldiers were carrying concrete bags to build five crude bunkers.</br>
</br>
This move was very intriguing.</br>
</br>
All the Shenxiang townspeople had one thought hovering in their mind: do these people want to stay here?</br>
</br>
They had a sense of foreboding.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Type-51 helicopter landed about a half kilometer away from the town in an open space. Jiang Chen, clad in kinetic skeletons, jumped down from the top. Cheng Weiguo, along with the mayor of the town, greeted Jiang Chen and saluted after seeing him.</br>
</br>
"Did you finish the census?" Jiang Chen cut to the chase.</br>
</br>
"It's done." Cheng Weiguo handed a tablet to Jiang Chen for him to check.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen swiped the screen while he perused the statistics.</br>
</br>
Population: 721, captive mutated humans: 5.</br>
</br>
Seized: 24 machine guns, 72 various models of rifles, 100 thousand rounds of bullets, 1 shoulder-launched missile, 5 surface-to-air missiles, 5 recoilless cannons, and 40 rounds of ammunition. And there were 40 sets of C-type steel armors, though most of them were destroyed in the explosion.</br>
</br>
Looking at these batches of firearms, Jiang Chen was secretly stunned.</br>
</br>
Oh boy, these firearms reserves could catch up with the entire assets of the Fishbone Base!</br>
</br>
It could be seen that these mutated humans invested a lot in this outpost, but now all of these belonged to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
These firearms would remain here, but he ordered the armors to be shipped back. Although these lumps of irons were of little value to humans, nevertheless it's still pretty good to reforge them. Fishbone Base could use more C-type steels. With about ten tons of steel, however, modifying them into two armored vehicles wouldn't be a problem.</br>
</br>
In addition, there were also hundreds of preserved mutants cadavers which appeared to be the food of mutated humans, since only they could eat something this toxic. However, so as not to waste anything, Jiang Chen still ordered Cheng Weiguo to throw these into the organic extractor to produce some nutrient supplies. With the ratio of one mutant to 100 nutrient supplies, it could easily extract 10,000 nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
Including the 30,000 in the storage, he temporarily did not have to worry about the rations of more than 700 people.</br>
</br>
What excited him most was the construction materials that he seized. The mutated humans left a huge amount of cement and steels in the warehouse which were originally used to build an outpost, but right now, they were in his hands.</br>
</br>
With these batches of prefabricated construction materials, Jiang Chen could easily stretch out reinforced concrete defensive line along the shore.</br>
</br>
He returned the tablet to Cheng Weiguo, said a few words, and the latter received the order at once and left.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen finally turned to look at the mayor, who had been standing there and smiled amiably at him.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was looking at him, the mayor quickly bowed, "The honorable Fishbone Base leader, Mr. Jiang Chen, on behalf of all the survivors in Shenxiang town, I would like to express our utmost gratitude and sincerity to you."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about it...Do tell, what's your name?"</br>
</br>
"Deng Bin."</br>
</br>
"Okay, Mr. Deng Bin, I want to go to the town hall now. Do you have time to take me there?"</br>
</br>
"My pleasure." Deng Bin bowed again.</br>
</br>
To be honest, as the mayor, their "savior's" behavior after eliminating the mutated humans made him very uneasy. At the moment, however, they were wielding guns, and the entire military power of the town was wiped out after the onslaught of mutated humans. Not possessing confidence nor knowing what to say, he could only meekly follow Jiang Chen on the side.</br>
</br>
With hands in his pocket, Jiang Chen looked at the surrounding buildings while walking on the road leading to the town hall.</br>
</br>
The reek of blood lingered in the nose and did not fade away even after a long time.</br>
</br>
Along the way, he didn't say anything which actually made Deng Bin somewhat uncertain.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, Deng Bin looked at Jiang Chen and asked tentatively, "In just three days, they already slaughtered more than 60 of us. Truly grateful to you—us survivors from Qingpu. If there is anything we can help you with, we'll do our absolute best."</br>
</br>
"I've already said not to worry about it," Jiang Chen, however, didn't directly answer. Instead, he only responded in a brief sentence before no longer speaking.</br>
</br>
While Deng Bin's heart was still apprehensive, the two had arrived in front of the town hall.</br>
</br>
To his surprise, the leader of the mysterious organization didn't seem to have the intention to go in; rather, he just stood in front of the town hall.</br>
</br>
Did it deserve to be called a government building? It was aesthetically built, and based on the damage, it could be considered the only intact building in the entire town.</br>
</br>
"Say, was there a person called Lin Chaoen who came to your place before?"</br>
</br>
Deng Bin was a bit stunned for a moment, as he didn't expect Jiang Chen would suddenly ask this irrelevant question.</br>
</br>
Frowning, he tried to recall carefully and answered, "There seems to be someone like that...he came from Jia City."</br>
</br>
"Did he not say anything to you? Like how the mutated humans would be here?" Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
Looking blankly at Jiang Chen, Deng Binyao shook his head and said, "No, he only stayed in our town for a night before leaving hastily."</br>
</br>
Hadn't said anything?</br>
</br>
[That's extremely odd. If they desperately wanted to prevent the mutated humans from invading Wanghai City, there is no reason not to alert the people here, so that they can make early preparations. Or at the very least, build some defensive structures.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly knitted his brows as he carefully scrutinized Deng Bin's eyes.</br>
</br>
[It doesn't seem like he's pretending at all.]</br>
</br>
"How did you remember him...what I mean is, is there anything special about him that made you take a closer look at him?"</br>
</br>
"Hehe, there was one. Because the people passing through Zhufeng highway were usually lone travelers from Jia Cty, they come here to dig a few components or microchips from military equipment. These things would sell well anywhere in the mainland. The worst-case scenario is that they would go to Liuding town to buy a few boxes of canned fish to sell when they returned, and then the price could at least double. However, only Lin Chaoen came back empty-handed."</br>
</br>
"Has he only been here once?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, he seemed to have taken another route when he went to Wanghai City."</br>
</br>
Nodding thoughtfully, Jiang Chen became lost in thought.</br>
</br>
Deng Bin, standing on the side, was trying to figure out the expression on Jiang Chen's face but couldn't manage to read the slightest useful information. He couldn't understand why Jiang Chen would suddenly ask about the lone travelers. Was there any deeper meaning in this?</br>
</br>
While he was speculating, Jiang Chen spoke again, but this time it was to ask a different question.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk about something else. What do you do to earn a living?"</br>
</br>
More than 700 people were not a small number. It's not the city center, so there were not enough zombies to provide organic matter that could be used to extract nutrient supply. Although there were quite a number of mutants here, they were usually powerful. If they ever hunted mutants, they didn't exactly look like a well-equipped group of survivors.</br>
</br>
"We planted some crops on the farms outside the town to extract nutrient supplies," Deng Bin looked at Jiang Chen in the eyes and said cautiously.</br>
</br>
The fruit of the mutant plants could not be eaten, but it could be used as an excellent raw material for the extraction of nutrient supplies. Many survivors in Qingpu would also plant such crops on the roof and go to the Sixth Street to exchange for crystals or nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What is the degree of soil contamination here? What about the radiation?"</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen seem to be showing no interest in the nutrient supply in the warehouse, Deng Bin felt slightly relieved and muttered, "It seems to be 9...and 20."</br>
</br>
With regards to this, he didn't have to lie about it. The two numbers were easy to measure. The radiation value could be measured by EP, and the soil contamination would only require to take a sample and then to drop two drops of reagent.</br>
</br>
"9? Very good!" Jiang Chen suddenly laughed and then reached out and patted Deng Bin on the shoulder, "From this day onwards, you'll be in charge of the farm."</br>
</br>
Deng Bin paused while looking completely dumbfounded. He couldn't understand the meaning behind his words.</br>
</br>
"Farm? Me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, looked at him and said, "That's right, who else would it be?"</br>
</br>
Swallowing his saliva, Deng Bin was still bewildered and asked, "If you want those mutated fruits, we are willing to pay tribute to you—"</br>
</br>
Those things were not worth money at all, and not to mention the price of organic matter was declining. Even with the price two months ago, one ton of fruit could only extract 100 nutrient supplies which could be exchanged for ten crystals. The reaper rifle alone in their hands was worth 20. Thus, they didn't need to care about this small profit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand to interrupt him.</br>
</br>
"You misunderstood me, we don't care about those rotten fruits that you planted."</br>
</br>
It was the truth, Fishbone Base didn't need nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
"Then you mean—"</br>
</br>
"Am I still not direct enough? Former mayor, I need you to take care of my farm for me." There were two words Jiang Chen emphasized and they were "former mayor" and "my".</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this, Deng Bin's face instantly paled, his eyes widened, "You, you want to occupy our homes, you can't do—"</br>
</br>
"But we can, the mutated humans are going to cross this river, and I will prevent that from happening, and so we're here."</br>
</br>
"But all of them are dead now..." Deng Bin had difficulty speaking.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked strangely at Deng Bin, he smiled and said: "Are we having a misunderstanding here? You think we are here on a special trip to rescue you? I am sorry to tell you, but we are only fighting against the mutated humans. And this place is only the outpost I captured from them. Moreover, in accordance with the rules of the wasteland, since I saved you, you are all my captives."</br>
</br>
Deng Bin's lips trembled and couldn't utter a single word. His previous thought was they were saved, but in the end, it was just a change of ownership.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he had no reaction, Jiang Chen could also not care any less.</br>
</br>
"They will be back. Furthermore, there would be more of them, but I will defend here."</br>
</br>
Stamping his foot, he pointed towards the ground beneath his foot.</br>
</br>
"And from now on, this is my colony."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 181: As firm as the pyramid</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, Fishbone's flag was raised at the town hall of Shenxiang Town, proclaiming that it had officially become part of the territory of Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
Under the supervision of 20 riflemen, more than 200 survivors carrying cement bags and steel bars arrived at Taipu River. They would be under the leadership of 20 engineers that Fishbone dispatched to establish defense facilities on the riverside.</br>
</br>
Although they were still being forced to engage in manual labor, Jiang Chen's treatment of them was far better than the mutated humans. Not only did he distribute winter clothes bought from the Sixth Street, but he also didn't use whip in order to force them to work harder. As long as they were not slacking off, they would not be punished for failing to finish the project on time.</br>
</br>
During his encounter with Shenxiang Town, Jiang Chen used a completely different strategy compared to winning over the group of survivors in Qingpu area.</br>
</br>
As a result of being situated outside of the city where the population density was extremely low, the zombies in town were obliterated. After more than ten years of hard work, the town was finally cleared of zombies. It can be said that they lived in comfort these past years compared to those struggling survivors in the metropolis. Thus, their combat ability was also much weaker, and the difficulty of enlisting them was also naturally lesser.</br>
</br>
For instance, the survivors in Shenxiang town were all hoes-wielding farmers, while the survivors of Qingpu were gun-wielding hunters. For the nomadic "hunters", Jiang Chen adopted a strategy of trading, enticing, and then assimilating. For these "farmers", however, he adopted a straightforward approach in assimilating them in his military force.</br>
</br>
All the survivors implanted with slavery microchips were directly promoted to the management position, and the construction of infrastructure was handed over to more than 700 newly joined members. So far, this was how the pyramid's governing structure was established. Jiang Chen merely needed to keep a firm grip on the people on the top layer of the pyramid, and there would naturally be people under him who would take charge on his behalf for the matters in the bottom layer.</br>
</br>
In order to supervise the construction of the defensive structure, Lu Huasheng personally took along a team to take over the construction.</br>
</br>
The 200 survivors were split into 20 team, with each team being led by one engineer dispatched from Fishbone Base as they worked round the clock to construct the defensive structure.</br>
</br>
On the other side, on Shenxiang Town's eastern part of the wilderness, more than 200 survivors were struggling to develop the barren land.</br>
</br>
Here, one had to admire Jiang Chen's foresight to feed the survivors in his own base with "green food". Regardless whether or not it was done out of consideration, it was only now it was showing its merit. If someone consumed this type of thick nutrient supply, one would urinate more frequently, but it would definitely be a long time before one would feel the need to defecate.</br>
</br>
</br>
The survivors, who were busy clearing out the barren lands, were stunned when they saw a vehicle full of dried manure being pulled into the hill on the side of the farm.</br>
</br>
The mutated crops consumed a high amount of nutrients from the soil, and the fertilizer made out of mutants or zombies would increase the contamination of the soil (toxicity). Thus, they would naturally consider human waste as an option. They usually had to purchase industrial fertilizer from Sixth Street to supplement the fertility of the soil.</br>
</br>
How valuable was this waste?</br>
</br>
At first, Jiang Chen hadn't given it much thought but instead felt the impact of this on health was quite significant. It was not until the survivors of Qingpu offered a contract to clean their base that he began to notice the problem.</br>
</br>
In this wasteland, human waste seemed to be extremely valuable too?</br>
</br>
Wanghai City was located in the plains, where mineral deposits were extremely scarce in the surrounding area. Although nitrogen could be obtained through artificial nitrogen fixation technology and potassium could also be extracted from seawater, phosphorus scarcity was much harder to resolve. The cost of extracting phosphorus from a mutant organism or plant was not exactly low, and the main cost of producing fertilizer in the Sixth Street was higher than this phosphorus.</br>
</br>
Excrement, however, was quite easy to handle. Its nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents were very rich and only needed to be mixed into the soil and then sprinkle the seeds.</br>
</br>
Under Jiang Chen's direction, the farm's plot expanded from hundred acres to thousands of acres. If all of it was used to grow Carm tree, it was estimated that it could provide 100 tons of Carm resin per month. In this case, not only would it meet the industrial needs of Fishbone Base, it could also be exported to the Sixth Street. Based on the prevailing price of 150 crystals per ton, the farm would bring Fishbone Base a revenue of 10,000 crystals per month.</br>
</br>
As for the ration of more than 700 people, provided there were 30 days in a month, two nutrient supplies per day, and if one dose of nutrient cost 0.1 crystal, it would only amount to more than 4,000 crystals.</br>
</br>
As for those "expensive" provisions, after taking Sun Jiao's advice into consideration, Jiang Chen decided not supply them to the newly joined survivors for the time being. As for the reason, it was not because he was stingy, but rather it was to reinforce social class structure.</br>
</br>
Unlike those survivors that were already implanted with microchips and sold themselves to Jiang Chen, if these precious rations were given too casually, it wouldn't make these "foreigners" feel grateful. On the contrary, it's likely that they would come to feel that it was too easy, and this might even give birth to disloyalty.</br>
</br>
When all was said and done, this was the first time they assimilated more than 700 foreign population which was practically more than three times the population of Fishbone Base, and these 700 people also belonged to the same group. If you just want to enslave them to do manual labor, one just needed to fetter their hands and feet with fetters and handcuffs. However, if you want to "digest" them, you must split them apart first.</br>
</br>
The specifics of implementation were also quite simple.</br>
</br>
700 people, first split them into two; first half would remain here, while the rest would be brought back to the Fishbone Base. Those who were brought back would join the factory to engage in manufacturing or enter the new military camp to receive training.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen announced that every one of them was a slave, and only two nutrients mixtures could be obtained every day.</br>
</br>
But if someone performed outstandingly in their work, his identity would be upgraded to that of a low-class citizen, and daily ration would be upgraded to two nutrient mixtures, plus a piece of bread.</br>
</br>
If you work harder and got upgraded to a middle-class citizen, the ration would turn into two nutrient mixtures, in addition to a pack of instant noodles.</br>
</br>
If they became a high-class citizen, they would be able to enjoy unlimited rations just like those people implanted with microchips and would be allowed to participate in the "communal feeding" in the dining hall. Apart from not being able to join management position, they also enjoyed civil rights that were no different from those who were implanted with chips.</br>
</br>
Once a disparity in status appeared in their small social circle, they would automatically split apart. Those who got promoted would protect their own interests and naturally stand on Jiang Chen's side in order to strive further for a higher promotion.</br>
</br>
If they had the opportunity to climb up, most people would still choose to be content with what they have.</br>
</br>
In addition to this, in order to distinguish ranks, all survivors implanted with chips would be conferred with a "Knight Emblem" as a means to encourage their contribution to the construction of Fishbone Base. Moreover, the "slavery chip" was officially renamed to "honorary chip". Despite being the same thing and only the name had changed, Jiang Chen could clearly sense the distinctive difference in the posture of those survivors who got promoted to knights after he promulgated his decision.</br>
</br>
.....</br>
</br>
The sense of honor, if used correctly, would be much more useful than those chips.</br>
</br>
Of course, only under the premise that everyone could fill their belly would someone be able to pursue that illusory honor.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 182: Birthday</br>
</div></br>
</br>
As for those emblems, those were "copy military goods" that Jiang Chen ordered from wholesale online shopping back from the modern world. The gold-plated appearance looked delicate, workmanship was also fine, and other than the lack of necessary certificates, it was no different than the real ones.</br>
</br>
Regardless whether it was male or female, both could be honored.</br>
</br>
On these more than 200 knights, Jiang Chen spent three days of effort to complete the "knighting" process.</br>
</br>
If high-class citizens wanted to become part of the knight society and enter management, they must have an even more outstanding contribution. For example, meritorious military service or a breakthrough in the technological field, and so on.</br>
</br>
After going through a busy schedule, the might of pyramid was at long last completed.</br>
</br>
The production and life in the base returned to the right track, and after the introduction of fresh blood, there was more liveliness in the base.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Ten days had passed and the colony became stable.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sent Zhao Gang to be in charge of the colony's defense and moved Cheng Weiguo back to handle the training of the new recruits. The five Tigers and 30 riflemen were left there, and -51 served as a gunship and was transported back.</br>
</br>
In the same way, Jiang Chen transferred more than 100 newly produced units of hummingbird drones. He also sent some technicians to establish a relay station to control the drones in the local area. These kinds of low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have a surprisingly effective scouting and attacking ability. With this batch of drones, it undoubtedly alleviated Fishbone Base's issue of insufficient strength significantly.</br>
</br>
The production line of the kinetic skeleton under the leadership of Jiang Lin was also completed. For this, Jiang Chen specifically ordered the construction team to build a factory in the newly developed area that could accommodate hundreds of people. Based on Jiang Lin's estimate, provided that there were sufficient raw materials to go around, 30 kinetic skeletons monthly production could reach 30 units.</br>
</br>
After handling everything properly, Jiang Chen suddenly found himself free.</br>
</br>
You couldn't help but praise the talent of the Fishbone Base, which practically comprised of almost every trade in the industry. There were some things that he only needed to set the general direction, and his subordinates would already think of the execution plan for him.</br>
</br>
"By the way, is it almost Yao Yao's birthday?"</br>
</br>
While they were eating, Jiang Chen suddenly asked aloud.</br>
</br>
He remembered Yao Yao had told him last time that her birthday was in November. It's already mid-November, and he got so busy in the past that he almost forgot.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Uh..." Yao Yao face instantly turned red. She lowered her head, feeling shy, and said coyly, "Umm, its...it's not a big deal. If big brother is too busy, then it's okay if we put it off for a while."</br>
</br>
</br>
"That's not okay, there is no meaning if the birthday is not on that day!" Jiang Chen said without hesitation as he took a huge bite out of the roasted golden chicken leg.</br>
</br>
"Eh? O-okay. It's on November 16, hehe..." Yao Yao charmingly smiled while staring blankly at the bowl of egg soup in her bowl, gently poking the soft pudding with her spoon unconsciously.</br>
</br>
November 16, so it's the day after tomorrow?</br>
</br>
"What present does Yao Yao want?" Jiang Chen rubbed Yao Yao's head as he smiled.</br>
</br>
Hearing about the present, Lin Lin, who was sitting across Jiang Chen, perked her ears and immediately shifted her attention away from her bowl of food, and raised her hand to interrupt.</br>
</br>
"For your information, my birthday is on May 27, and I want a Hadron Collider—"</br>
</br>
"In your dreams." Jiang Chen glared at her.</br>
</br>
"Woo—" Lin Lin puffed her cheeks as though throwing a tantrum, the pale and gorgeous face was bloated to a dark, red color.</br>
</br>
But contrary to Jiang Chen's expectation, she held her tongue this time.</br>
</br>
[She finally remembers how to act when freeloading?] Jiang Chen ridiculed in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Hmm, you have a birthday, that's wonderful." A rare sight where Sun Jiao, who never spoke during meals, looked up, her mouth was drawn into a grimace while looking outside.</br>
</br>
This feminine appearance was not typical of this bold girl that Jiang Chen couldn't help but give her a few more looks.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Sister Sun Jiao doesn't know your own birthday?" Yao Yao looked at Sun Jiao with a hint of sympathy.</br>
</br>
From Yao Yao's perspective, your birthday should be the happiest day of the year. Before the war, whenever it was her birthday, mother and father would treat her like a princess, and took her to eat lots of yummy food...</br>
</br>
Thinking of her parents, Yao Yao's eyes could not help but flash a touch of sadness. But when she saw "Big Brother" sitting beside her, a gentle and pure love appeared in her eyes, her tiny hand softly covered the hand on top of her head.</br>
</br>
"Who would remember that kind of thing?" Muttering, Sun Jiao pursed his lips and stared at the hand on top of Yao Yao's head with jealousy.</br>
</br>
But she didn’t say anything. Compared to her initial possessiveness, she was starting to learn how to share.</br>
</br>
This decision was not due to her magnanimity but because when the last time that Jiang Chen came back, she faintly read a trace of fatigue from his eyes.</br>
</br>
When she tried putting herself in his shoes—if she could live in a peaceful environment and become a wealthy girl in a mansion, would she want to come back the world full of chaos?</br>
</br>
She had already thought of sharing him with Yao Yao for quite some time, but she had not been able to put the idea into motion.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was time to push this little girl a bit?</br>
</br>
With both hands against her chin, she mischievously looked at Lin Lin, who was sitting next to her.</br>
</br>
To be fair, this girl was also gorgeous. Though she was but a digitalized human, but as a sex robot…</br>
</br>
As though seemingly aware of Sun Jiao's gaze, Lin Lin blankly raised her head, but when she made eye contact with her, she involuntarily shuddered.</br>
</br>
This female devil must be thinking of something evil!</br>
</br>
Lin Lin quickly came to a conclusion, as she subconsciously went into "self-protection" mode, fiercely glaring at Sun Jiao. Her threatening look appeared to be saying: Stop looking at me!</br>
</br>
However, using deterrent skills against Miss Sun Jiao was undoubtedly a foolish choice, as Sun Jiao just raised her brows and bluntly stared back.</br>
</br>
The arrogant eyes seemed to say: I'm looking at you, so what are you going to do?</br>
</br>
Like a startled rabbit, Lin Lin quickly lowered her head as she pouted, feeling wronged.</br>
</br>
"Um, I won’t celebrate my birthday either. If it's just me, it would feel too devious…" After listening to Sun Jiao, Yao Yao sensibly spoke in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was stunned, a gentle smile appeared on her face, "It’s okay, you helped this bad guy so much, it’s time for him to treat you. Don’t worry about it. If he dared to bully you, sister will step up for you!"</br>
</br>
With that, Sun Jiao even threateningly waved her lovely, little fist.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Jiang Chen couldn’t help but laugh.</br>
</br>
What else could make men more excited than a harmonious "harem"?</br>
</br>
Although this harem's current size was only one and a half…</br>
</br>
"Any, any request?" Yao Yao flushed as she asked faintly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Jiang Chen nodded earnestly, rubbing her fluffy hair, "As long as it's something within my means, I'll do it."</br>
</br>
"Um….woo, I’ll keep it a secret for now." Yao Yao said shyly, her head was lowered, feeling conflicted.</br>
</br>
[Which person can keep the gift she receives confidential?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face showed a dumbfounded expression.</br>
</br>
"Uh, you should at least give me some time to prepare, it would be too late on the day of your birthday."</br>
</br>
"Prepare…right," Yao Yao gently bite her lip as she looked up courageously. With eyes filled with anticipation, she looked at Jiang Chen, "Can, can you lend me a day?"</br>
</br>
"Lend? If there is something you really want, why don't I just give it to you?" Jiang Chen asked uncertainly.</br>
</br>
"Umm, although this is a very tempting proposal, sister Sun Jiao would definitely be unhappy, so I’ll just borrow you for a day…" She stole a glance at Sun Jiao as Yao Yao said softly.</br>
</br>
"What, am I such a stingy person?" Sun Jiao said with dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
"No, that’s not what it is, it's just that—" Yao Yao anxiously waved her hands, and then lowered her head shyly, "I want to borrow…um! In short, just accompany me for a day, is that okay?"</br>
</br>
[Is that it?] Jiang Chen couldn't help but facepalm.</br>
</br>
"Of course. That's it?"</br>
</br>
"It's an entire day! You're not busy, right?" Yao Yao asked quietly.</br>
</br>
"An entire day? Does that include the night?" Sun Jiao was stunned.</br>
</br>
"Ahem—" Lin Lin suddenly choked on her food. She quickly covered her mouth and reached for the bowl of soup.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao’s face flushed like her blood was about to drip out. Oddly, she didn’t rush to offer an explanation, she stared at her knees instead, swinging her pair of smooth and white porcelain-like legs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also stunned, he awkwardly scratched his cheek.</br>
</br>
As soon as these words came out, the atmosphere on the dining table suddenly became "tense".</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I think, considering your age, some things are just too exciting for Yao Yao, so I think the night should be left to me." Sun Jiao carefully shifted her gaze.</br>
</br>
"I, I am not young anymore." It was rather rare for Yao Yao not to retreat, but she mustered her courage and retorted, "I'm already three years over 30!"</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this, Sun Jiao couldn't help but feel shame. She was definitely not backing down just because she exposed her age.</br>
</br>
"But you spent more than 20 years in the hibernation chamber, right?" Lin Lin chipped in. "Moreover, if the inhibitor was used before adulthood, you would need another ten more years for you to grow to the maturity 18 years old."</br>
</br>
"Ten years!" Yao Yao was like a squirrel that had been frightened, but she was still not ready to give up, "But from any perspective, I am already mature."</br>
</br>
But the legs dangling on the chair didn't make for convincing argument at all.</br>
</br>
"Oh? In what way?" Lin Lin persisted, clearly not letting it go.</br>
</br>
As though abandoning all her humiliation, Yao Yao with two red cheeks, closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
"I, I already have my period!" she bellowed.</br>
</br>
The room turned eerily silent for a moment.</br>
</br>
As though the two consecutive verbal sparring had sapped all her energy away, the small loli wobbly sank into her chair.</br>
</br>
"Uh, we should discuss the cake." Sun Jiao held her laughter as she averted her gaze.</br>
</br>
"Yes, indeed, the cake is more important." Jiang Chen was speechless.</br>
</br>
"I second that." Lin Lin raised her spoon as an agreement.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 183: The Seventh Area</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The snow was ferocious.</br>
</br>
The concrete walls in the ruins were covered by a layer of ice and the dangling steel beams were frozen into crystalline rods.</br>
</br>
Below, ragged figures strolled. There was an unhealthy color on their faces, and their expressions were frozen numb. The heavy loads on their backs crushed their spine and knees.</br>
</br>
The person standing on the side was evidently the mutated human supervisor.</br>
</br>
For slaves of mutated human, the only escape was to be picked at around 30 years of age through pure luck. From there, finish the breeding mission, immerse in the growth vial, and to be "reborn."</br>
</br>
As for the people who were not so lucky, their fate was usually tragic…</br>
</br>
Since the growth vial and growth solution were limited, not everyone had rights to become a mutated human. Mutated humans also needed to maintain a population of slaves in order to complete the dreadful tasks that none of them wanted to do and at the same time, the mutated humans needed a source of entertainment.</br>
</br>
Standing at the door of the encampment, Troy grimly watched the frail figures as he turned around to look at the human beside him.</br>
</br>
That’s right. Beside him, a human stood!</br>
</br>
Any survivor in Wanghai city who happens to witness this scene would drop their jaws. Based on common sense, there was no possibility of negotiation between a mutated human and a human, let alone for them to stand side by side.</br>
</br>
This person wore a fur coat and the red ring on his finger was quite distinctive. Anyone with the right knowledge would shockingly discover that the white fur on his collar belonged to the mane of the Bloodthirsty Lion.</br>
</br>
As the king of dangerous creatures, Bloodthirsty Lions could combat five Death Claws simultaneously. Their sharp teeth were like blades that could easily rip through power armors. But they were rare in the Eastern area as they usually inhabit in the far northwestern plain. Because of their ferocity, they were rarely hunted. Hence, the unique mane gained popularity among collectors.</br>
</br>
As for the red ring, it was even more incredible.</br>
</br>
It was a blood crystal.</br>
</br>
Usually, mutants would form crystals around the nerve center as a highly efficient energy storage device. But blood crystals were unique on its own. Although they were created with the same elements, blood crystals' energy storage was thousands of times greater. A piece the size of a thumb could be compared to the energy generated from one kilogram of fissile material through nuclear fission.</br>
</br>
But what was beyond comprehension was that the blood crystals' existence was stable. Despite people’s attempt, they could not use the energy inside. Not even human - the mutants who generated the blood crystal themselves couldn’t utilize the energy inside. Precisely, any mutant who creates these blood crystals would be the failure of the spices.</br>
</br>
</br>
The extraordinary potential and rarity of blood crystals made them a luxurious collector item, especially favored by the nobles in the Northern Alliance Area.</br>
</br>
By this point, the man’s identity couldn’t be more obvious.</br>
</br>
He came from the north, and his status was prestigious.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Troy, what’s the progress for your soldiers?" Bo Yu put his hands in his pocket as he asked the mutated human standing beside him.</br>
</br>
"The outpost is already established," Troy cracked a smile exposing his fearsome red gum, "Once the last batch of the armored trucks is completed, my team can head out."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is that right?" The man in luxurious clothes seemed to be nonchalant to the answer of the mutated human leader as his reply was short.</br>
</br>
Silence ensued between the two.</br>
</br>
The mutated human called Troy seemed to be fearful of the power coming out of the man from the Northern Alliance, even though this place was thousands of kilometers away from the Northern Alliance, even though this place was his home base.</br>
</br>
"Seeing your own people suffer, do you not have any thoughts in your mind?" Troy cracked a smile as he asked disrespectfully.</br>
</br>
"We are different from monsters, we don’t have to possess those extraneous herd mentality." Bo Yu laughed, not bothered at all.</br>
</br>
Troy’s eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
The fact that they have always viewed highly of themselves meant that they were particularly sensitive to the fact that humans categorize them as mutated creatures.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I have a phone call." Bo Yu shrugged as he walked to the side, then he pressed the phone to his earlobe.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Oh… This is unfortunate then, okay. Mhmm… Keep monitoring their movements. The name is Jiang Chen right? Interesting, I am going to hang up."</br>
</br>
Troy stared gravely at his position.</br>
</br>
"Sorry buddy, your outpost seems to be gone." Bo Yu ignored the unfriendliness as he casually strolled beside him.</br>
</br>
Troy's throat moved, he didn’t overthink it. But the expression on this man’s face made him uncertain.</br>
</br>
Simultaneous, a mutated human ran from the distance. The frightened look on his face, even from afar in the heavy snow, was clearly visible.</br>
</br>
Troy’s eyebrows twitched as he looked at Bo Yu on the side. The grin on his face triggered him.</br>
</br>
But he couldn’t be angry right now.</br>
</br>
"Leader, our force stationed in Shenxiang town-"</br>
</br>
"Was eliminated?"</br>
</br>
The mutated human here to report the news hesitated before he immediately lowered his head and continued his report in a tough tone.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Troy took a deep breath while he tried to calm his ready-to-explode emotion.</br>
</br>
"Which force did it…"</br>
</br>
"Liuding town… Our people saw their helicopter with binoculars. It was the Type-51 transport helicopter equipped with electromagnetic pulse cannon. Their symbol was below the helicopter."</br>
</br>
"How would Liuding town’s people appear here?" Troy was shocked.</br>
</br>
Although he was skeptical towards this information, he couldn’t find an argument against it. Since within the entire area, only Liuding Town’s people possessed air units.</br>
</br>
If Liuding town intervened, his plan would be much more difficult to execute.</br>
</br>
He thought about this as Troy’s eyebrows began to tense up.</br>
</br>
He heard of Liuding Town’s force before. The electromagnetic pulse cannon on the aircraft carriers had a maximum range of 500 kilometers under atmospheric condition. It could be fired from the exit of Long River and directly strike Luzhou. Needless to say, his seventh area was right beside Wanghai city.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I do have to let you know that it was not Liuding Town's people who wiped out your outpost." As if he was very familiar with the force distribution within Wanghai city, Bo Yu interrupted.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Troy raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Liuding Town’s people would never install electromagnetic pulse cannon on their helicopter because their electromagnetic cannon could strike any target in Wanghai city freely. Even if you built defensive structures, under the impact of a 100kg bomb, how many seconds would you last" Bo Yu smirked.</br>
</br>
"Then, you mean...?"</br>
</br>
"Your information is too outdated. A "glorious leader" was born in Qingpu. Under his call for unity and the temptation for food, the scattered survivors unified and built a base called Fishbone Base on the ruins… Also, according to my research, they have a trade relationship with the Zhao Corporation on the Sixth Street. The exact reason is food related," Bo Yu said.</br>
</br>
"Food?" Troy looked at Bo Yu with not the friendliest look, "Based on what I know, on the entire wasteland, the only place that can produce food is the Northern Alliance Area. Can I interpret that you sponsored that force?"</br>
</br>
The undeveloped area in the northwestern region was barely scratched during the chaos of the war. Although the soil was barren, fertilizer was a much simpler problem to solve compared to contamination and radiation. If you go further north, you would reach the front-line between PAC and CCCP. That place also lies in shambles like Wanghai city.</br>
</br>
Therefore, in the entire Hua area, only northwestern region produced edible crops.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu sighed at the information.</br>
</br>
"The entire wasteland? By 'entire', do you mean Wanghai city, or within the PAC borders, or the entire world?"</br>
</br>
"Is there a point in discussing world geography?" Troy mocked.</br>
</br>
"It’s all about the structure we are in." Bo Yu shrugged, "Being unable to farm is only because the technology is not on par. Our radiation treatment technology is well designed. If it is not, then even if you were given clean soil, you can not grow anything it. At the same time, as long as the technology is available, any corner of the wasteland can easily grow delicious fresh fruits and vegetables. Their food probably comes from an established garden underground. But these are not the key points, only one thing interests me."</br>
</br>
"Project Garden of Eden?" Troy burst out laughing, "This is quite funny. If that Project Garden of Eden could restore farming, then why do those elites flee into space?"</br>
</br>
"Because hope afar is far more tempting than dealing with chaos here." Bo Yu smiled as he paused, then he continued, "On space colonization, I maintain the same stance as the dissolved World Alliance Organization."</br>
</br>
"But those people didn’t let the <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="066d6f75752b4675752b7f6973">[email&#160;protected]</a> go on the boat." Troy continued to mock.</br>
</br>
"Why would I need a ticket to go on the boat? As long as I have the technology, I can easily build another colonization ship." Bo Yu laughed out loud as he took out his hands from the pockets and pointed to the sky, "Give me 20 years and I’ll rebuild a high technology park. Give me 50 years and I’ll take the descendants into space again. What should be abandoned is not us, but rather the soil below us!"</br>
</br>
"Why don’t you learn from us? Evolve then adapt? If you don’t try it yourself, you will never know how delicious Death Claw’s meat is."</br>
</br>
Bo Yu’s calm and collected expression flashed a rare glimpse of disgust, but it quickly faded.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, discussing value proposition is something more boring than ideology. You’ll get the improved FEV virus and you will take your species to adapt to the wasteland. But, remember our deal."</br>
</br>
Bo Yu controlled the security password of the Carman Pharmaceutical, it was him that provided the FEV virus information to the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I’ll lead my people to help you attack 'that place' within the city center We will find out the location of the Fallout Shelter 005, if it really exists that is."</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry about that anymore. My information has always been reliable. Fallout Shelter 005 is located in Wanghai city," Bo Yu said confidently.</br>
</br>
Troy glanced at Bo Yu before he looked away towards the direction of the slaves.</br>
</br>
It used to be an empty plot of land but it was now packed with military supplies.</br>
</br>
Rifles, machine guns, armors, armored trucks, even cannons and bombs!</br>
</br>
Within this shipment, some belonged to the mutated humans, but the majority was from the man called Bo Yu.</br>
</br>
With a common interest, even mutated humans and humans could stand side by side.</br>
</br>
"We must go into the city center… Looks like we will need to start our journey in the winter."</br>
</br>
Fixated on the snow in the distance, Troy said in an undertone.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 184: Who should I bring home for New Year</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Although it was Yao Yao’s birthday, Sun Jiao and Lin Lin all rushed to list their requirements for the birthday cake.</br>
</br>
Chocolate.</br>
</br>
Mango.</br>
</br>
Those were definitely what they wanted to eat.</br>
</br>
Instead, the protagonist of the birthday – Yao Yao, feebly expressed that any flavored cake was fine, as long as brother Jiang Chen likes it.</br>
</br>
[Ahh…Yao Yao is the cutest.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shouted in his mind.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen specifically made a trip back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
"You are back." Ayesha happened to pass by just in time to see Jiang Chen come out of the door, she tilted her head and asked.</br>
</br>
Before, he would stay for a long time before making a trip back, but now it seemed to be much more frequent.</br>
</br>
Last time it was five days ago. He came to buy emblems?</br>
</br>
"I came back to buy something. Oh, do you want to head out with me?" Jiang Chen suggested out of the blue.</br>
</br>
He knew nothing about cakes. In his memory, he hasn't celebrated a birthday in a long time. It would be better to have a girl’s opinion.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." She didn’t ask what he wanted to buy as she gently nodded.</br>
</br>
Ayesha changed into a Gothic-style skirt, white stockings, and black platform shoes. She held onto Jiang Chen’s hand as they left the house. Because she was usually very shy about being intimate in public, her unwillingness to let go and her blushed face was particularly cute.</br>
</br>
They bought this set of clothes in Kane last time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the garage door as he sat in the front passenger seat. Ayesha sat in the driver position.</br>
</br>
Her driving skill was acquired from the virtual reality training system. As to the driver license... is anything difficult to obtain if money is involved?</br>
</br>
"Where are we going?"</br>
</br>
"Shimao Mall." Jiang Chen gave it a thought, but the only place he could think of that was prosperous was the shopping mall in the city center.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Ayesha softly combed her brown hair to the side of her face, she smiled tenderly while starting the car.</br>
</br>
Although it was the same Wanghai city, in the midst of November, the sun here was much more graceful here with only a hint of chillness mixed in the air. It was fair to expect that in the modern world, Wanghai city would have a warm winter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched the scenes on the streets fading away in the window. For some reason, he began to feel melancholic.</br>
</br>
Who would have thought, in another dimension, the same place one hundred years later, would become a place filled with zombies?</br>
</br>
But all these things were too distant.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was amazed by the beauty of Ayesha as she drove. He couldn’t resist and snapped a photo of her.</br>
</br>
Sensing Jiang Chen’s action, Ayesha’s gorgeous eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
"Does it look good?"</br>
</br>
</br>
She asked, her eyes still maintained focus on the road. But Jiang Chen felt like all her attention was on his phone.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
After receiving a positive response, the tips of Ayesha’s mouth curved up joyfully.</br>
</br>
"But it would be better if it was bigger." Jiang Chen stared at the photo for a while before he suddenly let out a sigh and muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Although he toned down his voice, this sentence still didn’t escape Ayesha’s ear.</br>
</br>
Instantly, the graceful hand clenched tighter onto the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
"Eh, is, is it my breast? I have been eating papaya and drinking milk, but it still is a process…" Ayesha said while her eyes looked listless.</br>
</br>
"No, not that." Seeing the car that just skidded by them, Jiang Chen’ sweated profusely as he rushed to comfort her, "Its age, age!"</br>
</br>
"Eh?" Surprised by Jiang Chen’s explanation, Ayesha asked, confused, but her emotional soothed down while the car returned to the normal track.</br>
</br>
"Umm, how should I explain this? We have a holiday, or tradition, in Hua… All in all, I have to take a girlfriend back by February 8th of next year to see my parents." Embarrassed, Jiang Chen explained.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that the renowned Future Technology president did not have a girlfriend to bring home for the New Year.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had kept in contact with the family. Since he was rich, he wished for his parents to live a better life.</br>
</br>
To prevent the two elders from not sleeping well, after deliberate consideration, Jiang Chen decided not to reveal that he became the president of a billion dollar company. He only said that he made a decent amount of money doing business and planned to explain the whole situation to them when he returned for New Year.</br>
</br>
At the end of every month, he would send half a million to the card that his dad previously used to send his allowance. In the beginning, his dad did not accept it. He stubbornly sent it back until Jiang Chen finally announced that he already bought a house in Wanghai City, and that he was rich enough to not worry about money anymore. The stubborn father finally reluctantly accepted the money.</br>
</br>
Every parent wishes their children would live a good life. In their eyes, half a million was an astronomical number already. Their entire life saving was only this amount. They were already satisfied that Jiang Chen could support himself in a completely foreign city. They wouldn’t spend that much money anyways after they retire, plus they could take their retirement fund to live the rest of their lives without worry. That half a million was saved so their son could get a house. The thought of receiving money from their son never even crossed their mind.</br>
</br>
The one thing they did think of, was when they would have grandchildren.</br>
</br>
Now that the house is there, what about the wife?</br>
</br>
Under his parents' persistence, Jiang Chen awkwardly indicated he didn’t have anyone yet. Since the generation gap was there, he did not dare to tell his parents that, "your son does not have a wife, but has a mistress."</br>
</br>
It would be better if Ayesha was a bit older. If that was the case, then taking her home for New Year would not only satisfy his parents' thought of having grandchildren, it would also satisfy their vanity. In a small town of Huchen, marring a foreigner was a glorious act.</br>
</br>
Nurtured by the nutrient solution, Ayesha’s skin was as smooth as a porcelain doll. To Jiang Chen, it was a great thing, but the "disadvantage" was that she looked too young.</br>
</br>
Especially with Ayesha’s Lolita appearance…</br>
</br>
No matter which perspective he took, bringing a loli home was a terrible idea.</br>
</br>
"New Year right?" Hearing that her husband did not mind her size, Ayesha was relieved. She gently smiled, "If you don’t mind, I can be your girlfriend and go home with you."</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen’s surprise, Ayesha knew Han New Year already. But when he gave a thought, it made sense as she already comprehended the language Han, and thus, there was no reason not to know the traditions. Just like when he learned English, he learned of Christmas.</br>
</br>
"Why would I mind? But the problem is not that." Jiang Chen was exasperated, "Within Hua, the legal age for marriage is 20. Although it could be worked around with money, my parents are the stubborn type, therefore… Therefore it is complicated."</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her tiny head, she was born in Syria so naturally, she didn’t understand the laws here. In her hometown, it was not uncommon for girls 12 or 13 years of age to be married. In her head, she thought she was marrying late.</br>
</br>
The topic didn’t continue.</br>
</br>
The car quickly arrived that the Shimao building. When they finished parking, Jiang Chen held onto Ayesha’s hand and walked into the Christine cake store.</br>
</br>
In his memory, this should be most famous cake store in the area.</br>
</br>
As to the price, he didn’t really care.</br>
</br>
But just as he pushed open the glass door, Jiang Chen was shocked by what he saw.</br>
</br>
...</br>

</br>
"Welcome-" Fang Yuanyuan raised her head, but in the middle of the sentence, she froze.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stiffened as he stood before the door. A peculiar expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
He didn’t expect to meet this woman coincidentally again.</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head as she stared at Jiang Chen and then the receptionist.</br>
</br>
She seemed to have understood the situation. She gently pulled Jiang Chen’s hand as she whispered, "Should we go to another store?"</br>
</br>
"There is no need." Jiang Chen smiled as he squeezed her hand.</br>
</br>
Although he disliked this person, his dislike was not to the point where he would avoid her on purpose.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen walked towards her direction, Fang Yunyuan lowered her head.</br>
</br>
"Hello, what would you like?"</br>
</br>
Her voice was unnatural. Jiang Chen noticed that her fingers were slightly trembling.</br>
</br>
[She must be afraid.]</br>
</br>
"Cake, with chocolate, and mango… Umm, just give me the menu." He let out a sigh as he didn’t want to bully her. Instead, he responded with certainty.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took over the menu from her hand and they began to pick.</br>
</br>
Seeing the girl beside Jiang Chen, Fang Yuanyuan felt teary for some reason.</br>
</br>
The door was suddenly pushed open and a man in plain clothes walked in with a delicate lunchbox.</br>
</br>
"Yuanyuan, are you hungry?" The man’s forehead had a scar, but his smile was bright as he flashed his white teeth.</br>
</br>
Fang Yuanyuan’s cheeks turned red as she nodded and quietly took over the lunchbox from his hand.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, thanks, but I am still working…"</br>
</br>
"I’ll leave you to it then, I have to go back to work too, see you later."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, with the corner of his eye, examined them, intrigued. The man’s face had a joyful smile as he energetically stepped out of the room.</br>
</br>
"This cake should be good."</br>
</br>
Ayesha pointed at a chocolate cake that was decorated with fruits.</br>
</br>
"This one it is." Jiang Chen refocused on the menu. He gladly accepted her recommendation.</br>
</br>
These high-class cake stores usually offer delivery services. Jiang Chen took the receipt from Fang Yuanyuan’s hand and asked out of curiosity, "your boyfriend?"</br>
</br>
Fang Yuanyuan's looked away with complications in her eyes, she nodded.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Does he know your past?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"No." Fang Yuanyuan bit her lips as she said quietly.</br>
</br>
"Do you regret it?"</br>
</br>
Fang Yuanyuan didn’t respond. Instead, she looked at him, pleading with her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Please don’t tell him? I know you hate me, but Little Cong is a good guy, I don’t want him-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand to interrupt her as he smiled.</br>
</br>
"First, there is no need to talk about hate. Second, I have no interest in creating problems for other people. I am only curious… Whatever, I already know the answer."</br>
</br>
</br>
Seeing the chef hat on Fang Yuanyuan’s head, as well as the simple makeup, the answer was already clear to him.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left with the girl's hand in his, the look on Fang Yuanyuan's face turned perplexed.</br>
</br>
She had a fantasy of marrying rich and live the life of a female protagonist like the ones in TV drama. She almost achieved this dream when she was a real estate salesperson. A boss proposed to her, but she chose to wait, thinking that her beauty could do better than him and gain more of a material enjoyment…</br>
</br>
Without her realizing it, she slowly turned from a bi*th to a sl*t.</br>
</br>
In the end, what is the difference between what she did and prostitution?</br>
</br>
When did she realize this?</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was that one night, when she was thrown out of Hongyi Private Club like a tool. The mockery sight of ten thousand bills thrown at her woke her up as if cold water was poured onto her head. She felt like she was being shooed away like a homeless person.</br>
</br>
It was late into the night and she didn’t have her phone. She waited for a while at the side of the road but didn't manage to get a taxi. In the end, she could only drag her wry body and disheveled clothes as she numbly walked back to her rented apartment.</br>
</br>
On her way home, she encountered two drunk perverts who mistook her for a prostitute. They tried to violate her and she desperately fought back. However, the more she struggled, the more it excited them.</br>
</br>
Just as she was about to lose hope, he appeared.</br>
</br>
He was not tall nor did he look that strong, but he still bravely stood in front of her.</br>
</br>
She was shocked at the fact that there would be a fool in this world who was willing to stand up for her - for a filthy woman.</br>
</br>
But he couldn’t beat the two perverts.</br>
</br>
He was only able to guard a few moves before the beer bottle exploded on his forehead.</br>
</br>
Blood began to pour, the brave "fool" didn’t even flinch before he collapsed on the ground.</br>
</br>
Perhaps awakened by the bloody scene, the two people immediately turned sober. Because they were afraid of accidentally killing someone, they fled the scene.</br>
</br>
Seeing the man on the ground, as well as the glass shards and blood, Fang Yuanyuan was stunned. "Rationality" told her the most convenient action was to not say a word and run, pretending nothing happened, and leave the "fool" here.</br>
</br>
But to her own surprise, she didn’t trust the "rationality" that supported her throughout her life. Without thinking much, she knelt down, picked up a glass shard, ripped off a piece of her two thousand dollar dress, and bandaged up his head.</br>
</br>
The terrifying blood made her tremble uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
On the street that was void of life, she shouted, yelled, but the cars passed by all accelerated and left.</br>
</br>
No one was willing and no one dared to stop the car to help them.</br>
</br>
It was already midnight, the rural area was not the safest place.</br>
</br>
A man whose face was full of blood was lying on the ground. If they stopped and gave them a ride, the man might die in their own car.</br>
</br>
There might be a lawsuit and then a payout a settlement. If they were terribly unlucky, they might even have to go to prison.</br>
</br>
In this apathetic society, the cost of sympathy was too high.</br>
</br>
Especially if there was still work the next day.</br>
</br>
Luckily, the world still has kind strangers. A pickup truck eventually stopped. The driver of the truck carried the barely-breathing man onto the car and rushed them to the nearest hospital.</br>
</br>
After going into the emergency room for hours, the "fool" lived.</br>
</br>
She didn’t know why. The "her" who has always loved money didn’t hesitate when she used the "reward" from Zhou Zihao to pay the medical bill.</br>
</br>
She also stayed with him until he woke up.</br>
</br>
His name was Wang Cong. His ordinary name with the white t-shirt that he wore made him look even more dowdy.</br>
</br>
He only left university this year, a programmer in an IT company.</br>
</br>
When Fang Yuanyuan asked why he stood up for her, he blushed and looked away.</br>
</br>
"I didn’t think too much, when I saw you walking alone outside being bothered by two obviously rude people. I did what I did with a hot head."</br>
</br>
"Did you even consider the possible that you could have died?"</br>
</br>
Wang Cong looked at her blankly as he forced a smile, "I probably wouldn’t have died. Murder is too big of a crime in today's society."</br>
</br>
One of her nerves malfunctioned as Fang Yunayuan asked unreasonably, "If you knew you were going to die, would you still have helped me?"</br>
</br>
He kept his silence for a while.</br>
</br>
Wang Cong scratched the back of his head as he smiled humbly.</br>
</br>
"Yeah…I can’t watch a good girl being ruined."</br>
</br>
That night, she wore a white colored dress.</br>
</br>
Good girl?</br>
</br>
When Fang Yuanyuan heard the word, she teared up for some reason.</br>
</br>
She cried and she regretted.</br>
</br>
Afterwards, she handed in her resignation at the real estate company and found the work she has now.</br>
</br>
Then, they decided to be together.</br>
</br>
He didn’t have a house, nor did he have a six-figure saving's account.</br>
</br>
That night, Wang Cong proposed to her.</br>
</br>
She accepted it.</br>
</br>
As for money, it was no longer important.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When he left the cake store, Jiang Chen suddenly started laughing.</br>
</br>
Ayesha turned to look at him, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Did something good happened?"</br>
</br>
"No, I wouldn’t say it is good, I just think it is interesting." Jiang Chen put his hand on Ayesha’s head as he gently rubbed it.</br>
</br>
"Interesting?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, an old friend of mine received the finale meant for her."</br>
</br>
"Finale?" Ayesha, deep in thought, put up her finger against her bottom lip, "What would be considered the finale for someone?"</br>
</br>
To Ayesha’s question, Jiang Chen paused, but then a smiled quickly emerged.</br>
</br>
"It’s hard to say, but from a bystander’s perspective, if there is nothing to expect for the rest of the story, then that should be the finale."</br>
</br>
Ayesha half-understandingly nodded.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Apocalypse.</br>
</br>
On the bank of Taifu river.</br>
</br>
The feather-like snow blew in the sky, a thin layer of ice covered the river, the bridge across the river was blown apart, and a layer of whiteness covered the bank across the river. On top of the snow, there were a few indistinguishable black dots.</br>
</br>
"What are those mutated humans doing?"</br>
</br>
Hiding inside the snowed hidden fortress, Zhang Lin held the digital binocular as he focused across the river bank with his eyebrows twisted together.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang, who stood on the side, was silent, but gloom covered his face.</br>
</br>
They previously thought that the mutated humans with wiped outposts and lost supplies would be more obedient. They thought that they would have the luxury of waiting until the next spring to plan. But it looks like they want to fight.</br>
</br>
Based on the information obtained from the drones, there were at least two hundred mutated humans stationed across the river bank.</br>
</br>
Large quantities of construction supplies were transported to the empty land and built into a small supply station. The snow removing vehicle and slaves somehow managed to clear out a road on the tens of kilometers of highway covered in snow.</br>
</br>
The armored trucks listed in formations as the daunting anti-air machine guns and the menacing cannons lined up to create an iron forest.</br>
</br>
"What should we do?" Zhang Lin looked at Zhao Gang on the side.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang took a deep breath and he said calmly.</br>
</br>
"Report to the base, if there are 500 more people here, we probably can’t defend…"</br>
</br>
The river was the slowest here. Once it entered ice season, the river would be frozen firmly. Even the mutated human with steel armors could easily run on the ice.</br>
</br>
Once the mutated humans with number advantage start to charge, Fishbone Base could not defend the river with only five Tigers.</br>
</br>
Once they captured the river bank, repair the blown up bridge, their armored force would cross the Taifu River and into Qingpu area.</br>
</br>
Gazing upon the snowy hill in the distance, Zhao Gang’s eyebrows furrowed together.</br>
</br>
A hard battle was imminent.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 186: The Declaration of War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside Sixth Street’s towering walls.</br>
</br>
It was the most prosperous place on the wasteland, a city that never slept built among the ruins.</br>
</br>
In the heart of this bustling place, stood a magnificent dome building. Its structure was similar to Houses of Parliament, symbolizing the unity flag fluttering above.</br>
</br>
It represented power, the brain of the entire Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Within the council chamber of the building, the Council of Ten members gathered around the round table.</br>
</br>
Sixth Street was on doing fairly well for a while now, however, what was surprising was that the dignitaries sitting here had no smile on their faces.</br>
</br>
As the president of Zhao Corporation, Zhao Chenwu was obviously among them. Sitting across him was his competitor, the boss in the giant firearm company, Feng De. Usually, they would mock each other as part of their routine every time they meet, but this time both of them had gloom all over their face with both keeping their silence.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the seat pointing at the door was an old man with rectangular face and white sideburns, he coughed and broke the silent atmosphere at the table.</br>
</br>
Although the Council of Ten had an equal status, on the wasteland ruled by the powerful, the right to speak was naturally proportional to the strength.</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong, the president of Crimson Chamber of Commerce, had a force that was not limited to the Sixth Street, and his mercenaries base stretched as far as Su City. He controlled 60% of the genetic vaccine of the pharmaceutical market share in Sixth Street, and although he did not take part of the firearm dealings, his private force was the strongest in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Prowler" tanks equipped with a particle cannon and outfitted with heavy physical armor and particle shield. The tank possessed attack, defense, and mobility, making it perhaps the strongest land unit in the wasteland.</br>
</br>
And he had five of these tanks.</br>
</br>
"Everyone’s time is precious. I suppose we didn't gather here to just stare in the air, isn't that right?" Spreading out his hands, Cao Jinsong spoke without preamble.</br>
</br>
"That’s true. Then shall we start the meeting?" Zhao Chenwu crossed his fingers, his elbow resting on the table.</br>
</br>
"I second that."</br>
</br>
"That’s right, I still have an engagement after this, so let’s get this over with."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Quietly waiting for the sound to subside, Cao Jinsong pressed his hand on the conference table and uttered, "Although everyone should have already seen this, I will play it again."</br>
</br>
Dark blue particles began to levitate in the center of the table as a holographic image formed in the middle which converged into a half body portrait.</br>
</br>
"Hello everyone from Wanghai City."</br>
</br>
The man clad in military uniforms seemed arrogant.</br>
</br>
"After seeing this image, our people would already be on their way.</br>
</br>
</br>
"We all agreed that you're sitting on the treasures from your predecessors, but you don’t think of improving yourself. You sit on a huge amount of treasures, but you settle for status quo and enjoy a lavish life. We can’t wait any longer, I think we need to have a good chat.</br>
</br>
"Of course, this doesn’t mean I'm here to negotiate with you.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, this is a declaration of war.</br>
</br>
"Northern Alliance District, General Wang Beihai. Signing off."</br>
</br>
The image disappeared.</br>
</br>
There was a frightening silence around the table.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu took a deep breath, stretched his hand to gently fix his collar, and looked anxiously at his colleagues around him. Anger, alarm, disdain, and timidness.</br>
</br>
Sitting across him was his nemesis, Feng De, who used a tissue to wipe the sweat off his forehead while anxiously adjusting his sitting position.</br>
</br>
But Cao Jinsong's look was rather calm as there was not much of a change in his expression.</br>
</br>
"They're crazy! They are just a bunch of lunatics. These...Northern Alliance District? If I remember correctly, that place is 1,500 kilometers away from here! Do they think they can fly all the way here? Or are they saying they could slaughter their way through half of Hua's zombies?"</br>
</br>
A tall middle-aged man roared with disdain.</br>
</br>
"Furthermore, it's a winter expedition, To procure winter supplies for a 1,500-kilometer trek, don't those people need to eat?"</br>
</br>
"They sure are that confident to win, eh? Do they really think no one is here in Sixth Street?"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong silently looked at the council members around the table as his index finger rhythmically tapped on the table.</br>
</br>
"Winder expedition…why must it be in winter? In our eyes, it is indeed a foolish move, but why do they insist on doing this?" Taking a deep breath, Zhao Chenwu stated.</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong gave him a startled look and nodded his head slightly.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing someone pointed out this question, the previously volatile council members began to calm down. They got confused by the arrogance of that general, however, now that they had given it some thought, something was definitely amiss.</br>
</br>
"According to the information my people had gathered in Luzhou, the Northern Alliance District indeed appeared there. They are currently building an outpost in Luzhou rural area with a large number of people." Cao Jinsong drawled.</br>
</br>
"Luzhou? Could it be…" The council member's expression sitting next to Cao Jinsong suddenly shifted.</br>
</br>
‘That’s right, they used the underground highway." Cao Jinsong nodded.</br>
</br>
"That thing was already broken. How could they use that?" Someone asked derisively.</br>
</br>
Highway, railway, magnetic levitation, and other transportation infrastructures were all targeted during the war. The underground highway was no exception. NATO’s satellite weapons deployed 57 pressure bombs that blasted the underground highway into several sections, which was used by PAC to transport military supplies during the war.</br>
</br>
"Be that as it may, the underground passage between the Northwestern area to Luzhou has been repaired, so this might be the only explanation as to how their people could appear here."</br>
</br>
After hearing Cao Jinsong's words, everyone became silent once again.</br>
</br>
Seeing no one was talking, Cao Jinsong paused and continued: "Since this is a declaration of war, then war has become a foregone conclusion. For their arrogance and foolishness, we will naturally respond with guns, this is without a doubt. But there are still a lot of confusing things here…aren't you a little bit curious? What prompted them to make a reckless decision to declare war during winter from 1,500 kilometers away?"</br>
</br>
"He mentioned about the treasure, but the question is: what treasures is he talking about? We've been living here for so many years, and we haven’t found anything yet. How could there be goddamn treasures here?" A man with a beer belly couldn't help but swear.</br>
</br>
"Winter expedition to avoid mutants, and since they're using the underground passage, they naturally don’t need to concern themselves with the mutants along the way. Then there is only one possibility…their destination could only be reached in the winter," Zhao Chenwu said with a firm tone.</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong nodded with approval and looked at all the council members present.</br>
</br>
"I share the same thought as council member Zhao. If there is any place we have yet to set our foot on, it should be none other than the downtown."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before the war, Wanghai city was a major metropolitan in the world. It possessed the biggest technology park within PAC as well as a countless research facilities.</br>
</br>
Because of this, after the war erupted, Wanghai city immediately became the focal point between PAC and NATO in the east coast battle. It was the obvious destination for nuclear and biological weapon attacks. Damage was especially brutal within the city center where it was blown into a scorched piece of land, where only extreme mutants or already dead zombies could survive.</br>
</br>
On this piece of wasteland, the city center became the synonym for danger. Even the strongest hunting teams had not stepped into this forbidden territory. The countless number of zombies, the nest of zombie eaters, the unimaginably powerful mutants… The risk and reward tradeoff of exploring the zombies dominated area was not justified by any means.</br>
</br>
As to when the city center would be relatively safer, it was during winter.</br>
</br>
In the winter, most of the mutants would go into hibernation, thus, the only trouble that remained was the zombie.</br>
</br>
But despite this…</br>
</br>
"City center? Other than nuclear craters and scrap metals, what else is there?" A council member with a square frame glasses scorned at the thought.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps there is a lethal weapon left by the preceding government? Or perhaps a USB containing mysterious codes? Regardless what there is, our neighbor is clearly interested. We have enough evidence to believe that they have strong reasons for putting their nose up our business from thousands of miles away," Cao Jinsong smiled.</br>
</br>
"If they just want to go into the city center, why don’t they negotiate with us?" Zhao Chenwu frowned as he said in an undertone, "We don’t have to fight, we could work together. For example, providing supplies for their army for a commission amount…"</br>
</br>
"What do you think the Northern Alliance District is? A hunting team stationed at our place? Provide supplies? They could just raid us. They are not merchants, they are bandits under a military government." A council member mocked.</br>
</br>
"Disregarding whether if they could beat us or not. Even if they win, would they have enough force left to enter the city center? I agree with Councilmember Zhao’s perspective, their action is unusual. Perhaps there is some hidden truth we don’t know about." A sophisticated-looking council member added.</br>
</br>
"It's because of arrogance." Feng De sneered.</br>
</br>
"But arrogance has nothing to do with intelligence. They choose to start a war knowing cooperation would be the best choice, unless-"</br>
</br>
"Unless that treasure is tempting enough," Cao Jinsong opened his mouth, the fingers that were crossed together in front of his face covered his nose. "They believe the value of the treasure, and believe that if we know about the treasure, we would fight for it with all our forces. Even the reputation we built for over 10 years cannot guarantee our honesty."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then what is that treasure?" someone asked.</br>
</br>
"I personally lean towards the possibility of it being a weapon," a mysterious smile flashed across Cao Jinsong’s face. He then lowered his voice, "If there is a super weapon that could instantly suppress a base or even a city-"</br>
</br>
"That’s impossible, if a weapon like that really existed, then it must have been a top priority during the war." Someone rebutted.</br>
</br>
"I agree. Also, how do they know that the city center of Wanghai City really possessed such thing?"</br>
</br>
As to other council members’ rebuttal, Cao Jinsong didn’t mind as he smiled with collectedness.</br>
</br>
He took a momentary pause before he continued.</br>
</br>
"We are all unfortunate people who didn’t manage to get into the fallout shelter. I know that you all are no strangers to that war. I am talking about the sky-based weapon that destroyed the Holy Shield - the God’s Cane."</br>
</br>
When they heard the name God’s Cane, everyone held their breath.</br>
</br>
That was a long time ago, but even today, after ten something years, they could not forget what happened that day.</br>
</br>
The dome that covered the sky evaporated under the blue particles, followed by airdrop soldiers that fell like rain.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu looked at Cao Jinsong in disbelief as he spoke disheartenedly, "Didn’t that thing get blasted into pieces? I remember the PAC special force captured it and NATO initiated self-destruction-"</br>
</br>
"Based on my super computer’s data-modeling analysis..." Cao Jinsong took a graphite chip from his pocket and waved it in between his fingers before he put it on the table.</br>
</br>
The hologram image displayed again, the web-like structure simulated the earth, as well as the sky-based weapon hovering on top – God’s Cane.</br>
</br>
"259 kilograms of TNT’s self-destruction, the weapon parts would fall in the middle of Wanghai city." The web-weaved God’s Cane turned red as it drew a trajectory and pointed at the location on earth in Wanghai city.</br>
</br>
"If they acquired the parts of God’s Cane, repaired it, and fired it into space again, it will become the sword of Damocles (1) that hangs above all of us. It will become our eternal nightmare."</br>
</br>
Followed by his last words, the hologram image disappeared, and the atmosphere around the conference table turned cold.</br>
</br>
Everyone’s expression took a turn.</br>
</br>
Other than fear and anger, it also carried a hint of greed.</br>
</br>
"What do they want to do…"Zhao Chenwu squeezed those words out.</br>
</br>
"Conquer, or enslave." Cao Jinsong’s finger gently tapped on the table, "They want to continue their dictatorship outside of the Northwestern area. Other than this, I can’t think of any other reasons."</br>
</br>
"Resistance is necessary. The freedom’s spirit will not bend for dictators, that is without a doubt. There are only two choices in front of us."</br>
</br>
"First, before they come to Wanghai City, explore the city center by ourselves. If there really is a super weapon, we can use it against them."</br>
</br>
"Second, protect our treasure and fight our invaders until the last drop of blood."</br>
</br>
"Then, by tradition, let’s vote."</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong smiled mischievously as he pressed the vote button.</br>
</br>
....</br>
</br>
The final vote resulted in an absolute landslide victory of 2:8 to the second option – fight against the invaders.</br>
</br>
Even during winter, it was risky to explore the city center. They might end up paying a price for this if they do not find the weapon, or if the treasure was not a weapon to begin with. Even if was is a weapon, it could not be used in a short period of time because of the need for repair. This would indubitably increase the variables in the war.</br>
</br>
Most of the people chose the safer option. To first eliminate the external threat before exploring the treasure within the ruins.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, the council members began to depart.</br>
</br>
When Zhao Chenwu walked out of the chamber, Zhao Chenwu’s eyebrows furrowed. Su Lei, who was waiting at the door, saw her boss leave. She immediately greeted him.</br>
</br>
"Is there any problem?" As the right and left hands of the boss, Su Lei asked.</br>
</br>
"No problem, I just think something is not right." Zhao Chenwu said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"About our business?"</br>
</br>
"No… Hopefully it is just my illusion."</br>
</br>
Seeing his colleagues leave in brisk steps, for some reason, uneasiness began to sprout in his mind.</br>
</br>
(1) The famed "sword of Damocles" dates back to an ancient moral parable popularized by the Roman philosopher Cicero in his 45 B.C. book "Tusculan Disputations." Cicero’s version of the tale centers on Dionysius II, a tyrannical king who once ruled over the Sicilian city of Syracuse during the fourth and fifth centuries B.C. Though rich and powerful, Dionysius was supremely unhappy. His iron-fisted rule had made him many enemies, and he was tormented by fears of assassination—so much so that he slept in a bedchamber surrounded by a moat and only trusted his daughters to shave his beard with a razor.

</div></br>
</br>
"Happy birthday to you~…"</br>
</br>
The melody of the birthday song harmonized perfectly with the clapping hands as the song echoed throughout the old mansion.</br>
</br>
It was already night and there was no light on.</br>
</br>
The room was dark. Only 16 candles illuminated and lit up the blushed face.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
Colorful confetti exploded alongisde three genuine wishes.</br>
</br>
"Happy birthday!"</br>
</br>
"Tha…Thank you." Yao Yao’s eyes were decorated with mists of excitement. Her tiny hands clenched onto the tip of her dress, and she bowed deeply to express her appreciation.</br>
</br>
It has been many years since she was this happy.</br>
</br>
But before she could finish, an unharmonious voice interrupted the touching atmosphere.</br>
</br>
"Oh my! Cake, mango, gulp." Lin Lin chuckled moonly at the cake as her fists clenched on the fork.</br>
</br>
"You are drooling! Fool." Sun Jiao grabbed her by the collar as she lifted back Lin Lin, who was approaching the cake. At the same time, she gave her a scorned look.</br>
</br>
"Wooo!" Lin Lin retracted her neck as she pouted her mouth feeling wronged, "Didn’t we agree on eating the cake after singing the birthday song?"</br>
</br>
"We still have to blow out the candle, wait a bit longer." Jiang Chen’s mood was particularly delightfully today as he gave a rare tender smile to Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"If it is only a bit longer." Lin Lin looked away with her face blushed.</br>
</br>
Under the dim light, no one noticed the red hue on her face.</br>
</br>
"Go ahead, Yao Yao, you are the star today." Sun Jiao extended her hand with a smile as she put it around Yao Yao’s shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Remember to make a wish." Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" The pretty face was red because of excitement. Yao Yao’s tiny head nodded fiercely.</br>
</br>
She approached the candles with excitement as she took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Woosh-"</br>
</br>
16 candle flames flared by her breath. Each candle was filled with a young girl’s wish.</br>
</br>
From now on, Yao Yao has offically entered her sweet sixteeth.</br>
</br>
The light turned back on.</br>
</br>
With a pure white princess dress, soft hair that dangled to her chest, ad white stocking paired with black chauffers, she looked like a girl who just walked out of a fairy tale.</br>
</br>
"Cut the cake. I want the cake!" Lin Lin couldn’t wait any longer, her silver hair swayed, but her one red and one black pupil stared at the pieces of mangos on the cake as she continued to gulp.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao lifted the plastic knife as she started to portion the cake.</br>
</br>
"Is it okay to cut the letters? Or should I avoid the letters."</br>
</br>
Born in a fallout shelter, it was her first time seeing a cake. She only remembered that she ate something called chocolate before. Just a small piece was sweet enough to melt her. But now, the chocolate was made into a cake the size of a plate.</br>
</br>
The white vanilla cream and the colorful fruits were just like a piece of art. She didn’t want to cut it.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ahhh! Don’t hesitate anymore, my mango!" Lin Lin reached her hand out desperately as she tried to fight for the plastic knife in Sun Jiao’s hand.</br>
</br>
"Rowdy." Sun Jiao obviously would not let Lin Lin succeed so she easily took care of her.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, on the other hand, was quieter. Her face blushed as she closely leaned on Jiang Chen. Her cheery-like mouth panted as her chest raised up and down. She looked nervous.</br>
</br>
As to why she was nervous... that was because of tonight…</br>
</br>
"Are you happy today?" Jiang Chen gently squeezed Yao Yao’s hand as he smiled.</br>
</br>
Seeing the warm smile on his face, Yao Yao shyly stared at the chocolate vanilla cake in front of her and she grinned softly.</br>
</br>
"I am happy."</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, I thought it was your 17th birthday today… Do we really need 37 candles?" Jiang Chen suddenly added a smirk to his face.</br>
</br>
The cute mouth immediately pouted.</br>
</br>
"Woo… Don’t be mean to me today." Yao Yao said softly as she gently dragged the tip of his shirt.</br>
</br>
"Haha, sorry, I can’t resist because you are too cute." He caressed Yao Yao’s longhair. Seeing the slightly narrowed and loving eyes and the lightly shaking eyelashes, a joyful smile appeared on Jiang Chen’s face.</br>
</br>
The feeling of home was probably similar to this.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, what did you wish for?"</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Yao Yao’s face turned red as her eyes quickly glanced at him before moving away.</br>
</br>
"It would not be a wish if I say it out loud, it’s a secret…" She said quietly.</br>
</br>
She certainly minded.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was about to tease the small loli more, a light door-knock transmitted from the living room.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen to ask for his opinion, Jiang Chen shrugged before he walked to the living room and opened the door.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin stood outside. Her nose turned vibrant red because of the chillness. Her freckled face had some ice shards on it.</br>
</br>
The night on the wasteland was frigid, particularly in the winter.</br>
</br>
Seeing how her frozen face was written with worry, Jiang Chen turned serious.</br>
</br>
"Come in first."</br>
</br>
Wnag Qin nodded sincerely, she ducked under the door and shook the snow off her body.</br>
</br>
"Do you need a cup of hot water?" Seeing how cold she was, Jiang Chen asked caringly.</br>
</br>
But she waved her head signaling a "no" and she took a deep breath of the warm air before she looked at Jiang Chen."The mutated humans, they are coming from the Seventh Area and they are setting up camps across from Taifu River. It is rumored that…Awechu!"</br>
</br>
As she spoke, she suddenly sneezed.</br>
</br>
Seeing her disjointed look, Jiang Chen sighed as he headed into the kitchen and poured a cup of hot water for her.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Wang Qin sat on the sofa and held onto the steamy cup. Signs of bloodflow finally began to show on her face.</br>
</br>
"Sit down and say it slowly. There is no need to rush. Don’t forget any details." Jiang Chen sat across from Wang Qin and said in a stern tone.</br>
</br>
She nodded before she took a deep breath and collected her thoughts.</br>
</br>
"This afternoon, Zhao Gang sent information from Shenxiang town…"</br>
</br>
Wang Qin described in detail the movements of mutated humans to Jiang Chen, including the force distribution, the number of equipment detected by the drones, as well as the request for backup from Zhao Gang.</br>
</br>
Hearing her description, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment.</br>
</br>
"What’s the production status of Tiger?"</br>
</br>
"We only produced two new units as of now and the workers are already working around the clock." Wang Qin said, troubled.</br>
</br>
"What about the drones?"</br>
</br>
"47 units."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see." His finger on his chin, Jiang Chen fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
Mutated humans were planning to fight until death. They chose to invade during winter even with their outpost taken out.The motive certainly surprised him.</br>
</br>
Although the Carmen Pharmaceutical Corporation was near the city center, it was not within the vicinity of the city center. From any point of view, it would be a wiser choice to head to the Carmen building when spring came around rather than fighting through the river during the winter.</br>
</br>
Was there any reason they must fight in the winter?</br>
</br>
Unless their target was not only the Carmen building but the city center as well?</br>
</br>
"Tell Zhao Gang that the backup will arrive immediately."</br>
</br>
Wang Qin nodded, but a troubled look flashed across her face.</br>
</br>
"New recruit training is still underway. There are only 70 soldiers available to fight in the base. If we send too many people..."</br>
</br>
She didn’t complete the sentence, but the meaning was obvious.</br>
</br>
If the defense of the base is weak, they might not be able to control the slaves.</br>
</br>
"I’ll take care of the problem, just reply this way." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because his smile was confident, Wang Qin’s concern immediately vanquished.</br>
</br>
She nodded with a smile before she left.</br>
</br>
Seeing Wang Qin leave, Jiang Chen pondered for a long moment and closed the door.</br>
</br>
He readjusted his mood before he went back to the dining room.</br>
</br>
"Did something happen?" Sun Jiao seemed to have sensed something.</br>
</br>
"Nothing." Jiang Chen smiled, signaling her not to worry.</br>
</br>
But this time, he saw Lin Lin twitching on the chair with vanilla smeared all over her face. His expression changed.</br>
</br>
The naughty Sun Jiao seemed to have noticed Jiang Chen’s stare as her face turned red. She looked at the ceiling, raised her proud chest, and pretended that nothing happened.</br>
</br>
"Don’t bully Lin Lin that much."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao stuck out her tongue and suddenly grabbed him by the arm. She giggled and inched closer to his ear.</br>
</br>
"I am full, let’s go play games?"</br>
</br>
[I haven’t even eaten yet.] Jiang Chen facepalmed in his mind.</br>
</br>
But the tenderness he felt from his arm made his mind drift elsewhere.</br>
</br>
"No, not acceptable!" Yao Yao with her ears on high alert immediately jumped on like a squirrel whose tail just got stepped on. She ran over and dragged onto the other hand of Jiang Chen, and looked at Sun Jiao in remorse, "We already agreed that the star today is me…"</br>
</br>
"We already agreed?" Jiang Chen paused as he looked confusedly between Sun Jiao and Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, uhh, I changed my mind, I’ll give him to you tomorrow." Sun Jiao didn’t answer Jiang Chen’s question. Instead, she looked away awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"Woo-!" Yao Yao bloated her cheeks as the adorable eyebrows immediately raised up, but they soon softened down.</br>
</br>
"You already ate all the good food, you can’t even let the small animal drink some soup?"</br>
</br>
The saddened voice made Sun Jiao’s face look somewhat embarrassed. She didn’t say anything.</br>
</br>
Seeing Sister Sun Jiao had no reaction, Yao Yao didn’t give up. She lightly gritted her teeth to give herself the courage as she continued to use the soft voice to persuade her, "If you eat meat every day, you will become sick of it."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao’s expression was evidently moved. Jiang Chen still looked at the two of them in bewilderment, not understanding why the conversation topic suddenly turned to food.</br>
</br>
Seeing the words were effective, Yao Yao secretively posed a success gesture with her hands as she built on her success. "The occasional vegetable would be good for your health. Also, if the small animal doesn’t taste good, wouldn’t it demonstrate the attractiveness of the big dairy cow…"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao with a blushed face said, ‘What…what’s big dairy cow."</br>
</br>
"Uh, what are you guys talking about?" Jiang Chen scratched his face in confusion.</br>
</br>
Her conflicted eyes moved between Yao Yao and Jiang Chen as her stance wavered.</br>
</br>
Although she already decided…[Wooo! This is annoying!]</br>
</br>
[But-]</br>
</br>
[If you eat meat every day, you will become sick of it.]</br>
</br>
"Ahhh! I don’t care anymore, do whatever you want." Sun Jiao said in defeat as she escaped without looking back.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the fleeting Sun Jiao blankly before he looked at Yao Yao, who had a red hue on her face. A troubled smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Uh, what just happened?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing." Yao Yao’s head shook furiously as she put her hands behind her back timidly.</br>
</br>
She smiled tenderly, as she posted a success gesture with her hand behind her back.</br>
</br>
The victory belonged to the small animal!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After the shower, Jiang Chen raised his hand to knock on Sun Jiao’s door, but there was no reaction in the room.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter with this girl today?"</br>
</br>
With a head full of question marks, Jiang Chen returned to his own room.</br>
</br>
Although he could go back and sleep in the modern world, he felt that it would weaken his spirit. What's more, there's not much of a difference whether he slept here or on the other side. The only difference was the person he's sleeping with...</br>
</br>
He turned off the light and laid in bed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes and began to think about the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
There was a scarcity of soldiers in the base, and the mutated humans didn’t play by the book. As for how to resolve the problem, he already had a plan formulating in his mind, it was just the specifics that required more thinking.</br>
</br>
While his mind drifted off, he began to succumb to drowsiness.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to doze off, there was a gentle knock on the door.</br>
</br>
The corner of his mouth had a touch of smile as he pretended to not hear anything and closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.</br>
</br>
[This girl is actually sneaking in at night. We'll see how I'll teach you a lesson…]</br>
</br>
The door was slightly pushed open, and a faint light pervaded in the room before it quickly faded away.</br>
</br>
The steps were light as it carried a faint scent of Jasmine, disturbing Jiang Chen’s heart.</br>
</br>
The quilt was pulled out of the corner and someone slipped under the sheets.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was smirking and pretending to be oblivious while turning his body before putting his arm around the dainty figure.</br>
</br>
Wait! Dainty?</br>
</br>
"Woo," The feeble murmuring had increased. This didn't seem to be Sun Jiao…</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao?" Jiang Chen asked awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm…" Yao Yao quietly replied.</br>
</br>
Her wet hair exuded a sweet scent of Jasmine, her gossamer of nightgown covered her delicate figure, and the moonlight from the window suffused her flushed face. Her huge, adorable eyes were trembling with apprehension, but there was no sign of retreating.</br>
</br>
A silent atmosphere lingered between the two.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shifted slightly, wanting to subtly move his hand away, only to realize that Yao Yao was clutching on his cuff.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao murmured: "I like you."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," He opened his mouth to speak, and despite wanting to say a lot of things, he only managed to utter a single word.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen didn’t react, Yao Yao gently lowered her eyelids, but soon quickly plucked up her courage and lifted her head.</br>
</br>
"Could you accompany me for a while to share some secrets?"</br>
</br>
"Secrets?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, precisely because we're under the sheets that we can tell each other secrets," Yao Yao whispered and nodded her head earnestly.</br>
</br>
"You can talk to me about anything," Jiang Chen smiled at her. Instead of removing his hand from her shoulder, he gently smoothened her hair.</br>
</br>
</br>
Yao Yao guilelessly enjoyed the caress by his big hand as she comfortably closed her adorable, huge eyes and snuggled closer to him.</br>
</br>
Due to the close proximity to her delicate body, Jiang Chen’s face was suffused with heat.</br>
</br>
"That, let's start…first, what kind of girl does Big Brother like?"</br>
</br>
Staring into the crystal clear eyes, Jiang Chen held his breath, forgetting to answer the question.</br>
</br>
Sensing the mood, a crimson hue crept on Yao Yao's face.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao closed her eyes gently.</br>
</br>
Her eyelashes gently fluttered, drawing her slightly open small mouth nearer to her beloved Big Brother's lips.</br>
</br>
Staring at the approaching face, Jiang Chen’s Adam's apple bobbed in his throat.</br>
</br>
Reasons told him that if he didn’t stop her in this situation, something bad might happen.</br>
</br>
[Stop? Why stop?]</br>
</br>
Temporarily forgetting to think, Jiang Chen leaned closer to Yao Yao’s lovely face.</br>
</br>
A long time ago, he made a decision to follow his thoughts from the bottom of his heart and to stay true to his emotions.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a wisp of cold breeze blew past at the back of his neck.</br>
</br>
Cold air?</br>
</br>
"Who is it!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was instantly alerted and immediately got up to look at the window.</br>
</br>
The window was already open, a shadow was hanging upside down in the window.</br>
</br>
The long hair swayed in the air, the crystal sandwiched between her two finger reflected an ominous glint under the moonlight.</br>
</br>
The corners of her mouth were eerily curved.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Yawn," while walking aimlessly around the base, Sun Jiao yawned, behind her back was an SK10 laser rifle.</br>
</br>
The snow was not as heavy as before, and the combat suit fended off the cold air, so it wasn’t too chilly.</br>
</br>
White mist started to come out of her thick hat as she deliberately looked in the direction of the mansion.</br>
</br>
It was already the 37th time that she had done it.</br>
</br>
Thinking of that big, bad guy, he was definitely embracing the adorable Yao Yao at this time was and putting that thing that mustn't be described in…</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao’s face immediately turned red as she stomped her feet in anger.</br>
</br>
"Stupid loli lover," Sun Jiao cursed out as she shook her head and continued to wander to other places.</br>
</br>
At that time, she suddenly saw two people.</br>
</br>
A man and woman were holding hands while walking on the path leading to front of community center.</br>
</br>
Despite the distance, Sun Jiao still recognized the identity of the woman. Thus, a complicated expression appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
Zhou Xiaoxia, her former friend.</br>
</br>
[But she probably couldn’t recognize her anymore…] Thinking of this, Sun Jiao let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
She had been living in bliss for quite some time to the point of almost forgetting the cruelty of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"I hope you can be happy, my friend."</br>
</br>
She looked at the two persons from afar, but she didn’t get closer. Instead, she turned around and walked to a different direction.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"I am so mad at that she-devil," Lin Lin used a towel to dry her silky silver hair while muttering furiously before leaving the bathroom.</br>
</br>
Water droplets dripped on the floor as she dragged her feet slowly inside the cotton slippers.</br>
</br>
The cream smeared on her face and hair had been finally rinsed off. She made a relaxing stretch, preparing for a well-deserved sleep tonight.</br>
</br>
[Then bear her, I will help you.]</br>
</br>
Tingting seemed to have completely mastered the human language.</br>
</br>
"Um, it’s okay. Um, in my opinion…you shouldn’t be this violent, since this is my body after all," Lin Lin muttered softly.</br>
</br>
[Are you not annoyed by her?]</br>
</br>
Hearing this question, Lin Lin pouted and burried her head under the towel.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, not really."</br>
</br>
[Is this the Stockholm Syndrome we are talking about?] Tingting queried curiously.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible!" Lin Lin exclaimed, infuriated. She punched herself on her left chest, but there was obviously no reaction from Tingting. Rather, it was Lin Lin who got hurt herself.</br>
</br>
[Then what is it?]</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's pale face was beet red as she rubbed her chest, looking away.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps, it is because we are...friends."</br>
</br>
It was her first time having this feeling.</br>
</br>
She had never experienced the feeling of having friends while she was locked inside the digital cage. Although Sun Jiao would occasionally bully her, she had never disliked her. And that included Jiang Chen...no, that person was different.</br>
</br>
The more Lin Lin thought about it, the redder her pretty face became.</br>
</br>
The man that rescued her from the virtual world was surprisingly gentle...</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
There was a sudden loud noise coming from upstairs which interrupted Lin Lin's bewildered musings.</br>
</br>
"What are they doing?" Lin Lin blankly stared at the shaking ceiling as red light began to form in her right eye and migrated to her left eye.</br>
</br>
"Wait, what are you doing!" Lin Lin gradually lost control of her body as she screamed at the "guest" residing in her body.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 190: The Otherworldly Crimson Pupils</br>
</div></br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Crystal? Explosion?</br>
</br>
The bed there had been broken into two pieces.</br>
</br>
With no time to think, Jiang Chen instinctinvely shielded Yao Yao from being hit.</br>
</br>
One of his hand surrounded tightly around Yao Yao's quivering shoulder while he leaned against the half-destroyed bedboard, his other hand took out the PK2000 from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Tatatata!</br>
</br>
With gritted teeth, Jiang Chen held onto the rifle with his finger on the trigger. Yao Yao covered her ears with her hands as her body shook in his arms.</br>
</br>
The bullets shattered the window into pieces, but they only managed to break a few strands of the person's hair. The figure agilely dodged all the bullets and dashed into the room.</br>
</br>
Bullets chased the quick shadow and left bowl-sized holes in the wall.</br>
</br>
The figure didn't seem to be anxious because of the constant firing. Instead, it dashed to the other corner of the room and dragged down the closet along with the wall.</br>
</br>
Ka.</br>
</br>
The bullets ran out, Jiang Chen flung the rifle to the ground as he pulled out his pistol.</br>
</br>
One hand appeared from the shadow and something was thrown out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
With the help of the moonlight, he saw a crystal emitting a dark green sheen.</br>
</br>
There was no time to dodge. He glanced at Yao Yao with the corner of his eyes. Jiang Chen bit the bullet and decided not to start interdimensional travelling. Rather, he reached for the crystal with his hand.</br>
</br>
The green sheen lit up the entire room as the scorching temperature almost melted off his skin.</br>
</br>
Energy withdraw!</br>
</br>
The unstable energy quickly stabilized as the dark green crystal's energy instantly entered the void and turned into a transparent colorless glass.</br>
</br>
"Eh?" The opponent was surprised. Just as Jiang Chen didn't understand how she could use the crystal as a grenade, she was also confused as to how Jiang Chen could make the crystal energy disappear.</br>
</br>
But being surprised was one thing, the movement of the figure did not stop the slightest as her hand raised up again.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face turned green instantly.</br>
</br>
It was not one crystal this time, the dark green crystals appeared in the air like raindrops.</br>
</br>
Even if he had 10 hands, he could not be able to grab all the crystals!</br>
</br>
The crystals scattered everywhere in the room, in such an enclosed space, there was nowhere to dodge.</br>
</br>
If he wanted to avoid them, he must use interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
But Yao Yao...</br>
</br>
Instantly, thousands of ideas flashed through Jiang Chen's mind, but none of them contained the thought of abandoning her.</br>
</br>
Finally, he gritted his teeth, pushed Yao Yao on the ground as he prepared to take the explosion.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's eyes widened as she looked at her big brother's action in disbelief with her lips quivering. She used her tender hands to forcefully push him, she knew that if big brother was here by himself, he definitely could avoid the explosion.</br>
</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's didn't let go, nor did he activate interdimensional travel, he only gritted his teeth.</br>
</br>
"Although it is quite touching, please go die." A female voice full of mockery came from behind the closet. The crystals with sheen began to fall and the dark green energy violently swarmed the room. It could explode any moment.</br>
</br>
Beam-!</br>
</br>
All the sudden, a blood red beam penetrated through the door and scattered the darkness of the room. It passed the broken window and into the distance.</br>
</br>
Under the interference of the blood red particle beam, all the crystals began to gather around the beam like metal dust encountering a magnet, then all the energy was instantly removed as the crystals shattered into clouds of dust.</br>
</br>
It was Lin Lin standing at the door!?</br>
</br>
But the blood red pupils emitted an unsettling strangeness.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible!"</br>
</br>
Shouting appeared from behind the fallen closet.</br>
</br>
"Nothing is impossible."</br>
</br>
Although surprised by the ability displayed by Lin Lin, right now was obviously not the best time to ask the question.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let Yao Yao go and he quickly leaped toward the side to pick up the rifle.</br>
</br>
The person hiding behind the cupboard didn't pause, seeing that the assassination had already failed, she immediately pulled the smoke grenade.</br>
</br>
"You must be in your dreams if you think you can escape!"</br>
</br>
The nitrogen shield was instantly activated as the turbid air flow scattered the thick smoke.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen carried the rifle to the fallen closet, but he realized that the person was already gone.</br>
</br>
The window?</br>
</br>
"Eh? What happened?" The crimison light vanished from Lin Lin's eyes as she looked bewilderedly at the room in shambles.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin, look after Yao Yao." Jiang Chen suppressed the anger in his chest as he took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Eh? But I-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly took out the kinetic skeleton and put it on, and then with one hand pressed to the window, he jumped straight down.</br>
</br>
Both of his feet stomped on the ground with full force as the shock absorber on his legs erased most of the impact.</br>
</br>
Although the assassin avoided the patrol of the drones, when she left she still triggered the alarm. The alarm began to ring inside the base as the drone fleet quickly chased after the infiltrated target.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his EP as the escaping target had already been locked by the drones, Jiang Chen quickly moved toward the target.</br>
</br>
Even with snow up to his knees, with the assistance of kinetic skeleton, he still didn't feel much resistance as he inched closer and closer to the red dot.</br>
</br>
There was a wire tied on the top of the wall, she must have used this rapport to sneak into the base.</br>
</br>
With his knees bent, Jiang Chen pushed his feet against the ground as he leaped up and grabbed the edge of the wall with one hand. Jiang Chen somehow managed to jump over the five meters high wall of the base.</br>
</br>
The snow-covered street was filled with zombies. When they heard the noise, the blank eyes looked in this direction as their lifeless pupils began to turn red.</br>
</br>
"Rawr-!"</br>
</br>
With a roar, they dragged their stiff body as the zombies began to surround Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't back down. Instead, he leaped forward. Under the fully mobilized kinetic skeleton, he smashed toward the zombies like a steam train.</br>
</br>
The gun barrel smashed through the broken head before the agitated zombies managed to surround him. Jiang Chen quickly dashed through the waves of zombies as he sprang toward an abandoned building outside of the wall.</br>
</br>
With both feet on the ground, he vaulted up.</br>
</br>
Hands on the edge of the building, Jiang Chen climbed to the roof, leaving the zombies at the bottom. Without slowing down, he chased after the direction of the assassin.</br>
</br>
As he jumped between roofs, he was closer and closer to the pitch black figures.</br>
</br>
The drones had already surrounded her. The flashing flame in the distance was a signal of the drones firing.</br>
</br>
"You can't run, surrender now." Jiang Chen pulled the trigger as he shouted.</br>
</br>
The two exchanging gunshots attracted the zombies on the entire street. But without the ability to climb up to buildings. they could only blindly follow the source of the sound.</br>
</br>
&lt;Warning: Drones reaching signal limit.&gt;</br>
</br>
They had exceeded the attack radius of the Hummingbird drone.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, what a rat." Jiang Chen furiously stared at the figure dodging while he leaped at the front building.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, that person stopped, turned around, and a mysterious smile appeared.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was highly alerted by this, but his body was already in motion and he could not react anymore.</br>
</br>
"Bye-bye."</br>
</br>
Under the pristine moonlight, he saw the slim-figured woman blowing him a kiss.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Before his feet touched the roof, flame emerged from the bottom of the building and the roof collapsed under the sound of the explosion.</br>
</br>
It was explosives.</br>
</br>
Heavy smokes filled the vicinity as the debris quickly surrounded him.</br>
</br>
The woman looked at Jiang Chen from a distance. Mockery was all over her face as her silky black hair blew in the northern wind.</br>
</br>
The black combat suit looked thin, but she did not look chilly at all.</br>
</br>
"I thought he was an interesting person, but looks like he is just so-so after all."</br>
</br>
She played with the crystal in her hand and threw to the street on the side.</br>
</br>
A green sheen flashed as the crystal exploded, the zombies surrounding the shambles were attracted by a new sound source as they confusedly moved to that direction.</br>
</br>
"With the cost of 127 crystals, this ability for sure burns through money." Mission ended, the black figure started to mutter to herself as she jumped in front of the shambles.</br>
</br>
Not everyone was rich like Jiang Chen, 100 crystals were an astronomical number for most people.</br>
</br>
She flung her wrist as the aerodynamic looking laser rifle appeared on her graceful hand.</br>
</br>
"Is he buried inside now? This is bothersome." She let out a sigh. The battery buzzed as the laser pistol in her hand was already loaded.</br>
</br>
With a kinetic skeleton, he might not have died, Without confirming the body, this mission could not be considered complete.</br>
</br>
"As the leader of the force, you chased all by yourself so far out, should I call you courageous or foolish?"</br>
</br>
She pressed on her EP as she activated the life detection device.</br>
</br>
The signal wave scanned through the map as she tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"No signal? Died? Or did he carry a blocking device?"</br>
</br>
She kicked away a piece of rock as her gun pointed at the shadows among the ruins, she carefully stepped on top of the shambles.</br>
</br>
It began to snow again.</br>
</br>
The northern gust covered the already dim moonlight.</br>
</br>
But all the sudden, the yet-to-shut-down life detection device on her right hand suddenly showed a red dot flashing on the map. She saw this with the corner of her eyes and she suddenly felt a chillness down to her bones.</br>
</br>
She jotted up her head as a black figure growing bigger and bigger reflected in her contracting pupils.</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
With an abrupt jump backward, she barely dodged the thunderous blow.</br>
</br>
Rocks scattered like bullets has hit the surrounding. The arm she used for blocking stung.</br>
</br>
The suppressive air flow once again blew away the settled dust, as well as the snow.</br>
</br>
One person, one hammer.</br>
</br>
The eyes were filled with rage.</br>
</br>
If she got any closer, she would have seen the red dot on the pupils.</br>
</br>
Fury!</br>
</br>
"This is impossible! How did you -" Her eyes were written with disbelief. She obviously didn't know of Jiang Chen's ability to travel through dimensions.</br>
</br>
Without a reply, Jiang Chen continued to move.</br>
</br>
The micro-engines in his knees kicked into overdrive. Like a cannon, he dragged the long hammer and dashed at her.</br>
</br>
She had yet to regain her footing as she could not jump back. Under the crucial situation, the female assassin clenched her teeth and activated the particle shield on her right arm.</br>
</br>
The faint blue particles dispersed around to form a circular shield with a radius of one meter around her.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sneers as the narrowed pupils locked onto her eyes.</br>
</br>
The power hammer obtained from the mutated human swung up, with four trails of blue light streams at the end of the hammer, it swung toward the shield in front of her arm like a meteor striking earth.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 191: The Dark and Windy Night</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The particle shield made out of faint blue particles shattered. The power compressed together was instantly released as the female assassin was blown away like a bomb, colliding against a concrete wall 10 meters away.</br>
</br>
The sound of fighting drowned the zombies nearby. The frost didn't numb their legs. Compelled by the lust for flesh, they ran toward the two of them.</br>
</br>
Under both the kinetic skeleton as well as fury's strength, the power hammer in which the lead mutated human couldn't even lift, was put on Jiang Chen's shield and it was instantly charged again.</br>
</br>
Without a skip in a beat, like an enraged monster, he swung the hammer.</br>
</br>
A few dark green crystals flew towards him, Jiang Chen didn't avoid it. Instead, the nitrogen armor on his right arm blew the green dots away for meters.</br>
</br>
"This lunatic..."The person frantically lifted her pistol and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
The instant explosive force of laser weapon was perfectly demonstrated in the short distance. The raindrop-like blue beams exploded instantly, outshining the thick snow.</br>
</br>
Nitrogen armor could not defend against laser bullets, Jiang Chen put up the hammer to shield his head while the plastic armor layered with scattering effect deflected the 10 low-power laser bullets.</br>
</br>
Although the attack didn't manage to cause any hindrance to Jiang Chen's movement, it still forced him to lose his vision on her for a brief second.</br>
</br>
With this opportunity, the female assassin quickly jumped towards the side and avoided the thunderous blow.</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
The concrete wall was smashed into dust as debris flew.</br>
</br>
"Roar..." The deep roaring sound filled the air.</br>
</br>
The disturbed zombies crowded them as they lept toward them baring their teeth and claws.</br>
</br>
The female assassin sensed the dire situation as she swung her left hand with a metal hook. It shot straight to the top of an apartment building.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Jiang Chen immediately gave up on the hammer as he pulled out the PK2000 behind his back. He fired following her figure and noise.</br>
</br>
The snow made shooting challenging. However, due to Fury and the desire for blood, the bullets managed to chase up to her as if they had eyes.</br>
</br>
There were whimpering sounds in the distance. He could sense that he managed to land at least three shots on her.</br>
</br>
He swung his gun to smash down a zombie who was leaping towards him. Calmly, Jiang Chen climbed onto the top of the half-destroyed concrete wall as he jumped to the top of the building.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because her legs were hit, the figure became more awkward and disorientated.</br>
</br>
After leaping through two more buildings, Jiang Chen successfully forced her into the corner.</br>
</br>
With her back against the wall, the female assassin held onto her bleeding right leg as she stared gravely at the approaching Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Looks like there is an error in the information I collected. You are not just a foolish playboy." In a mocking voice, the female assassin said.</br>
</br>
"I don't know how you obtained that information." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
Fury was deactivated, as his eyes turned clear again.</br>
</br>
The landscape near the mansion was relatively flat, there were no tall buildings nor were anything surrounded with high walls. It was nearly impossible to observe the inside of the mansion from outside the base. She could only use the limited amount of information to analyze Jiang Chen's whereabouts.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was cautious in his mind, this person managed to sneak into the heart of the base, looks like it was necessary to upgrade security,</br>
</br>
"Your name?" Jiang Chen stopped five meters away from her with a gun pointed at her head.</br>
</br>
The mask covered her face and her nose, Jiang Chen couldn't see her expression clearly.</br>
</br>
"Compared to my name, shouldn't you by more worried about your own safety?" The female assassin mocked as a victorious smile appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Put down your weapon, or you could lose your hand." He had no knowledge that a giant man was standing 10 meters away with a rifle pointed directly at his arm. The killer's face carried a malevolent smile.</br>
</br>
Although the plan was to assassinate, it would be better if they could capture him alive.</br>
</br>
[Not working alone?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh but he didn't put down the weapon. Instead, he glanced at the man standing meters away from him.</br>
</br>
"Watch your back." Jiang Chen said mischievously.</br>
</br>
The person was suddenly alerted and immediately pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
But the bullet didn't hit anything, because the target disappeared out of thin air!</br>
</br>
He promptly turned the gun towards his back, but there was nothing behind him either.</br>
</br>
"Be careful-!" Before he could hear the shout, his consciousness was terminated.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen who reappeared at the same place pulled the trigger without hesitation and the bullets penetrated through the back of the assasin's head.</br>
</br>
Then, he turned his gun towards the female assassin who was not willing to disclose her name.</br>
</br>
White blade reflected light directed at him, Jiang Chen abruptly reposted with his rifle.</br>
</br>
Ding!</br>
</br>
The dagger cut through the shell of the rifle as the female assassin used this glimpse of opportunity to leap over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately pulled the trigger, but she was already a body distance away from him. She grabbed on to the burning gun and a second dagger appearing out of the other hand.</br>
</br>
Sparks flashed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lifted his arm as the kinetic skeleton metal frame attached to the side of his arm shielded against the hit that was aimed straight to his throat.</br>
</br>
"Go die!" Letting go of the rifle, Jiang Chen removed the dagger slashed into the gun as he stabbed fiercely toward the female assassin's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Not so much." The swinging dagger blocked the hit. She threw away the rifle in her hand as another ping-pong ball sized crystal appeared in her hand.</br>
</br>
The crystal emitted a dark green light as fierce and determination flashed across her face. She squeezed out a few words between her teeth, "let's die together."</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, what a psychotic woman.]</br>
</br>
Cold sweat rolled down his forehead. The continuous use of interdimensional travel consumed almost all the energy there was in the bracelet.</br>
</br>
[What do I do?!]</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
The sound of a gunshot interrupted the fight between the two.</br>
</br>
The bullet ripped off half of her arm as the hand holding the crystal fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh!" The agonizing scream almost penetrated Jiang Chen's eardrum as the female assassin that lost her arm tumbled to the back.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the assasin had fled, Jiang Chen kicked the dark green crystal away without stopping.</br>
</br>
The crystal exploded 10 meters away in mid-air.</br>
</br>
Light beamed down from the sky and locked onto the female assassin who was struggling to get up. She held onto her broken left arm with an agonized and frightened expression. Her two athletic but slim legs spread out on the concrete floor. Because of all the blood, such gesture did not look attractive at all.</br>
</br>
With heavy breathing, Jiang Chen threw away the dagger in his hand, he wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead, as he narrowed his eyes to look in the sky.</br>
</br>
It was the helicopter, Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Chu Nan was piloting the helicopter. After the alarm rang, he, who was taking a stroll outside, immediately headed towards the helicopter pad.</br>
</br>
Half-kneeling at the hatch door was Zhou Xiaoxia.</br>
</br>
She held a sniper rifle in her hands. Her merciless expression was completely contrary to her usual dumbfoundedness. The cross-sight in her field of vision locked onto the head of the female assassin.</br>
</br>
"No need to shoot, just maintain suppression."</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was okay, Sun Jiao, who was standing on the side, finally let out a breath of relief as she slowly opened her mouth.</br>
</br>
When she heard that assassin broke into the mansion and that Jiang Chen and Yao Yao were attacked, her heart almost jumped out of her throat. Especially when she saw the image from the drones that Jiang Chen chased out alone, she almost burst out crying.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was only an expression, Sun Jiao would obviously not cry. She carried the laser rifle and jumped onto the helicopter.</br>
</br>
Zhou Xiaoxia didn't respond, her black hair was disheveled because of turbulence, but the hands that were holding onto the sniper rifle were steady.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked perplexed from the side of her face and she didn't say anything. She only signaled Chu Nan to lower the helicopter height in order to take Jiang Chen home.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao could imagine the difficulty of sniping on the helicopter, especially with the heavy storm.</br>
</br>
With only instinct toward the weapon, she achieved this kind of accuracy?</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao began to reminisce about the past when she was active near Liuding town - the not long period of time when they worked together.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, commander, maybe you should really "teach" your husband? He is a leader. After all, this type of risky things should be left for us." Chu Nan left out a sigh as he approached the building.</br>
</br>
He maneuvered the helicopter as he said jokingly, "How should I say this? He is not a bad boss."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Sun Jiao half-heartedly replied. All of her focus was on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The helicopter hovered beside the roof.</br>
</br>
Before the helicopter stabilized, Sun Jiao immediately jumped to the roof and hugged Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He held onto the gorgeous figure as he felt her warmth, just as Jiang Chen wanted to say something, his expression turned peculiar.</br>
</br>
He tenderly patted her on the back as he let her teeth bite into his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Is your Han Zodiac a dog?" Jiang Chen gasped for air in exaggeration.</br>
</br>
With her face slightly red, Sun Jiao was embarrassed, but her hands still clenched tightly onto Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that her eyes were red.</br>
</br>
"Sorry for making you worry." Jiang Chen caressed the luscious hair. He looked into the reddened eyes and began to blame himself.</br>
</br>
He didn't think too much in the heat of the moment, he only followed because of pure anger.</br>
</br>
His hasty move probably disrupted the entire base.</br>
</br>
Feeling the girl in his arms calm down, Jiang Chen turned around holding her hand and looked at the already fainted female assassin.</br>
</br>
"Let's see the real face of this rat?"</br>
</br>
Anger flashed across Sun Jiao's face as her eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"I agree, for an unwelcomed guest, we must treat her properly."</br>
</br>
She already had plans as to how to torture this despicable person.</br>
</br>
[Whip, candle... No, these punishments are too light.]</br>
</br>
[We will use the cruelest tortures to found out the perpetrator behind this.]</br>
</br>
With laser rifle in her hand, Sun Jiao walked up as she kicked off the mask on the assassin's face without mercy.</br>
</br>
"How is this possible!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's pupils immediately contracted as she tumbled back a few steps, her face was full of disbelief.</br>
</br>

</br>
"It has been tuned, but you should be careful when you use it. Since I haven't made one in a long time, actions with high complexity could cause a program error." After tuning the numbers on the computer, Jiang Lin removed the cords on the mechanical arm and gave it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The silica gel feeling was no different than the skin. If the port in the back was not made of metal, it would almost be the same as a woman's hand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen played with the mechanical hand for a moment and asked casually, "What's the cost to produce one of these?"</br>
</br>
"The titanium skeleton is a bit expensive which costs around 31 crystals. The microchip used as processor along with electronic nerve were around 20 crystals in total. To be honest, I recommend purchasing microchips from Liuding town. The chips there are not only cheap, but are also more advanced compared to the Sixth Street. If we use their chips to produce kinetic skeletons, the stats in every category would improve."</br>
</br>
"Oh? I'll keep an eye out... Also, did you implant the thing I told you about?"</br>
</br>
"Already done, this is the control terminal." Jiang Lin put a thumb-sized memory drive in Jiang Chen's hands.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the memory drive as he directly inserted it into the end of the EP before the screen began to load.</br>
</br>
"If the user had any malicious intention, the battery would be locked, and it would instantly release power that executes the user... Of course, this power could be adjusted, if you don't want to kill the user right away."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, beautiful... Speaking of this, do you not need to keep an eye on the kinetic skeleton production line?" Jiang Chen stared at the rocket engine in the middle of the room as he asked with an odd expression.</br>
</br>
"I have already assigned the responsibilities to everyone and put what they needed to do in a handbook. I am only responsible for quality assurance and tuning, as well as ranking their work performance." Jiang Lin pushed the glasses up his nose and he said proudly.</br>
</br>
The ranking was geared towards the newly joined survivors who are better known as the slaves. For those with outstanding work ethics, they would be promoted to lower citizens.</br>
</br>
Since it would not interfere with the production, Jiang Chen was too lazy to ridicule him to not stay on task.</br>
</br>
"Therefore? How long would this thing stay in orbit for?" Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Uhh, this is not an exploration rocket." Jiang Lin scratched his head.</br>
</br>
"Not an exploration rocket?" Jiang Chen was confused.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, precisely speaking, it's a missile capable of carrying 1000 kilograms of combat equipment."</br>
</br>
Bang..</br>
</br>
The mechanical arm dropped to the ground.</br>
</br>
"How many of this can you produce!" Jiang Chen had both of his hands on Jiang Lin's shoulders as he stared at Jiang Lin passionately.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin felt goosebumps all over his back. He took a step back and forced a laugh.</br>
</br>
</br>
"This thing cannot be mass produced. It's hard to obtain the materials, I can only say I will do my best..."</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k, 1000 kilograms of load, even if it carried the ancient TNT, it would instantly evaporate half of a street. If it was switched to the concentrated bomb common on wasteland, its power would be comparable to the mid-sized tactical nuke.]</br>
</br>
"Do your absolute best!" Jiang Chen said sincerely.</br>
</br>
If he possessed this superweapon, it would without a doubt increase his odd in winning the war against the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin took a deep breath and nodded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the mechanical arm off the ground and headed towards the direction of the mansion.</br>
</br>
When he entered the basement, he saw the female assassin strapped tightly on top of the operating table, as well as Sun Jia who stood on the side with a perplexed expression.</br>
</br>
"The DNA results are out." Lin Lin stretched her body after busily working on the control panels for a long time.</br>
</br>
"What's the result!" Sun Jiao tightly clenched onto Lin Lin's shoulders.</br>
</br>
Because their faces were so close together, Lin Lin's face turned slightly red and looked away.</br>
</br>
"She is indeed your younger sister."</br>
</br>
When she heard the confirmation, Sun Jiao's shoulder began to slacken. Jiang Chen noticed the perplexed expression on her face, he sighed, walked to her and hugged her around the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"I'll spare her-"</br>
</br>
"No, she almost killed you and Yao Yao." Sun Jiao had determination in her eyes, but it was soon replaced with blankness.</br>
</br>
On one side laid the only relative she had in the world. On the other side stood the person she loves.</br>
</br>
"I don't want to make this difficult for you."</br>
</br>
"But-"</br>
</br>
"Leave it to me. Trust me." Jiang Chen stared at her shaking eyes as he said with an assertive tone.</br>
</br>
With a blushed face, Sun Jiao lowered her head.</br>
</br>
"Then I'll leave it to you..." As she finished speaking, Sun Jiao pushed opened the door and left the basement.</br>
</br>
Although she had thought of the countless of cruel ways to extract information from the assasin, when she realized that the assassin was actually her sister, she was no longer certain.</br>
</br>
To find her lost sister, she had covered the entire Wanghai city with her footsteps. It was until she finally met Jiang Chen did she temporarily put a pause to the journey of searching for her family.</br>
</br>
If she stayed here, Jiang Chen must feel restrained because he has to consider her feeling.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, who already knew the meaning of tenderness, didn't want him to feel conflicted.</br>
</br>
So she chose to leave.</br>
</br>
Seeing Sun Jiao's back, Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"This is problematic."</br>
</br>
The assassin was the female boss' sister. Could the plot get any more stereotypical than this?</br>
</br>
"How about you take her as part of your collection as well, since your prey limit is anyone within 10 years both ways." Lin Lin suggested.</br>
</br>
The joke was not made at the best time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin frightenedly trembled and lifted her hands to cover her mouth.</br>
</br>
"How did she make the crystals explode, did you figure it out?"</br>
</br>
Under a normal circumstance, the energy in the crystal is very stable. Even in a high-temperature and high-pressure environment, it would not explode. The crystals could even be cut into smaller pieces, hence why it could be used as a currency.</br>
</br>
"Based on DNA analysis, she could freely change her brain wave pattern. It is likely that she changed her brain wave pattern to coincide with a special particle chain within the crystals, which resulted in resonance. Through experimental analysis, once the particle chain is disrupted, the entire crystal structure would collapse which would instantly release all the energy. This should be an ability that evolved from genetic vaccine. Also, about the crystal-"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin seemed to have made a new discovery, but Jiang Chen didn't have the mood to be thinking about other things.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see, go back first, I'll find you later." He interrupted and ordered in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Do you not need my help anymore?"</br>
</br>
"Because the things happening next might not be PG." Jiang Chen shrugged his shoulder.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's face turned red as she cursed out whiling walking out in quick steps carrying her tablet.</br>
</br>
"Pervert..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Lin Lin's bad mouthing as he quietly waited for her footsteps to disappear.</br>
</br>
He closed and locked the basement door, took a deep breath and walked to the female assassin.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou, that was her name.</br>
</br>
If one carefully studies at her face, one would discover that her looks did resemble Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
As for the differences, it was mainly that the assasin was shorter in height . She was also not as busty compared to her sister and her face still carried a hint of immaturity. The broken hand was sprayed with medicine mist and bandaged up. Her limbs were locked onto the operating table with all four extended out. Her black combat suit was changed into loose white shirt and pants. Just by judging her current appearance alone, it was hard to imagine her as an assassin.</br>
</br>
He shook his head as he walked beside the operating table. Looking at the buttons with many unknown functions, he paused for a moment before randomly pressing down a button.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhhh!" The scream almost pierced through his eardrums. Jiang Chen had to cover his ears.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou violently shook as her eyes turned white and foam was dripping out of her mouth.</br>
</br>
A faint pungence appeared, Jiang Chen looked at the light yellow liquid dripping along the operating table and an awkward expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
He only wanted to startle her and wake her up.</br>
</br>
He didn't think that the button was for electrocuting.</br>
</br>
[But what are the purposes of the other buttons?]</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou woke up from her paralyzed state.</br>
</br>
She stared fiercely at Jiang Chen, then her eyes began to wander around the basement.</br>
</br>
"Don't bother, there is not a single crystal in this basement." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"What did you do to me?" Sun Xiaorou quickly scanned her clothes. When she realized her black combat suit had been changed, anger appeared between her eyebrows, but the smile he had was no different.</br>
</br>
"Your name is Sun Xiaorou."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou paused for a moment. She the looked at Jiang Chen in alert without making a sound. She was confused as to how this man knew her name.</br>
</br>
[Looks like she haven't seen Sun Jiao yet...]</br>
</br>
"Where are you from? Why are you assassinating me?" Jiang Chen grabbed a chair and sat beside the operating table.</br>
</br>
A determined and scornful laugh eame out of her mouth and she said mockingly. "You really think I am going to tell you?"</br>
</br>
"How would I know without trying? If possible, I would prefer if you don't make me do cruel things to beauties." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Oh? If it is just the electrocuting, you are far away from getting anything." Sun Xiaorou mocked.</br>
</br>
She had already been mentally prepared about the consequence of being captured.</br>
</br>
"Have you been implanted with the chip?" Jiang Chen didn't get enraged by her tone. Instead, he asked with the calm voice.</br>
</br>
"Only foolish people would be happy about those boring dog chains." The voice was contemptuous.</br>
</br>
She was not forced by the slavery chip.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was her only family, then this eliminated the possibility of her family being taken hostage.</br>
</br>
An absolute form of loyalty?</br>
</br>
Hard to believe, especially on the wasteland without orders.</br>
</br>
"Do you have a sister?" Jiang Chen asked the question attentively.</br>
</br>
Her expression did not change the slightest.</br>
</br>
"I don't have family."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wondered if Sun Jiao would be heartbroken after these words, her sister already couldn't remember her.</br>
</br>
For the people injected with the genetic vaccine, the truth-telling liquid is ineffective. If he wanted to obtain information, then it must be interrogation with the help of a lie detector. Seeing her defiant stance, Jiang Chen was troubled.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's sister... Based on relationship, she should be considered his sister-in-law.</br>
</br>
From any perspective, using torture on an assasin was the best choice to obtain useful information. But Jiang Chen could not do that to his sister-in-law.</br>
</br>
"Then let's make a deal. If you cooperate, I can let you go, and give you ten thousand crystals." Jiang Chen decided to first lure her with money.</br>
</br>
To his surprise, her stubbornness matched her sister's.</br>
</br>
"Crystals? You don't understand what this is about at all." The voice was filled with arrogance and contempt.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Don't you use crystals as a currency?" Jiang Chen tried to make a conversation.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ignorant."</br>
</br>
Still, the tone was filled with mockery.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was instantly enraged, but his face was expressionless. He only grabbed a long needle injector from the pan beside the operating table.</br>
</br>
"Do you know what this is?" Jiang Chen shook the needle in front of her nose as he said slowly.</br>
</br>
"What?" Sun Xiaorou held her neck up as she scorned.</br>
</br>
"Nerve catalyst, it would increase your nerve cell activity by one hundred times. In simple words, it could increase your sensitivity one hundred times." Jiang Chen lightly pushed the needle as the colorless liquid emerged from the tip.</br>
</br>
"You are a devil." Sun Xiaorou's expression changed as she tried to move back, but because of her tied down limbs, her struggle was futile.</br>
</br>
"I don't have time to waste on you. The mutated humans are across the river bank and my people are waiting for my order. You only have two choices right now, be truthful, or be tortured until you tell the truth." Jiang Chen said in menace.</br>
</br>
This medicine was purchased by Zhou Guoping at the Sixth Street black market. Five milliliter of liquid cost one hundred crystals, which signified its rarity.</br>
</br>
"Then why don't you try!" Pew!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dodged her spit. He was not angry. Instead, he laughed as he injected the needle right into her vein.</br>
</br>
Looking into her eyes of despair, he pushed all the liquid into her.</br>
</br>
Her limbs twitched as if she was having a spasm, then her body began to quiver. It took her a long time before she breathing returned to normal.</br>
</br>
"You, you filth of a human being..."</br>
</br>
"Do you not have the energy to speak?" Jiang Chen threw the needle away as a smirk emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
"..." Her voice was trembling so much Jiang Chen could not make out what she was cursing about.</br>
</br>
If possible, he didn't want to do this, but since it already started, then it must continue.</br>
</br>
He pressed his finger onto her right arm.</br>
</br>
"Wooo!"</br>
</br>
"Are you sensitive to this extreme? Then let me ask you-"</br>
</br>
"In, in your dreams..."</br>
</br>
"Okay, then imagine what happened today as a bad dream. Next, what should we try? Electrocution? Or high-temperature SPA? Or something else?" Jiang Chen pressed a red button.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhhh-!"</br>
</br>
The agonizing scream revibrated in the entire basement.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, with one ear on the door, shivered and she quickly retracted her head.</br>
</br>
[What was this pervert doing!]</br>
</br>
Because of curiosity, when Jiang Chen closed the door, she quietly sneaked back.</br>
</br>
But just as she put her ear against the door, she heard the agonizing scream.</br>
</br>
She remembered the words she spoke that provoked Jiang Chen as she shuddered again before carefully leaving the basement.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Looking at Sun Xiaorou with foams in her mouth, both eyes turning white, and her limps spasming on the operating table, Jiang Chen rubbed his wary temples.</br>
</br>
Even after the injection of medicine that increased her sensivity by one hundred times, she still lasted two hours.</br>
</br>
Seeing the stains at the edge of the operating table, Jiang Chen held his breath and his expression was somewhat awkward.</br>
</br>
[This seems to be over the line?]</br>
</br>
But he couldn't think of better ways. In the end, he didn't hurt his body, as to the mental trauma... let time work its magic.</br>
</br>
Another note worth mentioning, he didn't expect her to be a virgin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the notebook and hastily left the basement.</br>
</br>
At the door, he met Sun Jiao with a perplexed expression.</br>
</br>
"Is it over?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen nodded awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn't say anything and kissed him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen blankly looked at Sun Jiao's closed eyes before he shut his eyes as well.</br>
</br>
Lips apart.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I-"</br>
</br>
"Don't apologize, she deserves the punishment. Regardless of where it happens, the fate of assassins is public execution... I am already thankful that you spared her life. The damage on her body could be healed with time-" Sun Jiao seemed to have thought this through as there was no more hesitation in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"No, I didn't hurt her during the process. But she provoked me, I turned hot-headed, and then I..." As he spoke, Jiang Chen's expression turned more and more awkward.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao paused for a moment, then her face turned red and she gently bit her lips.</br>
</br>
"Pervert." Sun Jiao smashed his shoulder and she quickly walked downstairs.</br>
</br>
Seeing Sun Jiao's figure, Jiang Chen put up his hand wanting to explain something, but then he put it down.</br>
</br>
There was no use in explaining once the girl sees the chaos in the basement.</br>
</br>
He will have to wait until the night to explain to her "privately."</br>
</br>
Perhaps, this was the evilest thing he has done in his entire life.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 194: Klein Particles</br>
</div></br>
The Northern Alliance District.</br>
</br>
As one of the rare safe havens inside Pan-Pacific area, the description of this place was only applicable when compared to the ruins and shambles.</br>
</br>
The survivors left on this wasteland migrated north as they established a survivor camp along the Yellow River South of the Golden City. The population density of this area was not high before the war. Therefore, the concentration of zombies was naturally low. Without the direct impact of a nuclear weapon, the radiation level was much lower compared to developed area. The mutant population was also meager. Other than the mutants that migrated from north of the Golden city, this place possessed almost no lethal danger.</br>
</br>
Stability brought order and prosperity.</br>
</br>
Despite the harsh environment and the barren lands, they still manage to plot out thousands of acres of "arable land" on the wasteland. Despite the low production, it ultimately managed to feed the tens of thousands of survivors who fled here.</br>
</br>
Dictatorship, power, stability.</br>
</br>
These three words could holistically describe this "empire."</br>
</br>
Although it was named as the Northern Alliance, the armed force that controlled the "security" of this place of land controlled the life of all the survivors. In the form of military government, they managed the food production and subsequently dictated the entire area.</br>
</br>
It was rumored that they had been plotting against Wanghai city for a long time already.</br>
</br>
Of course, Sun Xiaorou didn't belong to the military government, but rather a religious group based on the northern area - the Dusk Church.</br>
</br>
They promoted the forthcoming of an apocalypse and fully believed the terror of the apocalypse. But different from the majority of people who lost hope, they also firmly believed that their spiritual leader Bo Yu could lead them to escape the solar system, find a second Sun and establish a new home for the humans.</br>
</br>
It was quite a coincidence, the purpose of their trip to Wanghai city was to obtain the &lt;Project Garden of Eden&gt; buried in Fallout Shelter 005 and to acquire the technology to establish the biosphere in space.</br>
</br>
To be able to enter the planning bureau inside the city and obtain the exact location of Fallout Shelter 005, they were not reluctant to partner up with the mutated humans from the Seventh Area. All the firearms of the mutated human, as well as the security password of the Carmen Pharmaceutical, were provided by them.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, their fate was deteremined and they were to return empty-handed. Other than metal debris, there was nothing left there. After clearing out the mutated creature that infiltrated Fallout Shelter 005, Jiang Chen blew up the server of the article intelligence and cleaned out anything useful inside.</br>
</br>
As for the metal box that stored &lt;Project Garden of Eden&gt;, after Lin Lin copied all the information to the chip inside her head, Jiang Chen destroyed the original copy.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wondered what kind of expression would be on Bo Yu's face once he went through all the trouble to finally enter to Fallout Shelter 005, and only found junks inside.</br>
</br>
But regardless, even if Jiang Chen knew what happened to Fallout Shelter 005, he could not stand in front him and say "I already cleared Fallout Shelter 005 and I have taken everything away."</br>
</br>
In this case, conflict was inevitable. Jiang Chen could not let the mutated humans inside Qingpu. The leader of The Dusk Church Bo Yu would not give up on entering the city center. When he sent the assassin, he already demonstrated his hostility.</br>
</br>
As to how the weapons and supplies would be transported to Wanghai, and how she joined The Dusk, Sun Xiaorou didn't have those memories. Since she joined the cult at a very young age and based on the face that all religions have the same tendencies, brainwashing was an unavoidable step.</br>
</br>
After all, it was about the crystals.</br>
</br>
In the end, Sun Xiaorou, in herhalf-unconscious state, blurted out random things. After attempting to piece together her broken sentences, Jiang Chen could not summarize the information she said.</br>
</br>
But a keyword she continuously emphasized drew his attention.</br>
</br>
Klein Particles.</br>
</br>
It was the third time he has heard this word.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh!"</br>
</br>
Just as he pushed open Lin Lin's door, Jiang Chen heard a sudden whimper.</br>
</br>
He looked confusedly at the quivering Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"What happened to you?"</br>
</br>
"No...Nothing!"</br>
</br>
The sharp voice seemed to be out of tune.</br>
</br>
Was she traumatized somehow?</br>
</br>
Due to Lin Lin being regularly irregular, Jiang Chen wasn't bothered by it and he cut straight to the topic.</br>
</br>
"About what happened last time, I have a question."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin cutely gulped as she nodded her head intensely.</br>
</br>
It was rare that she was this cooperative.</br>
</br>
Usually, she would start with, "Why do I have to help you?".</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen obviously didn't know that the disobedient Lin Lin sneaked back when he closed the door and heard some bad things.</br>
</br>
"...Then I am going to ask, last time, it was Tingting that shot out the red light?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was weird when he said the name Tingting.</br>
</br>
Although in that virtual world, she entered it in the form of a human and became a couple with him, her original form is a "bug."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Lin Lin nodded furiously.</br>
</br>
"That particle, what exactly is it?"</br>
</br>
When she heard this, Lin Lin's expression turned earnest.</br>
</br>
"That's what I wanted to say... I found something abnormal on the surface of the crystal."</br>
</br>
As she finished saying, Lin Lin ran to the front of the experiment table. She picked up a polished crystal and put it inside the glass sphere of an odd-looking equipment.</br>
</br>
"This is...?"</br>
</br>
"You won't know even if I tell you, it is a really convenient equipment... Before I always thought you guys collected them because they were shiny and that because they could also replace hydrocarbon as an energy source. But after doing some experiments, this thing is not as simple as it looks."</br>
</br>
Inside the glass sphere, the dark green crystal began to change color.</br>
</br>
"The complete combustion of the energy of a crystal could release the energy equivalent to 2.47 kg of coal. After, it would turn into this form."</br>
</br>
The crystal lost its shine and changed into a quartz-like appearance.</br>
</br>
"And then?" Jiang Chen looked at the crystal keenly.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin didn't answer Jiang Chen's question. Instead, she asked rhetorically with mysteriousness on her face, "Have you heard of the fourth dimension?"</br>
</br>
"Fourth dimension? The dimension that includes time?" Jiang Chen had heard this before as he had been through university after all.</br>
</br>
"Then let me ask you another question, have you heard about energy that belongs to the fourth dimension?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was dumbfounded. One because it was too abstract, two because he didn't know why she suddenly brought up the question.</br>
</br>
"Every matter in this world, including you and me, could be measured by three measurements: length, width and height. These are all measurements of the third dimension. But if time is added to the list, then the Jiang Chen today would be completely different from the Jiang Chen tomorrow. This would be the fourth dimension. The same as the 1.50 m Lin Lin is completely different than the 2.00 m Lin Lin in the third dimension."</br>
</br>
"If we can add a timeline to energy. Imagine this, the crystal's "energy today" have been used, but a few thousand years later, its energy would be filled up again..."</br>
</br>
"Wait, what about the conservation of energy?" Jiang Chen had to interrupt.</br>
</br>
"Of course it is conserved. Because from the start, the Klein particle exists in the forth dimension, but it is limited to a "point" that we can't see. But at a certain time point, some Klein particles would fall to the third dimension, in our eyes, the most obvious demonstration would be 'energized.'"</br>
</br>
Because it was too scientifically fictional, despite Lin Lin being extremely slow and detailed in her description, Jiang Chen still felt lost.</br>
</br>
"You can try this crystal, use your power to draw its energy. Remember, the energy amount of this crystal before was five." As she spoke, Lin Lin put the colorless crystal in Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
It was already empty.</br>
</br>
Charging the interdimensional bracelet with it would be impossible?</br>
</br>
As he thought this through, Jiang Chen still followed Lin Lin's instruction and put the crystal in his hand.</br>
</br>
Then, his expression turned to astonishment.</br>
</br>
He somehow obtained energy from the empty crystal.</br>
</br>
The amount of energy that supplied the bracelet was no less than the crystal with five energy points!</br>
</br>
"Is there energy remaining?" Jiang Chen asked in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head.</br>
</br>
"The energy belonging to the third dimension has been completely exhausted. You could bring this crystal to any production equipment and it could not be used as a source of energy. But just as I had suspected, your interdimensional bracelet could directly draw Klein particles from the fourth dimension. Another way to say this is that you exhausted the energy that could appear in the crystal in the future."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes widened as he stared at his right wrist, the tattoo.</br>
</br>
"No, it could also draw electricity to charge it. It would cost 100 watts of electricity to charge it to full, with crystal, it would only cost 10 energy points. But based on your explanation, one energy crystal, with the energy fallen to the third dimension was equivalent to 2.47 kilograms of coal. 10 energy points of crystal Klein Particles must at least exceed 100 watts of electricity by 10 folds?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin sighed.</br>
</br>
"Think carefully, when you use electricity to charge interdimensional bracelet, did electricity follow your hand to go into the ground?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tightened his eyebrows as he recollected when he charged before, he shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"Of course not. If that happened, you would be fried." Lin Lin said in frustration.</br>
</br>
"The electricity absorbed by your bracelet is not the electricity generated through electron flowing from the negative end to positive end, but rather it completely consumed the electron itself. It is complicated to explain, but you could interpret it as the particle has completed vanished. Therefore, you wouldn't think that with only 100 watts of electricity, it could manage to travel through space dimensions?" In the end, Lin Lin ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, crystal... This type of biological formation, is a container for Klein particles?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. As to how exactly it contained the mysterious Klein particle, I haven't figured it out yet. But crystal is not as simple as it appears to be. Including the female assassin detonating the crystal, as well as the red beam shot up by Tingting, they are all phenomenon of Klein particles releasing its energy to the third dimension." Lin Lin explained with an earnest face.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 195: The Unpeaceful Sixth Street</br>
</div></br>
The unrest that happened overnight had been settled.</br>
</br>
The assassin was caught and captured in the mansion's basement. The boss was free of harm and everyone let out a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
Hearing that assassin sneaked into the base, Cheng Weiguo, who was responsible for the security of the base, immediately lectured and cursed the soldiers patrolling on the wall. He pulled the knight emblems off of their chest and ordered them to kneel in the snow naked for an entire day as punishment.</br>
</br>
In this type of weather, to kneel in the snow for an entire day, even with the genetic vaccine, they would lose their life.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen spared them with his words.</br>
</br>
It was not their fault.</br>
</br>
Being able to avoid the drones equipped with the infrared sensor, the assassin must be skillful. Through his combat with Sun Xiaorou, Jiang Chen discovered that she was not to be underestimated.</br>
</br>
Because of the existence of a powerful enemy, punishing their own just to release anger was no doubt a foolish move. Although Jiang Chen didn't understand the crafts of leading people, he still could think wearing others' shoes.</br>
</br>
"This humiliation will be washed away by your future achievement. If you really feel guilty, then use your loyalty to repay, not your life."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said to the humiliated "naked knights" who were kneeling on the ground.</br>
</br>
Although he spared the patrolling soldiers, the topic of base security was the conversation around the table again.</br>
</br>
How to maximize the resource available to increase the effectiveness of patrol? Jiang Chen suggested a brutal but straightforward idea.</br>
</br>
Bulldoze all the buildings within one hundred meter radius outside of the base to clear out the area.</br>
</br>
They would reuse the construction materials as much as possible, if they couldn't, then they would drag one hundred meters out and pile it up.</br>
</br>
Without buildings to take cover, it would not be as easy to infiltrate the base under the dual surveillance of drones and patrols.</br>
</br>
This issue was finally resolved.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The bedroom wall was disfigured by the bullets and required renovation. Therefore, Jiang Chen had to choose a different room to sleep.</br>
</br>
But Sun Jiao already made the decision for him as she dragged him into her own bedroom. She was ready to use her own body to "interrogate" him to see what exactly he did to her sister.</br>
</br>
Of course, there was no sense of blame.</br>
</br>
However, the fact that her man slept with her own sister made the possessive Miss Sun Jiao displeased.</br>
</br>
The result of a displeased Sun Jiao was that Jiang Chen had to stay up tonight...</br>
</br>
The only pitiful person was Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
After she recovered from the shock, the small loli worked up the courage to suggest that if he had nowhere to stay, he could stay with Yao Yao. But sister Sun Jiao was one step ahead so Yao Yao could only pout at the closed door in disappointment.</br>
</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen bumped into Yao Yao, who, just like him, also had dark circles.</br>
</br>
Feeling guity over the fact that he didn't manage to fulfill his promise, Jiang Chen suggested a compensation plan - to stay with her for the entire day.</br>
</br>
"Am I really not heavy?" Yao Yao turned around asking worriedly.</br>
</br>
"Not heavy, Yao Yao, you are really light." Jiang Chen quickly shook his head.</br>
</br>
A timid smile appeared on Yao Yao's face and she happily turned to look in the front. She dangled her feet in the air while moving her tiny butt backward to sit in a more comfortable position.</br>
</br>
But this troubled Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was not the weight, but the tender feeling scratching on his legs had touched an indescribable place.</br>
</br>
To simply describe the state between these two people...</br>
</br>
Inside the bedroom of a girl, Jiang Chen sat on the side of the soft bed, and Yao Yao sat on his legs.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath as he tried his hardest to suppress the part of him from raising up. It would be awkward if it "stood up".</br>
</br>
But a faint fragrance entered his nostril because of his deep breath.</br>
</br>
The tip of his head felt a tingling sensation.</br>
</br>
Uh Oh!</br>
</br>
Maybe it was because she felt something hard, or sensed Jiang Chen's "trouble," Yao Yao's face began to turn red.</br>
</br>
"Big brother, you don't need to endure this..."</br>
</br>
As she said that, Yao Yao buried her tiny head and silently putting her tablet down. Her feet also stopped dangling. The long shaking eyelashes seemed to be waiting for something.</br>
</br>
[No, it's better to endure.]</br>
</br>
After an arduous internal conflict, Jiang Chen finally suppressed his desire and he decided not to put his claws on Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen made no moves, Yao Yao pouted her mouth but didn't say anything as she continued to research on her tablet.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a relief as he glanced at the dazzling amount of information on the tablet. The hiddenly shocked Jiang Chen also picked up his own tablet off the table and began to take care of his own business.</br>
</br>
There was a large discrepancy of force at the front line. Based on the information provided by Zhao Gang, it is expected that after 20 days, the mutated human force would be ready to attack. When that happens, the river below the Zhufeng Highway bridge would be frozen. The mutated humans would launch their attack at that time.</br>
</br>
On the screen was a visual sent back from the Hummingbird drone. Because of the existence of an anti-air machine gun, the task of capturing video footage could not be given to Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
The dense red dots accumulated behind the snow hill on the side of the highway, as well as the anti-air machine guns and cannons covered in white cloths.</br>
</br>
[If Jiang Lin's missile is completed, it would only take one hit to achieve what I want...] Jiang Chen fantasized in his head but quickly shook his head. He then called Zhou Guoping from the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The phone was quickly picked up.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping's bald head appeared on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Boss. Do you need me to do something?" The respectful voice lightened his mood.</br>
</br>
"I need mercenaries, do you know any you are familiar with at Sixth Street?" Jiang Chen cut straight to the topic.</br>
</br>
"Mercenaries?" Zhou Guoping paused for a moment, "Do you know already, boss?"</br>
</br>
"Know?" Jiang Chen's expression was odd, he didn't understand what Zhou Guoping said.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, there is a rumor recently on Sixth Street. It said that the wreckages of 'God's Cane' lie inside somewhere in the city center. Of course, the validity of the information has yet to be confirmed, I am still investigating. If, boss, you are also interested that thing, I can help you investigate carefully." Zhou Guoping said mysteriously.</br>
</br>
"The God's Cane?" Jiang Chen was lost, just as he was about to ask what it was, he suddenly recalled the &lt;Colonel's Diary&gt; he read in the virtual world.</br>
</br>
"Oh, I almost forgot that you are not from Wanghai City." Zhou Guoping slapped his forehead as he quickly explained, "It's a sky based weapon, also known as an orbital weapon-"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I know, but what does that have to do with the Sixth Street?" Jiang Chen interrupted Zhou Guoping's explanation, he only wanted to listen to critical information.</br>
</br>
"A mysterious wealthy man sent out quests at major bars and set a reward of one million crystals for the wreckage of God's Cane."</br>
</br>
"One million crystals? Fu*k, is that person crazy?" Jiang Chen almost jumped up.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao looked at Jiang Chen in confusion. She moved her butt as she readjusted the way she sat.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, the amount has been verified by Sixth Street officials. The quest had been stamped with the metal seal. With Sixth Street's official reputation, this quest shouldn't be fraudulent." Zhou Guoping took a moment he continued, "The mercenaries stationed in the Sixth Street have gone insane. There are fewer missions in the winter as all of those people like to spend their days rotting away in the bars. Now someone offered such an astronomical number, even the not-so-strong hunting teams began to make moves."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s eyebrows furrowed.</br>
</br>
"So you are saying, it’s hard to hire people now?"</br>
</br>
"I wouldn’t say it is hard, but the price is definitely higher."</br>
</br>
"That’s okay, I’ll send you the mission… Also, regarding the God’s Cane, keep an eye out for me."</br>
</br>
"Yes, boss." Zhou Guoping exaggeratedly bowed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the communication menu and rubbed his nose.</br>
</br>
He had an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
The snow this year would be much colder compared to the years before.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 196: Mercenaries</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Snow, as thick as a blanket, covered the desolated street.</br>
</br>
Other than the worker removing snow, the only noise on the entire street was the freezing northern wind.</br>
</br>
Oh, not quite. There was still one place that maintained the liveliness of spring.</br>
</br>
People shouted, celebrated, unleashed their pressure, and spent away their dreary days.</br>
</br>
This place was the Fake Leg Bar. Although they have only been open for less than one month, the high-quality alcohol garnered the hearts of all the survivors. In front of the bar counter, the muscular mercenary had a foot on the chair as he showed off his scars drunkenly. The barely covered lady walked among the dark corners of the bar to wait for the prey of the night. Gamblers put two tables together as they played poker and dices.</br>
</br>
Just based on these few people, this place would appear as no different than the Bullet Shell Bar on the next street. The only difference was, the security here was top notch - to the point of unbelievable. But, it was not like this when the bar just opened.</br>
</br>
Alcohol was a lucrative industry regardless of the geographic location. The existence of Fake Leg Bar, without a doubt, ended the reign of bars on the entire street. When people tried the beer with the sweet wheat aroma, no one would be interested in the stuff made with industrial alcohol. Even the wealthy in the inner circle would occasional drop by to have a drink or two.</br>
</br>
The high profitability naturally drew the jealousy of competitors. When threatening didn't work, the owner of each bar used all kinds of despicable techniques.</br>
</br>
Fights, theft, even blackmail.</br>
</br>
But those who used these techniques obviously underestimated Zhou Guoping's ability. His profession was a bandit. In terms of despicable techniques, he was the master of all.</br>
</br>
Bribery, assassination, and vandalism.</br>
</br>
After chopping down six dirty overreaching hands consecutively, the people looking for trouble finally became cautiously. Immediately, he spread out a rumor that the boss of the store had a special connection with the Group of Ten council members. After hearing the news, people were still hesitating if they should take the risk and finally give up the ill- intentions in their mind. They wondered if they should just accept the fact that Fake Leg Bar dominated the market.</br>
</br>
Other than great security, the design of the bar was also customer friendly. The second and third floor were renovated into rooms, providing privacy for the males and females that needed their own space and to provide the wary survivors a place to release their deep level of stress.</br>
</br>
Like usual, Zhou Guoping wore a grey suit. He casually sat at a wooden table as he chatted with the mercenaries that wandered the wasteland. The talkative boss garnered the friendliness from the mercenaries. Even his blad head became a bright spot for this bar.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just like the grandpa in KFC.</br>
</br>
As to why. It was because if someone talked about something interesting, he would put out a tab that drinks would be on the house.</br>
</br>
"And at the northern area of city center, guess what I saw? I saw a Mother of Death Claw! Dammit, I thought it was just a nuclear crater, so I wanted to see if there was anything worthy inside."</br>
</br>
"Ok, buddy, Mother of Death Claw would only return to nuclear crater when they give birth. In the winter, they would usually hide in a cave, you are bullshi*ting too much." A middle-aged man smiled, he took the cigar out of this mouth, shook it in the dust tray. His face had a frightening scar that stretched from his left eye to the right tip of his mouth. Because of this scar, his smile looked daunting.</br>
</br>
"If the one-eyed Lev said that, then it must be."</br>
</br>
"That's right, buddy, the scar on this old fellow's face was left by the Mother of Death Claw."</br>
</br>
The young man turned red. He took a big gulp of the beer to disguise the embarrassment.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping looked at the chatting mercenaries with a smile. But he was planning in this mind as to when he should speak, and who he should hire.</br>
</br>
The young man should be new to the scene, at least he didn't look like he was in the profession before. As to the Slavic middle-aged man, he must be a character. It was rumored that he was a fighter jet pilot for CCCP. He didn't get sent back after the war. Instead, he was taken to Wanghai City as the special experiment test subject. When the apocalypse happened, he used his impeccable skills to escape from the lab before he started to wander on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
But Zhou Guoping didn't plant to hire him. Regardless of how powerful he was, he was only a lone traveler. The boss' instruction was that he needed a lot of people, a team at least the size of 50 people.</br>
</br>
It was difficult, especially in the environment where everyone was plotting for the city center.</br>
</br>
But the boss's order is absolute, Zhou Guoping's eyes continually glanced at the door. He was waiting for a person to show up.</br>
</br>
The oak door was pushed open as a gust of cold wind mixed with ice shards blew inside.</br>
</br>
The man drinking beside the door shivered because of the wind. Just as he was about the curse at the person who opened the door, he saw the person's face clearly and the swear that was about to burst out of him was swallowed down.</br>
</br>
Buzzcut, grey winter suit, he looked rather ordinary. When he stepped into the bar, he was not rowdy like most people. Instead, he sat at the counter with a low profile and ordered a beer.</br>
</br>
But when Zhuo Guoping saw the person, his eyes immediately lit up and walked over with a smile.</br>
</br>
It was Luo Yang, the leader of the Black Blood Mercenaries. Although he had an ordinary face, he possessed an ability that is not to be underestimated by anyone. On top of that, he had the abilities of the 70 warriors who fight for him.</br>
</br>
"How's the reward today?" Zhou Guoping sat beside him and used a casual tone to chat with him.</br>
</br>
"Terrible, other than snow, there was blood. The northern part of the city center has been completely explored. A zombie nest was even cleared out and there were no signs of the satellite wreckage at all." Luo Yang took a sip of his drink as he warily rubbed his head.</br>
</br>
"Nothing at all?"</br>
</br>
"Basically, only when you enter the city center would you start to have some respect for the dumb zombies. It was so dense, and you couldn't see the end. Our truck mulled through the crowd and fired fiercely into the herds of zombies. Even then, we were almost stuck there twice."</br>
</br>
"Have an open mind, buddy. Since that is the world of zombies, even Death Claw would have to avoid there." Zhuo Guoping comforted him as he took out a pack of cigarette and handed one to him.</br>
</br>
Luo Yang let out a sigh and lit one for himself.</br>
</br>
"Has there been any good missions recently?"</br>
</br>
"You give up on the 'one million reward' mission?" Zhuo Guoping cracked a smile.</br>
</br>
"I can't use my brothers' life to take the risk. I have a feeling that it would be a pit without a bottom. It can't be filled regardless of how many lives were shed." When he heard one million crystals, greed radiated through Luo Yang's eyes, but it was quickly replaced by a grave concern.</br>
</br>
Compared to his colleagues that dove into city center like flies, he maintained some rationality.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk about something happy. I happen to have a mission."</br>
</br>
"How much money?" He took a sip as Luo Yang said quite curiously.</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand crystals."</br>
</br>
"What!" Luo Yang spat the beer out. He looked at Zhuo Guoping with eyes widened, "Ten thousand? Are you sure?"</br>
</br>
"I am certain." Zhou Guoping nodded his head with eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"What's the mission ?" Luo Yang wiped his mouth as he said cautiously.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard the Fishbone base?" Zhuo Guoping said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"I have heard a thing or two. An external force's base stationed in Wanghai City with quite a powerful force."</br>
</br>
Because the trades with Zhao Corporation were conducted secretly, Zhou Guoping didn't reveal the boss behind this bar. So, to the outside, the Fishbone base was a mystery. Most of the people only knew that there was a base in Qingpu, but even the exact location was unknown.</br>
</br>
As to why it was obvious, there were a countless number of survivor camps on the wasteland, but most were unfriendly. For example, the Huizhong Mercenaries were already wiped out.</br>
</br>
"The hirer is their boss. As for the mission, it is on here."</br>
</br>
As he spoke, Zhou Guoping took out a sheet of paper and put it on the counter.</br>
</br>
After wavering for a moment, Luo Yang picked up the contract. He scanned the paper and his expression turned more and more stern.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible! What kind of joke is this? Stopping the mutated humans from Seventh area at Taifu river... This is asking my men to die."</br>
</br>
"Is that the case? If you think that way, then it is okay, although I personally think it is a pity to give it up." Zhou Guoping sighed, pretending to feel pitiful as he took back the contract.</br>
</br>
"I don't see where the pity is coming from. You have to have your life to spend money." Luo Yang laughed.</br>
</br>
"Do you think the Fishbone base will lose ?" Zhou Guoping asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Based on what I know, there are three thousand something mutated humans at the Seventh area, although they might not be the smartest, they are natural warriors." Luo Yang said. "Even if they only bring half of the people, it would be at least fifteen hundred people. A soldier discrepancy of more than ten times, only a dumbas*s would accept this mission. Mutated humans would squash them like ants."</br>
</br>
Luo Yang took a big chug as he shook his head in disappointment.</br>
</br>
He obviously was not disappointed at the fate of the Fishbone base, but rather he was sad over the ten thousand crystals that slipped away before his own eyes.</br>
</br>
"But based on my information, the Fishbone base has quite a powerful force, such as heavy firearms." Zhou Guoping smiled.</br>
</br>
"Heavy firearms? Haha." Luo Yang scorned, he didn't agree.</br>
</br>
He knew a few tactics of mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans occupying the steel factory at the Seventh area used steel almost lavishly. With their pure muscle strength, they could carry the thick C-Grade steel armor to take charge, it was a nightmare for all light infantries.</br>
</br>
Heavy firearms? Okay, it was effective. But when all the mutated humans spread out and charge over the wide frozen river, how many shots would the cannons manage to fire? Once the mutated humans pass through the line of defense, no firearms would be useful and the subsequent battle will likely become a one-sided slaughter.</br>
</br>
"As for the exact fighting tactics, as the middleman, I am not sure. But in your opinion, if they have an external force, without a certain confidence in victory, would they fight to the death for Qingpu?"</br>
</br>
"Regardless if they have confidence or not, for us, the risk is too high." Luo Yang shook his head.</br>
</br>
"But risk and reward is proportional, isn't that right? Or you wouldn't be taking your men into the city center."</br>
</br>
Luo Yang's expression was rather awkward when he heard those words.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Zhuo Guoping paused and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"I have a piece of information here, are you interested?"</br>
</br>
Luo Yang saw the mysteriousness of Zhuo Guoping and his expression turned serious, waiting for him to finish.</br>
</br>
"Other than this ten thousand crystals, there is also another perk. I can release the information to you, but do understand that it is against the rules. For the sake of my business, I hope you can keep this a secret."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, Mr. Zhou, you know me very well."</br>
</br>
"Of course, this is why I found you for this mission. 10% of the profit of a trade route between Qingpu and Liuding Town, the type of trade is food."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 197: Gathering a force</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping brought a good news from the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Black Blood Mercenaries accepted the mission and mobilized to Taifu river the next day. In addition to the new recruits, a mercenary group of 85 people on the wasteland could be considered a sizable force.</br>
</br>
When Zhou Guoping threw a bait of 10% food trade profit, Luo Yang agreed without the slightest hesitation.</br>
</br>
The popularity of the food industry in Sixth Street was proven to be a lucrative business. And because of this, Zhao Corporation controlling the entire market had crystals flooding in, and everyone in Sixth Street was well aware of this.</br>
</br>
Hearing Zhou Guoping's words and considering the relationship between the Fishbone Base and Zhao Corporation, it finally dawned on Luo Yang. The food in the Sixth Street actually came from the Fishbone Base! Presumably, Zhao Chenwu, that old fox, was controlling the underground sewerage entrance which must be leading to the Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
But Luo Yang didn't spread the shocking piece of news out since the less the number of people knew, the more advantageous it would be for him. If he could manage to get a slice of the pie of the trade route to Liuding Town, he would accept the mission at whatever cost! With Black Blood Mercenaries' reputation, there wouldn't be a problem in transporting the goods from Qingpu to Liuding Town situated at the exit of the Yangtze River.</br>
</br>
With a stable source of income, Black Blood Mercenaries' equipment and size would expand and improve, and his prestige would consequently heighten. If he could manage to become a council member, he would be able to join the ranks of the inner circle of the powerful!</br>
</br>
Despite having accepted the mission, there was one point he was confused about.</br>
</br>
Since Fishbone Base had a special relationship with Zhao Corporation, why didn't they request help from them? To protect his own interest, Zhao Chenwu would do anything to help, wouldn't he?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had obviously considered this problem.</br>
</br>
It's just that...</br>
</br>
"How did you get in trouble again?" Sitting in the virtual boardroom, Zhao Chenwu smiled wryly.</br>
</br>
"Trouble finds me," Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Sixth Street is not too peaceful these days. I really can't send out some forces to face the mutated humans from the Seventh area. Maybe you should consider relocating?" Zhao Chenwu pondered for a moment before proposing.</br>
</br>
"Relocate? That means all my efforts would have gone to waste. I have spent almost 400 thousands crystals for the construction of the base. At any rate, I won't give up on the base especially since my odds of winning are not low."</br>
</br>
"Then I'll pray for your victory. The batch of sentinel machine guns, I'm finally able to fulfill the contract under the pressure of the council, and I can deliver it to you tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"Pressure from the higher-ups? When did the council start encouraging a breach of contract?" Jiang Chen jested.</br>
</br>
</br>
"It is a critical time."</br>
</br>
"What kind of trouble did you guys encounter?" Seeing the graveness on Zhao Chenwu's face, Jiang Chen also became serious.</br>
</br>
"Although it is considered a secret, if it was like anytime before, the news would spread out regardless. The military government controlling Northern Alliance District has declared war on us, and they are currently on their way."</br>
</br>
"It's them?"</br>
</br>
"Have you heard already?" Seeing the shock on Jiang Chen's face, Zhao Chenwu shrugged, 'In order to obtain the space-based weapon wreckage landed somewhere in the metropolis, they came from thousands of miles away to incite trouble."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu obviously misinterpreted something. The reason why Jiang Chen got shocked was that the organization that partnered up with the mutated humans was also from the Northern Alliance District. Except it was not the military government but a rather strange organization with an even peculiar name—the Dusk Church.</br>
</br>
"The God's Cane?' Jiang Chen asked solemnly.</br>
</br>
"That's right. To defend against Northern Alliance's invasion, the Group of Ten council passed a proposal. To create a defense line at the rural area to defend against the invasion. But if it was just this, it wouldn't be so problematic."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu's face was cast in gloom, he paused before continuing, "Although we agreed to fight off the enemy before hunting for the treasure, almost everyone has already been secretly sending in exploration teams into the metropolis. Especially when the news of 1 million crystals mission has spread out, everyone has gone insane. Those fools, who were previously reserved and heading out secretly, are now blatantly sending out their forces and rushing downtown. Just like those gamblers who had completely lost their mind on a gambling table."</br>
</br>
"No one has realized that doing this at this time is foolish?" Jiang Chen had no other emotion except for derision.</br>
</br>
"Not everyone is foolish and that includes me," Zhao Chenwu bleak expression stared at the table, "If anyone obtains that thing, it would be a nightmare for everyone else. If could dominate all life and death, just like a scepter from God."</br>
</br>
Saying this, the ruthless businessman had a hint of insanity between his brows.</br>
</br>
"Just imagine this: if there is a sword hanging over everyone's head, who else can resist your reign? It only takes one shot from that tungsten rod that can't be intercepted to silent all voice of resistance. And that sword is now somewhere in the city center, behind all of us. Now...everyone wants to become a person wielding the sword."</br>
</br>
"This damned democracy."</br>
</br>
Everyone wanted to become the dictator.</br>
</br>
If there was only a single voice from the beginning, it wouldn't be this chaotic.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Asking help from Zhao Chenwu was not possible anymore, but that was to be expected.</br>
</br>
He already had enough chips in his hands, without one or two guests, it wouldn't interfere with the fireworks.</br>
</br>
Counting in the Black Blood Mercenaries, the total number of soldiers that could fight on the frontline had already reached 200 people. Although there was still a huge discrepancy, he still had his last resort.</br>
</br>
That was none other than the survivors from Qingpu!</br>
</br>
After the last expedition, they had been unified under the Fishbone Base banner. After a month of doing business, the relationship between the two parties was further strengthened.</br>
</br>
Since the beginning, Jiang Chen had always include them in the plan, and he was just waiting for an opportunity.</br>
</br>
The opportunity to unite everyone, the opportunity to display the might of Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
And now, the opportunity had presented itself.</br>
</br>
Outside of the Fishbone Base, in front of the concrete building used for trading goods, a long lineup could be seen.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see, Zhao Gang." Ma Zhongchen hugged his old friend whom he hadn't seen for a while as he regarded the winter garment on Zhao Gang enviously. The whole set would probably cost 30-40 crystals which would be equivalent to the price of a Reaper rifle.</br>
</br>
Despite Zhao Gang's usual taciturn behavior, when he saw his old friend, a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen called Chen Weiguo back yesterday and was once again sent to the frontline.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang pulled Ma Zhongchen to the side. He passed him a cigarette while he also put one in his own mouth and then lit it up.</br>
</br>
"How are you doing these days?"</br>
</br>
"Same old. Nice smell, what brand is this?"</br>
</br>
"The base's own produce." The boss brought it back as part of the benefits for employees. As for its exact origin, Zhao Gang couldn't be bothered about it.</br>
</br>
"The winter is so cold and you guys are quite well off," Ma Zhongchen remarked as he enviously eyed the large-caliber machine gun on the wall.</br>
</br>
"It should be us, shouldn't it?"</br>
</br>
The two stared at each other and started laughing.</br>
</br>
The line in front of the concrete building moved up slowly. People coming out of the room had switched into the winter gear as they entered the base under the supervision of the soldiers.</br>
</br>
According to the agreement, all the survivors joining the Fishbone army would receive housing and upper-class citizen treatment, and their family would receive lower-citizen treatment. Ater contributing in war and being promoted to knight, their family would also enjoy upper-class citizen treatment.</br>
</br>
As of today, more than 20 community-sized survivors have joined Fishbone Base. All the people were incorporated into a newly created foreign army with Zhao Gang as the commander. Currently, there were only 81 people in the force, but everyone was a sharpshooter.</br>
</br>
With a bit of training, they could become a force to be reckoned with.</br>
</br>
So far, the Fishbone Base's soldiers had exceeded the 300 mark.</br>
</br>
The day of the decisive battle was gradually approaching.</br>

The God's Cane was formerly known as God's Cane Space-based Kinetic Energy Weapon System. NATO completed the deployment of the weapon system in 2030, but now its combat ability was no longer limited to kinetic energy attack.</br>
</br>
Over the past hundred years, NATO had continuously perfected this weapon system. Although its core attack was still a vertical strike by tungsten rod bombs, in addition to that, NATO had also added high power microwave weapon (HPM), wide-area electromagnetic pulse (EMP), as well as particle shields aboard the weapon system. NATO completely transformed it into a hedgehog-like existence—a near-Earth orbit weapon platform.</br>
</br>
Though Jiang Chen had already experienced the power of this weapon, after listening to Lin Lin's explanation, he still got astonished.</br>
</br>
Seeing the shock on Jiang Chen's face, Lin Lin haughtily raised her head and paused before continuing, "That is a really powerful weapon. It is believed that to destroy it, PAC launched 27 nuclear missiles to the low Earth orbit, but they were all unfortunately intercepted. Finally, while the God's Cane's HMP was on cooldown after it had just attacked the Holy Shield system, relying on the aerospace special force's attack at ten crystals cost near-Earth orbit landers, they finally managed to capture it."</br>
</br>
However, before they even had the opportunity to hold the "cane", NATO had initiated the "God's Cane's" self-destruction program in the hope of destroying it and preventing it from falling into the enemy's hands. So the superweapon that was in the service for over 150 years had turned into a space junk.</br>
</br>
No one knew this weapon better than Lin Lin. After all, she was a former PAC researcher, so she more or less understood the specifics of the weapon.</br>
</br>
"Wait, space debris?"</br>
</br>
"Yeah, is there any problem?" Lin Lin asked, tilting her head.</br>
</br>
"Didn't God's Cane fall onto the Earth's surface?" Jiang Chen asked with a frown.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, I can attest to that. The post-war World Alliance Organization had considered recovering the remains at the near-Earth orbit, but the proposal was not implemented because shortly after, the implementation of space colonization plan was passed with a landslide victory. You know what happened next—six colony ships were sent to the deep space."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen said thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
"Why the sudden interest?" Lin Lin was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"What if someone used a supercomputer to determine that the remains of God's Cane fell into the downtown of Wanghai City?"</br>
</br>
"That's impossible. You've been duped," Lin Lin unceremoniously denied.</br>
</br>
[Did I get fooled?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
Or did everyone get fooled?</br>
</br>
This was troublesome.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Inside an ancient room, a tripod incense burner stood on top of a table, smoke floated on top of it. A man with grey sideburns leaned against a recliner, his eyes were closed, and he appeared to be taking a nap. Next to him was a woman dressed in cheongsam, and though her face could not be considered gorgeous, she certainly looked graceful.</br>
</br>
</br>
The old-fashioned visage obviously didn't match the high-rise buildings outside the window.</br>
</br>
To be able to build such a large manor in such a ritzy area of Sixth Street, this person must possess an immense amount of power.</br>
</br>
Indeed, the man on the chair was Cao Jinsong, the owner of Crimson Chamber of Commerce and the head of the Group of Ten council.</br>
</br>
There was a knock at the door, and the man slighly opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Come in." His voice was slow and gentle but without a trace of his old age.</br>
</br>
The door slowly opened, and a woman walked in.</br>
</br>
The face was identical to the cheongsam beauty standing beside him.</br>
</br>
Almost as if they were cut out from the exact same mold.</br>
</br>
Other than being twins, there was only one explanation to this: they were clones.</br>
</br>
"Nine members of the council have sent large-scale forces to the metropolis. Among them, the Double-headed Bull Chamber of Commerce was the largest with a total of 207 people, two spider tanks, and five armored vehicles..."</br>
</br>
Hearing his secretary's report, Cao Jinsong's eyes narrowed while nodding.</br>
</br>
When she finished, he briefly pondered for a moment before asking, "What about that Zhao Chenwu? Did he do anything?"</br>
</br>
That person was slightly shrewder compared to the other council members, and his sight was not blinded by the dazzling brilliance of the crystals.</br>
</br>
"He deployed scouts to Luzhou, and also sent a team to the city center, but their teams did not advance and just lagged behind our team," the secretary reported as she pushed her eyeglasses up.</br>
</br>
Cao Jinsong suddenly laughed. The wrinkles that had been etched on his face through the passage of time blossomed and transformed him into a kind, old man.</br>
</br>
The laughter, however, carried a few strands of menace.</br>
</br>
"Although everyone wants to be the person wielding that sword, it would be interesting if that sword didn't exist in the first place."</br>
</br>
Conclusive evidence and foreign spying. Just these two points alone seemed to be enough evidence to prove the existence of God's Cane.</br>
</br>
"Is it that time already?" Cao Jinsong looked at the smoke above the incense burner and smiled.</br>
</br>
The expressionless secretary just quietly looked at him, without saying a word.</br>
</br>
"Bring that thing over."</br>
</br>
"It has already been prepared." A trace of a smile appeared on the female secretary's face. She took out the holographic computer pen from her pocket and handed it to him.</br>
</br>
He took the holographic computer pen, but his forefinger stopped at the start button.</br>
</br>
On the metal surface, two faces were reflected: one old and the other young.</br>
</br>
The young face belonged to his wife. She was so frail that she couldn't get through the first year. Before she passed away, he promised her that he would bring order to this chaotic wasteland.</br>
</br>
Afterwards, he would join her down there.</br>
</br>
After the collapse of all civilizations, a new civilization would be reborn from the ashes. The new civilization would be powerful as ever and rise from the Phoenix fire. It would learn from the past mistakes of the ruined civilization and abandon any weaknesses from the past civilization.</br>
</br>
In this radiation-filled wasteland, not only the mutant's claws and human's marksmanship evolved, but also things of a higher level had also evolved.</br>
</br>
Thirteen years ago, the walls of Sixth Street were built. The gathering place built by the survivors of the settlement gave birth to the seed of civilization.</br>
</br>
However, this seed had been dormant for far too long.</br>
</br>
Even though the expedition brought prosperity to it, it was only a basic level of prosperity.</br>
</br>
When it came to one's own interest, the council would engage into endless squabbles.</br>
</br>
Without a unified voice, nothing would come out of it.</br>
</br>
He had enough of these endless disputes.</br>
</br>
The people from Northern Alliance District would perhaps come but definitely not at this time. What they wanted was definitely not the God's Cane but something entirely different.</br>
</br>
Ten years ago, the unification of the Northern Alliance was completed.</br>
</br>
If this continued, Sixth Street would no longer be its match. It would become a mere speck in the history. But everything here was the fruit of his hard labor, and he couldn't bear to end like this.</br>
</br>
This piece of land needs a dictatorship!</br>
</br>
"Hero or criminal, only history will tell," muttering to himself, Cao Jinsong closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at the Secretary in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Qin Lian, could you lend me some courage?"</br>
</br>
The woman didn't say anything and merely put her hand on his. The woman in cheongsam standing beside him also came over and held out her hand.</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, a crazed expression returned to his face.</br>
</br>
"Then let's begin."</br>
</br>
He pressed the button.</br>
</br>
A fire started burning and the manor of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce in the Sixth Street was completely incinerated.</br>
</br>
Rumor had it that it was the conspiracy of Zhao Corporation plotting for "the treasure".</br>
</br>
At the same time, another fire broke out in the center of the city dozens of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
It was the fire of civil war.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 199: Civil War</br>
</div></br>
"What do you think is the boss planning?" A soldier wielding a rifle and clad in carbon nanotube armor walked at the forefront of the troops.</br>
</br>
"I don't know." The commander next to him was silent. The tactical helmet hid the expression on his face, but the way he was looking around betrayed the anxiousness in his heart.</br>
</br>
They were Zhao Corporations's private soldiers.</br>
</br>
Two Spider tanks, five armored vehicles, four modified trucks, 20 power armors and 120 soldiers.</br>
</br>
80% of their fighting force had been placed on the gambling table.</br>
</br>
There were only five kilometers left before they reached the metropolis. The area was filled with nuclear craters, a place not even the Death Claws would dare to enter.</br>
</br>
The order that Zhao Chenwu had issued was very vague—follow the troops of Crimson Chamber of Commerce wait for further orders.</br>
</br>
Just simply follow?</br>
</br>
The two sentries in the front row weren't the only ones who were anxious, but also the squad leader, Chen Wei, sitting in the armored vehicle looked grave.</br>
</br>
Staring at the screen of the Wanderer tanks, Chen Wei swallowed.</br>
</br>
10-meter long, 3.8-meter wide, and 2.6-meter tall, weighed 112 tons, and could accommodate 3-4 passengers. Its main weapon was the 52-type particle cannon and a 2kg-class electromagnetic pulse cannon as coaxial guns. Its whole body was covered with 140mm thick A-grade steel armor with a built-in high-density supramolecular compartment that could withstand high-energy neutron radiation caused by a neutron bomb explosion, while the particle shield could effectively resist energy weapons attacks.</br>
</br>
It was practically a moving fortress.</br>
</br>
A wave of zombies advanced, but under the giant's oppression, the only thing the zombies could do was to provide lubrication for its track with its flesh and fat.</br>
</br>
The thick primary cannon was covered in snow and had never fired a single shot the moment it left the base. The 2kg-class electromagnetic pulse cannon also appeared very dormant and would only occasionally fire whenever it encountered a Roshan.</br>
</br>
Under the power and influence of this metallic monster, even in the danger-filled metropolis, these two forces couldn't provide much resistance.</br>
</br>
"They stopped," the sentry from the front row casually said.</br>
</br>
"It's probably their time to rest."</br>
</br>
Because the zombies in the forefront had already been cleared out by the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, they didn't even need to fire, so they could casually chat among themselves.</br>
</br>
The expression under the sentry's tactical helmet gradually turned to that of horror.</br>
</br>
"No, this is odd—there's something wrong with their cannon."</br>
</br>
VROOM!</br>
</br>
The sound of a cannon firing drowned his astonished voice.</br>
</br>
The 2kg bomb easily separated his flesh and ripped through the roof of the armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
</br>
"We're under attack by our allied force! Dammit, what do they think they're doing!"</br>
</br>
"Take cover! Go take cover in the bunker, quick!"</br>
</br>
"Attention everyone! That is not a friendly force, I repeat, that is not a friendly force," Chen Wei's voice began to echo in everyone's communication channel. The forces in the forefront, who were taking cover, immediately began to fire back.</br>
</br>
The aerodynamic Spider tank slid around on the main road. Six sets of weight-bearing wheels were separated in the middle to form into four square-shaped mechanical legs as they quickly began to climb on top of the half-destroyed buildings. The remaining four armored vehicles along with modified trucks also promptly turned around the corner, using the terrain to avoid the barrel of the Wanderer's tank. Whereas the infantries in the area searched for shelter while taking out their rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers and begun firing back.</br>
</br>
Because Chen Wei sensed something was amiss from the start, he ordered the team to form a long formation. Although it was much easier to defend against zombies in a square formation, if an enemy attack at the front, the long formation would allow the force in the back to quickly disperse and minimize the loss.</br>
</br>
"Have they found the remains of the satellite yet?" Chen Wei struck at the armor shell as he stared at the image transmitted from the solider's tactical helmet.</br>
</br>
The reckless movement of the tank completely ignored the rocket launchers flying towards it.</br>
</br>
Even if he had two Spider tanks as backups, he still didn't have the confidence to win.</br>
</br>
&lt;Permission to fire back.&gt;</br>
</br>
Four big yellow characters appeared in the center of the screen and a rueful smile appeared on Chen Wei's face.</br>
</br>
They already started to retaliate.</br>
</br>
Although he was counting on the boss to stop the war through diplomacy, it now seemed like they have to fight through it.</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Two rounds of shell were fired at a 50 degrees angle from the roof of a half-destroyed building, with an orange flame trail, it smashed onto the Wanderer tank's turret before it got deflected into the window of an abandoned shop.</br>
</br>
"The shell was deflected!"</br>
</br>
The eerie blue electric arc had enveloped the shell of the tank but didn't even leave a dent.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! That's an electromagnetic reactive armor!"</br>
</br>
Specially designed against piercing shells, through a unique interaction field, the metal shell could reach superconducting state after breaking through a certain speed threshold. Under the powerful magnetic field outside the armor, according to the Meissner effect, shells that had become superconductors would produce an enormous magnetic field in the opposite direction, thereby attenuating its kinetic energy and shifting the projectile angle.</br>
</br>
This armor had a miraculous use against the conductive material of the electromagnetic cannon shells. It also had certain effects on the artillery steel core armor-piercing shells.</br>
</br>
"Change into insulation shells."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The Wanderer tank quickly retreated, and because of the angle limitation of the cannon, it could only aim at the Spider tank on the roof with an increasing distance.</br>
</br>
However, the Spider tanks occupying a favorable terrain wouldn't allow its plan to succeed. So while on the move, they fired at the metal monster on the road.</br>
</br>
Zombies, Crimson Chamber of Commerce, and Zhao Corporation.</br>
</br>
These three giants engaged with each other.</br>
</br>
With the heavy armors leaving the battle, the zombies that weren't blocked lunged at the two parties exchanging fire while howling and screaming.</br>
</br>
If they were just fighting with the zombies alone, these well-trained soldiers would definitely not let these dumb things get closer. Today, however, everyone was not just facing the threat of zombies, but the enemy's bullets as well.</br>
</br>
Everything devolved into an utter chaos.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, their firepower is too suppressive! We need backup!" Leaning against the side of the bunker, while shooting at the incoming zombies, the soldiers in carbon nanotube combat suits roared at the communication device they're clutching.</br>
</br>
"Someone's down, medics!"</br>
</br>
"Dammit, it's the Death Claw! Ahhh—"</br>
</br>
"Zombies had broken through the line of defense! Requesting armored vehicle support!"</br>
</br>
"Negative. The enemies' anti-armor units have yet to be cleared. Unable to enter the battle—"</br>
</br>
Turning off the noisy communication channel, Chen Wei rubbed his forehead. A ferocious glint appeared on his face and his eyes were locked on the several big characters on the screen.</br>
</br>
&lt;Available support: Disaster-32 Cruise Missile&gt;</br>
</br>
Just now, he finally understood the meaning of the phrase: "caution" that Zhao Chenwu left before leaving.</br>
</br>
From the start, the boss had already suspected that Crimson Chamber of Commerce had gone rogue.</br>
</br>
This type of limited superweapons was definitely not used in dealing with the zombies.</br>
</br>
If Crimson Chamber of Commerce's trump card was the Wanderer tank, then the trump card of Zhao Corporation was this. The bombs sold to Fishbone Base were only old technology, while the more powerful weapons have always been kept under Zhao Chenwu's control.</br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, Chen Wei pressed the &lt;launch&gt; button.</br>
</br>
Without a warning.</br>
</br>
On a barren field 100 kilometers away, the flat ground was suddenly split open. After the item used to camouflage was removed, the metal plate hidden under the layer of the soil was gradually separated.</br>
</br>
This was the missile well left by PAC. To escape air raids, this improvised one-time use missile silo was common on this piece of land.</br>
</br>
The light blue signal light extended from the top to the bottom of the silo.</br>
</br>
"Missile silo 72 is about to fire. Workers, please take shelter immediately."</br>
</br>
The electronic voice announcing its launch had scared the mutant mice that were biting the roots of plants away.</br>
</br>
In a flash, the smoke burst and instantly covered the whole area.</br>
</br>
The 10-meter long missile pierced through the sky filled with radiation dust.</br>
</br>
"Ten seconds before arriving at the target location. Commander, please set the target."</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Chen Wei's eyes tightly locked on the rampaging Wanderer tanks. Using his finger, he dragged the crosshair onto the red box.</br>
</br>
&lt;Target lock successful.&gt;</br>
</br>
"Attention! Attack A, Attack B, immediately move away from the target area."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
After receiving the command, the Spider tanks quickly jumped off the building, the six pairs of weight-bearing wheels formed together reverting back to driving mode.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the enemy units suddenly retreated, the Wanderer tank realizing that it might have been targeted by long-range weapons immediately fired heat-induced bait bombs and electromagnetic decoy targets. It then shifted into overdrive and crashed into the side of the building.</br>
</br>
The solid concrete wall disintegrated like a piece of paper under the impact, as it attempted to use the 10-meter tall building as cover.</br>
</br>
But it was too late.</br>
</br>
A trail of grey smoke instantly fell from the sky.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, everything dimmed down.</br>
</br>
The arc-shaped flames instantly ignited. The shockwave didn't just blow away the concrete blocks and scattered the particles shield away, but also the armor shell as well.</br>
</br>
The buildings that survived the aftershock of the nuclear blast had collapsed due to the direct impact of the cruise missile. The Disaster-32 cruise missile was designed based on a fictitious aircraft carrier, so taking care a tank was definitely no big deal.</br>
</br>
Even those from thousands of meters away felt the tremor of the ground.</br>
</br>
The flames on the horizon made the thick snow lose its color and deafened the continuous gun firing shots.</br>
</br>
The tide of war was instantly reversed.</br>
</br>
The Crimson Chamber of Commerce that just lost its strongest armored unit was immediately under heavy fire suppression by the two Spider tanks. Aside from the Wanderer tanks, they didn't bring more armored units, only thirty infantries and dozens of powered armors.</br>
</br>
Seeing that his own soldiers had the upper hand, Chen Wei slowly let out a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
Zhao Corporation had already won the battle.</br>
</br>
Although the price was expensive.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street Council was probably making a ruckus at this moment, but it was something not for him to worry about.</br>
</br>
Gunshots were getting sparse, the soldiers of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce fought valiantly, preparing to fight to the bitter end.</br>
</br>
But this still could not change the outcome of their defeat.</br>
</br>
"Enemy units have been cleared." Hearing the communication by his ear, Chen Wei was relieved.</br>
</br>
"Regroup. Set up a blockade to block the zombies, recuperate, and prepare to head back."</br>
</br>
"What is that!"</br>
</br>
"God!"</br>
</br>
Two soldiers opened the trunk of the captured armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
Staring at the screen, Chen Wei's pupil contracted.</br>
</br>
Nuclear bomb!</br>
</br>
Staring at the distant mushroom cloud, Cao Jinsong's face flashed a touch of mockery.</br>
</br>
At the moment, he was standing on a barren land a few kilometers away from the wilderness, and there was a pickup truck parked next to him.</br>
</br>
"Sheesh, you've finally used Disaster-32?"</br>
</br>
He shoved the binoculars in his pocket, shook his head, and returned to the truck.</br>
</br>
Whether or not the sword of Damocles exists, the sword hanging above his head had disappeared.</br>
</br>
The price of a Wanderer tank in exchange for the trump card that scared the living daylight out of him. A nuclear missile and 72 lives in exchange for 80% of Zhao Chenwu's force.</br>
</br>
And Wanderer tanks, he still had four of these left.</br>
</br>
If it had been a poker game, then the outcome of the battle had already been decided?</br>

</br>
"Did you hear the noise?" Sun Jiao raised her eyebrows as she asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The snow was thick, as the two were standing on the bank of Taifu river.</br>
</br>
"I think so, did something explode?" Jiang Chen stared towards the east, but the flurry blocked his vision.</br>
</br>
There were two explosions; it was hard to tell which one was louder. It seemed to be from somewhere in the far distance.</br>
</br>
"Let's not be distracted anymore." Sun Jiao sighed, her eyes narrowing while starring across the river. "The party is about to start."</br>
</br>
"You are right." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
All combat units have been sent to the front line.</br>
</br>
271 soldiers, 8 Tigers, as well as 15 modified pickup trucks.</br>
</br>
The Black Blood Mercenaries have already sneaked past the river as they had taken cover on a snow hill a few kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Everything was prepared.</br>
</br>
He dragged the scarf away from his neck as white mist emerged from Jiang Chen's mouth.</br>
</br>
"Let's start."</br>
</br>
"Understood! My commander." Sun Jiao naughtily blinked her eyes before she turned around to step into the T-3 power armor.</br>
</br>
The night began to fall as the snowfall slowed.</br>
</br>
The searchlight in the center of the camp, as well as the four corners, shook rhythmically and lit up the snow hills around them.</br>
</br>
Rows of mutated humans carried rifles as they patrolled their camp. Their steel armor, lined with fur, prevented their skin from being in direct contact with the steel.</br>
</br>
There were around fifty trucks parked on the empty lot in front of the camp. The daunting gun and cannon barrels create a metal forest. White sheets covered them as they blended into the snow.</br>
</br>
They didn't even consider the enemy across the river an opponent.</br>
</br>
In their eyes, only a round of attack would allow them to drag those cowards out of the trenches and shred them into pieces.</br>
</br>
Shooting was not their strong suit.</br>
</br>
Because of their fat finger, to make it easy to shoot, they had to saw off the trigger ring. This was also why they preferred machine guns as most machine guns were not as small as rifles.</br>
</br>
Due to their build, they didn't need to consider the large, heavy firepower and weight of the guns.</br>
</br>
The last group of soldiers had arrived at the base. Once the ice is strong enough to withstand the weight of their armor, they would sound the horn to charge.</br>
</br>
But that day will never happen.</br>
</br>
"Did you hear something?" The mutated human at the gate of the base tilted his head and looked at his comrade.</br>
</br>
The mutated human raised his eyebrows but didn't seem to find the source of the noise.</br>
</br>
"Look! What is that!"</br>
</br>
There were screams, and a mutated human pointed at the dark sky.</br>
</br>
Something had fallen from the radiation dust, it carried a visible trail of flame and began to accelerate.</br>
</br>
</br>
But they didn't have more time to think about it.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
The searchlight in the center of the base and the four corners shattered with the noise. The light that shined on the four sides instantly faded.</br>
</br>
At that moment, a few trails of orange flame rose in the sky and exploded. The blinding white light turned the base into day light.</br>
</br>
It was a lighting shell!</br>
</br>
"Dammit, it's an enemy strike!" The mutated human standing at the gate roared out before he took out the light machine gun behind his back and began to fire at the snow hill.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans didn't expect that the human taking cover behind barriers would attack them during the night.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans were not worried by the human's night strike, rather, they felt a sense of excitement.</br>
</br>
They are asking for their own death!</br>
</br>
But that kind of confidence didn't last long.</br>
</br>
Under the cover of the lighting shell, a missile with a trail of red flame had fallen from the sky.</br>
</br>
In the terrified vision of all mutated humans, it landed in the middle of the base.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Flames instantly erupted.</br>
</br>
It engulfed the vehicles covered by white, the mutated humans preparing to enter the vehicle, as well as the supplies hidden under the snow.</br>
</br>
The merciless chain explosion started. It played a symphony inside the mutated human's base.</br>
</br>
Running, screaming, desperately trying to remove the scorching steel armor, and falling when out of energy as they waited for the flame grim reaper's cultivation.</br>
</br>
The steel debris and snow were blown into the air as they melted into liquid in the heat wave as if it was a firework celebration.</br>
</br>
It was living hell.</br>
</br>
No one suspected the "rats" across the river possessed a cruise missile.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was obviously not a cruise missile. It was only a rocket equipped with 1000 kilograms of concentrated explosives. One kilogram was 20 crystals, and along with the cost of the missile, the mega firework cost Jiang Chen thirty thousand crystals.</br>
</br>
But so what, compared to the effect it caused, the thirty thousand crystals were well spent.</br>
</br>
Gazing at the fire across the river, Jiang Chen pulled out the flare gun, and he shouted at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
"Attack!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The red flare broke through the night sky.</br>
</br>
Eight homing voices rose as the 5 kg bombs smashed into the base across the river.</br>
</br>
The shock of the missile explosion had blown away the snow piles. There was no cover between the two forces. With the range advantage, the electric pulse canon unloaded its firepower.</br>
</br>
The infantry with their rifles stepped out of the trenches, under the leadership of six power armors, they all charged at the opposing river bank.</br>
</br>
The Black Blood Mercenaries, who've crossed the river, engaged in crossfire with the mutated humans already. The rain drop like lighting shells lit up the night sky.</br>
</br>
Because the explosive was made of Magnesium powder and other oxidants, the flames didn't fade away for a long time.</br>
</br>
Under the intense light, the position of the mutated humans was fully exposed. But it was a problem even for the mutated humans with rifles to aim at the target in the dark. They could only respond by firing randomly into darkness.</br>
</br>
Seeing the battle visual on his tablet, a smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
The anti-air power had been completely dissolved. The unexpected missile had not only wiped out half of their force, it completely disrupted their command structure which forced them to fight on their own.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans wielding armors were strong, but only in the front. On an open field, if they were surrounded with bullets flying in all direction, mutated humans without formation would only be slaughtered.</br>
</br>
The infantries fired with pace as they pushed forward under the cover of cannons. Within the virtual reality training system, they have practiced this countless amount of times.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao led the six power armors with their high mobility as they roamed among the mutated humans to prevent them from gathering information.</br>
</br>
Seeing the swiftness of this girl's action, even if she was in a metal box, recalling her shyness under himself, the feeling was indescribable.</br>
</br>
With a face slightly red, Jiang Chen coughed as he got rid of all the unhealthy idea in his mind.</br>
</br>
The battle was approaching its end.</br>
</br>
The soldiers used their gun barrels to smash the half-dead mutated humans as they finished the kill off with a dagger.</br>
</br>
There was no need for hostage. Death was the best fate for these monsters.</br>
</br>
He retracted the tablet as he got in the armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
"Cross the river."</br>
</br>
"Yes, commander."</br>
</br>
As the leader of the base, Jiang Chen began to realize he could no longer fight like a soldier on the front line. Since Fishbone base had already passed the initial growth phase where they lacked people, he gladly accepted the perspective Sun Jiao insisted, which was to stay in the back and wait for the battle to end.</br>
</br>
The gunshots in the distance began to die down. The armored vehicle drove over the bridge.</br>
</br>
The northern wind carried a hint of warmth. Jiang Chen who sat on top of the car looked at the remains of the mutated human's base after the explosion, but his mind had already drifted elsewhere.</br>
</br>
This was where the mutated humans stored most of their supplies. Even if there were still two thousand something mutated humans there, this major loss would render them unable to fight another battle.</br>
</br>
These supplies were transported from the Northern Alliance District fifteen hundred kilometers away; it must not have been easy. Now that these supplies are destroyed, and the spy Sun Xiaorou was captured by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
What would the Dusk that suffered defeat do?</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, the Defender had no action at all, as even Jiang Chen almost forgot that he had an alliance.</br>
</br>
What are they planning?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

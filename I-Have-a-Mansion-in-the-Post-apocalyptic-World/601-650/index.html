</br>
"A budget of 20 billion dollars… Are you planning to build an aircraft carrier?" Xia Shiyu rubbed her temples and said with a slight headache.</br>
</br>
Twenty billion dollars was worth 130 billion RMB! Although Future Group had a lot of money, this was not the way to spend it. And based on what Jiang Chen said, this was the price tag just for the first phase of the project.</br>
</br>
"Why do you relate everything to an aircraft carrier? Even the Nimitz class cost only 4 billion dollars," Jiang Chen sighed and jokingly said.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyebrows jumped. She took a deep breath and calmed her agitated emotions before asking.</br>
</br>
"A budget of five aircraft carriers, can I ask what you are going to do with it?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, since it is nothing worth keeping a secret about," Jiang Chen paused, "I plan to build a city."</br>
</br>
"A city?" Xia Shiyu was dumbfounded, unable to respond to what Jiang Chen was saying.</br>
</br>
'What kind of city would need this much steel, aluminum, and polyethylene…'</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen nodded with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gazed into his eyes before finally letting out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Fine, I will go arrange it after and speak with the finance department. I'll have the document ready for you before the end of the day at the latest; you can give it to me after you sign it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked how easily she agreed.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu saw the shock in his eyes. She lips made a small curvature, but the serious expression didn't change at all.</br>
</br>
"But as the CEO, I still have to remind you. Future Tourism has a great profitability margin right now, but even under the most ideal scenario, it would take five years to recover 10 billion dollars in investment."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen nodded, "but this project is pure tourism, its purpose is not only reflected on the profitability of the income statement. It may seem abstract the way I'm describing it, but once I hand you the project plan and visualization, you should understand my idea."</br>
</br>
"You're the boss; you don't need to explain to me." Xia Shiyu pushed up her glasses with her finger with a smile. "Also, I trust you."</br>
</br>
Because you can always create miracles… the latter half of the sentence was hidden inside her heart.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about this. I think you should find an assistant soon."</br>
</br>
"Aren't you my assistant?" Jiang Chen said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gave him a hard stare, coughed, and calmed down, "let's not make jokes here, be serious."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat up straight waiting for her to continue.</br>
</br>
"With the current expansion speed, my work in decision making will increase, and I will no longer have as much free time as before. Such as document organization, discussing the decisions, and pouring coffee… it is better to leave it to the professional."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu then added.</br>
</br>
</br>
"It is more efficient this way."</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen said sternly.</br>
</br>
The shadows of her bang hid the faint hue on her face, Xia Shiyu stared at the documents around her arm and whispered, "Its okay."</br>
</br>
[You have a conscience after all.]</br>
</br>
After a short silence, Xia Shiyu placed the documents she had been holding on to on Jiang Chen's table.</br>
</br>
"I have a few resumes on the table. These talents have impeccable education and ability and there are people from Harvard, Imperial College. They are extremely interested in working for you. You can see which one you like, and I can arrange the interview for you."</br>
</br>
"Okay, thank you very much." Jiang Chen picked up the documents and start flipping through them.</br>
</br>
It felt the servant was picking out the concubine for the emperor.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head, dispersed the inappropriate ideas from his mind, and started to examine each resume carefully.</br>
</br>
&lt;Wang Xiao, male, 37, Tsinghua University Human Resources Masters, worked as a human resources manager at Huawei before…]</br>
</br>
Just like Xia Shiyu said, these talents were impeccable in both academics and abilities. But after reading through them, he realized something was off.</br>
</br>
It took him a while before he realized what was wrong.</br>
</br>
The resumes were all males?</br>
</br>
The idea that the person pouring him coffee and tending to him would be a guy made Jiang Chen feel unpleasant. Ability was one thing, but at least give him some passion to work.</br>
</br>
Although he understood Xia Shiyu's intention behind this, he was still hurt by this.</br>
</br>
[Where did the trust go? Am I that kind of person? Even if it is a female assistant, even if she looked pleasing to the eyes, I wouldn't do anything okay…]</br>
</br>
Perhaps.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen realized himself that his ability to reject temptation has been poor. And Xia Shiyu who realized his point did nothing wrong to cut off the "temptation". Since she is the CEO of the group, it was reasonable for her to moderately control the desire of the president for the sake of the Group's expansion…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stuffed the resumes in his drawer, called the human resources department, and asked them to send a few more resumes.</br>
</br>
He could not accept a man wandering around in his office all day.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Assistant selection aside, compared to the irrelevant small stories, Jiang Chen had other urgent matters to take care of.</br>
</br>
Just like what he told Xia Shiyu, he planned to build a city.</br>
</br>
Not on the ground, but the ocean!</br>
</br>
Followed by the economic development of Xin, a large number of foreign workers and tourists flooded Xin, the not large Pannu Islands instantly became crowded. The previously spacious residential land started to experience shortages. Although it wasn't to the point where the original residents could no longer afford housing, it inevitably increased their cost of living and the requirement to immigrate.</br>
</br>
Even if Xin possessed the economic conditions for population increase, on the islands not-so-big in the first place, how many people could you stuff on there?</br>
</br>
Xin had a massive territory; not on land, but on the sea.</br>
</br>
Next to the vast west Pacific Ocean, there was no territorial dispute for Xin.</br>
</br>
With such a god given geographical advantage, it would be a waste of heaven sent if not utilized.</br>
</br>
Future Group and Celestial Trade's next strategic focus was to expand to the ocean!</br>
</br>
It was the prequel to the space era.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 602: A Strand of Hair</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Coro Island, near Future Building, located on the northeast corner of the island was a high tech park. The place represented the origin of the most advanced technology of Xin.</br>
</br>
It was also the area on the entire Coro Island with the highest security. The gates and walls were guarded with soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons supported by the patrol of Hummingbird drones. The gates were scanned in not by ID cards, but rather retina recognition. The security level there was only second to Jiang Chen's mansion located at the north end of the land, slightly higher than the Presidential Palace of Xin.</br>
</br>
But even with the high security, you won't feel the suppression of a high-security zone walking inside the high tech park. Other than the patrol teams outside the wall, the Hummingbird drones were usually hidden inside the "drone hives" waiting for an order. Only when the alarm is triggered would they fly to the alarm source.</br>
</br>
The people who listen would lay flat on the ground, the people who don't listen would be dropped by rubber bullets, the people with weapons…</br>
</br>
Would be made into sieves.</br>
</br>
Inside the high tech park, there was no military zone or restricted zone. But rather some areas, people were unpermitted to enter without the right permission.</br>
</br>
For example the Nano material lab 200 meters out of the Future Building. The egg-shaped building was built two months ago and in service just last week. The primary research project was Nano material with graphene as the central component.</br>
</br>
The permission level there was only second to the CEO office of Future Group subsidiaries. Other than the scientists that worked there, there was only a handful of people in the Future Group permitted to enter.</br>
</br>
The lab cost 140 million US dollars; the lab was currently the one that burned the most money in Future Group.</br>
</br>
Although it was burning through cash, compared to the other Nano material labs around the world, the 140 million US dollars was very cost friendly. Some of the equipment cost millions with a ridiculous maintenance fee.</br>
</br>
And the reason why Future Group's lab saved money was that of the industrial 3D printer Jiang Chen brought back so that most of the high precision equipment could be manufactured by themselves. As well as the Graphene Composite Cutting Bed he brought from Zhao Chenwu a long time ago along with the resources related to the applications of Graphene that all provided substantial help to the lab.</br>
</br>
The scientists here may not be comparable with the most leading experts around the world, but the technology they knew of was the most advanced in the 21st century.</br>
</br>
They were standing on the shoulders of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived at the lab, the lab director in a white lab coat was standing with other employees beside a humongous equipment and nervously conducting an experiment on Nano material. Some people were adjusting the equipment, some were recording data, some were making observations… a total of eleven scientists, none were extraneous.</br>
</br>
</br>
The director of the lab's name was Lu Yuan, male, 47, previously an academician at Central Research Institute's physics department. The man had black hair, and the straightened body looked sharp without any signs of aging, he looked like he was 30 something.</br>
</br>
It was not easy to hire him to be the director. The researchers in Hua had mediocre income, but at the academician level, especially in material science where it is connected to national defense, the benefits are not low at all. Based on what Lu Yuan said, including benefits, it was around 2 million a year…</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen offered a salary of 10 million a year.</br>
</br>
Facts proved over and over again, as long as the hoe hit the right spot, a wall will always collapse (1). But what really attracted the old professor to bring his most outstanding students to come to Xin was Jiang Chen's promise of "non-bureaucratic and free research environment" and "most advanced research equipment", as well as the most tempting "technical information from Future Group".</br>
</br>
Of course, a confidentiality agreement was necessary. Since he was in Xin, Jiang Chen naturally won't let him go easily.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly stood in the hallway outside of the lab and looked at the scientists working on the equipment. It was not until the experiment was over did he finally walk inside.</br>
</br>
"How are the results?"</br>
</br>
"Very ideal." Lu Yuan patted the experiment data in his arm and exclaimed, "I finally understand how fearsome Future Group's research ability is."</br>
</br>
"Could I interpret this as you're complimenting yourself?" Jiang Chen said in a joking tone.</br>
</br>
[Aren't you a part of Future Group's "research ability"?]</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan laughed and passed the data to his assistant, told him to summarize the data, and then looked back at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I feel pity."</br>
</br>
"Pity?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Lu Yuan nodded and sighed lightly, "Throw away the hypes, we successfully produced the first 15-inch single-layer graphene in Hua by chemical vapor deposition and successfully fabricated a 7-inch graphene touchscreen. But a high-strength graphene cable like this, I never thought I could see this in my lifetime… With this, the space elevator in novels and movies could become a reality."</br>
</br>
Inside the apparatus, inside the middle of the lab, a hair-thin graphene strand was connected between two metal poles, and the strand of hair was the subject of the experiment. Just then, they tested the graphene's durability to withstand different gas pressures and gas compositions, the results were extremely pleasing.</br>
</br>
"Space elevator is our next strategic focus. I can tell you this now." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"If Central Research Institute has a lab like this, even without the resources, give us at most ten years and this 'strand of hair' will be born in Hua…." Lu Yuan exclaimed before he shook his head.</br>
</br>
There was no purpose to say this. The price he had to pay to enter this lab was a confidentiality agreement with Future Group, and it did not permit him to leave Xin within ten years.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only scoffed at Lu Yuan's exclaim.</br>
</br>
[Obviously, half of the equipment came from the mid-22nd century, the most critical resources are all technologies from the 22nd century!]</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen could only think in his mind without blurting it out. His explanation for the technical resources was acquired from commercial methods without providing a more specific explanation.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, what's there to feel pity about?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Pity that it is Future Group that conquered this problem, not Central Research Institute." Lu Yuan looked at Jiang Chen while slowing stating it. "To be honest, the institute discussed you before. But no one thought that other than artificial intelligence and virtual reality, you would have so much more to offer."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed without commenting on this question. Then he asked rhetorically, "Then do you think without such a broad stage, Future Group would be Future Group?"</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan heard the question and finally couldn't hold in the question that bothered him for so long, "are you not willing to contribute to your home country?"</br>
</br>
"Of course I'm willing." Jiang Chen said frankly, but before Lu Yuan was able to continue, his words took a sharp turn and erased the unrealistic thought out of Lu Yuan's head, "I won't preach everything I know."</br>
</br>
(1) There is no man you can't headhunt as long as you're willing to pay the price.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 603: The Amazing Graphene</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In Jiang Chen's "Ocean Expansion" strategic plan and "Space Elevator" plan, the research of Nano material – graphene was fundamental and core.</br>
</br>
Most people know that graphite is one of the softest substances in nature. What most people don't know, however, is that its so-called "softness" is just its macro phenomenon. For example, the hexagonal grids stacked on top of the other, the graphite interlayer structure is maintained by "the least reliable" van der Waals forces, so that the layers and layers are relatively "slippery" under the action of external force, thereby giving a "soft " illusion.</br>
</br>
But in the direction perpendicular to the plane, graphite is "amazingly" durable!</br>
</br>
According to the latest research results, it shows that graphene per 100 nm distance can withstand a maximum pressure that reaches 2.9 micro Newton. In other words, it will take 55 Newton of force to break one meter long graphene! Intuitively, graphene with the same thickness of food plastic bag will need to exert a pressure of almost 20,000 Newton before losing its integrity. In other words, if the plastic bag is made out of graphene, it will be able to withstand about two tons of weight!</br>
</br>
Here only its strength is discussed, its conductivity, light transmission, lightweight and anti-bactericidal nature are all superb. All of this is also precisely why graphene is one of the most important research topics in the world. From space elevators to supercomputers, screens of the next-generation photonic sensors to mobile phones of the second generation, this new source of material, which is cumbersome to produce, has garnered worldwide acclaim since the turn of the century.</br>
</br>
Graphene material is the future!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's Future Group was leading the world in this aspect. Although it was not revealed to the public, Future Group has been using graphene material in many of its products. For example, the K1 kinetic skeleton Celestial Trade is currently using, from the chip to the removable bulletproof guard; graphene could be seen everywhere. The Phantom helmet was also another example along with the electromagnetic acceleration track in the deep water mining facility, they were all made with graphene material.</br>
</br>
Application was only one aspect. These products were all designed in the apocalypse and not indicative that Future Group really mastered the technology. To digest the technology from the other dimension and apply the technology to more broad applications, Jiang Chen invested and established the graphene lab and "bought" the group of scientists with achievement in the research of graphene to digest the superior technology.</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan didn't disappoint him either.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the "strand of hair" back to Fallout Shelter 027. After the testing done by the scientists at the shelter, it reached the quality needed to build the space elevator. It meant that in the field of material science, Future Group's technology led the world by at least 20 years.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
A stream of cargos sailed from New Guinea to Ange Island; anyone could have guessed Future Group had big plans. UA was the most sensitive about this since the two parties recently were in an escalated tension on the topic of MLL Island.</br>
</br>
But what the CIB Agent on Ange Island didn't know was, after Xin further refined the crudely refined steel products, they transported them back to the port again and then hauled them to a region 200 kilometers out, then ended up dumping the refined steel products into the ocean.</br>
</br>
Dumped into the ocean?</br>
</br>
Not only were the CIB agents confused, but even the UA soldiers playing video games on the aircraft carrier were equally as confused. The Capitol immediately ordered them to closely monitor Future Group's move!</br>
</br>
Therefore, they sent the unmanned multi-purpose MQ reconnaissance drone stationed on the aircraft.</br>
</br>
They were fortunate that they sent an unmanned drone.</br>
</br>
The unlucky bird lost communication not long after it flew into Xin's territory. The aircraft carrier thought it was Celestial Trade that shot it down and reported the information to the Rainbow Mansion. The Capitol was furious and immediately called Jiang Chen… they finally learned that even Zhang Yaping couldn't give them a response.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's reaction was "innocent" and stated that he didn't know any drones that entered Xin's airfield, he then retorted the Capitol, when was it okay to be this straightforward about going into someone's house without permission?</br>
</br>
The Capitol felt awkward but acting shamelessly was key for all politicians around the world. The newly elected President is no less shameless compared to her predecessor. After she forced some explanation, she requested Celestial Trade to permit the aircraft carrier sending out unarmed recovery boat to recover the drone in the region.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't reject but did agree on a time limit with the Capitol. If the drone could not be recovered within 72 hours, the recovery boat must leave Xin's region. After the Capitol accepted Jiang Chen's proposal, the aircraft carrier immediately sent out a recovery boat. But after 72 hours, the boat recovered nothing and could only leave Xin's territory under the supervision of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Of course they couldn't find anything.</br>
</br>
When the unmanned drone entered Xin's territory, Droplet 1 set sail from the port of Coconut Island. At the same time, Aurora-20 departed from New moon Island. When it arrived above the drone, it launched an air-to-air EMP missile to the area. The drone was just like a fly that smashed into the spider web, the electronic equipment instantly malfunctioned and dove into the sea.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Droplet 1 waiting underneath extended its mechanical arm and dragged the wreckage of the drone into the net before returning to Coconut Island. The Capitol and aircraft carrier didn't think Celestial Trade's action would be so swift which made the captain of the aircraft carrier even questioned himself.</br>
</br>
'Could it have just encountered bad weather?'</br>
</br>
But what if it was not bad weather, but it was actually taken down by Celestial Trade's anti-air missile without any signs…</br>
</br>
Captain Hoffman shivered at the thought but he quickly shook the unrealistic thought out of his head. It was not difficult to shoot down the drone since it was not advanced technology, but it was impossible to do so without being detected by the aircraft drone.</br>
</br>
Within the 100 nautical miles, any anti-air missiles ascending to the drone's attitude will be captured by the radar of the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
But what Hoffman didn't know was that their radar's detection ability was a joke compared to Aurora-20's invisibility.</br>
</br>
It was not UA that kept an eye on Celestial Trade, the small neighbor Malaysia also closely monitored the situation.</br>
</br>
Different from UA, Malaysia was not focusing on military advancement, but economic changes…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 604: The Envious Neighbor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Regardless of how many White Papers the UA published alerting people of Celestial Trade's danger to regional stability, the countries clearly didn't take this warning seriously.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of surrounding countries, Celestial Trade and Future Group were marvelous.</br>
</br>
Why? There is a perfect example in New Guinea's port!</br>
</br>
At the end of 2016, the port was just a poor shanty town. Other than an uneconomical airport and a highway halfway built, the entire city's economy was dead on the ground and supported by tourism and small amounts of lumber and ore export.</br>
</br>
Malaysia's Papua Province and port were only separated by a straight border, occupying the west side of Papua. This straight borderline simply separated the entire island of Papua into two worlds, one on one side and the other on the other side. The city of Jayapura always complained that the poor from New Guinea was stealing their jobs, dirtying their cities and drinking their water, yet this condescending sense of superiority gradually vanished by the arrival of Future Group.</br>
</br>
The Malaysian shockingly discovered that port was growing at a visible speed! In just a period of four short months, the size of the city expanded by a fold. The almost deserted airport had five addition arrivals and departures. The packed port had to expand to seven berths to accommodate for the incoming cargos.</br>
</br>
When the conditions permitted, compared to working in the neighboring country, New Guineans favored working in their country more. With the economy supported by mega steel plants, it dragged up the local economy and brought along a series of other industries.</br>
</br>
Also similarly!</br>
</br>
In February, the public Luer Automotive Corporation passed a decision from the board to invest 200 million USD to establish an electric vehicle plant in the region to officially enter the Asia market! Future Biology also moved the seaweed farm to the port to provide raw ingredients for the nutrient supply production line on Ange Land. The parts plant for the housework robot was also placed near the port.</br>
</br>
Due to the shortage of population and land, Future Group started executing the strategy of shifting the high labor-intensive industry to developing countries at the beginning of 2017. And New Guinea with a weak government presence, vulnerable national defense, excessive labor, and resources, fortunately, became Jiang Chen's target.</br>
</br>
Without restriction from policies, Future Group was a hungry capital beast and took a giant bite off of New Guinea's catch. 30% of the residents of port worked for Jiang Chen directly, and 50% of the population there either were supported directly or indirectly by Future Group. What's more shocking, Future Group did everything in four short months.</br>
</br>
To the massive conglomerate, even if the New Guinea government retained a cautious attitude, the local government won't easily upset Jiang Chen because of the political order from the central authority. Jiang Chen's sentence alone could make 50% of the population of the city lose their source of income. Without Future Group and Celestial Trade, how chaotic would the city be?</br>
</br>
</br>
To some extent, Future Group was like an addictive drug to the local government. The officials with foresight obviously know that it would be detrimental if this continued, but even if they know, they could not break off the drug. Officials in any country must require achievements to be promoted, and Jiang Chen happened to control what they needed the most.</br>
</br>
The New Guinea government did consider breaking up Future Group's assets through anti-trust investigation. But just as the parliament started discussing this problem, protestors consisting of the original residents of the port with signs immediately appeared to protest about racism and unfair tax treatment and fought for independence…</br>
</br>
New Guinea was scared.</br>
</br>
They were not afraid of the protestors, but afraid that Papua would become the second MLL Island. Celestial Trade dared to set an example of another country provoked them.</br>
</br>
And they did it in front of UA's face without holding anything back!</br>
</br>
No one mentioned the anti-trust investigation anymore. After a period of protesting, the protestors also lost interest and returned back to work at the steel plants.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was just a story that happened in between.</br>
</br>
Future Group provided hundreds of millions of USD in tax revenue for the local government. Just for the sake of foreign currency, the local government didn't dare to offend Future Group. Or the protestors won't be able to return to the plants and work peacefully; usually, they would have to be at least thrown in a detention center for at least a few days.</br>
</br>
It was because of this foreign currency that the neighboring Malaysia became jealous.</br>
</br>
They were not afraid of Future Group throwing a coup that overthrows their government since their force was not comparable to Country F's third-hand product. Their air force was equipped with Russia's MIG-28N and America's F-18 Hornet! Although they were not seeking for war, their air force was only comparable by Singapore in the region.</br>
</br>
Malaysia's Finance Minister and Energy Minister visited Coro Island two times to meet with Zhang Yaping and Jiang Chen while providing positive signals to Future Group.</br>
</br>
[We have a workforce, resources, and the most important basic infrastructure to support it all! Everything New Guinea has, the Papua Province on Papua Island has it, and we have more of it than them!]</br>
</br>
With how direct his message is, he practically said "come invest here!"</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't respond directly to the two ministers' warm invitation. He only vaguely stated if Celestial Trade and Future Group required expansion in business, they would consider the resource-rich Malaysia as a partner.</br>
</br>
But after all the polite talk was done, Future Group did not react at all. The tensest was the local government of Papua province, seeing that the poor country beside them was rising. While people in Jayapura hated New Guinea's poor for working in their cities when they can all go back to their hometown to work, however, when the restaurants and McDonalds throughout the city could not see a single New Guinean server, the citizens of Jayapura started to feel anxious.</br>
</br>
The sudden shortage in labor force caused a visible drop in the quality of life of Jayapura people, and the booming economy started to slow down. With the extra labor force missing, would there be no unemployment rate in the city? It was obviously not the case.</br>
</br>
While they lost their extra labor force, Jayapura lost the extra consumers. The drop in store sales and slowdown in company performance naturally led to a reduction in workforce. The more prosperous the city, the more it depended on the connections it had with the outside world.</br>
</br>
As to the influence of port and the effect on the capital of Papua province Jayapura, it would be an indirect comparison to the rise of Shenzhen and the fall of Hong Kong, not to be discussed further here.</br>
</br>
Finally, Malaysia who couldn't sit around any longer sent delegation again.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With the foreign capitals continuing to flee, if they could attract investment from the neighboring Future Group, it was a tempting choice for Malaysia looking to revitalize the economy. With Future Group's speed of expansion, there was no one that even remotely matched them.</br>
</br>
In order to hop on the rocket rapidly accelerating, Malaysia sent out a delegation for the third time.</br>
</br>
This time it was a parliament member with a renowned reputation and also was acting as the economic development consultant of Papua Province. While his rank may not be higher compared to the previous times, the visitor possessed a background from both the Malaysian government and the local government. That meant, he brought enough chips with him to the table.</br>
</br>
Also, his name is Yu Weida, a Han.</br>
</br>
Han faces are no uncommon in Malaysia, but definitely as rare as the giant panda in Malaysian politics.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen, I have long heard your name."</br>
</br>
When they met, Yu Weida in a suit sincerely extended his hand and greeted Jiang Chen. After some small talk, Jiang Chen invited the parliament member to sit down. The concierge staffed poured tea for them.</br>
</br>
Following the basic procedure of foreign delegation, he already shook hands at the Presidential Place with the President of Xin, but in front of Jiang Chen, his attitude and actions seemed reserved. Clearly, he did his homework before he came and knew that the person in front of him was the actual owner of Xin.</br>
</br>
"I trust that Mr. Jiang Chen already knows the purpose of my trip. The last time, our ministers already expressed our welcome to your investment in Malaysia." Yu Weida paused and looked at Jiang Chen. Then lowering his eyes, he said sincerely, "what's your party's consideration?"</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I'm still considering. " Jiang Chen took a sip of the water, smiled, and said in an unrushed tone.</br>
</br>
Yu Weida was not defeated by the response and started to joke with Jiang Chen, "The old saying is that, visiting the straw hut three times show one's sincerity. (A reference to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei) Now that we have already been here three times, Mr. Jiang won't let us leave empty-handed right."</br>
</br>
"That might not be the case."</br>
</br>
"Future Group's operation in New Guinea is fine. The local government and the central government both are 'extra protective' of their assets. The port government was recently discussing if they will permit Celestial Trade's Marine Corps to establish an 'employment hiring base'. If permitted, Celestial Trade will be able to acquire sufficient soldiers in New Guinea. The desire to immigrate to Xin will motivate a lot of New Guineans to apply. Since this is the only way for the islanders without a high education background to immigrate to Coro Island with a higher and higher barrier to enlist."</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Yu Weida dubiously, "Looks like Mr. Yu knows the Hua culture very well."</br>
</br>
"Of course, my ancestor is a Han merchant and settled in Kuala Lumpur during the Republic Era before moving to Papua Province." Yu Weida explained.</br>
</br>
"Then you should know that Lu Bei promised Zhuge Liang to be the state secretary," Jiang Chen paused, leaned slightly forward, and smiled at him, "then, what can you give me?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, not everything has to be based on gains." Yu Weida opened his hands, "at the very least I'm representing a country. We invited you three times, even for Apple, we weren't this sincere."</br>
</br>
"What was the GDP of Malaysia last year?"</br>
</br>
"312.7 billion US dollars," Yu Weida answered quickly.</br>
</br>
"Future Group's market cap is 500 billion, and this is a conservative estimate from Wall Street." If Jiang Chen gave an estimate, the number would have to at least double.</br>
</br>
"This way of saying it is too out…" Yu Weida adjusted the diction in his mind before he forced a smile, "this is without reason."</br>
</br>
"It's not about having a reason or not," Jiang Chen waved his hand in disagreement, sat up straight, and looked at the Malaysia parliament member in front of him. "I'm a businessman, my decision to invest is based on what you can provide me."</br>
</br>
"We have the third largest labor market in the world with a strong economic foundation. At present, ASEAN is the third power in Asia, and Malaysia is undoubtedly the leader in ASEAN. If you can come to invest here, we are willing to provide you with a series of benefits such as loans, land, recruitment and so on... "</br>
</br>
"But your labor cost is higher than them." Jiang Chen smiled, "take the steel plant for example, including overtime, the workers at New Guinea only needs to be paid 750 US dollars per month, but your basic wage without overtime will be more than 800 uS dollars."</br>
</br>
"It is unfair to purely discuss cost. Our country's education level is higher than them," Yu Weida explained.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was clearly not having any of this.</br>
</br>
"Do you need higher education to learn how to operate a boiler? You just need to know how to read." Jiang Chen then continued, "especially since we'll be sending technical experts to be stationed in each steel plants. As long as we have good production procedures, even if the workers have a low education level, our group can still accept this."</br>
</br>
Yu Weida gritted his teeth. He knew that if he didn't bring out any attractive proposal, this negotiation would be without fruition. Although before he came, the parliament and local government already gave them their bottom lines, but bringing out the chips this early was not helpful in haggling the price.</br>
</br>
"One year, tax-free!"</br>
</br>
"New Guinea gave us three years."</br>
</br>
"Then we'll do three years!" Yu Weida thought about the ore agreement with BHP, he continued, "Also, limited to just the ports of Papua Province, we'll exclude the income tariff on iron, aluminum, nickel, and cooper; as long as the total investment in Malaysia exceeds 2 billion US dollars."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was moved.</br>
</br>
They eliminated the import tariff! In this case, it would save Future Group at least 200 million USD in expenses! Currently, Future Group's massive expansion projects did put a strain on its cash flow. If he could save this expense, he could distribute the budget to the projects burning more money.</br>
</br>
But just the elimination of the ore import tariff was not enough to convince Jiang Chen, unless they could add more benefits…</br>
</br>
"You almost convinced me."</br>
</br>
"Can I know where I'm lacking?"</br>
</br>
Seeing how big Jiang Chen's appetite was, Yu Weida was growing more displeased.</br>
</br>
He already offered all the benefits he could on the table, if Future Group is still raising the price without agreeing, he didn't plan to discuss further.</br>
</br>
"I admit that your offer is generous and attractive, but," Jiang Chen suddenly took a sharp turn in the conversation, "we already invested 1.7 billion US dollars in New Guinea with a 5 billion US dollars investment project coming up. If we give up 2 billion of initial investment because of a 200 million policy benefit, if you are in my spot, is this clearly a less appealing choice?"</br>
</br>
[5 billion US dollars more!]</br>
</br>
Yu Weida held his breath.</br>
</br>
He didn't notice the second half of Jiang Chen's sentence because all his focus was caught by the number.</br>
</br>
"What do you want?"</br>
</br>
"Everything before that and one more, a special pass," Jiang Chen raised one finger, "all the trucks and employees of Future Group can freely move between Malaysia's Papua Province border and New Guinea. All documents and tariffs must be—"</br>
</br>
"This is impossible!" Yu Weida shouted out.</br>
</br>
It was impossible! Absolutely impossible! Not only did it pertain to tariffs, but it was also related to national security! Even if Future Group bears enough weight, the parliament would not agree to such a ridiculous term.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't care that much; he extended his hand with a smile.</br>
</br>
"If possible, cheers to our cooperation."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 606: A New Special District</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The truth proved that nothing is impossible.</br>
</br>
It was fine to have no taxes, and it was fine to remove tariffs for some goods, but the latter exception made the Malaysian government troubled. While both New Guinea and Papua Province were both on Papua Island and the two countries were connected by a highway, any goods transported through this highway required tariffs to be paid.</br>
</br>
Especially when it came to mining resources, Papua was rich in resources throughout the island. The Papua provincial government didn't want to see New Guinea's ores flooding into Malaysia to steal their own market share.</br>
</br>
But if Future Group was granted a special pass, that meant the border was non-existent to them.</br>
</br>
But!</br>
</br>
The 5 billion USD investment made it hard for the Malaysian government to give up. Malaysia received a total investment of 174.9 billion Ringgit in 2016, a drop from 186.7 billion in 2015 by 6%. Although the decrease had slowed down compared to the terrifying 21% cliff dive, overall, the Malaysian economic situation was optimistic.</br>
</br>
Future Group's 5 billion USD couldn't be underestimated. Based on the investment performance of Future Group at the port, one USD of investment attracted at least 1.7 USD in international capital. Even compared with the wealthy Wall Street across the world, Future Group was considered a generous investor.</br>
</br>
A lot of investors even closely monitored Future Group's activity and invested wherever Future Group invested. The trend of following Future Group was best demonstrated in Xin; Future Group's 10 billion USD investments there drew in at least 13 billion of follow-up investments. Because of the international capital flooding in, it made Coro Island a rising pearl in the west Pacific.</br>
</br>
Yu Weida brought Jiang Chen's words back to Malaysia.</br>
</br>
One week later, the Malaysian government sent Jiang Chen a reply.</br>
</br>
There was only a short sentence in the letter.</br>
</br>
"Cheers to our cooperation."</br>
</br>
The Malaysian government executed the document with the cooperation of the local Papua provincial government to designate the 180-square-kilometer area on the northeastern border of Papua Province as the New Malaysia Special District. Combined with the 40 square kilometers of land negotiated with the New Guinea government, Celestial Trade owned land on Papua Island the size of three Xiangjiangs.</br>
</br>
The land was located at the border of the two countries. After the establishment of the special zone, Celestial Trade and Future Group's employees and vehicles could freely move between the special district and New Guinea. But entering the other area of Papua Province from the special zone would still require custom inspections and tariff charges. It was the equivalent of the Malaysian government moving out the inspection station on the border by ten-something kilometers.</br>
</br>
</br>
Establishing an industrial zone on the border was similar to the UK industrial zone, but differences also existed. In terms of taxes, the two governments' tax revenue was split 8:2. In terms of management and administration, Malaysian officials managed the special district.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was extremely pleased with their compromise, and he was also shockingly surprised.</br>
</br>
Malaysia had high hopes regarding Future Group's prospects and was willing to establish a special zone to attract Jiang Chen's investment.</br>
</br>
Just as Yu Weida said, the education levels of the indigenous people of New Guinea were too low. The production efficiency of the workers was, in fact, related to their education levels. It might not be reflected in the boilers of the steel plant, but it could be seen in other plants.</br>
</br>
Take, for example, the parts required to construct a housework robot.</br>
</br>
To polish a part of the robot, a worker with an elementary education would require one month of training with an average polishing speed of 31 parts per day, but a worker with a high school education would only require 10 days of training with an average polishing speed of 47 parts per day. A lot of Han and Vietnam descendants who entered New Guinea through Papua Province had production efficiencies that were levels above the indigenous people of New Guinea.</br>
</br>
After the approval of the special zone document, Future Group negotiated with the special district government and acquired ownership rights of all 15 square kilometers of land at a symbolic price of 1 USD per square meters.</br>
</br>
Immediately, Jiang Chen spent 1.2 billion USD and hired five construction companies to simultaneously start on the construction of roads, residences and other basic infrastructure as well as steel plants, robot part plants and chemical plants for manufacturing MIX1 batteries to connect the plants built at the west end of the port.</br>
</br>
The completion of the industrial zone would create 117,000 job positions in Papua Province.</br>
</br>
The Capitol.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the conference room was low-spirited. The thinktanks of the Capitol sat around the table and exchanged opinions regarding the document in front of them. Their faces displayed shock, disbelief, and mostly concern.</br>
</br>
Hill sat at the end of the table. The aggressive old woman won the race against her opponent, but since her inauguration, she had never been tested by an incident this scale.</br>
</br>
A middle-aged man walked into the room.</br>
</br>
All the eyes in the conference room were directed at him, including Hill who sat at the end.</br>
</br>
Naomi Martin didn't waste any words and put the document on the table.</br>
</br>
"The results of the autopsy report have come out. The result of death was heart failure ... it's suspected he was killed."</br>
</br>
The conference room became rattled.</br>
</br>
Gordon, the F35 pilot, was found not on MLL Island, but in Singapore 2,000 kilometers away. When CIB agents found him through all the clues, he had been dead for half a month.</br>
</br>
Why would the F35 fighter pilot suddenly leave the combat zone and strike City K? Why did he not attempt to contact the command center after he parachuted and appeared in Singapore 2,000 kilometers away?</br>
</br>
Too many questions were brought into his grave.</br>
</br>
But CIB was indeed the hound of UA. When they were conducting a search of the pilot's apartment, they found a suspicious diary.</br>
</br>
30 pages of the 41 pages diary were ripped out. They found a large number of smudges on the 31st page with the only distinguishable thing being a word.</br>
</br>
"Kurofune, the black boat."</br>
</br>
"We already discussed this problem."</br>
</br>
"Should we contact the Nippon government? Perhaps they know something."</br>
</br>
"I'll bet 10 dollars that the 'Kurofune' probably is a nightclub that our boys like to go."</br>
</br>
"Luke, we're in a conference." Hill used a calm but authoritative voice.</br>
</br>
The man named Luke immediately closed his mouth and shrugged at his colleagues.</br>
</br>
Then Hill directed her gaze at Naomi, who just entered.</br>
</br>
"You're late, but I guess you have new discoveries, right?"</br>
</br>
Naomi took a deep breath and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Gordon seemed to be tortured before his death, but based on the statement from his neighbor, no one entered or left his room. From the room, we detected vomit and alcohol… he ingested a large quantity of alcohol before his death."</br>
</br>
"Get to the point; I'm not here to listen to your autopsy report."</br>
</br>
"I am just about to get to the point." Naomi continued, "based on the analysis of our intelligence personnel, Kurofune should be an organization. And Gordon should've contacted the organization before his death. But this wasn't the most shocking discovery."</br>
</br>
"There's indirect evidence to prove that Kurofune is perhaps related to that thing we're researching in Area 51."</br>
</br>
When Naomi finished the last sentence, the entire conference room was dead silent.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 607: Robot Xiao Lin</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the housework robot hitting the market, the entire Internet was again excited by the name "Future."</br>
</br>
Code AI-00, nicknamed Xiao Lin, represented the first model of Future Heavy Industries' combination of "artificial intelligence + service robot." Future Heavy Industries ended up rejecting the initial crude and bold design of the robot and designed Xiao Lin's appearance with a professional art team.</br>
</br>
Its previous cylindrical head was replaced by a human head.</br>
</br>
The uncanny effect made the art team tremble. The more the robot resembled a human, the more its physiological repulsiveness became apparent. Regardless of how much emotional data they ported to enrich the robot's facial expressions, the hollowness inside its pupils and the stiffness in the details would give people a similar feeling to seeing the dead, but the problem couldn't be solved by even Doctor Amos. It was solved by an undergraduate student with an art degree.</br>
</br>
"If looking like a human makes people feel uncomfortable, just don't make it look like a human!"</br>
</br>
Who said human-like features were the only definition of beauty?</br>
</br>
The fictional idol, Hatsune Miku, has been popular for years and has tons of followers on the Internet!</br>
</br>
The problem was solved just like that.</br>
</br>
The art team who suddenly had that realization got rid of the previous face and used 2.5D style as the foundation, bringing a character that only previously existed in fantasies to the real world.</br>
</br>
It had six basic expressions and 36 expressions based on emotional data. The amount of emotion it could display far exceeded the complicated 142-expression design.</br>
</br>
Xiao Lin's official appearance was set as an 18-year-old girl with long, black, straight hair. She had a maid uniform as well as a blonde boy in servant clothes. Gender, hair color, pupil color, breast size, personality, and uniform could all be customized based on user preference. Of course, customization would require an additional fee.</br>
</br>
Most people were willing to make their girlfriend look different from others.</br>
</br>
What? You're asking me if the word "girlfriend" is wrong?</br>
</br>
But in actuality, a lot of people who took Xiao Lin home treated her as their girlfriend. Future Technology's AI was known for its power and there were still people to this day who treated Little White as their pet, hence, a lot of people fell in love with the goddess who stepped out from their fantasies. The price of 10,000 USD was pricey, but to Doctor Amos' surprise, it achieved a sales feat in the Asian market.</br>
</br>
The sales of the adult version of Xiao Lin destroyed the sales of the family-friendly version. Although it was just an addition of a "special mold" as well as a unique "emotional sensor" to display R-18 positions and emotions, the price skyrocketed to 20,000 USD on the black market.</br>
</br>
This certainly caught Jiang Chen off guard.</br>
</br>
If you could pay 20,000 USD, why didn't you go find a girlfriend?! Picking up a girl wouldn't cost 20,000 USD, right?</br>
</br>
</br>
It wasn't until later that he discovered it wasn't just single men without money to get married who bought this, but people with money with special needs were also buying this. Some requested the height to be as short as possible, some demanded that the breast size be G, and some even bought ten and created a harem.</br>
</br>
Robots absolutely will not get jealous, unless it was set within the program that they will.</br>
</br>
Time magazine once again displayed Jiang Chen on the cover page and used comical English to describe him as:</br>
</br>
The header also made Jiang Chen furious.</br>
</br>
If it wasn't for the fact that the report was unbiased and offered insight, he would've sent out his Ghost Agents to do some work.</br>
</br>
There were 200,000 Xiao Lins walking out of the plant on Ange Island every month with 50,000 units as the home model with the remaining ones being the adult model. Previously, production was scheduled for an equal split between both models, but the sales of the adult model were so great that Future Heavy Industries immediately reduced the production of the home model and distributed the production to the adult version.</br>
</br>
Amos didn't stop complaining to Jiang Chen about this.</br>
</br>
Their era-defining masterpiece turned out to be a sex toy! It was humiliating to know.</br>
</br>
He complained for less than a month before he stopped yapping and focused on the improved version of Xiao Lin. The 50 million USD in dividends almost scared him to death. Although he was reputable in the international robotic community, he had never been this rich.</br>
</br>
But in comparison to Time, Capital Post maintained a cautious attitude towards the Xiao Lin introduced by Future Heavy Industries. They included a picture of the Terminator with heavy machines on the report for Xiao Lin. "Rainbow House should feel happy because it won't take long before the soldiers serving abroad can return home."</br>
</br>
But the Capitol wasn't happy.</br>
</br>
The moment Xiao Lin entered the market, the Capitol analyzed the "highly intelligent" robot's possibility of being used in warfare. While Xiao Lin couldn't distinguish between guns for now and the software eliminated any possibility of harming humans, it didn't mean that the robot couldn't be improved to include those capabilities.</br>
</br>
The results of the analysis were shocking.</br>
</br>
If the robot was used in the battlefield, the UA force's ground combat ability could increase by at least ten percent. Most importantly, these soldiers didn't need to be paid. There was no need for pensions and funerals if they fell in the war.</br>
</br>
Problematically, the control system of the robot was equipped with a similar protection mechanism as the Phantom. Forcefully dissembling it would trigger the protection mechanism and cause the high-energy capacitor to discharge instantly, frying all key components. The most pivotal AI program troubled all the scientists around the world who struggled with how to start reverse engineering it. The Capitol had to send an email to Future Group.</br>
</br>
"Thor Corporation wants to cooperate with us in military robots and their proposal is 1 billion USD to purchase the technology related to Xin Lin. Hua also offered a similar proposal in hopes that they could win the partnership before Thor Corporation," Xia Shiyu reported to Jiang Chen in his office.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the documents on the table without replying and only let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Artificial intelligence, robots - why do people want to make every piece of technology I introduce into a weapon?"</br>
</br>
Yesterday, Natasha came to speak with him expressing that the Kremlin shared the same thoughts, hoping to partner with Future Heavy Machinery. The girl even lowered her voice and tempted him with "nuclear." Russia could send out nuclear experts to Xin to help construct a nuclear power plant…</br>
</br>
"Reject them?" Xia Shiyu asked.</br>
</br>
"Reject them. Express Future Group's neutrality on global affairs again. Any attempt to acquire Future Group technology through illegal channels will be met with Future Group applying for patents in all other countries immediately."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
"I will use your words as a diplomatic reply. Also, Saudi called about the robot too."</br>
</br>
"Saudi?" Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu, confused. "They're interested in our technology too?"</br>
</br>
"Rather than saying they're interested, it's more appropriate to say…" After hesitating for a moment, Xia Shiyu looked away awkwardly. "Their royal has a special request."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 608: Taboo</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't think the Saudi Prince would personally make a trip. As per the request brought up in the morning, the Prince arrived at Coro Island in the afternoon and checked into the Heart of the Sea.</br>
</br>
The plane imprinted with the royal badge landed at the Coro Island airport. With bodyguards in suits accompanying him, Prince Yerif walked off the plane.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of his royal blood, the Arabic Prince looked extremely handsome. He wore a traditional Arab white robe. The moment he saw Jiang Chen waiting at the gate, without giving Jiang Chen the opportunity to speak, he walked out with quick steps and gave Jiang Chen a hug.</br>
</br>
"I finally met you - the most successful businessman of the century, Mr. Jiang Chen." After letting Jiang Chen go, Yerif spoke to him in English.</br>
</br>
"I'm grateful to meet you too, Mr. Prince," Jiang Chen said humbly.</br>
</br>
The person standing in front of him was indeed richer than him. Based on the information he obtained from Xin's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prince Yerif wasn't only a prince, but he was also the likely successor of the King. Once the Saudi King pass away in the future, it would be him on the throne.</br>
</br>
Based on what a Saudi Prince told him, Saudi Aramco's valuation was expected to be in the range of 2 trillion USD. Although it was undetermined if this number is inflated, if the number is, in fact real, Saudi Aramco's IPO would break Apple's 700 billion record.</br>
</br>
Among the people Jiang Chen knew, only the Rothschild family with an undisclosed financial standing could compare to the wealthy Arabs.</br>
</br>
When the car arrived at Future Building, Yerif was generous with his praise while standing at the gate.</br>
</br>
"A beautiful building. It is equally as beautiful as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai."</br>
</br>
"Haha, thank you for your compliment." While they chatted, Jiang Chen invited him into the conference room.</br>
</br>
When they sat down, Yerif asked his bodyguards to stay outside the room. It didn't take long before the conversation turned to robots. The handsome prince seemed to be uncomfortable expressing his request.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who noticed his awkwardness, signaled Xia Shiyu to step out for a moment.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu closed the door behind her.</br>
</br>
Seeing there was no one else present, Yerif felt relieved.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem. We're all men, I understand." Jiang Chen laughed. "But I have a question. Could Mr. Prince clear my confusion?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, please go ahead," Yerif said courteously.</br>
</br>
"Why didn't you get someone else to handle the small task of customizing a robot? Considering your identity… it seems inappropriate for you to make a trip down here just for this."</br>
</br>
Yerif smiled.</br>
</br>
"I see. I'm here on vacation to Coro Island. At the same time, I wished to bring Future Group a greeting from Saudi, so the outside world won't know about the robot. I hope Mr. Jiang can keep this a secret for me."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Of course. We always value the privacy of our users. What kind of robot do you need?" Jiang Chen tried his best to show a smile that wouldn't make Yerif feel awkward since asking the question felt equivalent to asking the size of sex doll Yerif wanted to buy.</br>
</br>
Just as he thought Yerif would say something embarrassing, he put his hands into his pocket and took out a delicate wooden box.</br>
</br>
Yerif handed him the box.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the redwood box, opened the sophisticated switch and found a photo inside.</br>
</br>
"This is…"</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he sensed that the photo looked familiar.</br>
</br>
"I feel like I've seen her before…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly recollected that when he was in Sanya in 2015, he was fortunate enough to attend a birthday party of an Arab Prince. The person in the photo was the beautiful princess he saw.</br>
</br>
Yerif looked more familiar the more he looked at him!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the prince a few more times and confirmed his suspicions.</br>
</br>
"My princess." Reminiscence surfaced on Yerif's face and he put his hands on his face. "My true love."</br>
</br>
From the hint of remorse in his eyes and the photo of the beautiful lady, Jiang Chen could guess his true intentions.</br>
</br>
It made sense now. He was the prince of a country, so how would he have made a personal trip down to Coro Island simply for a "doll"?</br>
</br>
But his wish troubled Jiang Chen…</br>
</br>
"The deceased can't be awakened. You should know that what you're pursuing is wrong." Jiang Chen looked sternly into his eyes and reminded him.</br>
</br>
"You already guessed what I want? Indeed, that is fitting for the most successful businessman of the century. I understand everything you're saying, but I just want her to return to my side." Yerif sniffed and looked at Jiang Chen with a hint of desperation.</br>
</br>
"I apologize—"</br>
</br>
"Don't reject me! I'm willing to pay money. How much do you want—" Seeing as Jiang Chen was about to reject him, Yerif stood up emotionally.</br>
</br>
"Remain calm. This isn't about money." Jiang Chen attempted to comfort him. "Even if I want to help you, I have to consider the technology at Future Group. Do you think Xiao Lin's design could fill the hole in your heart?"</br>
</br>
The wealthy just wanted to throw money at people whenever there is a conflict now.</br>
</br>
"I don't want that," the calmed Yerif shook his head. "But it's already very close. If there are technical challenges, just solve them. How much investment do you need? 100 million? 1 billion? We can discuss."</br>
</br>
Seeing as Yerif wouldn't back down unless he achieved his goal, Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
To be honest, considering how infatuated the prince was, he almost agreed but ended up rejecting him anyway.</br>
</br>
"Reviving the dead is taboo in science."</br>
</br>
"Why?!"</br>
</br>
"I can't explain why; I can only provide you with an example. Let's say that you had a brother who passed away and your father used the same method to revive him. Your father loved him like before and made him the successor of the kingdom. The robot would be the King one day - don't you think that's scary?"</br>
</br>
"She's only a woman! Even if you revived her, what influence would she have?" Yerif said ardently.</br>
</br>
Looking at the pleading Yerif, Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"… Fine, but you have to keep this a secret."</br>
</br>
With excitement lighting up his eyes, Yerif nodded fiercely.</br>
</br>
"I promise! I swear in Allah's name!"</br>
</br>
It was the most sincere promise a Saudi could make.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and he continued.</br>
</br>
"Before I help you, I have to ask - how are you going to cover up the fact that Amira already passed away? Most people should've attended her funeral already."</br>
</br>
"I'll marry her again. She will be my ninth wife. I'll tell people I fell in love with her on Coro Island and she looked like she was made from the same mold as Amir, so I granted her the name Amira," Yerif said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
[… Fine.] For a split second, Jiang Chen thought Yerif was an infatuated man.</br>
</br>
Nine wives.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought he was shameless enough, but he still paled in comparison.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 609: The Living Doll</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The prince's persistence did make Jiang Chen feel exasperated.</br>
</br>
Although Future Group currently held no special interests in the Middle East, based on the consideration of Xin and Saudi's future relationship, he ultimately agreed to Yerif's request.</br>
</br>
He obtained a strand of Princess Amira's hair and extracted the DNA inside. He took the DNA back to Fallout Shelter 027 and replicated her look at 20 years of age. He then used 3D printing technology to create the digitalized human version of the princess.</br>
</br>
The skeleton was titanium alloy, and the skin was silica gel. She possessed Princess Amira's looks and basic artificial intelligence, infinitely approaching intermediate artificial intelligence. Her memory was replicated based on Price Yerif's memory of her and a personal diary she had.</br>
</br>
From the appearance, she was no different from a human.</br>
</br>
No… she was no different from a human internally.</br>
</br>
The moment she woke up in the modern world, she called for Yerif. She was fearful toward the scientists in the lab and thought they were bandits who took her hostage. She threatened Jiang Chen to let her go or the Saudi royal family would take serious actions…</br>
</br>
Standing inside the surgery room, Jiang Chen and Amos looked at each other.</br>
</br>
They both read the unnatural concern in each other's pupils.</br>
</br>
The concern didn't originate from the uncanny valley effect.</br>
</br>
"This is immoral." When Doctor Amos recovered from his shocked state, that was his first sentence.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen concurred.</br>
</br>
"This is more immoral than a clone. At least clones don't possess your memory, drive your car, sleep with your woman, and make everything feel like it should happen. God…" Amos closed his eyes and drew a cross in front of his chest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't have anymore to add.</br>
</br>
He only narrowed his eyes and gazed into her pupils until she started to tremble before he moved his eyes away. He saw Lin Chaoen's shadow on her. Although the scientists at the fallout shelter swore she only possessed basic artificial intelligence, all her actions were just logical responses to an external stimulus.</br>
</br>
Although she was extremely similar to humans, she wasn't the same.</br>
</br>
She was just a "doll".</br>
</br>
"Are you really going to give her to the Saudi Prince?" Amos asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen nodded. "Xin needs allies in the international community. A friendship that can be won with just a robot is worth it for us."</br>
</br>
Amos still wanted to say something, but seeing as Jiang Chen didn't want to discuss further, he didn't speak.</br>
</br>
Disregarding morality and ethics, the robot could be considered the peak of technology. The "uncanny effect" Doctor Amos couldn't solve despite all his efforts was easily solved by the scientists at Fallout Shelter 027.</br>
</br>
Technological advancement wasn't a sprint but a marathon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned her like he was looking at a piece of equipment. He then threw some clothes on her body before he turned around and left.</br>
</br>
</br>
Her memory could be adjusted later.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Yerif stayed on Coro Island for three days. Based on the words of Future Tourism's CEO, Wei Yun, the wealth Saudi spent 5 million USD at the Heart of the Sea, which certainly dazed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Three days later, Jiang Chen took Amira to see Yerif.</br>
</br>
When Yerif saw his love, he hugged her emotionally. Amira tearfully hugged Yerif while telling him how she spent a long time in complete darkness and how she missed him.</br>
</br>
"Don't cry, my baby." Yerif comforted her.</br>
</br>
It was supposed to be a touching scene, but Jiang Chen felt an abnormal disgust, so he looked away.</br>
</br>
After they hugged, the gorgeous Amira bowed to Jiang Chen and thanked him for saving her from the bandits. Based on her adjusted memory, she hadn't died because of sickness but because she was captured by bandits. Future Group ended up rescuing her and cured her terminal illness before finally meeting her husband on Coro Island again.</br>
</br>
Because other people thought she died, Yerif agreed that she would only share Amira's name and have a similar look.</br>
</br>
After Yerif spent two more days at the Heart of the Sea, Yerif said goodbye to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Before he left, he asked Jiang Chen for his price.</br>
</br>
"Just treat it as a gift. I don't plan to release this model of robot to the market." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Don't be like this, my friend, you'll make it difficult for me. Money or beauty - please tell me what you desire," Yerif said sternly.</br>
</br>
In their correspondence over the past days, he really treated Jiang Chen like a friend.</br>
</br>
"If you really feel troubled, just keep this a secret between us." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"I can't explain why, but it's an immoral technology."</br>
</br>
Yerif didn't quite understand what Jiang Chen meant, but he still accepted what he said. He swore again in the name of Allah to keep this forever a secret.</br>
</br>
"Your generosity earned the friendship of the Saudi people." Yerif took a deep breath and bowed to Jiang Chen. "Regardless, I owe you a favor. Once I become the King, I will repay you."</br>
</br>
"Receiving the friendship of the future King certainly makes the gift worthwhile." Jiang Chen laughed before he gave Yerif a few cautionary words.</br>
</br>
Robots wouldn't ever get sick, so he should never take her to get a body examination. Robots wouldn't produce blood even though their bodies are designed with blood vessels, so he had to make sure she wouldn't get seriously wounded. He should never take her apart or the protection mechanism would burn the chip. She didn't need to be charged, but she required food as the digestive system was her only source of energy…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen personally sent the prince off on his plane.</br>
</br>
Before Yerif boarded the plane, he hugged Jiang Chen again and expressed his gratitude.</br>
</br>
"If you visit Dubai, please contact me."</br>
</br>
"I will!" Jiang Chen waved his hand and sent the couple off.</br>
</br>
Gazing at the flight disappearing in the horizon, Jiang Chen's smile began to fade.</br>
</br>
Moments later, he suddenly muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps I should never have said yes."</br>
</br>
Ayesha, beside him, looked at him, lost.</br>
</br>
If the deceased could be freely replaced by robots, people wouldn't ever truly die in this world. One hundred years later, when the last human passed away, his friends and family could bid farewell around his deathbed then a replica of him could be pulled out the second his eyes were closed.</br>
</br>
That thought alone made Jiang Chen shudder with terror.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 610: The Workers on the Sea</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the surface of the west Pacific Ocean, somewhere two hundred kilometers from Coro Island, buoys bobbed up and down on a chain connected by ropes as the waves undulated, forming a circle on the sea.</br>
</br>
Eight construction boats circled the five-square-kilometer sea region and stalled there, forming a platform to continually carry out construction. The workers on the ships worked on a seven-day rotating schedule.</br>
</br>
A Guardian-class frigate was stationed nearby, its steady electromagnetic pulse cannon raised at 45 degrees on the alert for any potential intruders.</br>
</br>
While Country F no longer had ships to disturb Xin's sea territory, their caution was necessary. An aircraft carrier not far away was also closely monitoring the region. While Country F no longer dared to send out a reconnaissance drone, they could use an underwater reconnaissance device. The Guardian-class frigate was equipped with an anti-submarine radar and an NK 330mm anti-submarine torpedo which served as a deterrent to any underwater unit attempting to approach them.</br>
</br>
Right now, a large cargo ship with hundreds of containers drifted closer before coming to a halt near one of the construction boats.</br>
</br>
A man in a white shirt threw a towel on his shoulder, walked beside the mechanical device, and pulled down a lever with force. An iron bridge dropped across the construction boat and cargo, and a few soldiers in kinetic skeletons with rifles boarded the boat.</br>
</br>
The captain immediately came to greet them and took the Celestial Trade soldiers on a tour around the boat. After confirming there were no issues, the supervisor began to order the workers to start working.</br>
</br>
There were two batches of containers. One batch was to be transported on the boat and the other was to be thrown in the ocean by a mechanical arm.</br>
</br>
After finishing his task, the white shirt man tossed a wrench beside him and wiped off the sweat on his face with the towel around his shoulder. Then he narrowed his eyes while watching the mechanical arm dropping the heavy containers into the ocean.</br>
</br>
His name was Zhou Qiang, but people who knew him called him Qiang-zi. He came onto the boat two months ago, hired through an online application. His educational level was high compared to most workers, although he just finished high school.</br>
</br>
Along the sea-facing region of Hua, a lot of people knew about Xin and knew that a big company called Celestial Trade existed. Not only that, but they knew the boss was Han, and the magical boss was the biggest shareholder of Future Group!</br>
</br>
Because they were all Han, the boss took extra care of them. As long as they worked in the company for a year without any criminal record, people as illiterate as them could obtain a passport for immigration. Of course, because of their poor literacy, they would be required to attend community college on Ange Island for half a year of education.</br>
</br>
While it could improve their literacy, the education was mostly English and mathematics training. Compared to other developing countries, Hua's literacy rate was high. Even the poor could read or else they wouldn't have understood the job posting in the first place.</br>
</br>
</br>
Education was a benefit in Xin, not an industry. This was different compared to their hometown. The workers were happy to study since knowledge could change one's fate.</br>
</br>
"Aren't they hot while working on these metal things while wearing such thick layers?" He Dong walked up and took out two cigarettes. He passed one to Qiang-zi and lit one up himself.</br>
</br>
The kinetic skeletons were mostly made out of an aluminum and polyethylene material. Aside from the vital parts protected by C-grade steel, no other parts were composed of metal, but the dark metallic shine on the polyethylene bulletproof board could make people mistake the kinetic skeleton for a metallic suit.</br>
</br>
Zhou Qiang humbly smiled and accepted the cigarette.</br>
</br>
"I don't know, maybe they don't mind the heat."</br>
</br>
He Dong laughed and glanced at the two soldiers standing at the door of the captain's room like two poles.</br>
</br>
"Xin's four seasons are all summer; they probably won't have the opportunity to see snow in the future."</br>
</br>
"Aren't you going to go back during New Year's?" Zhou Qiang asked, puzzled.</br>
</br>
He Dong glared at him and blew out a few smoke rings from his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Why go home? Just make this home."</br>
</br>
"Make this home?"</br>
</br>
"Or what? We're a late bunch; my brother, who came with the earliest group, is working at the Phantom Helmet plant! He worked for half a year and the bonus alone was enough to buy himself a place." He Dong glanced at Zhou Qiang, who didn't know too much about the process.</br>
</br>
Out of all the workers, he had the most connections. Mid 2016, his brother came to Xin during the first immigration wave and was assigned to work at the Phantom Helmet plant to produce the virtual reality parts. Following the expansion of the plant, his brother became a leader of ten people who polished helmet parts.</br>
</br>
He was ready to resign. After making enough, he planned to use the connections he made in the plant to obtain contracts for helmet shell production. A lot of the small enterprises in Xin made money through contracts related to Phantom production. With some money in his pocket, he also wanted to give it a shot.</br>
</br>
"A place for himself… is at least one million, right?" Zhou Qiang said, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Although his basic salary was around 8,000 RMB, the company also provided food and accommodation, but saving one million for a place was still a distant dream.</br>
</br>
He Dong seemed to have read his friend's troubled mind. He laughed and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Don't think that buying a place is so difficult. There are no greedy real estate developers in Xin and Future Group doesn't need the money from real estate. One million? If you want a mansion with your own backyard, just pretend I didn't say anything. But if you want an apartment with Celestial Trade's sticker, 200,000 is more than enough."</br>
</br>
"USD?"</br>
</br>
"RMB! Probably around 30,000 USD? My math is pretty bad."</br>
</br>
Zhou Qiang's expression immediately turned into a smile. Including the stipend for being out at sea, he could make 2,000 USD a month. It would take a year and a half to save up 30,000 USD.</br>
</br>
"But Celestial Trade's benefits for apartments is limited to one per person. It's around 80-90 square meters in size. People should have some ambition - how happy would you be if you saved one million for a seaside mansion?" He Dong chuckled.</br>
</br>
It was only recently that he got this ambition. When he was working in Wanghai before, he worked tirelessly for two years without daring to dream of buying a place in Wanghai. It was only through coincidence that he heard about working overseas and learned about the shortage of labor in Xin, so with the mentality of giving it a shot, he followed his brother's path and came to Xin.</br>
</br>
He no longer wanted to return home after he came.</br>
</br>
For most of the Han, they worked for a place a stay and a family to care for.</br>
</br>
"Stop worrying about this nonsense; do your work. An important person will drop by to conduct checks soon. I'll deduct from your bonus if you're lazy."</br>
</br>
The supervisor with a cigarette in his mouth operating the mechanical arm glanced over.</br>
</br>
Seeing as the supervisor was unhappy, He Dong immediately extinguished his cigarette and dragged Qiang-zi back. The containers were transported, but there was other work to do. As for the important person, it wasn't something they should be concerned about.</br>
</br>
After all the containers were transported, the cargo and construction boat separated and sailed in the direction of Ange Island.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a helicopter was flying in the direction of the boat.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The helicopter landed on the temporary helipad on the construction boat.</br>
</br>
With Ayesha accompanying him, Jiang Chen in casual clothes jumped onto the deck.</br>
</br>
The captain of the construction boat was already waiting on the side. Chen Anmin with a dark tan immediately greeted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Welcome. President Jiang's personal visit is making the boat a magnificent place!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost burst out laughing when he heard the welcoming words of the tanned captain. The usage of words was not considerate of the circumstance at all.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so nervous. I'm just here to see the progress of the construction; and also here to take people on tour to see our group's construction of the century."</br>
</br>
Chen Anmin took a moment to process this and looked at the boss in confusion. Then he saw a Caucasian man who came down from the helicopter.</br>
</br>
From his impression, the construction of the ocean city should be kept confidential. Even the workers on the boat didn't know the specifics of the construction. Only a few engineers on non-rotating shifts knew bits of the specifics.</br>
</br>
"In a few days, the information of the construction will be fully released. The world has the right to know what we are doing on the west Pacific Ocean." Jiang Chen opened his hand and spoke in a ridiculing tone, "some scared people think we are building missile silos."</br>
</br>
With the graphene cable development completed, the primary structure built by the amphibious construction robots was 20% done. Country F who was completely crippled in the last war continued to spur up the conspiracy of Celestial on the Pacific and slandered Celestial Trade for building missile silos on a large scale.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew exactly who was behind all of this.</br>
</br>
IBCM has a minimum strike radius. There is no need to use it to strike a neighboring country only a few kilometers away. The people who feared the missile most was UA, standing behind Country F.</br>
</br>
It was not the best choice to hide the information. So Jiang Chen planned to release the ocean city project to the public. And the release of information immediately drew the attention of all the countries around the world. UA was the first to demonstrate their suspicion and believed that the footage released by Future Group was fictitious!</br>
</br>
An ocean city five square kilometers in size? How is that possible!</br>
</br>
Of course, UA was also building an ocean city not far away from their homeland. While it was supposedly a city, it was just a concrete floating vessel made out of reinforced steel 70 meters tall and 27 meters in diameter. But it was already difficult to achieve that. This city wasn't going to be in the shallow region; it was in the middle of the Pacific! It was not creating an artificial island; it was creating a floating and movable city!</br>
</br>
Normal steel could not withstand the massive tidal force, even if titanium alloy was used.</br>
</br>
Constructing a "real ocean city?"</br>
</br>
</br>
They were not filming a sci-fi movie!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew that UA didn't believe him and he was too lazy to provide any explanation. [If you don't believe it, just come see it yourself. Since in a few minutes, Future Group will use the Phantom to push an advertisement to the entire world.]</br>
</br>
An absolutely stunning advertisement with the theme of immigration and tourism.</br>
</br>
"We will see if it is a missile silo." When the Caucasian man got off the helicopter, he adjusted his somewhat muddled tie, walked beside Jiang Chen, and said, "where are the scuba diving gears? I think we can start now."</br>
</br>
"You are always in a rush, Mr. Laurence." Jiang Chen smiled, "I'm really curious. I heard Robert say that you were transferred to the Los Santos office for office duty?"</br>
</br>
"There are not enough people, I've been transferred to do field work again," Laurence said in annoyance.</br>
</br>
Because of Jiang Chen's poor impression of CIB and his consideration of the diplomatic relationship with Xin, UA didn't send out CIB people but instead sent out an agent from FBA and two experts.</br>
</br>
When the FBA agent first got off the plane on Coro Island, Jiang Chen was surprised to discover that it is someone he knew. The hooked nose that left a deep impression still looked aggressive. But during this meeting, the sharpness from Iraq no longer existed and he grew a beer belly.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you want to return to Los Santos soon, and then let's get started." Jiang Chen looked at the captain. "Prepare the submersion device."</br>
</br>
Chen Anmin immediately nodded and glanced at the three UA citizens in alert before going inside the ship.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha, wait for me on the deck."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Ayesha nodded and stood aside.</br>
</br>
Laurence looked at the girl in sunglasses and thought she looked familiar, but he couldn't remember the exact place. He sensed a hint of danger from her. Since he left the god forbidden Iraq, he hasn't sensed something similar in a long time.</br>
</br>
They followed Jiang Chen to the back of the deck, and the circular submersion device was prepared.</br>
</br>
Because it was a visit by outsiders, Jiang Chen naturally couldn't use the highly advanced Droplet No.1. Since construction was taking place 500 meters under the sea, the normal submersion device could serve their purpose.</br>
</br>
"Is there deep ocean diving gears? Perhaps we need to leave the submersion device later for an observation," a UA expert asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but I don't think you'll need it. Our construction is magnificent. You can see everything clearly from the outside." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That might not be a case." Laurence scorned, "who knows if you are pretending to do something and building missile silos in disguise."</br>
</br>
"Did you know when we first started building nuclear silos?" Jiang Chen acted like he was shocked.</br>
</br>
Laurence didn't understand what Jiang Chen wanted to express.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Laurence, what I will say is not only directed to you but directed to the government behind you." Jiang Chen stopped and turned around to stare him in the eyes. "We have the ability to deploy missiles at any corner of the sea without you being aware of it, and we have the ability to strike any target on your homeland without you being aware of it. We are not NK, we are not Iran, and don't use what you use against them on me. Or else you and I will both regret this. Remember I'm not saying this to you."</br>
</br>
Laurence held his breath and watched Jiang Chen in a stunnded fashion. One of his foot was still hanging in the air.</br>
</br>
"What are you waiting for?"</br>
</br>
Laurence, who regathered his thoughts, hid his infuriated state behind his poker face. He scorned and asked the two experts to board the submersion device.</br>
</br>
The veil hidden underneath the Pacific will finally be unveiled by him.</br>
</br>
The mysterious construction that made Capitol lose sleep…</br>
</br>
Is it a missile silo, or the unrealistic ocean city?</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 612: The Construction that Shocked the World</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The mysterious construction that made Capitol lose sleep…</br>
</br>
Is actually real!</br>
</br>
No, it was not a missile silo, it was...</br>
</br>
Laurence's eyes widened as he stared at the scenery outside of the glass, stunned.</br>
</br>
It was a circular ring.</br>
</br>
From above, it was a massive circular ring two kilometers in diameter.</br>
</br>
The light beam from the searchlight, like a spotlight on a stage, illuminated the massive and magnificent project. The colorful fishes traversed among the circle, as if they were exploring a city of metal buried in the sea. The cylindrical mechanical device (the amphibious construction robot) worked around the circular ring in an organized fashion. Not far in the distance, construction boats continuously dropped supplies into the sea before being picked up by the robots and transported elsewhere.</br>
</br>
It was unbelievable, breathtaking!</br>
</br>
Laurence's mouth opened wide. No words could describe the magnificence sight.</br>
</br>
"The circular ring is the 'foundation' of the entire city. Just like what you saw, the helium room, the power room, and part of the living quarters are all on the exterior of the circular ring." Jiang Chen smiled while speaking to the completely dazed Laurence.</br>
</br>
"Wait, the footage you released, isn't it a city on the ocean? Why is it underneath the water!" Laurence suddenly realized and asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Once construction is completed, we'll inject gas into the helium room, and the entire circular ring will float."</br>
</br>
"This is too absurd!" The UA experts shook their heads nonstop, "did your designers consider tidal force? Without any exaggeration, once the circular ring floats close to the sea's surface, it wouldn't take five minutes before it is shredded into pieces. If it is serious, it may potentially cause a habitat crisis on in the west Pacific Region!"</br>
</br>
"And there is also the weather's influence. The west Pacific Ocean is common to typhoons, even if God protects your boat from not being shredded to pieces, a gust of wind will make your circular ring into a hula hoop," Another expert said in a mocking tone.</br>
</br>
"Haha, you guys are so humorous." Jiang Chen laughed nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"We are discussing a serious matter." Laurence narrowed his eyes and looked at Jiang Chen. "Although we haven't discovered any suspicious activities, like what our experts said, your project is a complete failure from start to finish."</br>
</br>
"What does my failure have to do with you?" Jiang Chen glanced at Lauren with a grin forming on his face. "When did you start caring about climate change?"</br>
</br>
Laurence's mouth opened, but no words came out.</br>
</br>
"Since you have already seen it, it is apparent that we didn't deploy missile silos, so could you guys please go back now?"</br>
</br>
"No!" The UA expert suddenly said while exchanging eye contact with the other expert, "We have only seen the overview of the construction, we haven't checked the details."</br>
</br>
</br>
The other expert read the hidden message inside his colleague's eyes and looked over maliciously, "That's right, the circular ring structure is not enough to deduce if it is a missile silo or not. We need to conduct a more in-depth investigation."</br>
</br>
Although they didn't believe that the circular ring could really withstand tidal forces, they were still curious about the project. It was a ten billion dollar project! As long as Jiang Chen was not dumb, his designer must have thought about material integrity.</br>
</br>
They were curious what technology Future Group possessed to have the confidence for such an absurd project.</br>
</br>
Even if they believed that no one would be foolish enough to spend 10 billion on a random deepwater project used to disguise the construction of missile silos. Just like what Jiang Chen said, since they have the ability to complete the deployment of missiles without them being aware, there was no need to take an extraneous step.</br>
</br>
Laurence looked at the experts behind him and gazed at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"We need to go in."</br>
</br>
Laurence thought Jiang Chen would stop them, but Jiang Chen said, with a smile, "Of course, we can even live inside."</br>
</br>
"Live inside?" Laurence furrowed his eyebrows. "People can live inside here?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not here," Jiang Chen coughed and raised his watch, "Just five minutes ago, the Phantom's application was updated. In the loading space of the user, we installed a small advertisement interface. You can see everything inside the ring for yourself."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Like his usual routine, Wei Wendong put on his helmet and was immersed in the virtual reality world.</br>
</br>
Inside the white loading space, he called out the menu but noticed a unique advertisement interface beneath the game.</br>
</br>
[Penglai City? The system update was just to update an ad?] He ridiculed, but with his curiosity for Future Group, Wei Wendong pressed on the interface.</br>
</br>
Just like when he logged into the game, the white cubical room shattered into dust, and a splendid picture unfolded.</br>
</br>
The sound of tidal waves echoed beside his ear, and the pleasant sea wind blew on his face.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong stood blankly and looked at his surroundings.</br>
</br>
He was standing on the edge of the artificial ring island.</br>
</br>
The middle of the island was a tower with clearly defined buildings surrounding the tower. The complex road scattered from the middle of the circular island. Miniature vehicles moved between the roads, holograms flashed on the advertisement boards along the street, and ships of different sizes surrounded the island, massive screens were carved on the tower like The Times Square.</br>
</br>
Manmade beach, theatre, five-star hotel, residential area, opera…</br>
</br>
The place combined luxury and comfort. The leisure of a holiday destination and the fast-paced nature of a metropolitan city.</br>
</br>
Waves splashed onto the exterior of the ring, but he didn't feel the changes to his center of gravity at all. The sea wind blowing on his face comforted the turbulence in his mind.</br>
</br>
He even forgot about the scenario almost starting.</br>
</br>
There was no mistake; it was the ocean city Future Group recently advertised!</br>
</br>
It was not a floating island at all. It was a monstrous city planted on the sea floor.</br>
</br>
"Welcome to Penglai City! I'm your guide, Xiao Yu." A thumb-sized mermaid surfaced beside him and danced happily in the air before stopping in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Xiao Yu… May I ask where is this place?" Wei Wendong examined his surroundings, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Xiao Yu stopped her dance in mid-air and gave him a sweet smile.</br>
</br>
"Just like what you saw, this is Penglai City."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 613: A Tour of Penglai City</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Wei Wendong followed the tiny mermaid guide and looked at the clock on the screen at the massive central tower.</br>
</br>
12:10</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, he called out the menu, messaged his teammates who planned to enter the scenario and asked them to wait a moment. But when he opened his friend list, he discovered that the professional players from Kings already messaged him.</br>
</br>
"Captain, can we go into the scenario ten minutes later? The helmet system just updated. Let me try to figure it out."</br>
</br>
"Shadow, I need to go to the washroom. Wait for me. I'll be five minutes!"</br>
</br>
"Captain, did you see Future Technology's advertisement? Is it really an ad and not a new game they made?"</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong forced a smile.</br>
</br>
These guys... the legendary scenario was about to start and they all dropped the ball at the same time.</br>
</br>
But then his face immediately turned red. As someone who was about to message them to delay the scenario, his words were not convincing at all.</br>
</br>
He took a moment to think before he messaged the group and delayed the scenario by half an hour.</br>
</br>
The reason being: Some teammates can not arrive to scenario on time due to real life reasons, the scenario entering time has be delayed by half an hour.</br>
</br>
Ding-</br>
</br>
The message was successfully sent.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to close the system menu, a message from his friend list popped up.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong opened it and saw it was a video question from Yue Hui. He was a friend he met through the game playing the summoner class. Because they got along, they met a few times offline and became friend in real life. He later became part of Kings Club.</br>
</br>
Yue Hui was just a casual player; a boss of a company in real life. Other than having better equipment, his level and skill was mediocre.</br>
</br>
"Old Wei, what do you think?" The moment the video message connected, Yue Hui immediately asked.</br>
</br>
"What can I think?" Wei Wendong rolled his eyes and laughed. "I'm used to Future Group's ridiculous technologies."</br>
</br>
Although he sounded like he was untouched, he was still stunned.</br>
</br>
"There are presale buildings, are you not going to take a look?"</br>
</br>
"I can't afford it! A house here probably is at least in the millions range. I'm just taking a look out of curiosity, perhaps I will visit in the future."</br>
</br>
"Eh? This is not something Wei Million in our clan said," Yu Hui joked, "ten million is at most half of your annual salary."</br>
</br>
The news of Kings Boss signing Shadow King at a hefty price of 20 million created a big splash in the professional scene. At first, they thought the investment was not worth it since twenty million was too much. But they had to agree later that the boss had the foresight.</br>
</br>
It was a worldly MMORPG.</br>
</br>
100 million active players globally!</br>
</br>
Just in half a year, Shadow King used his superb gaming sense and experience through the internal test to win over 30 million in profits for Kings! Nothing else, and just in the monthly PVP competition without level restriction, the top ten players' ID could include the club's name and sponsor.</br>
</br>
</br>
The ad placement could even influence the stock price of a public company!</br>
</br>
In this digitalized era, if executed properly, intellectual property is money.</br>
</br>
Of course, that is another topic.</br>
</br>
"Nah, you make more money through your business and you can spare change to buy something here. I only know how to play games. I'd be beggar if I went to a foreign country."</br>
</br>
"Xin is not considered a foreign country, there are more and more Hans going there, you can just pretend you went to Guangzhou. And playing the game is the same everywhere. I plan to buy a place there since they said you could request a refund at any time." Yu Hui smiled.</br>
</br>
"I'll consider it."</br>
</br>
After ending the call, Wei Wendong began to consider his friend's suggestion seriously. But after given it some thought, it would be too rushed of a decision. Buying a house was something related to him forming a family and it must be well thought out. Now that his savings were enough to purchase a small mansion in Wanghai, it was not necessary to live overseas at all.</br>
</br>
Although he admitted that the futuristic style of the city did attract someone young like him.</br>
</br>
He followed Xiao Yu on the main path. However when Wei Wendong scanned his surroundings and felt somewhat lost.</br>
</br>
Just like what Future Group promoted, the place was highly futuristic, and because of this, the hologram projections and buildings overwhelmed him.</br>
</br>
Xiao Yu saw that he was lost, flew to his ear, and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Any tourist coming into Penglai can obtain digitalized glasses. Because we are currently in virtual reality, the glasses have been hidden by us. If there is a need, you can call it out through the system menu."</br>
</br>
Based on Xiao Yu's instructions, Wei Wendong selected the glasses icon in the menu. Light particles began to gather in his hand before a pair of glasses formed in his palm.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong played with the glasses before putting it on his nose.</br>
</br>
It was light, the lenses were thin, and wearing it didn't feel like anything.</br>
</br>
The sight stopped at the map and a scene that shocked him appeared. Light blue particles formed a path underneath his feet and extended to the target he selected on the map.</br>
</br>
He blankly stared at the cursor on the ground, took off the glasses, and the cursor disappeared. He put it back on and the cursor reappeared.</br>
</br>
Magical!</br>
</br>
A word surfaced in his head.</br>
</br>
"Could this be… Augmented Reality?"</br>
</br>
He remembered Microsoft's HoloLens glasses had a similar function, but he didn't know if they achieved Future Technology's level that could mark the route to the target location in three dimensional space.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Xiao Yun smiled.</br>
</br>
"Can I ask another question? Are you a live support?"</br>
</br>
"Xiao Yu is an AI," Xiao Yu put her hands beneath her chin, whipped her tail, and said with a smile. "As long as you wear the Augmented Reality glasses, you can have a Xiao Yu that belongs to just you."</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong was silent for a while before he let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Your boss is a genius… virtual reality + real estate, and an artificial intelligence salesperson that is more similar to human than human. It's impossible not to make money."</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your compliment," Xiao Yu blinked her eyes and said in a cute voice.</br>
</br>
They took a trip around the main street. In front of a community center, Wei Wendong stopped and examined the apartment building.</br>
</br>
At the door, he saw a hologram screen with a row of organized stickers.</br>
</br>
"For sale?" He muttered the words on the hologram screen.</br>
</br>
"Penglai's municipality management is digitalized, your local assets and real estates are all connected to your personal ID and could be managed through a special port. For example, the hologram screen in front of the apartment could be used to purchase or sell real estate, the information will also be synchronized to other areas…" Xiao Yun patiently explained to him.</br>
</br>
Just then, the sticker changed from green to orange, "For sale" turned into "Bid: 10,000".</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"Because the ownership of the property currently belongs to Future Group, all initial sales are done through a bidding system. The level 1 property is only 80 square meters and the starting bid price is 10 thousand US dollars," Xiao Yu explained.</br>
</br>
But because there were a lot of properties, only people that want to live on the same floor bided. The bid must be at the minimum 1,000 US dollars and the deal is locked after three days.</br>
</br>
"It is only 10,000 US dollars?" Wei Wendong murmured to himself.</br>
</br>
"Each user can only purchase one unit of level 1 or 2 properties; only properties above level 3 allow multiple units to be purchased, but there are still restrictions that apply," Xiao Yu reminded.</br>
</br>
From the map, there were 200,000 units of level 1 property on sale, mostly distributed in the outer ring area. The level 2 property had a higher price tag and was closer to the middle of the ring. All in all, the price was higher closer to the center, but there were exceptions. For example, the seaside mansions on the outermost ring were the highest level 5 properties with prices comparable to the center zone.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong checked out the price of the giant tower and was stunned by the number.</br>
</br>
The room at the top of the tower was one billion US dollars, but it had a grey sticker which meant it was sold to the public.</br>
</br>
And the bottom of the tower… that's right, there was a underwater portion of the tower as the entire island was like a gyro and the room deepest in the water was the tip of the gyro. The spiral-shaped room was surrounded by water and had a price tag of ten billion US dollars.</br>
</br>
Still not sold to the public…</br>
</br>
[The price must be randomly inputted! Since they don't plan to sell anyways!] Wei Wendong ridiculed in his mind.</br>
</br>
"What if this city's construction ultimately failed? I remember it is still under construction under water."</br>
</br>
"Future Group will provide a full refund." Little Rain smiled. "Future Group will use its global assets to act as collateral to all investors; we definitely can afford it.</br>
</br>
With Future Group's cash, there was indeed no need to worry about bankruptcy. Wei Wendong with a bitter smile shook his head; he was worried about a foolish question.</br>
</br>
"Will there really be people living here?" Looking at Xiao Yu, he asked the most critical question.</br>
</br>
If a city has only buildings without any people, it is just a ghost city.</br>
</br>
"From the property in bidding, 110,000 people are planning to settle here. Based on Future Group's development plan, the ocean city's development focus will be on tourism and research. Once Penglai City is completed, it will be moved to the central sea region between Coro Island and Ange Island, because there will be convenient transport planes and ships, the residents on the island can freely work on any island in Xin," Xiao Yu then added. "Just like taking public transportation."</br>
</br>
"Like the Venice of the Sea?" Wei Wendong murmured to himself and scanned his surroundings once more.</br>
</br>
The environment here was gorgeous. To be honest, he was tempted. But considering that even if he lived in Wanghai, he could come here through the helmet at any time, his longing for Penglai decreased by a bit more…</br>
</br>
But then, he suddenly noticed a countdown timer at the bottom right.</br>
</br>
"What's the timer for?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, that." Xiao Yu covered her mouth and made an impression as if she almost forgot about something, "This is the time a user can remain in this virtual reality."</br>
</br>
"Time remaining? Wait… that means—"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Xiao Yu flew directly in front of him, stopped, and looked at him with grin, "The advertisement time is only 30 minutes, purchasing property and applying for travel can all be done through the Phantom Helmet. If you want you see Xiao Yu and Penglai City, please wait for its completion."</br>
</br>
[Fu*k! Limited time experience again!]</br>
</br>
But before Wei Wendong finished cursing, everything surrounding him shattered.</br>
</br>
In two short seconds, he returned to the pure white cube.</br>
</br>
Facing the empty virtual reality room, he was speechless for a long time.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 614: The Second Immigration Wave</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The term "Penglai" was first seen in "Lie Zi (The Tale of Lie Zi)" and later in "Shan Hai Jing (The Tale of Mountain and Sea)" and appeared in books such as "Records of the Historian" and "The Ten Continent of the Sea" (1).</br>
</br>
With the thought of spreading traditional Chinese culture, the giant floating city on the ocean was named Penglai by Jiang Chen. As to if the name was the same as a city across the ocean… this is not within his consideration range.</br>
</br>
When the advertisement in virtual reality was pushed to the global virtual reality system, the mysterious underwater construction first entered the sight of the public.</br>
</br>
The entire main structure of the island was a ring five square kilometers in diameter and it looked like a "lifesaver". Arm-thick graphene cables intertwined within the middle, just like the metal skeleton of a skyscraper. Though it was not filled with concrete in the middle and it was relatively light. It was like a special foam aluminum that was more ductile than graphene but less strong. The bearing capacity of the graphene could easily withstand the enormous tidal force without the fortress being shredded apart.</br>
</br>
The finished construction from afar resembled a "Gyro" inserted into the ocean.</br>
</br>
A tall tower standing above the ocean surface; the conical on the bottom was submerged in the ocean.</br>
</br>
It was the most expensive place in the entire city; it was like an inverse pyramid. The more toward the tip, the more expensive it was. And the "tip of the tower", the top and bottom, were not sold to the public because they were private rooms for Jiang Chen himself.</br>
</br>
Three-dimensional island structure, five square kilometers of the island can accommodate up to one million people! Unit population per area could be described as insane.</br>
</br>
The exterior of the ring was designed with connectors which could be used to construct sub islands to connect with the main island via graphene tunnels.</br>
</br>
Even before that, the commotion created by Future Group in the ocean already built up enough hype for them. F first accused Future Group of constructing missile silos with the intention of threatening world peace, then UA's skepticism was followed by the United Nations' intervention. When the world's media zoomed their cameras to the quiet ocean, Future Group gradually unveiled the trump card hidden for a long time and it stood in the eye of the public criticism storm.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible. Don't believe that the computer-generated cinematic could fool us, the Hexagon will closely monitor the situation of the West Pacific Ocean—" The UA spokesperson told the media, Jiang Chen then sent an invitation to the Rainbow Mansion, inviting Hill to personally tour the region.</br>
</br>
Hill didn't attend the trip due to schedule conflicts, but did send out a FBA Agent and an UA experts for investigation.</br>
</br>
But just as they were bringing back first video footage, Future Group conducted the first update of the Phantom Helmet. They installed the voice communication system inside the chat software while installing an advertisement interface below the menu that would not interfere with the user's usage of the system.</br>
</br>
</br>
And the first advertisement was the concept map of the ocean city – Penglai.</br>
</br>
Although the viewing experience was limited to thirty minutes, almost everyone's heart followed the witty mermaid guide to the west Pacific Ocean thousands and even ten thousands of miles away. The sci-fi island; the magically ocean city!</br>
</br>
Like an explosive thunder, "Wall Street Journal" first expressed their exclaimed opinion!</br>
</br>
"The Atlantis of the East! Future Group is creating a miracle!"</br>
</br>
Then, it was "Christian Newspaper".</br>
</br>
"An unbelievable project. If they are not joking with us, then it must be God that's joking with us."</br>
</br>
But doubt still existed for the construction of the century. Jealous people who underestimated Future Group's ability to repeatedly create miracles were still unwilling to accept its marvelous technological abilities.</br>
</br>
The Economic News persistently criticized Future Group and highly suspected the existence of the underwater city. Future Technology defeated Nippon's best corporations in the robot and artificial intelligence fields, which was viewed as humiliation by extreme right wing parties. With the media controlled by them, they of course did everything they could to slander Future Group.</br>
</br>
"An ocean city? That is just a gimmick! Our material scientists stated that no materials could complete the construction of the illogical design! And before the completion of product to sell high risk products to investors is an extremely irresponsible move! Our people will not pay for such a stupid thing!"</br>
</br>
But their own people slapped their face with the high number of purchases for property on Penglai.</br>
</br>
They had enough of the crowded Yoto. Especially the despairing unemployment rate and the widely criticized economic conditions built on printing money.</br>
</br>
Of course, the majority of the immigration source came from Hua with over 50% of the buyers from the maritime region of Hua.</br>
</br>
The halo of high benefits disappeared in Europe that was in a period of unrest, the high barrier and low benefit North America was too difficult, and people with money or technical skill began to look at Xin that was growing incredibly fast. The small country with Han's culture was evolving into the second Singapore.</br>
</br>
Most critically, housing was cheap!</br>
</br>
Ten thousand US dollars was not a small number for most people, but equating to a property, most Han people were willing to open their wallets.</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
Because a lot of people worked for their entire lives without being able to purchase a place in the city they worked in unless they didn't drink or eat, or carried a mortgage for half of their life. Ten thousand US dollars was the price of one Xiao Lin, although a lot of the level one property's final price was bided to fifty thousand US dollars, it was still far lower than the housing price of most cities.</br>
</br>
Trusting the reliability of Future Group's products, a lot of people paid with the idea of trying it out.</br>
</br>
Especially since Future Group did promise that if the buyer was unhappy with the experience or Penglai City ultimately was unsuccessful, they were willing to pay twenty thousand US dollars, double the initial price to purchase back the property in the buyer's hand. The term was written in the purchase agreement with Future Group putting its asset as collateral and letting the government of each country monitor it.</br>
</br>
The export-led business meant that Xin didn't need to rely on real estate nor sacrifice the benefit of its citizens to boost spending. The irreplaceable high tech products made Xin's products impossible to be rejected by the international market. And the tourism industry developed by Penglai injected large quantity of fresh blood into the local economy. With such a natural advantage, Future Group didn't need to sacrifice its support in the country in order to bolster Xin's economy.</br>
</br>
Wall Street analysts' valuation of Future Group continued to skyrocket.</br>
</br>
A lot of investors even ran to Future Group's UA subsidiary, waving bundles of cash. They were hoping to 'gift money' to Future Group.</br>
</br>
With the persistent pestering of the media, Buffet expressed reluctantly that if Future Group was willing to go public on NASDAQ, his fund will consider adding Future Group's stock as part of its portfolio. To the media's question of never touching NASDAQ tech stocks, he could only say to the public, "There are always exceptions to the rule. We have to try to live a new life and accept new things. Do we not?"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"I heard you need immigrants?"</br>
</br>
The Saudi Prince seemed to be very keen on his oriental friend Jiang Chen and called him constantly.</br>
</br>
"The population problem is indeed giving me a headache." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
But the problem will soon be solved with the high demand in the housing presale. After the completion of Penglai, the benefits of a growing population will be realized. As long as Future Group could digest the labor force in a timely manner, they will create value for Future Group ten times the value created by Penglai.</br>
</br>
"We have a bunch of homeless people, why don't I send them your way?" Yerif offered generously.</br>
</br>
"… Are you helping me or are you screwing me over?" Jiang Chen was speechless.</br>
</br>
Infectious diseases, poverty, religion extremists, violence… were all common among refugees. While Xin lacked people, they were not at the point where they were desperate for anyone.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, my friend. Why would I screw with you? It was just a joke." Yerif laughed. "I heard you are building an ocean city on the west Pacific Ocean?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, are you interested?"</br>
</br>
"Extremely! Dubai has a new artificial island project with a price above 20 billion, is Future Group interested?" Yerif asked.</br>
</br>
"No need. We currently don't have experience operating internationally, it would be terrible if we fail you." Jiang Chen euphemistically rejected his proposal.</br>
</br>
Mentioning the bidding process before seeing the completed construction, Jiang Chen knew Yerif wanted to return the favor, but he didn't plan to use the favor here.</br>
</br>
Yerif smiled and didn't mention this further.</br>
</br>
"If the level five property of your ocean city is up for sale, please tell me. I'm really intrigued by the… Penglai City floating on the sea." Yerif didn't' pronounce the words too clearly.</br>
</br>
"Haha, indeed."</br>
</br>
Open level one and two properties were open for presale and part of commercial land. The former was targeted toward immigration while the latter was opened to domestic citizens. Only when the "indigenous people" truly felt the reward will they stand on Future Group's side, protecting the skyscraper piled up with cash and willingly adding bricks and tiles to the massive empire.</br>
</br>
The level three property and above would gradually be put up for sale. As to the highest level five property, it was naturally targeted to the senior executives within Future Group as well as the most wealthy people around the world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen obviously wouldn't reject the rich Saudi client.</br>
</br>
The underwater project burned cash at a rate of 100 million US dollars per day. By the end of construction, it will have burned through 32 billion US dollars which makes it the most expensive artificial floating island in the world…</br>
</br>
But at the same, it will be the most cost-effective and technologically advanced artificial island!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 615: Ridiculous Demand</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Yesterday at midnight, all 200,000 units of level one property were sold out with an average sell price of 111,000 US dollars. The highest final price was 300,000 US dollars." Xia Shiyu's voice shook as she reported to Jiang Chen, but she still tried to keep a stern expression.</br>
</br>
She didn't think that the project that burned through a lot of money would be so profitable.</br>
</br>
Before the construction was even complete, tens of billions were already in their hands and the majority of the capital cost was recovered.</br>
</br>
But she knew that the reason why the price was so high was partially due to the excessive coverage by the media, and partially due to the terrifying promotion capability of the virtual reality platform. One gifted Penglai City investment value while the other gave Penglai City enough room for imagination.</br>
</br>
Even a great branded product has the fear of not selling, not to mention one that is still under construction.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't seem too pleased with the price.</br>
</br>
"The price is bolstered to 300,000 US dollars… it is almost close to the housing market in Hua." Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
Based on his plan, even the level three property that would be open for sale were only starting at 200,000 US dollars. The investors' energy was hard to believe, but the price being bolstered too high may not be beneficial for long term benefits.</br>
</br>
"This is the result of using user's ID to limit purchases. If we didn't restrict each user being able to only one level one or two properties, the average price probably would have doubled. Because of the purchase restriction, it decreased the appreciation potential of the property," Xia Shiyu said, pushing up her glasses.</br>
</br>
"What about the level two property?" Jiang Chen nodded and asked again.</br>
</br>
There were 100,000 units of level two property with a bidding price of 50,000 US dollars; the size is 110-120 square meters; the primary target is the middle class.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu continued to report.</br>
</br>
"All level two units were sold with an average price of 217,000 US dollars; the highest price was 600,000 US dollars."</br>
</br>
[An average price of 10850 RMB per square meter... this is insane. Is this even the housing price of a new developed area? The location of the level two units are not even considered "city center" at all.]</br>
</br>
Other than the concepts of a high tech city, a tourism area, and a high degree of freedom, the investors didn't investigate other factors such as quality of life, education, transportation, work environment at all.</br>
</br>
Although Future Group accepted refunds, it was calculated based on the initial bidding price. Therefore, if someone purchased a level two property with 600,000 US dollars, Future Group will only refund the starting bid of 100,000 US dollars, unless it will be sold to an investor willing to take over.</br>
</br>
"Some real estate developers proposed a partnership opportunity; they are willing to purchase ten thousand units of both level one and level two properties at the unit price of 200,000 and 400,000 US dollars. They also promised to bolster the price of the remaining units to a price of 300,000 and 600,000 , as long as we agree to lift the purchase restriction and permit everyone to possess three units of level one or level two properties." Xia Shiyu continued.</br>
</br>
</br>
"The value created by a worker in a life time is far greater than the value created by a property. We are creating an endless gold mine. If we exchange the gold mine into cash too early, it will be too shortsighted." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
When he was creating Penglai, he didn't plan to make it into a product. Although he admits that bolstering housing prices was the fastest way to make money.</br>
</br>
But if he really wanted money, why not just make Future Group public?</br>
</br>
This is the faster method. With Future Group's profitability, it can easily break the trillion mark…</br>
</br>
Wall Street investors came more than once to him, and even flew to Coro Island to wait for Jiang Chen at the door of Future Building. They wanted to convince him to go public on NASDAQ and everyone believed Future Group's market cap would smash the trillion mark.</br>
</br>
"This is my thought too, so I rejected them for you." Xia Shiyu grinned.</br>
</br>
From Jiang Chen's insistence of remaining private, she already understood his thought process.</br>
</br>
"You know me the best." Jiang Chen nodded while looking at her.</br>
</br>
"Ahem," Xia Shiyu coughed and looked away somewhat red. Then she changed the topic, "Also, regarding the problem with commercial land, over 95% of our clients in the landmark building, The Heart of the Sea, applied to enter Penglai. These companies include hotel, dining, retail, and life sectors. But some companies hoped that the renovation could be done by their own people because of existing contracts.</br>
</br>
"That's not possible," Jiang Chen shook his head. "Penglai's construction material mostly uses bubble aluminum and graphene, the construction and renovation can only be done with construction robots. They'll have to renegotiate the contract."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
"The last is education. We already sent out invitations to 12,300 top teachers from over one thousand schools worldwide. But we didn't receive very positive responses… they seem to remain cautious in teaching internationally."</br>
</br>
Based on the construction plan of Penglai City, there will be fifteen elementary schools, ten junior highs, eight high schools, and one university to provide education services to Xin.</br>
</br>
But the lack of a teaching force was a painful problem.</br>
</br>
It was easy to find elementary and junior high school teachers, but it was more problematic for high school. As to the university professors… only a few computer science professors researching robots and artificial intelligence accepted the invitation without hesitation.</br>
</br>
The professions with benefits, like doctors and teachers, naturally were influenced by qualification requirements and culture backgrounds, therefore their stance to immigrate were more cautious compared to other professions.</br>
</br>
"We seemed to have misunderstood something," Jiang Chen abruptly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Xia Shiyu looked at him.</br>
</br>
"Since we have the Phantom Helmet, why do you need to build schools?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyes lit up but soon her eyebrows furrowed again.</br>
</br>
"I know what you mean; it is in theory possible to use virtual reality teaching to replace classroom teaching. But a school's purpose is not only to educate knowledge; it is also the window for children to get to know society. It is ultimately why online education will not replace classrooms."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"From some perspective, you're right. But from another, it is not completely correct." Jiang Chen paused. "Since our group's name is Future, we are operating in the high tech industry. Thus, as the management team, we must stand at the peak of the new era."</br>
</br>
"Could you be more straightforward?" Xia Shiyu asked.</br>
</br>
"The con of online classroom is reducing the social interaction of children. But if we completely replicate everything in the actual classroom in virtual reality, is there really a reason why classrooms have to exist? We can completely replicate the classroom, podium, blackboard, and tables in virtual reality. Our teachers and students can freely enter the classroom from anywhere. The helmet is the key!"</br>
</br>
"But… that is too risky." Xia Shiyu shook her head. "We haven't completely understood the side effect of replacing a classroom setting. And education is something that will require five or even ten years to verify."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
It was indeed a risky choice.</br>
</br>
On the timeline of the apocalypse, PAC didn't even replace classrooms until the year 2270. He personally experienced it first hand in the virtual reality inside Fallout Shelter 005.</br>
</br>
Despite being technologically advanced, PAC still maximized the amount of old traditions in people's daily lives. They could use the virtual reality study system to master a skill quickly, but they prevented any students below high school to use this system.</br>
</br>
They thought that pushing a person too fast will exhaust a person's potential. The education the student received may help them become a skilled engineer, but they will never be an innovative scientist. Scientific thought process could only be obtained through exploration, and exploration could be experienced by studying.</br>
</br>
Without him noticing, Jiang Chen realized that he became someone that could influence the development of civilization.</br>
</br>
The 22nd century was a mirror where he was fortunate enough to see the other side, but there was no need to go on the old path.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath, suppressed the odd emotion in his mind, and expressed his decision with an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Cancel the previous plan of building elementary, junior high, and high schools, change the original building locations into a square, gymnasium and other facilities. Set Penglai City as the pilot city for 'basic education in virtual reality'. All students within Penglai will use the student version of Phantom to receive basic education.</br>
</br>
"Teachers don't need to immigrate to Xin. They only need to pass through the hiring process set by the Penglai Education Department before being permitted to teach at any location and receive the agreed salary. Education content will be monitored and audited by both human and artificial intelligence and any non-qualified content will result in deduction of a teacher's score. When a teacher's score reaches zero, and teacher's qualification is removed. Also, student examination will be done offline and recorded into their personal profile."</br>
</br>
"The class distribution software will divide student based on race and hometown to learn basic knowledge with teacher of the same mother tongue. All students must command the official language as well as another language. Based on the student and parents' willingness, small quantities of 'international class' and 'advanced class' will be established for special education."</br>
</br>
"All basic education will be required to volunteer in public facilities such as squares and gymnasiums and all credits must be met before being permitted to complete the semester."</br>
</br>
"Virtual reality classroom and virtual reality social program will be developed by Future Technology."</br>
</br>
"University will be taught offline using the current education method."</br>
</br>
"That's all… for now."</br>
</br>
Using virtual reality to teach, but not using the virtual reality study system and instead replicating the traditional classroom.</br>
</br>
It was an attempt different from that world…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 616: It“s Time!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Penglai City continued to spark attention on international media and social media platforms, and the most direct impact to Xin was the exponentially increasing amount of tourism. The number rose from 200,000 at the beginning of the month to 410,000 by June of that year, equating to an increase of 205%.</br>
</br>
It was certainly heavenly news for Future Tourism's CEO, Wei Yun. Following the increase in tourism, Heart of the Sea's financial report could easily break the 200 million USD promised to Jiang Chen with ease.</br>
</br>
The remaining 200,000 square meters of leasing space was fought over by major international retailers. Clients who were already settled in were secretly glad they made the decision early to "buy at the dip" when Coro Island's traffic was low. Otherwise, they would be fighting like their colleagues over a few square meters of retail space.</br>
</br>
An enormous amount of pedestrian traffic packed the luxurious landmark building, but despite the crowdedness, people were still eager to visit this symbol of luxury and comfort. This wasn't only the case for Heart of the Sea - people were also eager to explore the beaches of Coro Island, the narrow sandy islands, and the complex sea maze.</br>
</br>
The tourists all uploaded their vacation photos onto their social media accounts and expressed their fascination with the area.</br>
</br>
For example, they posted onto their Moments page on WeChat.</br>
</br>
"This place is no different than my hometown. The air is just fresher, the environment is more beautiful, the roads are wider, the internet speed is faster, the housing prices are unbelievable… The official language of this place is the same as my hometown, I feel like I'm in the Hawaii of the East."</br>
</br>
For example, on Twitter.</br>
</br>
"This place has permanently free Wi-Fi that covers the entire country! Oh God, this is heaven for us. Our president should really learn from Jiang Chen; our state should have permanently free Wi-Fi inside our borders! Does she not know we'll die if we don't have Wi-Fi!"</br>
</br>
For example, on Facebook.</br>
</br>
"This is so hot - so much hotter than Moscow. I have to drink champagne all day just to cool off. *Burp* I swear, I'm only drinking so I can cool off. I'm not drunk at all! Are you not going to try? I heard their champagne is made with tropical fruits; this is so addicting…"</br>
</br>
Of course, people were most interested in the rumored Penglai City!</br>
</br>
Was the city currently under construction really as magical as Future Group described it to be?</br>
</br>
Smart travel agencies who smelled business opportunities from the public's curiosity introduced scuba diving activities near the west Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
The theme of these scuba diving tours was to explore the mysterious Penglai City.</br>
</br>
Because it was a military zone, personnel not associated with the area weren't permitted to approach the construction sites, but Celestial Trade didn't evict the civilian ships outside the territory.</br>
</br>
</br>
This was Jiang Chen's decision.</br>
</br>
People were filled with curiosity or suspicion about the mysterious Penglai City. If they managed to satisfy the curiosity of tourists and resolve their suspicions that Future Group was hyping up something fake, they would definitely pass the information back to their own countries and become firm supporters of the tale of Penglai.</br>
</br>
If Celestial Trade hindered tourists from coming, it could kill off their interest toward the country.</br>
</br>
And Xin needs tourists!</br>
</br>
Especially since normal scuba diving equipment couldn't submerge to a depth of 500 meters, there was no concern that tourists could interfere with the construction. However, if they approached the material drop off zones or went directly above the construction sites, Celestial Trade's submerge devices would evict them.</br>
</br>
Under the guise of safety concerns.</br>
</br>
But because there were too many tourists, soldiers couldn't keep up with the traffic, so Ivan had to report the status to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was fine.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately gathered all travel agencies with business in Xin and held a brief meeting.</br>
</br>
It was concluded that it was okay to tour Penglai, but viewings were only permitted to occur in the outer radius of the construction. Once any travel agencies were caught taking tourists inside the military zone, the tourists wouldn't be punished, but the guilty travel agency would be documented. After three occurrences, the travel agency would be on Future Tourism's blacklist.</br>
</br>
Being on the blacklist meant there would be no way for them to continue to conduct travel business in Xin.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, the bosses of the travel agencies immediately called for internal meetings back at their own companies. From today onward, all scuba diving equipment touring ships visiting Penglai City would be connected with a rope. While the rope was heavily criticized by scuba diving enthusiasts, it was a rule strictly enforced by all travel agencies.</br>
</br>
The reason was that no one wanted to get on the wrong side of the giant Future Group!</br>
</br>
Time quickly flew to mid-June.</br>
</br>
With summer approaching, the tourism industry welcomed a peak period.</br>
</br>
What was more exciting was that on Future Tourism's official site, the first level four unit was open for bidding!</br>
</br>
It was a three-story mansion located on the beach sitting on the outermost ring of Penglai City. It was built with a garage, pool, and a private dock for a small private yacht! The starting bid price was 5 million US dollars!</br>
</br>
Penglai City's housing prices skyrocketed and the unbelievable speed of appreciation made the people who lost the opportunity to purchase properties resentful and envious. This time, no one wanted to miss the opportunity. With Future Tourism's purposeful marketing scheme, the not-so-luxurious mansion was sold at a price of 70 million US dollars!</br>
</br>
Because units above level three had no purchase restrictions, it made all investors who believed in the value of Penglai drool over the property.</br>
</br>
Combined with level one and two unit as well as the commercial spaces sold previously, it brought an astonishing 61.7 billion US dollarsin revenue to Future Group! In Xia Shiyu's words, it was like robbing money.</br>
</br>
The tightened cash flow situation because of the construction of the New Malaysia Special District and Penglai City was quickly alleviated by this injection of capitals.</br>
</br>
While the presale of Penglai's real estate was a miracle, Future Heavy Industries' Xiao Lin also demonstrated a stellar performance.</br>
</br>
With the completion of the New Malaysia Special District, over 500,000 units of Xiao Lin were manufactured monthly. Its monthly net income also broke the 1 billion US dollars mark. Xiao Lin managed to completely dominate the home robot and adult toy markets.</br>
</br>
With the intention of building off this momentum, Future Heavy Industries announced to the media that it would cooperate with Future Biology to develop medical robots to deliver clinical doctors to everyone's homes.</br>
</br>
The Phantom Helmet, housework robots, and pure electric vehicles with high mileage… a lot of people began to develop a taste of the future in their daily lives.</br>
</br>
While they were enjoying the rapid speed of innovation, everyone was contemplating something in their minds.</br>
</br>
What would Future Group change next?</br>
</br>
Their sights shifted back to Future Biology, which had entered the medical industry.</br>
</br>
The vaccine for the T virus was shipped to 11 countries worldwide. While people's fear began to retreat with the passage of time, the 200,000 vaccine units produced per month far exceeded the market demand.</br>
</br>
The entire vaccine market was split by Future Biology and Tanaka Pharmaceutical.</br>
</br>
After five months, quite a few other pharmaceutical companies also managed to develop similar anti-virus medications.</br>
</br>
Some companies even stated that they controlled the technology to turn zombies back into humans, but there were no zombies now to prove the efficacy of their technology. Jiang Chen scorned the idea since even the apocalypse didn't have the technology to revive the dead, let alone pharmaceutical companies in the modern world. Humans were dead the moment their immune systems were destroyed by the T virus; the infected hosts were long deceased from this world.</br>
</br>
People who stated they could revive humans were only trying to build off the publicity.</br>
</br>
Kurofune seemed to have gone into a period of hiding. The Ghost Agent sent to Yoto didn't manage to find any traces of Kurofune but reported an interesting piece of information. CIB was contacting the Nippon government and was currently in the process of investigating Tanaka Pharmaceutical.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the CIB agents searching for the fighter jet pilot on MLL Island also began to retreat.</br>
</br>
The UA seemed to have noticed something.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen didn't know if it was for better or worse, he didn't have the energy to figure it out.</br>
</br>
He had been directing his energy in the modern world for too long.</br>
</br>
According to Sun Jiao, things on the apocalypse side were well rested, and resting any more would cause the muzzles in the soldiers' hands to rust.</br>
</br>
It was time to start expanding!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 617"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 617: But why did he feel almost thrilled at the same time???</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The TV in the dining room was playing the news. Jiang Chen got into the habit of watching the news during breakfast when he came to Coro Island. Lately, he always saw Future Group in the news.</br>
</br>
"We welcome Xin's Ocean City project with our warmest wishes. The two countries are connected by blood with inseparable cultural ties. Penglai will become the point of cultural and economic exchange between us and we hope that the two countries can continue to develop through peace and achieve eternal friendship!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned off the TV and shoved the last bit of scrambled eggs into his mouth then he went back to his room to change before heading outside.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to go to work today.</br>
</br>
Precisely speaking, he wouldn't go to work in the next few months.</br>
</br>
Everything in the apocalypse was taken care of; the development of the New Malaysia Special District was on the right track along with the mining operation in Moro taken over by Future Mining, and a triangular industry chain was established between Ange Island, MLL Island, and Papua Island.</br>
</br>
There was nothing Jiang Chen needed to strategize further.</br>
</br>
After nearly a year of rest, things in the apocalypse were ready. It was time to expand the territory of NAC!</br>
</br>
When he arrived at the gate, the modified Lamborghini was waiting for him at the door.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was in the car. Her suited appearance with sunglasses looked sharp as always.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen entered the car, Ayesha drove off.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going?"</br>
</br>
"The underground warehouse."</br>
</br>
"Are you transporting supplies to that side?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… I'll probably be gone for a bit longer this time. I'll have to count on you to take care of things on this side."</br>
</br>
Ayesha's delicate fingers took off her sunglasses. She turned her face and met Jiang Chen's request with earnestness; she nodded.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry."</br>
</br>
Whenever Jiang Chen traveled to the apocalypse, only Ayesha could get into contact with him. If he had to make a decision on behalf of Future Group, Xia Shiyu would message Ayesha before Ayesha relayed the information to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen trusted Ayesha, and she never betrayed his trust.</br>
</br>
The vehicle soon drove onto the ferry at the port before arriving at Ange Island. The car drove along the highway for ten kilometers before coming to a stop in a quiet rural area. Beside the Ange Mountain in the middle of Ange Island was a small military inspection station.</br>
</br>
Behind the inspection station was a hollow cave. After the modification of construction robots, the cave was composed of tens of thousands of square meters of interior space.</br>
</br>
The place was previously used to store the BM-21 purchased from Russia. After the successful development of "Fireball-1," the secret warehouse was temporarily abandoned.</br>
</br>
Afterward, because Xin gradually obtained recognition of the international press, UA and other countries increased their intelligence-gathering work in Xin. To avoid secrets being leaked, the previous warehouses at the south port were abandoned. Therefore, this warehouse was officially renamed "Xin National Strategic Supplies Reserve Center" and became the distribution center between the two worlds.</br>
</br>
</br>
Every week, food and mining supplies were transported into the cave. There were also occasional container-sealed kinetic skeletons, power armors, and Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannons being transported out and shipped to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
Aside from the four Celestial Trade soldiers stationed at the gate and Jiang Chen, no one else was permitted to approach the inspection station.</br>
</br>
The highest level of security was offered inside the cave.</br>
</br>
Five Reptile robots and ten Python drones were used to patrol the area and attack any unidentified units attempting to enter the cave. The transportation of supplies was conducted through the construction robots with a maximum security level.</br>
</br>
With the disguise of the mountain, even spy satellites couldn't get a glimpse of their activities. UA experts suspected that the location was a secret military factory of Celestial Trade since there were living supplies and manufacturing supplies being transported in and military equipment transported out, but the CIB agents were still clueless about the internal structure.</br>
</br>
No one could sneak in with the intensive security measures.</br>
</br>
Ayesha stayed outside to keep watch while Jiang Chen walked into the cave alone. After he delivered everything, he still needed to return to the mansion as he wanted to make his travel point his home, not the desolated cave.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gazed at the warehouse full of supplies. He picked up the supplies list from the construction robot and briefly glanced through it.</br>
</br>
800 tons of grain products, 400 tons of easy-to-store vegetables, 300 tons of dairy products, 200 tons of canned food, 100 tons of preserved food, and fresh meat stuffed into tens of giant freezers… as well as some snacks.</br>
</br>
For some strange reason, spicy strips sold extremely well on the wasteland. The evil food made out of preservatives and gluten had long gone extinct in the 22nd century, but it was reintroduced by Jiang Chen as an interdimensional traveler… Of course, this was out of the context of the story.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed at the mountain of supplies and put on the bracelet designed by Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Once the Garden of Eden was completed, this general no longer needed to be a farm mover.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The supplies from the modern world were still piled in the backyard of the mansion. NAC officials were no longer shocked by their general's ability to magically transport supplies from the outside. It wasn't that no one was interested, but people were afraid to probe deeper. They were afraid that if they learned something they shouldn't have known, the private force may shut them up for good.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen handed to list to Wang Qin then returned to his bedroom before traveling back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
When he returned to his home in the modern world, he laid down on this bed and adjusted his "save point" before initiating travel again.</br>
</br>
As soon as he came back to the wasteland and before he could gain his footing, he was "chewed on" by Sun Jiao, who flew toward him.</br>
</br>
With the warmth pressed against his chest and gorgeous face in front of his eyes, Jiang Chen's breaths began to shorten and his mind turned flirtatious.</br>
</br>
If it wasn't for someone else standing beside them, he would've had the impulse to "finish her" right here.</br>
</br>
"Sister has been missing you dearly since you haven't been on this side for a long time. She's been thinking 'What if he doesn't want to come back to this side anymore?' 'Is he unhappy that he didn't get to eat the small animal?' She also says 'Don't leave…' at night along with some other strange murmurs at night—" Sun Xiaorou, in a light purple dress, stood there with her hands behind her back with a pure smile on her face.</br>
</br>
"Shut up, idiot!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gave her sister a hard stare, but the response she got was just her sister's pure and innocent look.</br>
</br>
The two sisters were both mischievous and naughty.</br>
</br>
"Sorry."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hugged her slim but athletic waist and gave apologies to the beauty in his arms.</br>
</br>
Although he had visited this side in the past half year, had dinner with the girls, shared intimate moments with Sun Jiao and Sun Xiaorou, examined the work of NAC, observed the training of the three divisions, and took away high tech products…</br>
</br>
But just as Sun Xiaorou said, he hadn't been here for a long time.</br>
</br>
Since he set his focus on the modern world and the political crisis of MLL Island made him exert too much energy. During negotiations with UA, he almost threw all his chips on the bargaining table. The quantum satellites, robots, and Penglai all made him completely occupied.</br>
</br>
"I don't want to listen to your apologies." Sun Jiao gazed into his pupils with her arms around his neck.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently kissed her lips. He sensed her affection.</br>
</br>
Their lips parted.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao curled in front of Jiang Chen's chest and her eyes briefly scanned her sister behind her out of embarrassment before quickly looking away.</br>
</br>
"Hmm… Garden of Eden is almost complete; the environment here can't be worse compared to your home." The next words came out with great difficulty: "Could you… not abandon this side?"</br>
</br>
"How could I abandon this side?"</br>
</br>
This was his second home.</br>
</br>
"Woah! So devious. I want to kiss brother-in-law as well." Sun Xiaorou timidly shook her dress and blinked playfully at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Ahem… could you not call me that?" Jiang Chen face-palmed.</br>
</br>
The title brother-in-law made him feel extremely guilty.</br>
</br>
But why did he feel almost thrilled at the same time???</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With a cute pink apron around her waist and dressed in a pair of white rabbit slippers, Yao Yao brought out some steamy hotpot in excitement and walked in front of the table with hasty steps.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao had always been the meticulous one.</br>
</br>
On the contrary, Lin Lin was the complete opposite.</br>
</br>
With a pair of chopsticks in her hands, Lin Lin stared at the fresh vegetables and meat with a delicate tongue half hidden between her lips.</br>
</br>
"WOAH! We have hotpot! Delicious hotpot~"</br>
</br>
"Don't just wait to eat - help Yao Yao out."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took apart the packaged food "magically" and lay the beef strips, still with ice shards present, onto the plate. Jiang Chen mocked Lin Lin, who was staring eagerly at the food.</br>
</br>
The preservation function of the storage dimension was extremely powerful.</br>
</br>
"No, it's okay." Yao Yao's face quickly turned red when Jiang Chen showed care for her. Her lips murmured, "It doesn't take a lot of people to prepare hotpot; having Sister Xiaorou to help is more than enough."</br>
</br>
"Did you hear that? Yao Yao said it's okay." Lin Lin proudly lifted her chin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, speechless.</br>
</br>
He didn't understand she had to be proud of.</br>
</br>
Just as Yao Yao said, preparing hotpot didn't require a complicated procedure.</br>
</br>
The family gathered around the dinner table. It didn't take long before the soup began to boil.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's actions were swift as she put vegetables into the hotpot. It gave her satisfaction to see the food she put into the hotpot turn into deliciousness as someone who didn't know how to cook.</br>
</br>
This was the joy of eating hotpot.</br>
</br>
Of course, the most fulfilling part about eating hotpot was the family gathering together to talk while sitting together.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was glad he chose to reveal the secret to Sun Jiao and Yao Yao and stopped weaving a "beautiful lie."</br>
</br>
One lie would lead to ten more lies to keep up the lie.</br>
</br>
The moment the lie is exposed, the rift created with the people one cared about isn't something that could be fixed with mere apologies.</br>
</br>
Unlike now?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was able to sit in front of the dinner table and use a casual tone to freely discuss what happened in that world. He looked at their envious expressions and listened to their opinions about this other world. Jiang Chen spoke about Future Group, MLL Island, and finally, Kurofune.</br>
</br>
"Kurofune? How could someone be so dumb? If they want to become bugs, just do it themselves." Sun Jiao popped out her tongue and tossed a spicy beef strip into her already reddened mouth before she chewed with joy.</br>
</br>
Compared to the herbivore, Yao Yao, Sun Jiao was the definition of a carnivore.</br>
</br>
Of course, because of the effects of the genetic vaccine on metabolism, she would never get fat from eating.</br>
</br>
"Well, that's not entirely accurate." Compared to her sister, Sun Xiaorou's opinion was more compassionate. "I heard that before the war, NATO used democracy to launch a propaganda attack against PAC and successfully caused a riot in South East Asia. Sister Junhua lead a mechanized infantry to suppress the riot there?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"A riot… is different from Kurofune." Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"It's the same." Lin Lin put down her chopsticks. With a casual tone, she said, "Humans have always had unrealistic fantasies about the outside world. Conquering foreign provinces, foreign countries, and now, escalating to extraterrestrial civilizations on a cosmic scale… it's the same thing. How could they live? How could they solve the problem we're facing? That's something to long for… That's basically the idea. Distance creates beauty, and any fascination with beauty is almost always blind."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin with surprise.</br>
</br>
"Why... why are you looking at me?" Lin Lin began to feel embarrassed under Jiang Chen's direct stare; her face began to heat up as she responded with a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"I didn't think Lin Lin would say something so deep." A smile appeared on Sun Jiao's face as she joked.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao also nodded with agreement and looked at Yao Yao in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"That's enough! I'm a scientist at least! Don't look at me like that - I'm older than all of you guys added together! And I'm not the type that slept for twenty years!" Lin Lin, covered in a red hue, spoke while tossing about her tiny fists.</br>
</br>
Everyone began to laugh. Sun Xiaorou, who was sitting beside Lin Lin, gently caressed her head. "For a girl, being old isn't something to brag about."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's mouth pouted while she relished Sun Xiaorou's caress. She didn't say anything else.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao took a swig of the coke and said nonchalantly, "The world beyond the stars seems to be far away."</br>
</br>
"Yes… it's hard to imagine," Yao Yao agreed in a meager voice.</br>
</br>
"Compared to distances in space, distances in time is even more fascinating… I don't even know if I'll be able to see the final showdown in a hundred years," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"That might not be true." Lin Lin's ears wiggled and she raised her head. "There are plenty of ways to increase your lifespan…"</br>
</br>
She turned her head out of shyness and said with textbook tsundere, "Since… if you die too early, I… I'll get bored."</br>
</br>
The life of digitalized humans was much longer than humans. The more sophisticated the modifications, the longer the lifespan.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process that before he chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Why-why are you laughing?!" Lin Lin was slightly angry.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin is a very honest girl," Xiaorou said with a smile. Her eyes radiated an intrigued light.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao will also be lonely!" Yao Yao raised her hand with courage without backing down.</br>
</br>
Because of her delayed growth, Yao Yao, who was supposed to be undergoing puberty, hadn't grown at all. Based on what Lin Lin said, with her current growth speed, she would still be a little loli in ten years.</br>
</br>
In theory, her life would also be long.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao sighed and said with her usual straightforwardness, "Then everyone will live forever together."</br>
</br>
"Sister, from a different perspective, eternal life is also a curse." Xiaorou's words had a more profound meaning.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Living eternally is considered a curse?" Sun Jiao said without feeling bothered.</br>
</br>
"But to be with someone interesting, even for an eternity, it wouldn't be boring. Right?" Xiaorou peeked at Jiang Chen before letting out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Eternal life…</br>
</br>
For people with power, it was indeed attractive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly remembered the secret about eternal life from Bo Yu at the Dusk Church. He suddenly looked at Sun Jiao and asked, "Sun Jiao, where is your home… Fallout Shelter 071?"</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 071? Oh, well... it should be near Hucheng. Why?" Sun Jiao chewed while tilting her head to think.</br>
</br>
"I made up my mind!" Jiang Chen suddenly stood up. "The destination we'll conquer will be Hucheng!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen peculiarly as she swallowed down her food.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure? Hucheng is 500 kilometers from here!"</br>
</br>
The path was filled with zombies, mutants, raiders, mutated humans, and cannibals… Powerful lone travelers or a merchant fleet protected by mercenaries might purposely traverse such a long distance while barely managing to survive, but in order for a large unit like an army to travel such a long distance, it created an immense logistical pressure.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen responded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Don't forget, we have a steel airship!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 619: WAR!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hundreds of meters in the air, the NAC flag waved.</br>
</br>
The first ray of light scattered in the darkness of the night. The light of the dawn lit up the steel monster.</br>
</br>
Airship (AS) Order.</br>
</br>
The word was engraved on the polished steel surface.</br>
</br>
It was a monster that conquered the sky. The steel chimney on its back blew out white clouds and the extended cannon barrel on the bottom fearsomely aimed straight ahead!</br>
</br>
It was a specialized electromagnetic pulse cannon designed for AS Order, known as "The Hammer of Order." It could launch bombs up to 100 kilograms in weight with a firing angle of up to -70 degrees. The fire suppression range could reach an astounding 350 kilometers!</br>
</br>
It was the primary long distance weapon used by AS Order!</br>
</br>
The bottom was equipped with hive-shaped "Fireball-1" launchers capable of unloading 200 rounds of missiles per minute to unleash devastating attacks on long distance ground targets while making the friendly logistic team cry and suffer. Four 12.76mm anti-air machine guns made up for deficiencies in close-range combat. Two anti-missile laser devices could intercept most missiles.</br>
</br>
These were all the weapons on AS Order.</br>
</br>
Due to its massive size, low mobility, and lack of protection in the air, AS Order could only provide limited firepower at a great distance from the battlefield. But aside from providing firepower, this steel monster's strength was in providing long-range transportation. As an aerial aircraft carrier, it allowed for the quick deployment of land forces.</br>
</br>
On the danger-filled soil, no other unit flying above the clouds was suited for long-distance travel.</br>
</br>
Power armors, kinetic skeletons, rifles, RPGs, ammunition…</br>
</br>
Countless numbers of weapons were loaded into the belly of the monster through slings to complete battle preparations.</br>
</br>
Out of space-saving considerations, the airship was only supplied with liquid food. The nutrient supply produced in Ange Island had far superior taste and nutrients compared to the nutrient supply made out of "zombie juice" and mutant fruits from the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Be careful! You're loading combustion bombs! If you make any mistakes, I promise you'll turn into fine dust!" A supervisor with an official cap yelled at the elevator. He ordered the few slaves to load the missiles onto the sling before pressing the bell.</br>
</br>
Following a weak electric static noise, the sling was hauled onto the airship.</br>
</br>
At the top of the observation tower in Camp 27, Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes while observing the airship from afar.</br>
</br>
"Why don't we use robots?"</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu stood by the general. He immediately responded to the question.</br>
</br>
"Based on what Wang Qin said… in order to prevent problems, we need to find things for the slaves to do."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
It made sense.</br>
</br>
But compared to the rapid expansion of the modern world, the apocalypse possessed technology without the ability to convert it into production. Just looking at the people manually transporting the supplies, it was hard to imagine that this was the 22nd century.</br>
</br>
</br>
For example, with continuous supplies from MLL Island and New Malaysia District, Ange Island's robot factory could produce up to half a million robots per month. Although the housework robot's technological capabilities weren't "high," compared to the service robots from Sixth Street, it could be considered a functional toy.</br>
</br>
But the factories on Sixth Street weren't anywhere close to producing up to half a million units.</br>
</br>
It was the same for the Phantom Helmet.</br>
</br>
If they didn't use 3D printing and without considering the cost, they could, at most, produce one million units per month, but the production in the modern world was twenty times that number!</br>
</br>
At the same time, the modern world's technology couldn't produce the T-series power armor and K1 kinetic skeleton. While the production capabilities of the apocalypse were low, the process and manufacturing technology was ridiculously high.</br>
</br>
"How are preparations for the conquering going?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"We can depart at any time," Wang Zhaowu answered while standing tall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded again.</br>
</br>
He was pleased with Wang Zhaowu's work and it made feel more assured about this long distance journey.</br>
</br>
From the beginning of the year, NAC conducted spring recruitment with each division expanding from 2000 people to 5000 people. The entire NAC's force now consisted of 15,000 people which made them a substantial force in Asia.</br>
</br>
After his return, he adjusted the deployment of the three divisions.</br>
</br>
From the Sixth Street to Shenxiang Town, the First Division, led by Cheng Weiguo, was responsible for the defense of the entire Wanghai region. Cheng Weiguo was one of the first survivors who followed him and he became the division leader of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't need to worry with him guarding the home base.</br>
</br>
The Third Division was led by Zhao Gang, another survivor who followed Jiang Chen since the inception of the Fishbone base. He seldom spoke and prioritized relationships above all. Jiang Chen helped him and in return, he swore allegiance to Jiang Chen. After this adjustment, he was stationed in Jia City and guarded the southwest corridor to Wanghai as well as important trade routes to the south.</br>
</br>
This mission was given to the Second Division.</br>
</br>
While the 500 tons of payload wasn't small, the load associated with every individual soldier approached 200 kilograms. This included the equipment, ammunition, and supplies, not to mention the weight of the soldier.</br>
</br>
In order to maximize its battle capabilities, the massive airship was only made up of 400 soldiers, 50 crew members and 20 logistics members. At the same time, the supplies of the steel airship were carried by non-combat blimps.</br>
</br>
All the soldiers chosen to participate in the conquering were the elites of the Second Division. They previous participated in the mutant flood, rescued Fishbone base, attacked the city center, and were all seasoned veterans. They were equipped to their teeth with kinetic skeletons with impeccable equipment and morale.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen acted as the captain with Wang Zhiwu second in charge.</br>
</br>
After the end of the conquering, the next captain and second in charge would be chosen based on their achievements in battle. At the same time, the airship would be preserved as an independent battle unit outside of the three divisions, like the Hunter Division.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed as he watched the ascending dawn and airship in the middle of preparations. His mind was filled with mixed emotions with a curvature appearing on his mouth.</br>
</br>
"General, please examine the soldiers." Wang Zhiwu stood firmly beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was the third time Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He turned around and faced the uniformed soldiers in the square of Camp 27 as well as their countless raised heads…</br>
</br>
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, his eyes widened.</br>
</br>
He allowed the raging blood in his chest to unleash with his roar.</br>
</br>
"Gentlemen!"</br>
</br>
"I like war!"</br>
</br>
Without extraneous words, without uplifting commitments, Order's curtain was brutally ripped apart.</br>
</br>
"To bring civilization to shambles!"</br>
</br>
"To put the shackle of order on the barbarians there!"</br>
</br>
"To use the weapons in hand to spread the flag of NAC to the heart of the wasteland!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was met with thunderous roars as well as rifles raised high!</br>
</br>
"War—"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 620: Ten Thousand Meters Above</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"WAR—"</br>
</br>
The soldiers' roars pierced through the air above Camp 27.</br>
</br>
The slaves transporting the supplies stopped their work, trembling and dumbfounded as they gazed in the direction of the camp. The soldiers on patrol placed their fists in front of the emblem on their chests, silently raised their hands in front of their forehead, and saluted to their departing comrades.</br>
</br>
The roars echoed in the square and in the hearts of every NAC citizen.</br>
</br>
The salutes from the residents of Camp 27 from the bottom of their hearts demonstrated their respect to the parting soldiers and their general.</br>
</br>
Standing at the front of the row, Han Junhua, who was looking at Jiang Chen, carried an apathetic expression under her cap.</br>
</br>
With her right hand gently squeezed in front of her chest, Yu Lu's gaze staring at the observation tower was mixed with a hint of intoxication…</br>
</br>
Everyone boarded the airship.</br>
</br>
With a mixture of emotions, the soldiers bid farewell to their families and stepped onto the deck of Order after taking the elevator. Under the watchful gaze of the survivors of Wanghai, the steel monster ascended, broke through the depressing clouds, and began to move toward the heart of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Inside the captain's room, Jiang Chen made orders through the radio.</br>
</br>
"Angle 220 degrees, speed 40 knots, push forward!"</br>
</br>
"This is the power room, roger. The turbine engine output has been increased to 75%... engine ramped up."</br>
</br>
With the force from the turbines at the end wings, the airship adjusted its course. Following a negligible vibration, it began to accelerate.</br>
</br>
At the same time, captain Jiang Chen, second-in-charge Wang Zhaowu, advisor Han Junhua, and captain of the General Protective Force, Sun Xiaorou, were inside the captain's room.</br>
</br>
War was always the best method to increase one's reputation, and it was the only way for Jiang Chen, who couldn't appear in front of the public often, to maintain his reputation.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he decided to take on the role of captain on AS Order and lead this conquering!</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
With the procedure completed and flight course set, everyone returned to their rooms, leaving only Wang Zhaowu inside the captain's room.</br>
</br>
Right now, standing inside the tiny room, Sun Xiaorou stared at the clouds outside the small circular window and sighed.</br>
</br>
"We only managed to be together for such a short period of time before having to separate. Sister Sama must be sad being at home alone."</br>
</br>
Based on the recommendations of advisor Han Junhua, Jiang Chen accepted her proposal after careful deliberation.</br>
</br>
Based on the intelligence brought back by Zhao Chenwu, Hucheng wasn't occupied by a powerful military force and lacked anti-air weapons that posed a threat to Order. Therefore, the risk of this conquering was low and presented significance in terms of establishing a point of influence outside the province.</br>
</br>
</br>
This was the first time NAC stepped out of Suhang province.</br>
</br>
Thus, their "first time" should be under the name of the general.</br>
</br>
But Sun Jiao, as Miss General, had strong opinions about Jiang Chen leaving immediately after coming back. She demanded Jiang Chen to bring her along.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen wanted to bring her.</br>
</br>
But without him there, someone had to remain at the Office of the General. Only Sun Jiao could play that role.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Sun Jiao had to take a step back and allowed her sister to accompany Jiang Cheng on her behalf.</br>
</br>
She was meant to protect Jiang Chen's safety since Sun Xiaorou's combat abilities weren't bad.</br>
</br>
The other goal was to prevent him from doing anything unsafe.</br>
</br>
"'Sister Sama' is a peculiar way to call her." Jiang Chen, standing beside the table, flipped through the notebook in his arms while commenting nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
The notebook included the things he had to be aware of during this trip to Hucheng, the intelligence collected by Zhao Chenwu's merchant fleets, and information on the mercenary union managed by Zhou Guoping.</br>
</br>
&lt;"empire" and="" "federation"="" are="" the="" two="" local="" forces="" fighting="" over="" control="" of="" the="" hucheng="" nuclear="" fusion="" station.="" note:="" our="" strategy="" could="" be="" to="" form="" an="" alliance="" with="" one="" or="" destroy="" both=""&gt;</br>
</br>
The last note wasn't written on paper but remembered in Jiang Chen's heart.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, the bedroom of the captain is quite big." Sun Xiaorou's hands were behind her back. She strolled to the soft bed before patting the bedsheet.</br>
</br>
Due to space-saving considerations, normal rooms slept four people. Aside from a two-foot wide walkway, there was only a table beside the window along with two bunk beds attached to the wall… Rather than say they were beds, they were more like sleeping bags. Only senior officials could sleep in a room alone, but their rooms were still extremely small with the beds only slightly better than sleeping bags.</br>
</br>
Only the captain's room was slightly more spacious with room to store some private luggage.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"I'm hungry. When are we going to eat?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou was clearly displeased with Jiang Chen's reaction, but she wasn't discouraged. With her hands behind her back, she gently walked behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
She bent down and whispered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"… It's a rare chance for us to be alone. Why are you so boring?"</br>
</br>
Her warm breath blew into his ear, turning Jiang Chen's neck into a shade of red.</br>
</br>
A smirk appeared on Sun Xiaorou's face while she stared at his red earlobe.</br>
</br>
She enjoyed the feeling of bullying the person her sister liked, seeing him blush because of her. This ambiguous sense of morality gave her an inexplicable joy.</br>
</br>
Judging by how they treated food, it was evident how the two sisters differed in personality and attitude toward life.</br>
</br>
With a piece of delicious cake, compared to her sister's way of "stuffing the cake" with one bite, Xiaorou enjoyed smearing the sweet vanilla around her lips and using her tongue to slowly savor the taste…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen started to have a reaction. He closed his notebook.</br>
</br>
Or rather, when Sun Xiaorou seductively straightening the bed, Jiang Chen was already resisting. Since he still needed to discuss the strategy with Han Junhua later, he thought it would be disrespectful to smell weird.</br>
</br>
But the warm breaths in his ear blew away the rationality in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law? No… you can't do this. You've only been separated from sister for less than an hour." With her back smashed against the bed, Sun Xiaorou lightly pushed Jiang Chen while naughtily "escalating" the situation and playing innocent at the same time.</br>
</br>
The uniform on her body made her uncomfortable and her voice was intermixed with a soft moan.</br>
</br>
"Could you not refer to me like that?" Jiang Chen said fiercely.</br>
</br>
The word made him feel guilty.</br>
</br>
Although Sun Xiaorou couldn't move under Jiang Chen, she still blinked playfully.</br>
</br>
"Nope."</br>
</br>
"You'll regret it!"</br>
</br>
"What are you doing? Brother- wooo…"</br>
</br>
The tense giggle soon turned into a seductive shout and echoed inside the steel room. Along with the engine roaring outside the window, the sound traveled further and further ten thousand meters in the air…&lt;/"empire"&gt;</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 621: Battle Plan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The airship quickly left Wanghai behind.</br>
</br>
When it flew above the Taifu River, a lot of soldiers saw with their EP the Garden of Eden captured by the observation pod.</br>
</br>
It was a semispherical structure several kilometers in diameter; the transparent graphene board reflected a colorful ray under the afternoon sun.</br>
</br>
The serving NAC soldiers more or less heard about how the Garden of Eden could recreate the most stunning scenery from before the war.</br>
</br>
The survivors also heard that they could experience life before the war through virtual reality, but in the heart of the survivors, they still wished they could really live in that environment and not lie among shambles while reminiscing the past.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After finishing with Sun Xiaorou who couldn't even move her finger, Jiang Chen tucked her in and organized his clothes before leaving the room.</br>
</br>
He still needed to discuss the point of landing and contacting the different forces with Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen pushed open the door of the conference room, Han Junhua was already standing in front of the long table. It seemed like he had been waiting for a while.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I'm late." Jiang Chen scratched the back of his head, pretending to act calm while stepping inside.</br>
</br>
"No worries."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't' seem to mind. He pressed a button on the table and opened the hologram map.</br>
</br>
But just then, she suddenly sniffed and looked at Jiang Chen expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"There is a weird smell… did you put on cologne?"</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen facepalmed and then coughed to divert the topic. "Let's not talk about this and get to the point. I want to listen to your opinion regarding this mission."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded, put her hands in front of chest, and pointed the laser pen on the map.</br>
</br>
"Based on the information brought back by the Zhao Corporation merchant fleet, there are a total of 310,000 survivors in Hucheng with a medium level mutant threat and a high density of raiders. The west bank of Panyang Lake is scattered with some farms producing mostly mutated fruits, as well as bullet shell grains transported from Wu City. Also, because it is the capital of the province, a lot of technological resources and damaged production equipment worth collecting are buried underneath the shambles.</br>
</br>
"Based on the plan, the first step is to establish a military outpost locally to create a supply point. The second step is to establish an airship landing tower near the post and then set up a survivor's camp there as the last step."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua put her arms in front of her chest again. Her voice still pierced with the unchanging coldness of the frozen glacier.</br>
</br>
"The fourth step is eliminating the mutant nests and declare control of the Hucheng area. Any resistance will be wiped out."</br>
</br>
War is always the best diplomatic strategy on the wasteland without order.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen concurred with Han Junhua's strategy.</br>
</br>
</br>
But if possible, he still wanted to approach this with peace. Although he declared "I like war" in front of the soldiers, to be honest, he didn't think war is ever good.</br>
</br>
"Permanent residents? That's more than double Wanghai's population…" Jiang Chen exclaimed at the numbers on the map.</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily. After absorbing slaves from the giant slave pit, the population of Sixth Street reached 80,000. Without considering the shadow population, the total population has exceeded 200,000 already," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
Looking at the labels of the few survivor camps, Jiang Chen continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"What's your recommendation on Empire and Federation?"</br>
</br>
"Befriend one side, disrupt the balance of the local forces. After disrupting the situation, establish a new order," Han Junhua said without changing her expression.</br>
</br>
"Does it need to be this problematic?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"This is related to logistics and supplies. The airship's payload is limited. While housing 500 individuals, it can carry kinetic skeletons, power armors, Aurora-20s, and transport helicopters. There are only five rounds of the 100-kilogram bombs with around 200 missiles onboard," Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
"Don't we have light blimps supplying us?"</br>
</br>
"This is then a cost problem," Han Junhua said. "If possible, before we establish a supply point, we have to do our best to collect supplies. Including the construction material of the material outpost and the airship landing tower."</br>
</br>
"So we have to contact the local forces," Jiang Chen said deep in thought while scratching his chin.</br>
</br>
Obtaining supplies was not difficult for him.</br>
</br>
It was not possible on the airship because of the payload restriction.</br>
</br>
But on land, he just needed to return to the modern world to be able to obtain a large number of supplies.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Han Junhua nodded. "On the other hand, based on the consideration that we're planning to conquer the place and not raid or destroy it, we must limit the battle to a certain degree."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The discussion of the future for the Hucheng survivors quickly came to an end.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returning to the bedroom, he was surprised to discover that Sun Xiaorou tidied up the messy room. Her previous restrictive uniform became a casual purple long dress. If it were not for the unnatural blush on her face, it was difficult to spot a trace of that "battle".</br>
</br>
"Eh? You've recovered already?" Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Not at all, my body is still sore. You're so rough, brother—"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou's face quickly turned red when looking at Jiang Chen's half-smiling expression before she closed her mouth.</br>
</br>
With her state now, she had no energy left to make dirty jokes.</br>
</br>
"Hmm, it's dinner time now."</br>
</br>
"That's right. Are you not going to go back and drink your nutrient supply now?" Jiang Chen jokingly said.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law is the best." Sun Xiaorou with a grin, hugged herself around Jiang Chen's arm, and timidly rubbed her face on his arm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen heard the abnormal vocabulary again as he rolled his eyes with defeat, he then magically took out two pizza boxes.</br>
</br>
He purchased them from the restaurant of Future Building.</br>
</br>
He ordered twenty boxes which completely stunned the chefs there.</br>
</br>
"How did you know I would bring food?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, brother-in-law never mistreats the people he cares for." Sun Xiaorou then pointed at the microwave on the desk. "Also, nutrient supply doesn't need to be heated."</br>
</br>
"Go back after you finish. We should arrive at the destination by midnight. Get a good night's sleep. We still have to do work down there tomorrow morning." Jiang Chen stuffed the pizza into the microwave as he spoke.</br>
</br>
Already sitting beside the table, Sun Xiaorou dangled her pale and delicate feet and grinned, "What is brother-in-law saying? My room is right here."</br>
</br>
"Don't be naughty. We have to get up early." Jiang Chen sighed and brought the two steamy pizzas back to the table.</br>
</br>
"Then we have to sleep early."</br>
</br>
With her arms supporting her chin, Sun Xiaorou stared at the heated bacon pizza adorably, the soft tongue hid between her lips while she murmured ambiguously.</br>
</br>
"Making sure you are full is the order of Sister Sama."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down his fork, speechless.</br>
</br>
Looks like he can't eat dinner anymore.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When night came, the soldiers dove into their sleeping bags before dozing off into dreamland.</br>
</br>
Inside the captain's room, Wang Zhaowu yawned as he confirmed the map for the last time before initiating cruise control. Then he pulled down the bed on the wall. The size of his room was too narrow and he was too lazy to go back and sleep. Therefore he made himself comfortable inside the sleeping bag there before his thunderous snore began to echo inside the room.</br>
</br>
AS Order sailed above cloud nine steadily.</br>
</br>
Passing through Hang City, flying over the Yellow Mountain, and setting sail in the direction of Hucheng…</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 622: Water Treatment Plan Thugs</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hucheng, located west of the Panyang Lake, was a relatively developed inland city of the PAC before the war.</br>
</br>
But after the nuclear war, everywhere was the same.</br>
</br>
Even the prosperous Wanghai could not escape the doomsday nuclear strike.</br>
</br>
But the people that lived here were more fortunate than the people of Wanghai. The invasion and nuclear strike all began in the coastal area, therefore they had time to scatter, enter into the fallout shelter or evacuate with the army to inland.</br>
</br>
Right now, on the desolated shambles.</br>
</br>
The rural area east of Hucheng, beside an abandoned concrete plant, a Death Claw was using its sharp claws to dissect the stomach of a survivor and used its long tongue with back spikes to lick the red organs.</br>
</br>
The person's eyeballs were dug out and from the still whimping mouth, he was not completely died. The pool of blood also proved this point. From the fresh red color, the Death Claw should have started to eat not long ago.</br>
</br>
Just then, a suppressive "cloud" arrived above the lucky Death Claw.</br>
</br>
The sunlight that suddenly disappeared pissed off the Death Claw having its meal, so it raised its neck slowly and looked to the sky.</br>
</br>
The amber colored pupils suddenly contracted, the dumbfounded Death Claw even slowed its mastication.</br>
</br>
"Boom—"</br>
</br>
The air was instantly pierced.</br>
</br>
The dust scattered around the area and flew up five meters tall.</br>
</br>
Rounds of bullets were instantly unleashed and shredded the Death Claw along with the poor corpse into pieces.</br>
</br>
"Kill confirmed."</br>
</br>
With his thumb moved away from the trigger, the soldier in front of the computer closed the safety and answered.</br>
</br>
Monsters are monsters after all.</br>
</br>
The Death Claw that could fight the power armor could not even last half a second from the "trigger press" of the pilot.</br>
</br>
"Landing spot confirmed. Human signal detected in the nearby water treatment plant. Suspected to be a raider group. Best luck, commander."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the radio. In the kinetic skeleton, he turned around and looked at the soldiers of his personal force.</br>
</br>
The soldiers were the elites of the army, led by Sun Xiaorou. Although there were just ten of them,they each could use their equipment to easily take care of five times the foes.</br>
</br>
"Okay, gentlemen, pay attention."</br>
</br>
"Now below us is Hucheng! We don't know if the people in the water treatment plant are friends or enemies, we are going to meet them now."</br>
</br>
"Remember the procedure. Open the safety, put your backpack on, and tighten your shoelaces. Understood?"</br>
</br>
"Understood!"</br>
</br>
The soldiers of the general protective force stood straight and tall with fists holding the emblem in front of their chest.</br>
</br>
"Now, let's depart!"</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen opened the valve to the hatch, and jumped out…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k, what is that?" A man with a cigarette in his mouth peeked his head out of the window while nervously looking at the steel airship.</br>
</br>
</br>
"AS Order… What is that, why is the name ugly."</br>
</br>
A bald man was oiling his machine gun while cursing out.</br>
</br>
"I have seen the NAC symbol before. They are from a base from Wanghai," another thug said.</br>
</br>
"Psychos, why did they come so far." The cigarette man looked at the Death Claw shredded into pieces with lingering fear.</br>
</br>
The water treatment plant thug was a quite renowned raider group in the region. They occupied the water treatment plant and after they closed the valve that supplied water to the region, they sold purified water to the local survivors at a high price. At the same time, they were in the human trafficking business and occasionally robbed merchant fleets.</br>
</br>
Because of their strong combat ability, even "Empire" and "Federation" must be cautious and avoid in-depth interactions with them.</br>
</br>
The leader of the heinous villains was a woman…</br>
</br>
"You guys are so rowdy. You don't even know how to patrol properly. Don't you know there is an important client coming today?"</br>
</br>
A sluggish voice drifted from behind their backs, making the man drop his cigarette onto the ground in fear.</br>
</br>
Wearing a crocodile leather jacket, the hot figure barely hidden under the scraps of clothes, a woman with red hair casually strolled to the door.</br>
</br>
The sleeve of her jacket was stained with blood, just like her red nails. Her messy hair stuck together into chunks; her appearance could be described as a form of raunchy beauty.</br>
</br>
It was just that no one other than the raiders appreciated this form of beauty.</br>
</br>
The machine gun man kneeled at the wall quickly scanned their leader's long legs before erasing his disrespectful look.</br>
</br>
The scorpion's nature was evil, promiscuous.</br>
</br>
But even then, this "juicy meat" was not something the small thugs could eat. The people fortunate enough to hook up with the venomous "female scorpion" were either important members of the clan, or at least strong and powerful. For example, the man behind her…</br>
</br>
His head was engraved with a centipede long scar, the vicious triangular eyes scattered a bloodthirsty light.</br>
</br>
Jiang Xiaoyou, a lone traveler active in the Panyang Lake region, used a sniper rifle and mastered the art of dagger usage. He was hired by Wang Xie to act as her gunman. He would occasionally receive service from his employer, or make him and another man serve her, he never rejected the requests.</br>
</br>
Decency was something only a few lone travelers had.</br>
</br>
Everyone had their own standards, and his standard was just different from other people.</br>
</br>
Wang Xie's narrowed eyes stared outside the window.</br>
</br>
The sucker that died outside was the second in command of her clan, he was planning to overthrow and quarantine her. Fortunately, Wang Xie discovered his plot and killed it in its cradle. She used her nails to dig out his eyes before feeding him to the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
The red on her nails was not nail polish, it was bloodstains.</br>
</br>
But the Death Claw only started its meal before the poor guy escaped his agony.</br>
</br>
The airship that suddenly intruded disrupted her punishment to the traitor, the hailstorm of bullets shredded them into grounded meat.</br>
</br>
She had heard the name NAC before, but it was from the merchants and mercenaries heading east. From the respectfulness in their voice, it made Wang Xie feel slightly eerie, especially from the odd looking airship, it made it even more difficult for her to understand the strength of the NAC.</br>
</br>
If it were another force that offended her, she would have taken her raiders to fight already. But for the unknown force, she chose to remain cautious.</br>
</br>
"Something dropped down from that airship."</br>
</br>
The cigarette man pointed outside the window and shouted.</br>
</br>
The machine gun man along with his buddy looked lost as they stared at each other, not knowing what to do.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Xiaoyou, go take a look from the top floor. If they approach without listen to the warning, take them out." Wang Xie ordered.</br>
</br>
The man nodded and silently headed upstairs with his sniper.</br>
</br>
With Jiang Xiaoyou as the sniper, Wang Xie felt assured. While the bullets from the sky were terrifying, they were not necessarily afraid enough to hide inside their bunker.</br>
</br>
Then, she opened the radio beside her ear and shouted crankily at the thugs of the water treatment clan.</br>
</br>
"No. Six, take the brothers out and ask why they are here! No. Five, bring out our cannon and set it up. If they dare to flinch, shoot down that mofo in the air for me!"</br>
</br>
"Yes Ma'am!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 623: A Disagreement that Resulted in Violence</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Stomp, stomp!</br>
</br>
Twelve figures landed onto the firm ground with force.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood up with his arms pressed against the ground. He moved his limbs covered with hardened steel and then pressed the digital screen on his right arm a few times. The hologram map expanded and the observation pod hung below the airship synced the aerial map of the water treatment plant to his control panel. Light ripples scanned across the map and marked the red dots.</br>
</br>
There were 142 people in total.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, they didn't install life signal jammers in the base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and his force were wearing the newly research K2 kinetic skeleton. Without decreasing the mobility, it maximized the defense of the external skeleton. In exchange, the cost of the K2 type was four times the K1 type.</br>
</br>
And because of this, only the General's private force was equipped with this type of kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
"All units have landed," Sun Xiaorou walked beside Jiang Chen and spoke gently.</br>
</br>
"Perfect." Jiang Chen was about to order to move forward when he suddenly saw a few red dots leaving the plant and approaching them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised a fist to signal the soldiers to be on alert.</br>
</br>
Not long after, ten thuggish-looking people walked up.</br>
</br>
When Sun Xiaorou saw the appearance of them, she almost burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
Only a few wore a bulletproof vest, some had a piece of steel dangling in front of their chest, and even some's clothes were torn apart, not much better than hobos. As to the weapons in hands, they were mostly homemade rifles, common among survivors.</br>
</br>
The only weapon that looked okay was the assault rifle in their leader's hand.</br>
</br>
While infuriated by Sun Xiaorou's expression, Six examined the equipment of these people and then glanced at the airship high in the air, and he intelligently controlled himself.</br>
</br>
"Where are you all from? What's your purpose of coming to our clan's territory?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Sun Xiaorou exchanged glances and communicated via the private channel.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen: "Raiders?"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou: "Looks like it… should we fight?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen: "Wait, I still need to ask them a few questions.</br>
</br>
Six had a grave expression seeing that the two "weirdos" equipped to their teeth didn't speak.</br>
</br>
There was no one on the wasteland that dared to disrespect the water treatment plant clan like this, even "Empire" and "Federation" with power armors in the city were respectful when they came to negotiate.</br>
</br>
"Hello, my boss is talking to you!"</br>
</br>
A muscular man with tattoos on his face stared Jiang Chen down viciously while shouting at him.</br>
</br>
The raiders were not afraid of the kinetic skeletons they are wearing. Even with the homemade rifles, as long as they are loaded with armor-piercing bullets could penetrate their armor, they are unfearful unless they encountered power armors.</br>
</br>
</br>
"You're the boss of this place?" Jiang Chen ignored the small pawn and looked at the person in the front, intrigued.</br>
</br>
"No, not me," Six thought about the man with his eyes dug out and his back was instantly covered in cold sweat, so he quickly clarified.</br>
</br>
But then, he met Jiang Chen's intrigued eyes.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, I'm asking where you came from—"</br>
</br>
Six's expression suddenly froze.</br>
</br>
The black muzzle was pressed against his forehead.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him expressionlessly and the Reaper assault rifle was in his hand.</br>
</br>
The sudden unexpected changes caught the raiders of the water treatment plant clan completely off guard. The thugs, seeing their boss was pointed at by a gun, immediately raised their rifles and entered a standoff with Jiang Chen's force.</br>
</br>
"Our clips are loaded with armor-piercing bullets, do you want to try?" Six was dripping with cold sweat with both his hands raised, his calmness sounded forced.</br>
</br>
Jiang Xiaoyou, at the top floor of the water treatment plant, zoomed in as he didn't see how Jiang Chen pulled out his weapon. While he was shocked, the sniper rifle's crosshair locked onto Jiang Chen and he waited for his employer's order.</br>
</br>
Right now, Wang Xie standing in the water treatment plant had her arms crossed in front of her chest, her focus switched between the airship and the group with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
The turn of event surprised her; the opponent was way too confident.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't seem to mind his threat. Just as he was about to interrogate for some useful information, the voice of the airship communicator entered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"We detected a 40mm cannon inside the plant. They are setting up the cannon and attempting to aim at us. On the fifth floor of the building directly in front, we detected an enemy sniper."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression turned into a sneer, he suddenly changed his mind about interrogation.</br>
</br>
[If you're asking for death.]</br>
</br>
[Then, go die.]</br>
</br>
"Other than the person I'm aiming at, take the rest out." Jiang Chen changed to the public channel and ordered the execution.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The four gunners thousands of meters high in the air opened the safety after receiving the order. They pressed the trigger after locking onto the targets.</br>
</br>
Six was secretively relieved seeing Jiang Chen didn't dare to shoot.</br>
</br>
[Since the enemy is afraid to shoot, that means they are afraid of us…]</br>
</br>
"Boom—"</br>
</br>
The screech of the sound barrier being broken instantly destroyed Six's confidence. The deafening bullets made his head dizzy.</br>
</br>
When the dust dispersed, he saw the cuts on his face from the shrapnel, the contemptuous smile, and the black muzzles. Six couldn't stop shaking, but he couldn't even make a sound.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he felt his pants were wet. The stained yellow between his legs made his face instantly turn to an ugly red.</br>
</br>
"I already said… there is nothing to talk about with raiders." Sun Xiaorou let out a sigh and gently pulled out her gun. "Regardless, we'll have to fight."</br>
</br>
If the hideous raiders didn't use the sympathy of the fallout shelter residents, the sisters wouldn't have been separated for so long.</br>
</br>
"Leave a few alive; one is not enough."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen advised the vicious looking Xiaorou and signaled a soldier before pointing at the completely shocked hostage.</br>
</br>
The soldier with contempt walked forward and used his rifle to kick and drag the raider that wetted his pants onto the road. Then he took out a graphene handcuff and tied the sucker to a lamppost.</br>
</br>
There was smoke coming from the water treatment plant in the distance. The machine guns on the airship could clean out the thug clan that had the audacity to challenge them. Whether it was the sniper or the cannon hidden inside the bunker, they all could not escape the hailstorm of bullets.</br>
</br>
A grimacing smile appeared on Jiang Chen's face as he watched the black smoke rise. He then pressed on the radio of his helmet.</br>
</br>
"Airdrop crew, prepare yourselves. Kill the bugs for me!"</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 624: From the Sky</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Intense shaking came from the roof.</br>
</br>
Wang Xie used her hand to block the dust that had fallen from the ceiling while keeping her balance against the wall. Dry coughing, she opened her radio and screamed into it with a sharp voice.</br>
</br>
"What are you all waiting for! Shoot them! Return fire!"</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes!" The thugs immediately crouched beside the window and fired at the approaching figures with their weapons.</br>
</br>
Wang Xie gritted her teeth in fury. Her harsh face twisted together without any sense of beauty.</br>
</br>
Six was captured; Jiang Xiaoyou on the roof probably didn't get too lucky either. While she agonized over the loss of her two fighters, she was beyond furious.</br>
</br>
[They dared to fire without any warning!]</br>
</br>
[My 40mm cannon will fu*k you up!]</br>
</br>
With teeth gritted, she waited for a while but the sound of the cannon firing didn't arrive.</br>
</br>
Wang Xie's face turned pale white.</br>
</br>
Could it be that they took out all three targets along with the 40mm cannon…</br>
</br>
"B…Boss, what, what do we do?" The cigarette man looked back at Wang Xie, shaking uncontrollably, with fear written all over his face.</br>
</br>
"What can do we? They only have twelve people, FIRE!"</br>
</br>
Wang Xie's order was mixed with a psychotic scream. She immediately turned around to run inside the plant.</br>
</br>
Her years of experience struggling on the wasteland told her that the power displayed by the airship was not something the thugs at the water treatment plant clan could resist. The ability to instantly lock onto the sniper and the cannon hidden in the shadows meant that the enemy must possess superior aerial observation capability. And her pawns…</br>
</br>
Only a bunch of lousy pawns…</br>
</br>
The bullets with orange sparking tails jumped between the water treatment plant and the empty ground. The NAC force used the assistive aim module inside the K2 kinetic skeleton to reap the life of the raiders inside the plant.</br>
</br>
At the same time, followed by the eerie blue light arcs, ten T-3 power armors descended from the sky.</br>
</br>
Based on this airdrop capability, the kinetic skeleton was no match for the metal giants.</br>
</br>
With control, the ten pairs of steel boots stomped through the roof of the water treatment plant and directly invaded the top floor. The shockwave of the impact lifted the raiders up into the air and the firepower of the tactical rifles turned the bodies into pieces.</br>
</br>
Just a glimpse of interaction but Jiang Chen noticed ten red drops disappeared on the hologram map.</br>
</br>
"This is the airdrop platoon. The top floor is cleared out. Waiting for further instructions."</br>
</br>
"Push down and clear the enemy targets on the fifth, fourth, and third floor," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Followed by the weapons roar, they announced another round of slaughter.</br>
</br>
Because of the reuse value of the equipment in the water treatment plant, AS Order didn't use weapons such as missiles to assist the combat. The four machine guns along with the ten T-3s were more than enough to take out the pawns.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen with his private force stepped inside the water treatment plant, the sound of firing began to scatter in the entire building.</br>
</br>
The raiders curled behind the bunkers all dropped their weapons at the face of the suppressive firepower. They ran and they surrendered.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fired the rifle while opening the speaker on the helmet.</br>
</br>
"We will spare anyone that surrenders. Anyone else will be executed on spot!"</br>
</br>
It was an order not only directed to the soldiers behind him, but also against the opposing raiders.</br>
</br>
Just in a short moment, the infamous water treatment plant clan bowed down at the feet of the NAC.</br>
</br>
The airship dropped a pod connected with graphene cables and transported down some of the infantries of the Third Division and some logistics personnel. They began to establish a military outpost on the empty plot of land beside the water treatment plant. At the same time, Jiang Chen's people gained complete control of the water treatment plant.</br>
</br>
Below a water tank, the airdrop platoon discovered the hidden Wang Xie.</br>
</br>
A Knight wearing power armor dangled Wang Xie by the neck and threw her to Jiang Chen's feet.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen didn't agree with treating a lady with such brute force, he didn't feel any compassion for someone that committed such atrocities.</br>
</br>
He touched his chin, took out a notebook, and flipped to the page with information on the forces of Hucheng. He then examined the woman on the ground.</br>
</br>
"You are the… umm, the leader of the water treatment plant clan? Wang Xie? Why do you have such a funny name?"</br>
</br>
Wang Xie gulped while trembling in fear, through her messy hair she saw the man in front of her with fear written in her eyes.</br>
</br>
With a heinous life, she knew she wouldn't have a good ending. Similar to the previous leader that was killed by her in bed, she knew she would be replaced by the next person. But she didn't expect the day would be here so quickly. She finally climbed up from being a despicable slave to her position today.</br>
</br>
She was still young. She didn't want to die!</br>
</br>
The fear in her eyes quickly turned into flattery, she used her hands and feet to crawl beside Jiang Chen. Just like a dog, she pleaded without any dignity.</br>
</br>
"Please, please don't kill me, I…" She had a hint of hesitation in her eyes, but quickly she gritted her teeth and the hesitation in her eyes changed into seduction, "I can be your slave. My skills are great. I can definitely make you thrilled…"</br>
</br>
She said while kissing Jiang Chen's shoes.</br>
</br>
Wang Xie's pleasing action took Jiang Chen a moment to process.</br>
</br>
He didn't think as the leader of a force, she could commit an action without any dignity.</br>
</br>
Contempt flashed across Sun Xiaorou's eyes. She gently closed her eyes, and the finger beside the trigger silently opened the switch.</br>
</br>
Smoke dispersed from the muzzle.</br>
</br>
Blood burst out from Wang Xie's mouth. Her eyes widened in disbelief as blood gushed out of her mouth.</br>
</br>
Gradually, she stopped moving.</br>
</br>
A daunting blood hole was on her frail neck.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I misfired." Sun Xiaorou rolled out her tongue and closed the safety.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh and kicked away the bloodstained face.</br>
</br>
"Tell me before you fire. You stained my shoes."</br>
</br>
[Whatever, there are plenty of captives.]</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Inside the spacious basement, Jiang Chen saw water treatment plant clan's "collections".</br>
</br>
Naked bodies watched from the cage without any spirit in their eyes, they didn't react to the strangers that stepped into the basement. Some were cuffed down and some were tied down to torture equipment. From the bloodstains on the equipment, it was not difficult to see the cruelty that happened there.</br>
</br>
It was no different than the basement of the Huizhong Mercenaries; the raiders were typically associated with human trafficking and naturally, the hideous sex slave trade existed. The unfortunate women came from nearby fallout shelters, or survival camps, or from merchant fleets, or were lone travelers…</br>
</br>
The genetics of the 22nd century people were quite superb and it was difficult to see someone ugly. The "collections" included some gorgeous women, and the uncivilized raiders wouldn't give up the opportunity to enjoy them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen furrowed at the atrocities within the basement.</br>
</br>
The stink filled the air along with the smell of mold. It was nauseating.</br>
</br>
The boots felt sticky stepping onto the ground, the tiles on the floor reflected a greasy color and it looked like blood and fat that was unable to be washed away. It was a prison for the slaves; no one would clean this place.</br>
</br>
"What do we do with them?"</br>
</br>
"If we can save them, send them to Fishbone Base Welfare. If we can't, end their misery."</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law is compassionate." Sun Xiaorou gently whispered beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Am I compassionate? I'm just not committing unnecessary evil. Especially with so many single men in the NAC, this is also another part of the consideration."</br>
</br>
The men to women ratio on the wasteland were abnormal. While the birthrate was the same, the survival rate was completely not on the same level. Although the people that became the slaves of the raiders suffered greatly both psychologically and physiologically, with NAC's medical technology, and with proper care, they could eventually recover.</br>
</br>
The slaves recused from Huizhong Mercenaries were mostly married by now. This included the wife of the Sixth Street's director, Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
The people struggling in the apocalypse were not picky in some aspects.</br>
</br>
"No need to explain." With hands behind her back, Sun Xiaorou grinned.</br>
</br>
"…" Jiang Chen chose to stay silent.</br>
</br>
When they were alone together, she was surprisingly more active compared to being inside the mansion.</br>
</br>
Speaking with Sun Xiaorou subconsciously made the depressed feeling less noticeable.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen strolled inside the prison before surprisingly discovering a man. The man was naked on top but was still wearing pants. He had a cut on his forehead and was chained to the chair, looking lifeless.</br>
</br>
From the redness still visible on his face, he didn't stay there too long.</br>
</br>
When the man noticed the noise outside, he immediately raised his head.</br>
</br>
When he saw that they were not the raiders, he immediately had an expression where he looked like he was saved.</br>
</br>
"I'm thankful for the ideology of the Federation. Friends, thank you for saving me."</br>
</br>
"You should be thanking the ideology of the NAC. I'm not from the Federation," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
The person's expression numbed for a split second before he laughed in awkwardness.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I thought… Wait, you are from the NAC?"</br>
</br>
The man seemed to have suddenly realized something. He looked like Jiang Chen with an expression as if he just saw a ghost.</br>
</br>
"That's right. Is there a problem?"</br>
</br>
"No, nothing." The man shook his head and smiled at Jiang Chen. "I'm just surprised since Hucheng is 600 kilometers from Wanghai… The Federation did hear about the NAC before and said they are a powerful force. It is indeed true after witnessing what happened today."</br>
</br>
"Even if you don't try to flatter me, I'll still let you go." Jiang Chen shrugged while joking with him, "So, you are the sex slave of Wang Xie?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 625: Empire and Federation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng was not a sex slave; he was a parliament member of the Federation.</br>
</br>
The reason why he was in prison, based on what he said, was due to an accident.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had been wondering about the Federation.</br>
</br>
In the modern world, his hometown was beside Hucheng. Because he visited it quite often, he thought it was just a small place. And in this small place, there existed two forces.</br>
</br>
Federation? Empire?</br>
</br>
Just from the names, it sounded much more authoritative than the NAC.</br>
</br>
Could it be that Hucheng in this world is bigger? But from the map, he didn't seem much of a difference compared to the modern world.</br>
</br>
"We are different from the evil Empire, they are just bunch of raiders, thugs, or even mutated humans gathered together. We are superior to them in terms of technology and structure." The parliament member immediately became passionate when Empire was brought up.</br>
</br>
Right now, he already changed into his previous suit and sat across from Jiang Chen in the building of the military outpost.</br>
</br>
Before the conversation started, Jiang Chen expressed that he was the captain of AS Order, representing NAC to discuss cooperation and trade. The parliament member immediately expressed his welcoming attitude when he heard Jiang Chen came with peace. He strongly recommended for Jiang Chen to work with the Federation and stay away from the evil Empire.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then I'll take what you have said for now." Jiang Chen nonchalantly wrote a few things on the notebook, spun the pen in his hand, and used the tip to tap on the table, "I have one point I don't understand. In Wanghai, the mutated humans are the enemy of all survivors, we view them as equal to the cannibals. Why does Empire… accept them?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen first wanted to use the word tolerant, but he changed his mind.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng took a swig of the tea and savored the taste. He never drank such delicious tasting tea before. The fresh aroma was not something mutated tea could produce.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's question, disdain appeared but quickly faded from his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Accept? Ha! Those bastards forgot the basics of human dignity. But they are not to be blamed. Raiders are raiders after all. Perhaps they sense something familiar from the mutated humans?"</br>
</br>
"We need objective information," Jiang Chen said in frustration.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng became more collected when he heard the annoyance in his voice.</br>
</br>
"To put it simply, they establish rules on their own territory. For example, since mutated humans are naturally violent, they permit the mutated humans to use 'limited violence' on inferior people, and refer to that as the intimacy of the family." Ji Yucheng scorned.</br>
</br>
"That's a weird rule. If it were Wanghai survivors, they would have flipped the table and pulled out their weapons already," Wang Zhaowu standing on the side interrupted.</br>
</br>
"The situation at Hucheng is different from your side. You are the primary battlefield before the war, where the concentration of mutants and the number of firearms left behind is much higher compared to our side. You probably noticed that the people of the water treatment plant clan all used homemade rifles," Ji Yucheng explained.</br>
</br>
</br>
"How big is there territory?"</br>
</br>
"From the west bank of the lake all the way to Gan River. Half of the city is under their control."</br>
</br>
"Population?"</br>
</br>
"150,000."</br>
</br>
"They control more than half of the Hucheng survivors. Looks like you are weaker compared to them?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng quickly added.</br>
</br>
"That is not necessarily the case. They occupy the most fertile land, befriended the mutated human tribe, and put the shackles around normal survivors. While we are at an advantage in terms of equipment, they have a lot more people. And especially…" The parliament member hesitated but then continued.</br>
</br>
"They are discussing allowing cannibals to eat humans so they can join forces."</br>
</br>
Perhaps he thought his response was not objective enough, so he glanced at Jiang Chen before carefully added, "Of course, only cannibal's slaves are permitted to be eaten."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Wang Zhaowu were stunned.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to ask about the Federation?" Ji Yucheng asked in a whisper.</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen negated him. "We'll personally go and take a look."</br>
</br>
"I'm willing to be your guide," Ji Yucheng said fawningly.</br>
</br>
"We'll talk about this later." Jiang Chen waved him off in annoyance.</br>
</br>
Just then, Sun Xiaorou in her kinetic skeleton came inside the room.</br>
</br>
"There are survivors outside of the outpost. They say they are ambassadors from the Federation."</br>
</br>
"Is it Xu Chengwei?" Ji Yucheng's eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou looked at Jiang Chen and received confirmation from his eyes. She then nodded. "I think that's the name."</br>
</br>
"He is the advisor for our president; I can introduce you to him." Ji Yucheng looked at Jiang Chen with his white teeth showing. "He should be here to negotiate with the water treatment plant clan. But now that I'm saved by you, the ransom should belong to you."</br>
</br>
"We don't think you can pay a lot of ransom. As the payment for saving you, I'm only going to ask you two things," Jiang Chen took out the notebook from his pocket, "Quantum computer research institute. Doctor Sun."</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, Ji Yucheng couldn't give Jiang Chen a satisfactory answer.</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun was at the capital of the Federation, other than that he knew nothing. As to the quantum computer research institute, he never even heard about it before.</br>
</br>
But Advisor Xu made up Jiang Chen's regret and gave satisfactory answers to both questions.</br>
</br>
"The quantum computer research institute is located inside Empire and is controlled by Qingyun High Technology Park with security robots around the perimeter. Other than some quantum computer production technology and equipment before the war, there is nothing worth salvaging."</br>
</br>
To most of the survivors, the sophisticated quantum computer offered no value.</br>
</br>
"Doctor Sun is currently living in Qingshan Arena, the capital declared by the Federation. Based on rumors, Doctor Sun is not a human, but instead a digitalized human. He has lived inside the arena for eighteen years without any change to his appearance. The lone travelers and merchant fleets hold high praises about him, whether it is his medicine or his character."</br>
</br>
"Very intriguing information." Jiang Chen nodded, pleased, "thank you for your cooperation, Advisor Xu."</br>
</br>
"My pleasure." The tall and slim man shook his head. He then scanned the door before lowering his voice. "But in return, we hope you can do us a small favor."</br>
</br>
"Go ahead. As long as I can help you."</br>
</br>
"The head of Ji Yucheng."</br>
</br>
"No problem… wait, what did you say?"</br>
</br>
"He is currently in your hands so it should be pretty easy for you right?"</br>
</br>
The glasses on his nose reflected a menacing light. The triangular eyes resembled a snake's.</br>
</br>
Xu Chengwei put a stuffed bag on the table.</br>
</br>
"There are 310 points of crystals inside, Mr. President wants to buy his life."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 626"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 626: A Worthless Person in Imposing Attire</br>
</div></br>
</br>
310 crystals…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw Xu Weicheng putting the bag of crystals on the table, his mouth twitched and he resisted the urge to laugh.</br>
</br>
This was equivalent to a poor man asking a rich man: do you want to make 10 dollars?</br>
</br>
Seeing as Jiang Chen had no reaction, Xu Weicheng was silent before he took back the sack of crystals. "Please consider it carefully. If you're willing to help us with this small favor, you'll gain the friendship of the president."</br>
</br>
The advisor of the Federation courteously bowed before departing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen deliberated the words of the advisor before making the decision not to execute Ji Yucheng.</br>
</br>
The guy was quite unlucky; he thought the people from the Federation were there to save him, but it wasn't a ransom they brought. Instead, it was money to purchase his coffin. It was also the "President's" executive order.</br>
</br>
News of the destruction of the water treatment plant thugs quickly spread.</br>
</br>
The local survivors all exercised enough caution toward the mysterious but powerful foreign organization, NAC. It was only when they discovered that NAC had no other motives and just built walls below the airship that they started to loosen up.</br>
</br>
The bolder villages sent their men out and attempted to approach the camp. When they confirmed they weren't under attack, the local survivors started to interact with the soldiers in kinetic skeletons.</br>
</br>
They had to do that.</br>
</br>
Because of the sudden spike in the "tribute," their water supply had been cut for a long time.</br>
</br>
While they were close to the Gan River, the water in the wasteland wasn't drinkable. This was due to the greenish-yellow cloud in the air. Without the ability to access purified water from the water treatment plant, they could only hope they had powerful stomachs to supplement the meager amount of distilled water.</br>
</br>
"We're hoping you could open the water valve of the water treatment plant. Our village has lost access to water for half a month… Of course, we'll pay." An elder in a grey jacket handed Jiang Chen a bug containing only a few crystals as he carefully asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He was the representative elected by the nearby village, the mayor of Hamster Village.</br>
</br>
"What's your name?" Jiang Chen didn't take the stuffed bag. Instead, he looked into the cloudy eyes of the old man.</br>
</br>
"Zhu Baojin," the elder replied prudently.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Zhu Baojin." Jiang Chen smiled, "Tell your villagers that NAC has occupied the water treatment plant. I don't need your crystals. If you want water, swear your allegiance."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen handed him the NAC economic autonomous policy to him, sent him outside the military outpost and watched him escorted by two men with hunting rifles. While the rural area didn't have a lot of zombies, there were dangerous mutants here, like Death Claws for example. An elder without any combat ability wouldn't have come alone.</br>
</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou stood beside Jiang Chen and asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Will they agree?"</br>
</br>
"They have no reason to reject." Jiang Chen laughed. "Our proposed conditions could be described as heaven-sent."</br>
</br>
NAC collected no taxes on agricultural products in the economic zone, and the governance of the economic zone was based on a mix of local governance and supervising representative.</br>
</br>
"Is it?" With her finger on her lips, Sun Xiaorou smiled. "Speaking of which, brother-in-law, don't forget the primary purpose of this trip."</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 071, I know." Jiang Chen tousled Xiaorou's luscious hair.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou closed her eyes while enjoying the warmth of his big hand.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law isn't mad at me, right?"</br>
</br>
"Mad at you?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"In the morning… I purposely shot that female raider."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen didn't understand.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you feel pity?" Sun Xiaorou tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"Pity?"</br>
</br>
"She's the leader of a force. Did you not fantasize about humiliating her in front of her subordinates and enjoying the expression on her face?" Sun Xiaorou said all this with an innocent expression.</br>
</br>
"… I'm not that monstrous." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Eh?" Sun Xiaorou covered her mouth and made a surprised expression.</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
"Haha, sorry, I'll make it up to you tonight." Seeing as Jiang Chen didn't say anything, Xiaorou patted him on the shoulder with a grin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen really couldn't scold her when she had such innocent-looking eyes.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
While the water treatment plant was abandoned for many years, most of the equipment inside was operating autonomously. However, when Jiang Chen attempted to open the water valve, he discovered the valve was stuck. After conducting an investigation with the drone, they discovered that below the membrane of the tank were the eggs of a Mud Crab.</br>
</br>
And the location of the valve happened to be clogged with the corpse of a Mud Crab.</br>
</br>
Mud Crabs were extremely difficult to deal with and posed a higher threat than Death Claws in tight quarters. The sharp claws could even sever steel as they had a sturdy shell comparable to steel. With such a natural advantage, they didn't want to eat detritus anymore and began to feast on any living creatures approaching them.</br>
</br>
Based on the few bodies in the water, the raiders hadn't purposely hiked the prices; that was their temporary solution because they couldn't deal with the crabs.</br>
</br>
Under the command of Wang Zhaowu, ten soldiers in kinetic skeletons entered the water tank, accompanied by two soldiers with flamethrowers and a few Hummingbird drones to engage in fierce battle with the Mud Crabs.</br>
</br>
Reality soon proved that the Mud Crabs were far more difficult to deal with compared to the water treatment plant thugs who only bullied civilians. With hard shells, they weren't afraid of bullets and even forced the NAC team to retreat a few times.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then ordered the soldiers to unload a few combustion missiles from the airship. They stuck aluminum heating agents to them and dropped them with drones.</br>
</br>
The gate was shut tight.</br>
</br>
With the drones in position, Jiang Chen unleashed the missiles.</br>
</br>
What happened was obvious.</br>
</br>
When the soldiers broke through the scorching steel gate, the boiling water vapor burst out from the edges of the door and carried the aroma of cooked crabs.</br>
</br>
When the temperature cooled down, a few brave ones jumped inside with a net and took out the curled Mud Crabs.</br>
</br>
There were thirty in total!</br>
</br>
This made the food-loving soldiers particularly ecstatic.</br>
</br>
The logistics team on the airship was comprised of a few chefs who worked in the Fishbone cafeteria. Since they killed so many Mud Crabs that couldn't be preserved for long, Jiang Chen ordered the chefs to set up a few giant pots in the middle of the campground, to the cheers of the soldiers. Along with a few boxes of alcohol taken from the water treatment plant, the soldiers enjoyed a nice treat.</br>
</br>
Mud Crabs were one of the few delicacies in the wasteland!</br>
</br>
While the meat is poisonous, the crab roe is amazing. It smelled great and tasted soft, and it was rumored to make men last longer too…</br>
</br>
But the soldiers would have to solve their problems themselves since only Jiang Chen had the opportunity to take care of his needs.</br>
</br>
At night, around the giant pot.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, along with the soldiers of his private forces, ate the crab roe while chatting with Zhao Chaowu.</br>
</br>
"What do you think about Federation and Empire?"</br>
</br>
"Not much."</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"They dare to call themselves Federation and Empire with such a small plot of land; it seems comical." Wang Zhaowu laughed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I don't disagree with you." Jiang Chen took a swig of the fruit champagne made on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
"Why don't we use 'the Hammer of Order' to give them a round? The 100-kilogram bomb could really make them reevaluate themselves," Wang Zhaowu jokingly suggested.</br>
</br>
The 100-kilogram bomb was just like a meteor. If a 10-kilogram bomb could take out a vehicle, a 100-kilogram bomb could collapse a building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only smiled.</br>
</br>
Airship diplomacy was part of diplomacy.</br>
</br>
If necessary, he would consider this.</br>
</br>
Not far away, Ji Yucheng, who was wanted by the President, also enjoyed some crab roe and alcohol.</br>
</br>
But despite the delicacy and booze, there was no smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Buddy, don't waste the booze. How about you give me half?" The soldier beside him finished his drink and patted Ji Yucheng's shoulder with a grin, but Ji Yucheng's eyes were focused on the bowl.</br>
</br>
"That's enough! General already said the soldiers patrolling at night and in the morning are only permitted to drink half a bowl. Take it easy." His comrade punched him on the shoulder and reminded him.</br>
</br>
The rules of the Third Division were no joke.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so stingy. I was just joking." The soldier savored the taste of alcohol in his mouth as he spoke with displeasure.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng suddenly stood up and pushed the two bowls in front of them.</br>
</br>
"You guys can have it."</br>
</br>
Then he walked straight to Jiang Chen, leaving the two dumbfounded soldiers behind.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 627: The Password to Immortality</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, I need your help."</br>
</br>
Stopped in front of Jiang Chen, Ji Yucheng's head was lowered and his voice was even lower.</br>
</br>
"Help? Don't you think the fact that I didn't exchange your head for some crystals already did you a huge favor?" Looking at the gloomy Ji Yucheng, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Just two hours ago, he experienced defeat, falling from cloud nine to hell.</br>
</br>
He previously thought his president would pay the ransom in exchange for him; he hadn't imagined it was a conspiracy targeting him from the start. He thought carefully and realized how it was possible for lousy thugs to dare to execute a kidnapping on Federation's territory - if one permitted it to happen.</br>
</br>
When he thought someone wanted to take his life, he didn't leave NAC's outpost although he felt afraid. If his president wanted his life, he wouldn't be safe wherever he went. The raiders in the area were more and less associated with that man. Unless he escaped to Empire to become a slave, his only option would be to leave the region.</br>
</br>
He didn't just want to escape.</br>
</br>
He wanted to seek revenge on the people who stabbed him in the back.</br>
</br>
NAC was his last chance.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng took a deep breath and slowly said, "Just three days ago, I got drunk at the bar in the city then I was taken outside of the city by someone…"</br>
</br>
"Do you think I want to listen to your story?"</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng was clearly struggling to make a decision. Finally, he made up his mind, took a deep breath, and said, "Are you not curious why they want my life?"</br>
</br>
"Because of power?"</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Because of a secret."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked intrigued. He looked at the wretched parliament member.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What secret?"</br>
</br>
"If you promise to kill Federation's president… and advisor... kill all the bastards and I'll tell you the secret."</br>
</br>
"You're too confident. NAC isn't a killing organization," Jiang Chen ridiculed him.</br>
</br>
"But you're merchants, right? The vehicles of all the merchants from Wanghai have NAC's symbol."</br>
</br>
"That's not wrong," Jiang Chen put the alcohol aside and looked at him. "If you can convince me, I can even make you the president. But if you're just throwing me a hook to trick me into helping you, I'll regretfully tell you that there are no such good things in life."</br>
</br>
"A password," Ji Yucheng said.</br>
</br>
"What password?"</br>
</br>
"The password to immortality."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen's response and the same money sack, Zhu Baojin returned to Hamster Village.</br>
</br>
He didn't say anything to his villagers who had hopeful faces. Instead, he gathered the villagers of the nearby survival camps for a short meeting.</br>
</br>
While they were still unsettled, the survivors accepted Jiang Chen's terms and expressed their willingness to join NAC to become an economic zone under NAC's jurisdiction, controlled by the military government.</br>
</br>
</br>
It didn't take long for them to feel glad to make the decision.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen promised, NAC didn't need deprived people like them to pay much dues.</br>
</br>
Aside from a team of NAC soldiers patrolling each village daily to purchase supplies like concrete, crystal, and mutated fruit, their lives were almost unaffected. Or rather, with NAC's presence, the number of raiders and mutated humans decreased drastically.</br>
</br>
On the seventh day after AS Order arrived in Hucheng's rural area, a U-shaped airship landing tower was built on the empty plot of land between the military outpost and water treatment plant.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a second blimp arrived at the military outpost and brought along the first batch of supplies.</br>
</br>
The supplies included ammunition, living necessities, and food that made all the soldiers cheer! Even if the supplies were just compressed crackers, they'd be happy as long as it wasn't sour-tasting nutrient supply. In this depressing world, what else was more joyful than having a full stomach?</br>
</br>
The extra food was exchanged with local survivors. A box of compressed crackers could be exchanged for up to a bag of concrete, ten crystals, or a full night of service from a survivor gal. NAC's rules didn't permit prostitution, but a willing trade between two parties was allowed as long as it took place outside of work hours.</br>
</br>
Since soldiers are humans too, being suppressed for too long could cause other problems.</br>
</br>
The survivors wouldn't eat the exchanged compressed crackers; they could sell them for at least 20 crystals in the city. Often times, there was no supply at all.</br>
</br>
After the survivors gained approval from Jiang Chen, they established tents in front of the military outpost and formed a sizable market. Merchant fleets occasionally passing by would take a look to purchase useful goods.</br>
</br>
The blimp only stopped for one day at the outpost before carrying the 54 female slaves rescued from the prison back to Wanghai.</br>
</br>
With the arrival of the second blimp, the major forces in Hucheng all took on a cautious attitude. They previously thought NAC was only passing by, but with the establishment of an outpost and arrival of supplies, they looked like they planned to stay.</br>
</br>
Both Empire and Federation sent scouts to the military outpost. They scattered throughout the market and closely monitored the actions of the foreigners.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Inside the city, presidential palace.</br>
</br>
"NAC has only 500 people in their forces, but their equipment is extremely sophisticated with at least one kinetic skeleton per person." Inside the old office, Xu Chengwei reported to the president.</br>
</br>
"What about power armors? Do they have power armors?" Sitting on the chair belonging to the president; Li Zhenping asked what he was most concerned about.</br>
</br>
Since they inherited the power armor belonging to the land forces, Federation wasn't at a disadvantage against Empire's human flood tactics; they were also Federation's strongest combat units.</br>
</br>
Xu Chengwei thought before replying.</br>
</br>
"They also have power armors… but they don't look like they are produced from before the war. They look handmade."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, their combat ability is inferior to ours."</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily. They also have a steel airship with an unknown purpose."</br>
</br>
Li Zhenping scoffed.</br>
</br>
[What age is this? Who still uses junk like an airship? Who would give them the opportunity to fly above their heads? Not to mention the anti-air machineguns - even a cannon could take that thing out.]</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Ji dead?"</br>
</br>
"We don't know - NAC hasn't contacted us yet. We also cannot infiltrate the military outpost," Xu Weicheng said.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Qingshan Arena, the "palace" at the highest point of the stand.</br>
</br>
"… Emperor, we already detected that the NAC forces located at the water treatment plant have around 500 people. They are equipped with advanced technology." The retro-looking man had one knee on the ground while he reported to the man sitting in the gold chair.</br>
</br>
"I want to know the combat abilities of that airship." The man in the golden chair had his legs crossed, giving off no emperor vibes at all. Just like Ji Yucheng said, they were just a bunch of raiders ten years ago who now just expanded.</br>
</br>
Although they used "palace" and "dragon suit" to disguise their past, these words didn't change their nature. Looking at their words and actions, the discord was evident.</br>
</br>
"We don't currently know."</br>
</br>
The Empire put his leg down and stood up, smashing the chair.</br>
</br>
"Pass my order: gather the elders to discuss a strategy."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 628: Fallout Shelter 071</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Fallout Shelter 071, located in Hucheng, stood in the barren land south of Wuyang Town near the small hill by the Fu River. It had a depth of 1000 meters.</br>
</br>
Precisely speaking, the geological formation of the area wasn't suitable for building deep fallout shelters, but the project was approved before 2150. At that time, the global situation was trending positively with rapid developments in aerospace technology. All the countries were working together and no one believed in war. The local government only built the shelter in order to meet the targets set by PAC. It wasn't until 2155 when the local government realized the fallout shelter project was no joke that they reinforced some of the poorly-made ones used to meet the target. By 2160, Hucheng finally built enough fallout shelters with a capacity of ten million people.</br>
</br>
On the way to the fallout shelter, the abandoned maglev train was still visible.</br>
</br>
The place was covered in grass and weeds with thorns tangled around the track. The wolves hiding in the dark scratched their sharp claws and exposed their fangs at the approaching NAC soldiers.</br>
</br>
"Is this the hometown of Sun Jiao?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly while staring at the stone sign corroded by acid rain.</br>
</br>
The letters  and  were no longer clear. The sheds around the train station still showed the marks of bullets and combustion.</br>
</br>
"You could say that since we were born in this fallout shelter." Sun Xiaorou's face was pensive as she gently caressed the stone sign.</br>
</br>
Just like touching a tomb of the deceased.</br>
</br>
The tomb belonged to a civilization.</br>
</br>
"General, be careful."</br>
</br>
Li Wang noticed the wolves hidden among the bushes. He raised his rifle along with two other private force soldiers and stood in front of Jiang Chen and Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
"Awhooo—"</br>
</br>
The pack of wolves realized they were noticed. They jumped out howling with their bloody mouths wide open.</br>
</br>
The soldiers pressed the trigger calmly and turned the wolves into nothing.</br>
</br>
"Good job." Jiang Chen patted Li Wang on the shoulder. "But make sure you remember to call me captain here."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Li Wang nodded.</br>
</br>
"Guard the door. We'll be out before night." Jiang Chen noticed it wasn't noon yet and instructed the soldiers behind him.</br>
</br>
Li Wang looked troubled at being left outside.</br>
</br>
"I have to disobey the order - I'm responsible for your safety."</br>
</br>
"What danger could there be in an abandoned fallout shelter? There will probably only be a few mutated cockroaches at most?"</br>
</br>
"But—"</br>
</br>
"No buts. This is an order."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's decisive attitude, Li Wang had to comply. He organized the soldiers to position the vehicles in front of the door and created a temporary blockade. He agreed with Jiang Chen that if Jiang Chen wasn't out by six in the evening, he'd bring people down for support.</br>
</br>
The reason why he didn't take people down wasn't because of his confidence in his own abilities but because of considerations.</br>
</br>
</br>
The secret to immortality was destined to only be controlled by a few.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the elevator was still functional.</br>
</br>
It took half a minute before the elevator stopped at the bottom. Jiang Chen then saw the gate to Fallout Shelter 071.</br>
</br>
Every fallout shelter had a different design, but the structures were mostly the same.</br>
</br>
The gear-shaped gate was wide open. From the thick dust on the ground, the place had been deserted for a long time. A body against the door was wearing a blue uniform. From the bloodstain on the chest, the person must've died of a gun wound.</br>
</br>
"The raiders' attack was unexpected. The director ordered security to attack back, but a manmade fire made everything turn into chaos. Sister ran outside and encountered a PLA female warrior when she wandered around the shambles… Sister must've told you all this."</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Retro ideologists" in the Hua area, they were organized under the previous flags and strictly forced themselves to abide by glory and virtue. They attempted to recreate the magnificent country in these shambles. But up until now, Jiang Chen still hadn't seen them.</br>
</br>
"What about you?"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou shook her head.</br>
</br>
"It happened too long ago; my memory of that incident is cloudy. I just vaguely remember… it was the Dusk Church who took me in."</br>
</br>
"If it's a sorrowful past, don't think about it," Jiang Chen said quietly.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law is so gentle." Xiaorou smiled,"I'm so envious that sister met you first."</br>
</br>
"Let's get moving." Jiang Chen dry-coughed to mask the awkwardness. He raised his gun and walked into the fallout shelter first.</br>
</br>
With her finger tapping her lips out of habit, Sun Xiaorou's mouth was curved up with joy. She then slid down the graphene glasses on the helmet and followed.</br>
</br>
The fallout shelter was completely dark inside without even basic lighting. The nuclear fusion fuel rod was used up a long time ago and the two could only use the headlights on their helmets.</br>
</br>
"The layout is similar to Fallout Shelter 027." Jiang Chen picked up a diary and brushed the dust off.</br>
</br>
He put the diary on the table nearby. With his rifle loaded, he continued to press forward.</br>
</br>
"Screech—"</br>
</br>
A sharp screech broke out through the darkness. Jiang Chen immediately turned his rifle to lock onto the source of the sound only to discover a few fat rats squeezed into the corner.</br>
</br>
"They're mutated rats. Unless they're very hungry, they typically won't attack humans," Sun Xiaorou said.</br>
</br>
"We should still be careful." Jiang Chen let out a sigh and opened the life signal detector on the helmet. "The big crab even ate people."</br>
</br>
While it was in the distant past, since she lived there for a long time, Sun Xiaorou still had memories of the layout of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Due to a lack of electricity, the elevator inside the fallout shelter wasn't functional. The two of them chose to use safety stairs instead.</br>
</br>
The dark corners hid unknown dangers, but they were lucky to encounter merely a cow-sized mutated spider and nothing more dangerous.</br>
</br>
Their kinetic skeletons were too strong for the fangs of the spider. Its giant mouth suddenly attacked him from the darkness, making Jiang Chen jump before the unlucky spider's head was chopped off by Sun Xiaorou's dagger. After taking care of the fluid on his arm, he discovered only shallow teeth marks on the armor covering his left arm.</br>
</br>
To prevent accidents from occurring, when he passed by the spider web, Jiang Chen crushed all the spider eggs.</br>
</br>
Finally, the two of them arrived at the office of the director in the deepest part of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Everything related to the fallout shelter was recorded there.</br>
</br>
As the brain of the fallout shelter, the electricity system was independent from the exterior; it was supplied by a separate battery.</br>
</br>
"I don't understand one thing - how did Federation know the password? It was obtained by a small parliament member and their president felt the need to shut him up," Jiang Chen said while typing the password into the terminal.</br>
</br>
"Yet Federation's president, who knew the password, didn't come here after all this time." Sun Xiaorou pondered.</br>
</br>
"Could it be that they don't know the location of the fallout shelter?"</br>
</br>
"It doesn't look like it." Sun Xiaorou shook her head.</br>
</br>
The moment the door of the office was opened, a light on the wall lit up and sent the darkness away.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a gentle female voice entered their ears.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for using Fallout Shelter Technology. Fallout Shelter Technology will do its best to serve you."</br>
</br>
"What's going on?!" Jiang Chen pulled out his rifle and cautiously pointed at his surroundings.</br>
</br>
"The power system reactivated? That's impossible - the fallout shelter should be out of power already…" Staring at the screen on the wall, Sun Xiaorou muttered.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 629: The Director“s Diary</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The two waited for a long time at the door with their rifles pointed at the entrance not far away.</br>
</br>
But after a long wait, there was nothing.</br>
</br>
"Someone entered the power room to replace the fuel rod? That's impossible… Li Wang is guarding the entrance of the fallout shelter; no one should've been able to come in." Jiang Chen put the rifle behind his back. He took out a drone terminal from the storage dimension and placed it behind a wall.</br>
</br>
Ten Hummingbird drones flew out from the "hive" and hovered around the walkways.</br>
</br>
"Why did you take out the drones?" Sun Xiaorou was curious.</br>
</br>
"It feels eerie being so empty inside. Let the drones guard us. We can search for useful information in the meantime." Jiang Chen set the patrol order on the terminal, scanned the dark entrance, and walked toward the door.</br>
</br>
When he passed through the metal door, he saw a skeleton in a director's uniform. There was a pistol along with a diary beside him. It looked like a suicide.</br>
</br>
"Someone came here before us not long ago." Sun Xiaorou used her gun to poke the chest of the skeleton before she spoke with her eyebrows furrowed.</br>
</br>
"Why do you say so?" Jiang Chen picked up the diary on the ground.</br>
</br>
"These clothes, don't you find something odd about them?"</br>
</br>
"What's odd?"</br>
</br>
"The office of the director is the command center of the fallout shelter. The door we just passed by has a UV bacteria cleansing device installed, making this room free of bacteria. Inside a sealed environment without bacteria, the decomposition of bodies is extremely slow. While ten years is a long time, it's not long enough for his body to have become this," Sun Xiaorou said.</br>
</br>
It made sense.</br>
</br>
While ten years was a long time, the body shouldn't have decomposed to this extent. And based on Sun Jiao's memories, the director should've been in the camp above ground, leading security forces in fighting the raiders. There was no reason for him to be there.</br>
</br>
For some reason, someone dragged the body of the director from the surface back down to the shelter. Or maybe they used some other body and just changed the body into the director's uniform.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined his surroundings, attempting to look for some clues from the environment.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, he didn't possess any detective skills.</br>
</br>
"Someone came here, moved the body of the director here, and took something out," Jiang Chen muttered while looking at the diary in his hands. "And also left this diary."</br>
</br>
"That's the only explanation." With her finger on her lips, Sun Xiaorou's eyebrows knitted together. "Perhaps Federation's president came here already and changed the fuel rod in the power room when he came. That's why the fallout shelter suddenly lit up when we activated the door to the director's office? Since he already got what he wanted here, then he naturally wouldn't mind Ji Yucheng leaking the password and just wanted to kill him to protect the secret to eternal life… But that doesn't make sense. If he really wanted to keep that a secret, there was no reason for him to leave a diary as a clue."</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fell into deep thought staring at the diary in his hands.</br>
</br>
He pulled out a chair to sit down and flipped the diary open. He was surprised to discover the bottom of each page was blocked out by dark squares in black pen. The dates were artificially hidden for some unknown reason.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
This feeling is inexplicable. It feels as if civilized society entered a forest and the outside is completely dark to us. In order for us to survive, we have to strangle our own throats, stuff our ears to not make any sounds, and distrust any information that could be fake.</br>
</br>
Until we reach the year the lock expires, the door of the fallout shelter won't open.&gt;</br>
</br>
He did show me a signed document from my superior.</br>
</br>
Since I was bored, I agreed to his request. The one condition I set was not to endanger the lives of the fallout shelter residents. As the director of the fallout shelter, that's my duty.&gt;</br>
</br>
It was ridiculous. While I'm the director, that doesn't mean I have the authority to do whatever I want.</br>
</br>
He threatened me and said this is the highest order from my superior. Once the fallout shelter is locked down for the long-term, the plan must be executed. If I reject the order, it would be viewed as treason.&gt;</br>
</br>
I unwillingly told everyone that the survivors on the list were diagnosed with a dangerous genetic disease; they'll be forced to enter the hibernation chamber to wait for future treatment.</br>
</br>
There is a little girl on the list. It's too cruel to take away the child from her parents, so I took her name off the list… Did I do a good deed?</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the mission was successfully completed without causing massive panic in the fallout shelter. The XXX experiment officially began, and all the frozen popsicles in the hibernation chambers are his experiment subjects.&gt;</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
I discovered in a confined environment that people are far more fragile than they think.</br>
</br>
We can't drag this on any longer; we have to leave this place.</br>
</br>
Once this place reaches the lowest possible standard of confinement, we'll leave.</br>
</br>
The darkness is suffocating.&gt;</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
There were many pages torn from the diary, and it only recorded the first two years after the fallout shelter closed.</br>
</br>
But just from the brief sentences, Jiang Chen still managed to decipher the information hidden in this diary.</br>
</br>
Another observer?</br>
</br>
Academician Qin was one too. He used Fallout Shelter 027 to simulate changes in a civilization in an isolated environment.</br>
</br>
He began suspecting that all the fallout shelters performed near-crazy experiments.</br>
</br>
"Xiaorou?" Jiang Chen put down the diary and deeply inhaled.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"Do you still remember life in the fallout shelter?"</br>
</br>
"Most of my memories are cloudy, but I remember everything about sister clearly. Sister was really cute back then."</br>
</br>
"It's not about Sun Jiao… do you remember that a lot of people went missing one year?"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou shook her head and facepalmed at Jiang Chen's question.</br>
</br>
"Brother in law, notice the time. The diary recorded that the experiments were completed one year and nine weeks after the closure. I wasn't born yet."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process that before he realized.</br>
</br>
He closed the diary and stood up.</br>
</br>
"It's getting late. Since there are no clues here… it's time to go."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou still wasn't convinced. She searched the office carefully but still couldn't find any useful clues.</br>
</br>
She gritted her teeth and had a defeated expression.</br>
</br>
"Looks like we came here for nothing."</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily." Jiang Chen patted the diary. "We still managed to find some useful information."</br>
</br>
"The diary might not be true. Both the location of the diary and the obvious changes make it look too coincidental," Sun Xiaorou reminded him.</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen nodded. "But this is the only clue. We just need to find that observer… if he's alive."</br>
</br>
The whereabouts of the observer weren't recorded in the diary. Perhaps it was recorded originally but ripped out. If he wasn't dead, the secret of immortality should be in his hands. But when he thought about that, Jiang Chen began to have a headache.</br>
</br>
It was more difficult to find someone in the wasteland than fighting the Mother of Death Claws.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before they left, Jiang Chen and Sun Xiaorou went to the power room and hibernation center separately.</br>
</br>
Just as Sun Xiaorou suspected, someone came to the fallout shelter to install a new fuel rod for the place. The person even lived there for an extended period of time but for some reason, or perhaps because he reached his goal, he left.</br>
</br>
And it had been years.</br>
</br>
After he left, he shut down power to the fallout shelter until Jiang Chen entered the password at the terminal to finally wake up the dormant Fallout Shelter 071.</br>
</br>
"Immortality, or at least extending life, is part of the intergalactic colonization plan, although it isn't necessary. The Dusk Church attempted to take me here, and they did get here. But because they didn't know the password to the office, they could do nothing about the things inside."</br>
</br>
"Could the door not be blown open?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Based on what Han Junhua said, the door of the office at Fallout Shelter 027 was opened through force.</br>
</br>
"Not unless it was permitted by design. Otherwise, even if you blew up the entire fallout shelter, you might not even blow open this room." Sun Xiaorou sighed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen processed that information and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"This is too dark."</br>
</br>
He was referring to both this place thousand meters below the surface and the fallout shelter itself.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou grinned and continued the topic.</br>
</br>
"The Church finally did collect some interesting clues outside the fallout shelter. For example, the experiments of the observer and the director refusing to continue with the experiment involved a girl."</br>
</br>
"The girl took off the list mentioned in the diary?"</br>
</br>
"It's possible." Sun Xiaorou nodded seriously. "Since she was chosen as an experimental subject, there should be something unique about her."</br>
</br>
"Observer, girl… only these two clues?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen searched through the entire fallout shelter without finding the lab mentioned in the diary.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou carefully sifted through her memories from when she was young and had no recollection of the lab at all.</br>
</br>
The horrific experiments conducted by the observer were brought to the grave along with the abandonment of Fallout Shelter 071.</br>
</br>
But aside from the secret to immortality, the two also found some "interesting" stuff.</br>
</br>
One experimental quantum computer, a taken-apart soilless plantation device, and some stuff only available in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
It was a pleasant surprise to find a quantum computer there as most of the abandoned fallout shelters had been razed through by scavengers. The electronic parts and special material of the quantum computer could be used for weapons.</br>
</br>
Since the quantum computer hadn't been uncovered by scavengers, that meant it was hidden well.</br>
</br>
The two took a stroll in the fallout shelter. After confirming there was no other useful stuff, they left marks on the items that needed to be moved.</br>
</br>
</br>
Along with the diary, Jiang Chen and Xiaorou stood in the elevator as they returned to the surface. When he pressed the start button, he raised his left arm and glanced at the time on the EP.</br>
</br>
It was precisely six.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the surface, the soldiers all went to greet him.</br>
</br>
"General, if you didn't come out just now, we would've gone down." Li Wang was relieved when he saw Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"It's already this late?" Jiang Chen looked up.</br>
</br>
The day had turned completely dark. It looked like it was about to rain.</br>
</br>
"What are you planning to do with the fallout shelter?" Sun Xiaorou asked.</br>
</br>
"Temporarily take control of the place, and at least maintain an inspection station here… as well as a cemetery," Jiang Chen said while scanning the bodies all around.</br>
</br>
With a gracious smile, Sun Xiaorou gently nodded.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
He ordered Li Wang along with five soldiers to guard the place as Jiang Chen entered the vehicle and returned to the military outpost.</br>
</br>
Before dark, a helicopter would arrive, bringing supplies and backup.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Qingshan Arena, the capital of Empire.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, Empire wasn't called Empire but had a plain name – Qingshan Survivors Gathering. The people there were nowhere close to nice, they occasionally did some mercenary work while being raiders in the dark.</br>
</br>
But the villages west of Gan River formed an alliance and referred to themselves as Federation. They elected a President through voting and established a wireless base station to launch propaganda at nearby residents. The survivors at Qingshan saw this, used the opportunity to clear their name and adopted a different name.</br>
</br>
With the principle that they would never be inferior to their arch enemy, Federation, they referred to themselves as Empire.</br>
</br>
Using the ideology of rebuilding civilization, and promoting openness and freedom to attract merchants and population growth in the region, Federation gradually became a wealthy gathering spot. But with the increase in traffic, loose laws, corruption, and crime prospered there and spread to every corner of Federation like a plague.</br>
</br>
Everything there could be bought with a clear price tag.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the position of president or the head of a parliament member.</br>
</br>
The contrary was true for Empire. With their origins as raiders, they had the thug tradition all along, so they took the route of centralized power.</br>
</br>
They gathered a group of raiders and gave "stocks" to powerful mercenaries then they accepted the mutated human's tribe as their own. People with histories of crime could become accomplices to share power while the honest could only work hard. The clear social structure was simple, yet it established a primal power pyramid.</br>
</br>
As for who would be the emperor, patrilineal succession would definitely not work. Otherwise, the bosses of the raiders and mercenaries wouldn't be pleased. Then who should be the emperor?</br>
</br>
The first leader was an intelligent leader. He dug out the crown abdication system (1) embedded deep in history.</br>
</br>
Everyone could be the emperor, and everyone took turns being the emperor.</br>
</br>
Federation and Empire.</br>
</br>
It was hard to say who was more heinous and who was more civilized.</br>
</br>
Since this was the wasteland, it was a dumpster.</br>
</br>
"This is the history of Empire and Federation." A mercenary with a PK2000 rifle on his back took Zhao Baodong to pass through the gates while explaining the history.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong, an ex-Qingpu survivor. He joined Fishbone Base with the Hunter Division and cleared out the bacterial source with Jiang Chen long ago. But he wasn't as well off as his friend Ma Zhongcheng; that guy already became the head of the Hunter Divison, and he was only the captain of a reconnaissance platoon.</br>
</br>
He couldn't be blamed since he made the wrong decision from the beginning. The first survivor community Jiang Chen visited was his, and what did he do? Not only did he reject the proposal to fight with him, but he took out a recoilless cannon and asked Jiang Chen to leave…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't seek responsibility from him in the end.</br>
</br>
While a gun was pointed at Zhao Baodong, he cooperated. Without the Qingpu survivors, the X2 bacteria source couldn't have been eliminated by the power armors alone.</br>
</br>
If he could achieve success in his missions, he thought he could get promoted. Therefore he requested to go to Hucheng and boarded the supply blimp with the reconnaissance platoon.</br>
</br>
After he entered the gate, he stood in front of the arena.</br>
</br>
The mercenary eyed him, the guard with a homemade rifle also looked at him.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong immediately took out four grain-sized crystals from his pocket with a smile and stuffed them into the guard's hand. He then pointed at the mercenary beside him.</br>
</br>
"Together."</br>
</br>
Without saying anything, the guard tossed the crystal on the detector, and the number stopped at four.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong looked reminiscent, watching the number jumping up and down on the crystal detector.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street hadn't used this equipment for a very long time; the entire Suhang Province had no trace of this device at all. People all used NAC's credit points to purchase goods, so crystals became a product instead.</br>
</br>
That was why a lot of soldiers were unwilling to be sent here. Compared to the "advanced" Wanghai, this was an undeveloped mountainous range.</br>
</br>
Still, without speaking, the guard waved his gun and looked at the survivors behind the two of them.</br>
</br>
The mercenary beside Zhao Baodong immediately dragged on his sleeves to signal he could pass.</br>
</br>
"Do we not need to hand in our weapons when we enter the city?"</br>
</br>
"No need. You only need to do that when you enter the palace," the mercenary said.</br>
</br>
"Palace?" Zhao Baodong paused for a second.</br>
</br>
"It's right there." At the end of the hall, the mercenary pointed at the highest point of the arena.</br>
</br>
Stepping into the open arena, an explosion of scenery instantly entered his vision.</br>
</br>
The wide field had no grass on it. Instead, it was replaced by markets, houses, and even fruit gardens. The place was surrounded by "natural" walls guarding the place like city walls. On the tall stand was Empire's flag.</br>
</br>
This was the capital.</br>
</br>
Worth mentioning was that the arena of the 22nd century was much bigger compared to the 21st century. It was comparable to a nine-hole golf course.</br>
</br>
Including the area underground, the arena could hold a total of 50 thousand people.</br>
</br>
This was the center of Empire.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, buddy. If there's anything you don't need, you can find me at the bar. Before I accept new mercenary missions, I'll be there." The mercenary waved at him and disappeared down the street.</br>
</br>
Based on their agreement, Zhao Baodong would pay a two crystal gate tax and the mercenary would bring Zhao Baodong here while giving him a vivid "history lesson."</br>
</br>
It was extremely worth it for Zhao Baodong to purchase such valuable information with just two crystals.</br>
</br>
While the mission budget was generous, it was better to use crystals at critical points.</br>
</br>
He took a piece of paper from his pocket and confirmed the task Jiang Chen gave him for the last time before he headed to the hostel. He needed to find a place to stay to organize the information he already gathered then he would transmit the information wirelessly to the military outpost.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 631: The Sudden Alarm</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen and the group returned to the military outpost, the cooks were beginning to clean up the cooking pots.</br>
</br>
The logistics personnel saw that the general had come back and immediately greeted him, asking if they should fire up the pots again.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen rejected his good intention and took Sun Xiaorou to the direction of the general room.</br>
</br>
"The day before yesterday was pizza, yesterday was spaghetti, what are we going to eat today?" On the way back, Sun Xiaorou had a smile on her face while she said happily with a finger on her lips.</br>
</br>
It was a lavish problem for the people of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"What about seafood fried rice?"</br>
</br>
Although fried rice doesn't taste too great after reheating, Jiang Chen wanted rice.</br>
</br>
"Eh, noooo. I still want to eat pizza." Sun Xiaorou hugged Jiang Chen's arm and used her innocent eyes to stare at Jiang Chen, a common tactic she used.</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay, I said not to be coy here. It won't be good if other people saw this." Jiang Chen wanted to drag his arm out, but she naughtily hugged onto it tighter.</br>
</br>
"So, what's the matter?" Sun Xiaorou teasingly blinked.</br>
</br>
There were rarely people that passed by the general room with most of the patrols done by drones, so there was no need to worry about other people-</br>
</br>
Just as Sun Xiaorou thought about that, she immediately made eye contact with Han Junhua, who was standing at the door.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou let him go, rolled out her tongue, and jumped aside.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua slightly turned her head and spoke expressionlessly to Jiang Chen, "Do I need to leave for now?"</br>
</br>
"No, no need." Jiang Chen awkwardly coughed. "Is something wrong?"</br>
</br>
Since it was in a military outpost, while there was no one around, it was still considered out in public. Therefore, it wouldn't look good to be so intimate. As the general, he especially needed to be the role model.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded and handed him a thermos container.</br>
</br>
"You just returned from the fallout shelter and you must still be hungry. I asked the cook to make extra."</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't take the container and only stared at her blankly. Sun Xiaorou who stood beside him was only completely shocked.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?" Han Junhua was confused at the two's dumbfounded expressions.</br>
</br>
"No, it is just that…" Regathering his thoughts, Jiang Chen smiled and took the container. "This is very unlike you."</br>
</br>
"Is it?" While her face was still expressionless, he could read the confused emotion in her eyes.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen could clearly sense the piercing gaze of the person standing beside him…</br>
</br>
When Han Junhua left, the two returned to the room.</br>
</br>
Opening the container, Jiang Chen looked at the rice and dishes divided clearly and squarely while a curvature appeared on his mouth.</br>
</br>
The odd way of putting food was indeed Han Junhua's character.</br>
</br>
</br>
With a few strands of hair dangling on his shoulder, Sun Xiaorou put her face beside Jiang Chen's. The vibrant red lips were mixed with some jealousy.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law is so popular."</br>
</br>
"Am I?"</br>
</br>
"You are." Sun Xiaorou bit on Jiang Chen's ear, displeased. Then she murmured to herself, "Hmm… but if it is Sister Junhua, I don't think sister will mind."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows jumped and he threw the container into the storage dimension while feeling exasperated.</br>
</br>
[This girl is becoming naughtier.]</br>
</br>
If he doesn't "punish" her, where is the authority of the head of the family?</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law is angry? Ahhh—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly stood up. Amongst Xiaorou's scream, he put her on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Brother in law, what do you want to do?"</br>
</br>
"Wait, wait wait, Xiaorou is hungry, could you wait for a bit?"</br>
</br>
"No... QQ…"</br>
</br>
"Gulp… Gulp…"</br>
</br>
[Humph, now you're afraid? Too late]</br>
</br>
Looking at the pouting Xiaorou, the evil Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, the second blimp arrived at Hucheng.</br>
</br>
Other than bringing a large number of supplies, the blimp also brought NAC's most powerful drone units – Reptile and Python.</br>
</br>
But based on what the captain said, their trip was not too peaceful.</br>
</br>
When they flew over the Yellow Mountain, the blimp was attacked by anti-air machine guns. Fortunately, they were above the clouds. While some bullets struck the bottom of the blimp, the bullets at the end of its range didn't manage to do damage.</br>
</br>
"The information of NAC using blimp to transport supplies was known by the survivors along the way. While we flew above the clouds, the radar could still easily capture such a large target. And our speed was not fast. Once we were locked in, we were just a moving target. Fortunately, they used machineguns and not anti-air cannons." Recalling what happened last night, the captain still felt frightened.</br>
</br>
After thinking for a moment, Jiang Chen thought of a solution.</br>
</br>
"I'll send Aurora-20 to protect you."</br>
</br>
With Aurora-20's air to land attack ability, it shouldn't be a problem to take out a few anti-air machine guns. Someone dares to plot against NAC's supplies? Do they think they lived long enough?</br>
</br>
"That would be the best. They might use anti-air cannon next time." The captain smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
But sending out the fighter jet was not a long term solution.</br>
</br>
Aurora-20's transport fuel had a long production amount, but the cost was daunting. A flying mission's cost was around 1000 credits per hour and thus the cost of a supply mission would drag that number up by several folds. It was probably more economical to purchase locally.</br>
</br>
Before ending the conversation, Jiang Chen ordered him to stay for three days at the base and bring the quantum computer found in Fallout Shelter 071 back. All scientists at Fallout Shelter 027 used three experiment quantum computers in total, highlighting how much NAC lacked quantum computers.</br>
</br>
And because of this, Jiang Chen was determined to control the quantum computer research institute.</br>
</br>
Whether it was for the virtual reality network in the modern world or for the development of the NAC, he must control the production technology of the quantum computer.</br>
</br>
"Is there any news of the quantum computer research institute?" Jiang Chen asked Wang Zhaowu in the office.</br>
</br>
"We posted at the market outside of the outpost that information was wanted for the research institute, but we currently haven't received any useful information," Wang Zhaowu said regretfully.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
The advisor of the Federation only told them the rough location, but the area from east of Gang River to the west of Panyang Lake was all "sovereignty" of the Empire. With such a massive area, where was he going to find the small institute?</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the alarm outside began to ring.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Wang Zhaowu looked at each other.</br>
</br>
They immediately stood up and headed out.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 632: The Mutated Human Tribe</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
Walking to the gate of the outpost, Jiang Chen scanned the crowd in the distance with his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"It's the mutated humans." The soldier on duty saluted.</br>
</br>
"Mutated humans?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows, "If it is the mutated humans, why waste energy on speaking with them."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng walked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Guru Tribe, they are the mutated human tribe of Empire." He pointed at the slanted flag, "That dragon flag is the flag of Empire."</br>
</br>
The group was approaching and Jiang Chen saw the appearance of the group.</br>
</br>
They were muscular giants with green skin; the muscles on their body were bulging out. They were covered in drapes and holed clothes with rifles that looked toothpick thin compared to their giant arms. The clothes looked improvised.</br>
</br>
Only two or three mutated humans wielded armors made out of C-type steel with massive power armor in hand.</br>
</br>
In Wanghai, the mutated humans and humans had an eternal grudge, but this didn't seem to be the case here.</br>
</br>
When the survivors saw the mutated humans, while they looked afraid, they didn't display the fear on their faces.</br>
</br>
"Should we fire?" Wang Zhaowu looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As long as he orders, the "Fireball-1" on the airship will turn the mutated monsters into flames.</br>
</br>
"No rush. Let's hear what they have to say first. But if they continue to move forward, "Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed with a hint of coldness surfacing on his face, "then let our airship warn them."</br>
</br>
The group of mutated humans, fortunately, didn't step onto the red line set by the NAC, they stopped before the airship fired.</br>
</br>
Guro Tribe spread out eight hundred meters in front of the NAC outpost.</br>
</br>
If they fought, it was the typical combat distance.</br>
</br>
The crowd momentarily turned rowdy before a green-skinned muscular giant walked out. He had a flag in his right hand while he dragged a vicious dog in his left hand.</br>
</br>
The survivors at the entrance of the market whispered to each other. They began to collect their stuff to avoid him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyed his soldier.</br>
</br>
Li Wang understood and walked in front of the mutated human. He raised his gun before the mutated human arrived.</br>
</br>
"Please stop, it is NAC's territory up front."</br>
</br>
"We are the delegate sent from Guru Tribe!" The mutated human roared in a loud voice. He looked at Jiang Chen. "We brought greetings from the elder."</br>
</br>
"Oh? The greetings of the elder? Tell me about it." Jiang Chen looked at him.</br>
</br>
"Since you're doing business in Guru Tribe's territory, then you must gift tribute to the magnificent Guru Elder!" The mutated human stabbed the flag on the ground, disgusting saliva was dripping out from his vicious fangs, "Or else, your action will be viewed as disrespectful to God!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Zhao Chenwu exchanged eye contact and they simultaneously began to laugh.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Rude humans," The mutated human's eyes widened and he threatened, "You don't know that in Empire's territory, you're all third tier people! Even if I rip you apart, the Emperor won't criticize me at all."</br>
</br>
It was the first time in Empire's territory where he saw someone this disrespectful to mutated humans. Whether it was a lone traveler passing the area, or a survivor that lived there, anyone that dared to anger the mutated humans must pay serious consequences for their foolishness.</br>
</br>
If they dared to fight back, it was viewed as an obstruction to the friendship between Empire and the mutated humans!</br>
</br>
The soldiers of the Empire would haunt them till the border of Empire.</br>
</br>
"Then did you tell your emperor that the people here haven't paid tax for a long time?" Wang Zhaowu mocked.</br>
</br>
Would NAC be afraid of a bastard emperor?</br>
</br>
The tax official of Empire arrived at Hamster Village days before and happened to meet the patrol team of the NAC. The consequence was obvious, because of the poor judgment of the unlucky tax official, he was beaten and thrown into the detention room.</br>
</br>
From that day on, Empire didn't send another tax official there again. They didn't even dare to ask about NAC's invasion on their territory.</br>
</br>
In front of cannons, a human's mind is a lot calmer compared to a mutated human's mind.</br>
</br>
"Our elder doesn't care." The mutated human arrogantly raised his chest. "The Emperor declared this area belonged to our tribe, so you must pay tribute. If you reject, it will be viewed as disrespectful to Guru Tribe."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen burst out laughing again when he saw the cocky expression.</br>
</br>
"In Wanghai, I heard that the head of mutated humans is not that great. It certainly is true from what I see today."</br>
</br>
The mutated human ambassador was instantly enraged.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans hated people humiliating their intelligence because the FEV virus does have the side effect of decreasing brain cell activity.</br>
</br>
The hand dragged onto the iron shackle raised, he pointed it at Jiang Chen and shouted in anger.</br>
</br>
"How dare you! Your humiliation will be viewed as provocative to Guru Tribe. I will let you know what is rage and cruelty— Ahhh!!!"</br>
</br>
The severed arm spun in the air. The mutated human collapsed to the ground in pain, covering the place where his arm was as blood gushed out.</br>
</br>
On the wall of the outpost, Sun Xiaorou gently smiled and moved the sniper rifle in her hands.</br>
</br>
"You'll suffer if you're disrespectful to the NAC General."</br>
</br>
The mutated dog escaped the shackle and immediately leaped at Jiang Chen's group, but the creature didn't manage to run two steps before it was gunned down by Li Wang.</br>
</br>
The sudden change happened in an instant. No one expected the situation would suddenly turn into a crossfire.</br>
</br>
Facing the "delegation" from mutated humans, they clearly didn't expect NAC's reaction being this violent. They even shot their ambassador.</br>
</br>
That shot ignited their vengeance!</br>
</br>
"AS Order. Aim at all mutated human units 800 meters from the outpost, fire!" Jiang Chen opened the radio and ordered with a merciless voice.</br>
</br>
"Roar—"</br>
</br>
Mutated humans screamed and unleashed their firepower at NAC's outpost.</br>
</br>
The bullets with orange trials shredded the tents in the market, destroyed the frame, and hit the concrete wall of the outpost. The survivors that realized the situation was heading south already ran away, so the bullets didn't hit them.</br>
</br>
But the rain of bullets didn't last for two seconds before being suppressed by the bullet hailstorm.</br>
</br>
Four 12.76 mm machine guns unleashed fire and the waterfall of bullets exploded the dust on the ground and turned the fleeing mutated humans into meat chunks.</br>
</br>
NAC soldiers hid behind the bunkers and fired back with their rifles. At the same time, Python drones were all activated and circled behind the mutated humans from the wing.</br>
</br>
Behind the transparent graphene bunker, Jiang Chen looked at the hologram screen of thugs being slaughtered by the bullets from the sky with coldness.</br>
</br>
[The policy of Empire spoiled them; they really think they are superior?]</br>
</br>
NAC only had one policy when it came to the bloodthirsty thugs.</br>
</br>
Kill!</br>
</br>
After killing the mutants, throw their body into the incinerator chamber!</br>
</br>
That is where they belong!</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 633: Using Other“s Knife to Kill</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Capital, the Palace.</br>
</br>
"Did Guru Tribe start fighting against the NAC?"</br>
</br>
"My emperor, based on the scout at the frontline, the two sides are engaging in battle."</br>
</br>
"Perfect." The Emperor nodded, a pleased smile appeared on the well-defined face.</br>
</br>
After the last emperor's placate strategy, Guru Tribe began to expand. The previous force used as deterrence against Federation now became a tumor of Empire.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans' population was not high from the start, it was not a big deal to give them some special rights. But based on this trend, the humans will be a minority. Empire would no longer be Empire.</br>
</br>
Not including the mutated humans, the total population of Empire was around 150 thousand, but the growing population of mutated humans was 80 thousand. Could they still be considered a minority? Of course not.</br>
</br>
Including the elders, discussion of including the cannibals inside Empire, and retaining their tradition was all out of consideration of balancing the power of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
But balance didn't seem to do the trick anymore.</br>
</br>
With NAC's arrival at Hucheng and their blitz action to remove the raiders at the water treatment plant, they displayed their power and firm stance to the local forces.</br>
</br>
The emperor first remained cautious to the external force, since the area of the water treatment plan was part of Empire's territory. However, then he gave it a thought and concluded the appearance of Order may not necessarily be bad, and it happened to solve a critical problem.</br>
</br>
Empire didn't have strong control of the east rural area to begin with. If he declared the unnecessary area to the mutated human tribe, it not only would satisfy their growing appetite, but potentially would also cause the two to suffer great defeat.</br>
</br>
Since Hucheng was still hundreds of kilometers from Wanghai, unless the NAC made up their mind to include this area into their territory, the casualties against Guru Tribe will force them to back away.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Different from the lousy thugs in the water treatment plant, while the mutated humans were not the brightest, their combat ability was not weak at all.</br>
</br>
Or rather, the FEV virus already engraved the word "battle" into the genetics of these monsters. Just out of instinct, they could explode with combat ability no inferior to trained soldiers.</br>
</br>
But the combat ability was not effective under the suppression of aerial firepower.</br>
</br>
A few RPGs were launched out by the mutated humans to the air, but they quickly exploded under the laser anti-missile defense system. As to the machine guns firing into the air, they couldn't even leave a dent on the C-type steel armor of AS Order.</br>
</br>
The machine guns in the air were suffocating, the mutated humans began to retreat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wouldn't let their wish come true.</br>
</br>
[You must be joking. Since you provoked me, leave your life here and you can leave!]</br>
</br>
</br>
The Python drones moved to the wing and unleashed its supreme firepower to the fleeing mutated humans. At the same time, the NAC infantries accompanied by armored vehicles pursued the retreating mutated humans.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, these ugly humans' firepower is strong!" With disgusting blood dripped out from his forehead, Lou leaned behind a half-collapsed apartment building while jamming a clip into the machine gun. He then peeked out while roaring, "For the glory of Guru!"</br>
</br>
Tatatata-</br>
</br>
Bullets jumped between the bunkers. He clearly saw a NAC soldier fall because of his bullets. But unfortunately, he didn't see clearly whether the person ducked down or was killed before his head was cracked open by the soaring bullets.</br>
</br>
Curling behind the half-destroyed concrete pillar, Li Wang took a deep breath and stood up with the help of the Reaper assault rifle.</br>
</br>
He was hit two times in the chest.</br>
</br>
Luckily, the K2 kinetic skeleton's excellent external defense saved him. While his rib cage was in pain, he could continue to fight.</br>
</br>
Two Pythons soared by him, Li Wang loaded his gun and continued to chase the mutated humans. The gunner firing at him already died in another's hand. When he stepped over the headless body, he glanced at the mixture of red and white on the ground, feeling shocked.</br>
</br>
From the head explosion, the unlucky guy must have died of a sniper rifle. The front line force was not equipped with sniper rifles. But since the bullet came from the outpost, the sniper was too frightening.</br>
</br>
This place was 1000 meters away from the outpost.</br>
</br>
Right now, at the watchtower, Sun Xiaorou put down the sniper rifle in her hands and leaned it against the wall.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans already ran away, she could not see them from her location anymore.</br>
</br>
She elegantly took out the tactical gloves and directly jumped down from the eight meters tall watch tower.</br>
</br>
"What you did… is too rushed. While you have advanced equipment, the mutated humans occupy a large amount of fertile land to the west of Panyang Lake. They have a population of at least 80 thousand," Ji Yucheng said, troubled.</br>
</br>
The 80 thousand mutated humans were all soldiers, and they didn't include the human slaves. While the mutated human tribe's weapons were crude, it didn't mean they didn't have heavy firepower.</br>
</br>
And the NAC military outpost, at most, stationed 1000 something people. Even with the support from the airship, it would not be easy to fight against 80 times the force.</br>
</br>
"You probably don't know. In Jia City, there were probably at least 80,000, or even 100,000 mutated humans that died to my First Division." Jiang Chen used his EP to send out orders and said nonchalantly to Ji Yucheng.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps you're really strong, but this is Hucheng. They are fighting at their front door, and your supply line is 600 kilometers long." Ji Yucheng reminded him.</br>
</br>
He hoped Jiang Chen could help to become the president, so he didn't want to see NAC fight against the mutated humans without anything to gain. Only the president of Federation would feel for this situation.</br>
</br>
"How many 100 kilogram bombs were transported here?" Jiang Chen looked to Wang Zhaowu.</br>
</br>
"200 rounds."</br>
</br>
"Not bad, what about Fireball-1?"</br>
</br>
"2000 missiles."</br>
</br>
"Excellent. Enough for the consumption of a war. Contact Wang Qin and get the logistic department to transport 2000 more missiles. Remember, combustion and explosive each 2000 rounds."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Wang Zhaowu saluted and immediately headed to the command room.</br>
</br>
After instructing the necessary commands, Jiang Chen looked at Ji Yucheng again.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk somewhere else."</br>
</br>
Without waiting for his reply, Jiang Chen headed to the middle of the outpost.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng followed Jiang Chen, seeing there was no one around, he gulped and cautiously said.</br>
</br>
"Did you find the secret to immortality?"</br>
</br>
"Not yet."</br>
</br>
"Is the password not right?"</br>
</br>
"The password is right, but unfortunately, someone already went into the director office." Jiang Chen took out the diary from his pocket. "I only found this."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng wanted to grab it, but Jiang Chen didn't plan to give him the diary. His hand awkwardly hung in the air for a while before he took it back.</br>
</br>
"Then our agreement…"</br>
</br>
"Of course it counts," Jiang Chen smiled, "It is beneficial for me to make an obedient person the president."</br>
</br>
Based on their agreement, Ji Yucheng will tell us the password and he will help Ji Yucheng become the president, and kill the former president and advisor stabbing him in the back.</br>
</br>
And the first thing Ji Yucheng will do after being elected president is introducing NAC economic zone reform and become a place similar to the Sixth Street in the NAC.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng thought about the chip injected behind his neck, let out a sigh, and opened his hands. "I still don't understand, compared to Wanghai, everything is clearly terrible, whether it is Federation or Empire. Other than the also mythical secret about immortality, what could interest you here?</br>
</br>
"Once you possess territories, you'll want to possess more. Of course, I don't need to explain this to you, you just need to follow what I say."</br>
</br>
"Then… what are you planning to tell me? Is it something inconvenient for other people to know?" Ji Yucheng said.</br>
</br>
"It is about that password," Jiang Chen stared into his eyes, "I want to carefully recollect how you obtained it."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng paused before he sighed.</br>
</br>
"Is this the question? I can bet you that you'll be disappointed when you hear it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen signaled him to continue.</br>
</br>
"The password was brought to me by a postal man. I was drinking in the bar, he came to find me and said that someone from Federation sent me a mail for me to sign. I was confused… and I was even more confused when I opened the letter. There was a string of symbols along with the detailed explanation of Fallout Shelter 071 as well as a signature."</br>
</br>
"That's it?" Jiang Chen stared him, dumbfounded</br>
</br>
"That's it." Ji Yucheng nodded; his expression was innocent. "As I said, you will be disappointed."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the program related to the slavery chip on the EP. From his heart rate, he didn't lie.</br>
</br>
"So you gifted the password to the President."</br>
</br>
"That's right. I thought I could become a confidant, but he wanted to kill me instead." Ji Yucheng's words were mixed with deep hatred.</br>
</br>
"Who sent the letter?"</br>
</br>
"Doctor Sun."</br>
</br>
[Doctor Sun, could it be…]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen furrowed his brows.</br>
</br>
From the intelligence collected by Zhao Corporation about the doctor that doesn't age, he previously thought the person may be a digitalized human, but the truth may not be the case/</br>
</br>
</br>
But why?</br>
</br>
The doctor at the capital. What was his purpose to send the password to Federation's parliament member? Or rather, what was he try to achieve in making Federation's people purposely leave the diary behind?</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng was anxious seeing Jiang Chen didn't speak as he tried to contemplate his thought process.</br>
</br>
But quickly after, Jiang Chen spoke again.</br>
</br>
"Last question. You gave the password to the president… don't you long for immortality?"</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng took a second to process. He didn't think it would be such an irrelevant question, so he mocked himself, "I'm just a poor man and an unimportant parliament member in Federation. I work my *ss for the stingy poor suckers. Perhaps when I become the president, I will."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The gunshots in the distance stopped, the outcome of the battle ended with all the mutated humans eliminated.</br>
</br>
A total of 215 mutated humans as well ten mutated dogs all died tragically among the ruins.</br>
</br>
NAC suffered two deaths and seventeen injuries, the almost miraculous victory was a historic win in the eyes of the survivors.</br>
</br>
But the soldiers didn't seem to be too excited. The advantage in equipment meant the battle would be crushing from the start.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen personally held a simple burial ceremony for the two deceased soldiers.</br>
</br>
Their body would be shipped back to Wanghai</br>
</br>
To the wounded soldiers, as long as they didn't miss an arm or a leg, NAC's medical expertise could treat them.</br>
</br>
All in all, while the equipment of the mutated humans at this location was inferior to the mutated humans supported by the Dusk Church. But in terms of combat ability, the mutated humans were stronger.</br>
</br>
The NAC research in the force extracted blood, cell samples from the body of the mutated humans and brought them back to the lab at the outpost to conduct an analysis on DNA and metabolism.</br>
</br>
The appearances of the mutated humans were different compared to the mutated humans in Wanghai. Jiang Chen was especially intrigued. Therefore, he assigned the research task to the researchers.</br>
</br>
The result was also surprising; the mutated humans here had six strands of chromosomes with obvious differences to the mutated humans in Jia City.</br>
</br>
"FEV virus is also called Human Genetic Fixation Virus with the intent to allow the PAC citizens to become neo-humans more adaptable to the harsh environment. But since the start of the FEV project, it received the objection from the mainstream society; the pure species believers. Humans are destined to be a creature that can win against nature, but not compromise to nature and become a monster."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, the research of the FEV virus was delayed, it was not till before the war did people start to continue the research after digging the information out. The FEV virus culture widespread on wasteland was mostly the improved version of the original FEV virus."</br>
</br>
Inside the lab, the researchers responsible for dissecting the mutated human's body reported to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Other than the difference in appearance compared to the mutated humans in Wanghai, is there anything else that's different?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course." The researcher nodded, "Other than poorer regeneration ability, the Hucheng mutated humans' also possessed extremely strong metabolism. But different from the Jia City mutated human, their theoretical lifespan is three times the Jia City mutated humans."</br>
</br>
"Three times?!" Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
"That's right." The researcher said with certainty, "The FEV virus in Hucheng possesses the ability to elongate the DNA telomere. While the technical challenge is great, it is not impossible in theory."</br>
</br>
The mutated human's strength and immunity to poison were problematic, to begin with, especially with their cockroach-like regeneration, they could easily adapt on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
The inability to breed and shortened lifespan were two weaknesses that limited their size. But the mutated humans here's lifespan was longer than humans? It was unbelievable.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the command room, he found Han Junhua to discuss the strategy on wiping out mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The first step was to send out reconnaissance soldiers to determine the mutated humans' FEV production base, armory, command, anti-air units, and other critical infrastructures to be destroyed by Aurora-20,</br>
</br>
At the same time, the ground force will be supported by Order to push to the west bank of Panyang Lake occupied by Guru Tribe to free the humans slaved by mutated humans.</br>
</br>
As to Empire</br>
</br>
"In the past few days, based on the information sent by our soldiers to Hezhong City and Capital, I analyzed the Hucheng forces…"</br>
</br>
Standing in front of the hologram map, Han Junhua's arms crossed in front of her chest while she orderly explained the complicated relationship between Empire and Guru Tribe.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed after he listened to Han Junhua's analysis.</br>
</br>
"So you're saying Empire used us?"</br>
</br>
"90%." Han Junhua looked to Jiang Chen, "Then, what are you planning to do?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing. They will realize that our operation is not free." A mischievous smile appeared on Jiang Chen's face as he stared at Empire on the map.</br>
</br>
[Using us? They are playing with fire.]</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 635: Empire no longer in Control</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside the palace, the Emperor and the elders sat around the long table, celebrating.</br>
</br>
The alcohol on the table was a NAC specialty, the curry chicken and stewed beef canned food… were also from the NAC. But there were also specialty dishes from the wasteland. For example, the sauce roasted Crab Mud roe with an alluring fragrance, the Fury Bear Brain in the shape of tofu were all the cuisines on the wasteland that people without status could not eat. The supplies inland were plentiful beyond the imagination of costal Wanghai.</br>
</br>
The Emperor and elders toasted in joy.</br>
</br>
"Emperor's strategy is witty." An elder with a full mustache raised his cup and toasted with the Emperor, "With this strategy, the NAC force will have to retreat without any gain. The annoying mutated human tribe must also reconsider our relationship.</br>
</br>
"That's right!"</br>
</br>
"Emperor is wise!"</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, my elders, let's drink. This is premium beer purchased from Wanghai. For the glory of Empire, we'll get drunk today!" The Emperor stood up and toasted with each of the elders.</br>
</br>
"Emperor is right!"</br>
</br>
"For Empire, cheers!"</br>
</br>
"I'll finish this drink to show my respect!"</br>
</br>
"…</br>
</br>
Looking at the elders trying to flatter him, the Empire had a joyful expression on his face but was sneering in his mind.</br>
</br>
[You old foxes, everyone knows what hideous things you're thinking about in your minds.]</br>
</br>
The witty strategy of borrowing a knife to kill was not the work of the Empire, but a strategy discussed by the elders. And the elders didn't mention any of this and handed the glory to him just an attempt to please him before he steps down.</br>
</br>
Empire was a crown abdication. There was one year left in the five-year term, who would be the next emperor will be appointed by the current emperor. As long as the elders don't all reject, the next emperor would be the "wise" person appointed by him.</br>
</br>
He was sitting among them while doing all he can to flatter and please the person that sat in his chair, and the second year after he controlled all power, he no longer would even glance the previous emperor.</br>
</br>
In Empire, stepping down meant retirement and complete isolation with power; the person wouldn't even have the chance to return to the elders. Thinking that he still had a year of time, the Emperor felt melancholic, but he was over it quickly.</br>
</br>
At least now, he was still the leader of Empire, enjoying the respect and support of the nobles.</br>
</br>
The chief elder personally poured him a cup of alcohol and the Emperor relaxingly took a drink.</br>
</br>
"It is too boring to just flatter each out during the banquet," an elder suggested.</br>
</br>
"Why don't we discuss how to take care of the Guru Tribe? We gave them too many special treatments, the inferior people have been complaining."</br>
</br>
"It's okay; just arrest the people complaining in public."</br>
</br>
"But this is not a long-term strategy, why doesn't Emperor use this opportunity to take back some of the rights given," An elder carefully observed the Emperor's expression and suggested.</br>
</br>
</br>
"No! Federation is currently eyeing our territory with the NAC in the distance. In this critical moment, we must unite the mutated humans, and cannibals."</br>
</br>
After several drinks, the atmosphere lightened and the elders all expressed their perspective.</br>
</br>
But the Emperor was not pleased with the elders' argument, so he said.</br>
</br>
"My elders please don't be bothered. Today, let's enjoy the night and not talk about state affairs. Everyone eat, drink, and don't leave the tableful of delicacies and drinks untouched."</br>
</br>
"Haha, Emperor, you're right!"</br>
</br>
"Right, right! Everyone drink and eat!"</br>
</br>
A few elders helped alleviate the situation and held up their cups.</br>
</br>
When the emperor was a bit tipsy, a soldier ran into the banquet.</br>
</br>
"Greetings, Emperor, there is an emergency I must report." The soldier kneeled down and shouted.</br>
</br>
The emperor raised his eyebrows but still controlled his mood. Then he said, "Report now."</br>
</br>
"Emperor, the NAC just declared war."</br>
</br>
"Declared war? Is that it? I know, get out now." The Emperor dismissed him and said in annoyance.</br>
</br>
He already expected a war between NAC and Guru Tribe, and the information from the spy already confirmed his guess.</br>
</br>
But the soldier was not to be blamed, such the tactful strategy of borrowing a knife to kill was not something they could guess.</br>
</br>
The soldier was still hesitant without getting up from the ground.</br>
</br>
"Why are you still here? Do you want the emperor to give you a piece of meat?" The elder at the end of the table mocked the soldier.</br>
</br>
He had the lowest status on the table and his ranking was not high either. He enjoyed making fun of people below him. He used chopsticks and threw a piece of half eaten chicken leg onto the ground.</br>
</br>
The banquet table burst out laughing. Seeing his superiors were happy, that elder looked proud too. The red drunken face was chuckling and looked comical.</br>
</br>
The soldier kneeling on the ground didn't mind the laughter. He gritted his teeth and continue to report, "Emperor, NAC's declaration of war is targeted not only on the Guru Tribe but the entire Empire."</br>
</br>
The laughter abruptly stopped, the laughter on the face of the elder sitting at the end also froze.</br>
</br>
"Bang", the cup dropped to the ground and broke the silence.</br>
</br>
The emperor stood up fiercely and stared at the soldier on the ground. Cold sweat instantly took away all the drunkenness and with shakiness in his voice, he stated, "What, what did you say?"</br>
</br>
"NAC declared war on Empire."</br>
</br>
The banquet erupted in noise.</br>
</br>
"No way. How could they declare war on both Guru Tribe and Empire!"</br>
</br>
"Too arrogant! They only have 1000 people, their supply line is 600 kilometers long!</br>
</br>
"Fight! Fight! We have to teach the uneducated a lesson, how dare they!" The old elder's eyes widened as he said with fury.</br>
</br>
"But that airship…" Some elders were indecisive.</br>
</br>
"Funny, the massive Empire is afraid of one airship? With just 1000 in force, we only need to use a division force to easily wipe them out!"</br>
</br>
"What about Federation? What if they launch a sneak attack against us?"</br>
</br>
The banquet was a mess. The emperor's face was blank while his mouth closed shut without any redness.</br>
</br>
[Uh oh.]</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
At the same time, in NAC's military outpost. The Fireball-1 launch vehicles transported by the blimp were ready. The construction robots moved the bundles of missiles beside the launch vehicle with soldiers completing the loading</br>
</br>
NAC's soldiers formed organized square formations in the front of the outpost waiting for their command. The shining kinetic skeleton cast a daunting vibe while the survivors in the market witnessed all this in a state of shock.</br>
</br>
The deafening roar came from the distance, the Aurora-20 just completed its mission and changed into vertical landing mode, landing on the top of the airship.</br>
</br>
Standing on the watchtower, Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed while observing his force. Beside him, Wang Zhaowu replied concisely.</br>
</br>
"All FEV virus productions on the ground are destroyed."</br>
</br>
"Any underground units?"</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 010, the origin of Guru Tribe." Wang Zhaowu replied.</br>
</br>
"Depth?"</br>
</br>
"1000 meters."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Most of the mutated humans on the wasteland could not reproduce, and the FEV virus culture was their "eggs". As long as they destroyed them, delete the production data for the virus, they killed the root of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
If the emperor of Empire thought Jiang Chen just wanted to teach the unintelligent Guru Tribe a lesson, then he is completely wrong.</br>
</br>
To the enemy, NAC abides by one principle.</br>
</br>
Wipe them from the surface of the Earth.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 636: Doctor Sun</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was an old clinic that sat at the corner of the arena, the ghetto known for its dirtiness and chaos.</br>
</br>
When Zhao Baodong walked into the ghetto, he clearly sensed the atmosphere was drastically different compared to other parts of the arena.</br>
</br>
People were dressed poorly and had old, broken shirts and trousers hanging on drying lines above the alley, which made the sunlight-less alley appear even darker.</br>
</br>
Along the way, he put his hand in his right pocket and held onto the pistol.</br>
</br>
He could sense the unfriendly and even malicious looks from the refugees nearby. It felt like they were thieves assessing their prey.</br>
</br>
Clearly, this was the land of outlaws.</br>
</br>
Compared to Sixth Street, this place was sh*t.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong cursed in his mind while stepping into the clinic.</br>
</br>
A robot was taking reservations at the door. While he was interested in the robot's design, after hesitating for a moment, he resisted the urge to touch it.</br>
</br>
"Number 10, please wait in the waiting area."</br>
</br>
A sharp electronic screeching noise came from below the metallic exterior, followed by the sound of paper being ripped. A slip of paper with a number popped out from the robot's mouth. Zhao Baodong took the paper and scanned the clinic before he walked to the waiting area and sat on a long bench.</br>
</br>
There were quite a few people in the waiting area, with the majority of them looking poor. Empire had a lot of people; it also had a lot of poor people. Doctor Sun's clinic charged low fees, so the clients were mostly poor or stingy lone travelers. Because of this, the clinic had a great reputation in the ghetto of the capital; it didn't take Zhao Baodong too much effort to find the place.</br>
</br>
With this opportunity, he examined the customers in the clinic.</br>
</br>
There were humans, mutated humans, and odd people covered in capes refusing to show their faces.</br>
</br>
The green-skinned giant in front took up two seats. He crossed his arms while waiting in frustration. His amber-colored eyes resembled a Death Claw, but he wasn't as visibly vicious as a Death Claw.</br>
</br>
The mutated human noticed Zhao Baodong's gaze and stared back at him.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong looked away.</br>
</br>
In Empire, anyone disrespectful to mutated humans would be at risk of getting punished. They referred to this as "equality," although everyone, including most of their own, considered it absurd.</br>
</br>
There was no need to create a scene here, and the mutated humans wouldn't be around much longer.</br>
</br>
With that thought in his head, his turned his gaze to the clock.</br>
</br>
"Number 10."</br>
</br>
Finally, he heard his name from inside the room.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong stood up and headed to the room.</br>
</br>
When he saw Director Sun, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
Just as the information described him, the doctor working in this clinic for ten years still looked twenty years old.</br>
</br>
"What's the problem?" Without looking up, Doctor Sun spun his pen and asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Addicted to Jet."</br>
</br>
"Arm."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong obediently extended his arm while he scanned the room.</br>
</br>
"No need to look; there's nothing expensive here," Doctor Sun said without looking up.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong was shocked that the doctor noticed his gaze without looking up.</br>
</br>
"You're mistaken. I'm not here to steal." Zhao Baodong laughed awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun's hand holding a detector stopped. His finally lifted his buried head, and his apathetic eyes looked at Zhao Baodong.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? I'd hope you're here to steal and not here with some other purpose."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong didn't respond. He pointed the detector at his pulse before stats came up on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Jet addiction is recent?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"You don't have to purposely get high to see me. Medicine is scarce in the wasteland. Even if your employer is rich, it's shameful to waste." Doctor Sun tossed his notebook to the side. "Now, explain your intentions."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong sighed reluctantly, knowing his cover was blown. "Aren't you going to prescribe medicine for me first?"</br>
</br>
A Jet Stopper was thrown into his lap.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong flipped over to see the price tag, and his eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
200 crystals.</br>
</br>
This guy prescribed him the most expensive medicine.</br>
</br>
"Speak your mind," the Doctor said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"With someone's request, I was hoping you could accompany me to a place." Zhao Baodong did his best to make his wording sound less suspicious, but in the end, he realized that regardless of how he said it, it was no different from declaring a kidnapping.</br>
</br>
"What if I said no?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong cautiously scanned the door. Seeing as there was no one eavesdropping, Zhao Baodong said, "This is for your benefit. Believe it or not, this place is about to be gone soon."</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun was silent for a long time before he then asked, "Then tell me why your employer wants to see me."</br>
</br>
"Our leader suspects you're a digitalized human… of course, this doesn't mean we're malicious. We just want to confirm your program-"</br>
</br>
Before Zhao Baodong could finish, Doctor Sun burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong shrugged. He didn't mind a disrespectful laugh, but he just looked at the Doctor in search of an answer.</br>
</br>
Go? Or not go?</br>
</br>
"Is that what your leader told you? Haha, not bad, a digitalized human is a good way to disguise-"</br>
</br>
"Please don't continue," Zhao Baodong immediately said.</br>
</br>
"Afraid you'll find out too much?" Sun Yi glanced at the anxious visitor with a grin. His unaged face had the maturity belonging only to elders.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Zhao Baodong was honest.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen hadn't told him the specifics, that meant Jiang Chen knew his identity. If Zhao Baodong learned about something he shouldn't have, it might not necessarily be beneficial for a small character like him.</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun didn't make it difficult for him. He only shook his head and paused for a moment before he slowly said, "I could go with you."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong was relieved. "Then please."</br>
</br>
"But the time is not now."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong's expression froze, and words came out with difficulty.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
It was hard to take a person out of the capital by force.</br>
</br>
Although this was the ghetto, the outlaw land of the capital, the district outside the capital was patrolled by guards. Even if he was a great fighter, it wouldn't be easy to take someone out of the heavily guarded city.</br>
</br>
"In the past ten years, I've saved a lot of people. Out of everyone, nine of them suffered gun wounds," Doctor Sun said calmly.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, regarding your leader… or the treasure pursued by all people with power, I've completed my research."</br>
</br>
"My previous plan was to make the secret public so everyone could share the wealth exchanged by the blood of the minority. The wasteland could quickly regain its population from before the war, and with the efforts of humanity, the wasteland would be more prosperous, more united, and more pleasant than before the war… we'd work together to create a desirable future."</br>
</br>
"But when I woke up and walked out of the abandoned fallout shelter, I suddenly changed my mind. It wasn't because of the despairing barrenness, but something more depressing."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong was curious what his secret was, but his dry throat couldn't make any sounds.</br>
</br>
"You plan to attack this place, right?" Doctor Sun looked at Zhao Baodong expressionlessly. "Then let me see - destroying a city that provides protection for tens of thousands of people, is your leader worthy of the secret in my hands?"</br>
</br>
"If not, I'm prepared to take the secret in my grave."</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 637: The Fuse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The battle ensued.</br>
</br>
Outside the military outpost, white smoke drifted up at the missile launch grounds. Accompanied by blinding flames, missiles soared into the air, one by one.</br>
</br>
"Target hit. Covered unit 14, kill confirmed. Adjusting coordinates (114,23). Smoke covered, over."</br>
</br>
"Roger, number 3 cannon fire."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Inside the control room, the hologram map collected by Aurora-20 reflected real-time battle information to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The leading force of the mutated humans arrived 5 kilometers away from the water treatment plant, but under the barrage of missiles by the NAC and the attack of kinetic skeleton soldiers, they were completely wrecked.</br>
</br>
But the mutated humans naturally didn't understand fear.</br>
</br>
NAC's airstrikes on the FEV virus production bases clearly infuriated the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Guru Tribe mobilized a division of forces totaling 5000 people equipped with artillery, trucks with anti-air cannons, and modified pickup trucks equipped with armor and machine guns. They mobilized to the NAC outpost.</br>
</br>
The leading force included the strongest warriors of Guru Tribe. This included lead mutated humans with power hammers, machine gunners wielding steel armors, and mutated dogs strapped with nuclear grenades.</br>
</br>
But the complete elimination of the leading force brought the commander of the mutated humans some clarity. He didn't order the troops to just swarm the target, but instead, he ordered them to scatter based on the geography of the city. He sent out slaves and mutated humans to launch some fake attacks against the NAC outpost, but it was all inconsequential.</br>
</br>
For some reason, NAC didn't display its full power from the beginning, which gave the mutated humans' commander the false impression that they were equally matched.</br>
</br>
But Empire didn't have this illusion; the unaltered brains of humans were clearly more intelligent than mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Empire also mobilized two divisions totaling ten thousand, deployed around the rural area of Hucheng. It was half of Empire's forces. Such a massive military attack was the first in Hucheng.</br>
</br>
But compared to the brainless rush tactics used by the mutated humans, Empire's soldiers were more cautious and much more devious.</br>
</br>
</br>
They built defense structures along the borders of the rural area, used reinforced steel to fortify abandoned buildings, dug out trenches to separate the battlefield, and connected the buildings with tunnels underground. Needless to say, their tactics were extremely effective against heavy firepower, and it also suited the raiders' battle style of fighting independently.</br>
</br>
From the beginning, their stance was that they would defend their territory with their lives.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind Empire's actions; he didn't plan to use fire suppression against Empire. A "Fireball-1" missile cost 100 credits, and based on the conversion rate of the Sixth Street, it was around 500 crystals. With 2000 rounds of missiles, it would be equivalent to scattering money, although it would make for nice fireworks.</br>
</br>
There was no need to burn money against Empire.</br>
</br>
To dismantle this skyscraper, they just needed to think of a strategy to attack the bottom of the skyscraper disdained by Empire. There was no need to fight to the death against this lousy crowd.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Inside the bar at the capital, rare bottles of alcohol were arranged on the corroded table.</br>
</br>
Two people sat across each other while downing the drinks.</br>
</br>
"I think that increasing one's population to increase power is too rogue." The mercenary with a hat was drunk. He began to talk, and with purposeful probing by Zhao Baodong, he started to blurt out gibberish.</br>
</br>
It was his seventh day inside the capital. Zhao Baodong found the mercenary who led him through the door and said he would treat him to drinks.</br>
</br>
Alcohol was great. It could numb tense nerves; no one on the wasteland disliked it.</br>
</br>
On the table, Zhao Baodang successfully learned his name in addition to other information.</br>
</br>
He was Xiao Hu, a mercenary active between Hucheng and Wu City who mostly ran with the merchant fleets between two cities. He lived a poor, drunken life.</br>
</br>
While he could be witty, he was unintelligent in nature, which made him easy to manipulate.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Zhao Baodong took a sip of the alcohol and looked at him with a grin. "Your perspective is quite unique."</br>
</br>
Xiao Hu felt flattered. He laughed and said, "The people here are weird; a lot of newbies who come here for the first time don't understand why mutated humans are willing to live peacefully with humans."</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong had a brighter smile. "Please explain."</br>
</br>
Then he waved his hand at the bartender to signal two more drinks.</br>
</br>
"You realize that aside from poor hobos inside the ghetto, everyone's lives are okay? But people aren't happy… Of course, I'm referring to people who live here, not travelers who find fun everywhere."</br>
</br>
Xiao Hu's intoxicated face revealed a mysterious smile. He got closer to Zhao Baodong as he said, "Do you want to know why?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Zhao Baodong grinned.</br>
</br>
"They believe in a weird standard of equality. The minority receive more special treatment, and the majority receive less power, yet they refer to this as equality… Equality with the species being the unit."</br>
</br>
"I'm surprised… is the emperor not human?"</br>
</br>
"He's the one cutting the cake, not making the cake." Xiao Hu burped. He took another swig without hiding anything.</br>
</br>
"The Emperor is selected from the elders, so do you expect him to eat the cake? Don't dream about it. Even if two walls of the arena collapse and mutated humans kill a few more humans, they'll continue to live lavish lives... I'm thankful for the NAC merchant fleets. Otherwise, we couldn't eat food even if we have the money." Discussing the emperor and elders in the public already drew the attention of the bartender and the people around them. A lot of people afraid of trouble had already left. Right now, a mutated human, who just finished hunting, was sitting at an empty table nearby and ordered cheap alcohol.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong, who sat across him, laughed and glanced nonchalantly at the dumb-looking mutated human. He shook his head. "Let's not talk about the emperor. I want to listen to your opinion… on the species with special rights."</br>
</br>
"I have no comment. Those bastards just eat and sleep every day and only know how to force slaves who are afraid to resist grow mutated fruits; they know nothing else. I heard that the FEV virus will turn people's head into a mess? Haha, they aren't to be blamed. And the elder from Guru Tribe, ha? Who would worship a cancer patient with a tumor on his back as a God—"</br>
</br>
Slap—</br>
</br>
A loud slap to the face interrupted him.</br>
</br>
Zhao Baodong, who was sitting across him, had already disappeared.</br>
</br>
The voice of Xiao Hu speaking gibberish to his bottle of alcohol had entered the ears of the mutated human. The giant named Andy stood up as he slapped the table, and he gave Xiao Hu's forehead a hard slap.</br>
</br>
With his back on the cold concrete ground, Xiao Hu instantly sobered up. He barely managed up to support himself up from the ground as his bruised face was covered in fear.</br>
</br>
The elder was the elder of mutated humans, the God in every Guru Tribe.</br>
</br>
Even discussing him in public was viewed as disrespectful by the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
"No, no, I-I was just drunk…"</br>
</br>
Xiao Hu couldn't tend to his wounds as he crawled back onto the table while looking at the mutated human walking toward him.</br>
</br>
He hadn't brought a gun with him. Even if he did bring one, he wouldn't dare to shoot at a mutated human here. A mutated human beating him to death would be locked up at most. If he killed a mutated human, he would be enslaved by the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
It was even more terrifying than death.</br>
</br>
Andy smiled menacingly. He stepped out of the bar with his fist clenched toward the human on the ground.</br>
</br>
As everyone watched, the mutated human stepped onto the mercenary. He swung his fist and punched the mercenary in the face.</br>
</br>
Crack—</br>
</br>
Xiao Hu seemed to hear his nose bone cracking, but with his dazed head, he couldn't even scream.</br>
</br>
After a few punches, every punch landed directly, and the green fist was stained with blood.</br>
</br>
"Stop hitting him. He's almost dead," someone whispered, but when met with the mutated human's vicious eyes, that person looked away.</br>
</br>
"Anyone disrespectful to the elder is disrespectful to Guru Tribe! Anyone disrespectful to Guru Tribe must die!" Andy bathed in the countless looks of hatred and fear while he sat on top of Xiao Hu. He laughed psychotically while he swung his powerful fists.</br>
</br>
"ROAR-" The mutated humans cheered on the warrior.</br>
</br>
Perhaps they weren't really respectful of that elder; perhaps they just instinctively craved violence and killing. And the fear present in people's eyes promoted their extremism.</br>
</br>
The guard walked to Andy, but Andy was unafraid.</br>
</br>
Even if he killed the human here, he would at most spend a few days in prison without any prison guard daring to treat him unfairly. Maybe not long after, the leader of Guru Tribe would negotiate with the officials of Empire to demand his release.</br>
</br>
His amber-colored pupils scanned the crowd; he triumphantly exposed his fangs with one word coming out of his ugly mouth:</br>
</br>
"Cowards!"</br>
</br>
Until the miserable-looking mercenary stopped breathing, no one stopped his atrocious actions.</br>
</br>
But then his expression froze.</br>
</br>
His eyes met a gun hidden in the crowd.</br>
</br>
And the smile belonged to a human.</br>
</br>
Bang—</br>
</br>
The sound of a pistol broke through the noise of the market.</br>
</br>
There were deafening screams instantly.</br>
</br>
"Someone was killed!"</br>
</br>
Andy laid in a pool of blood. His widened eyes were written with disbelief. He couldn't believe he would die in Empire's capital.</br>
</br>
The guards looked around without a clue. They attempted to find the shooter, but it was futile in the massive crowd. The angry mutated humans shoved everyone, beating the innocent crowd while trying to find the murder who fired the shot.</br>
</br>
Along with the mass of people, Zhao Baodong disappeared at the end of the market.</br>
</br>
The dead Andy would never know that his death was the tipping point to the collapse of this empire.</br>
</br>
And the same scene was happening in every corner of Empire.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 638: Insurgence</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside the palace, the emperor sat on his dragon chair and elders stood on both sides. In the middle was a mutated human covered in Death Claw fur.</br>
</br>
In mutated human society, only a clan leader of ten thousand could wear clothes made of Death Claw fur.</br>
</br>
"My people are in a bloodbath against NAC invaders in the frontlines! And you, you cowards, are curled up behind the bunker. Is this the glory you referred to?" This rude roar made the tiles of the palace shake. The emperor on the dragon chair's had a grave face, but he couldn't say a single aggressive word against the discourteous green-skinned man.</br>
</br>
The prosperity of Empire required the support of mutated humans. When he considered the bigger picture, he couldn't break ties with Guru Tribe.</br>
</br>
The Emperor hid his anger behind his black pupils.</br>
</br>
"I'll order the frontline forces to accelerate the attack against NAC."</br>
</br>
"No need!" The mutated human ten thousand clan leader swung his hand and glanced the emperor and guards with contempt. "Just let your cowards continue to hide behind the bunkers. Useless people should stay where they belong; the battlefield belongs to warriors! Our people will tear apart the people who dare to offend Guru Tribe."</br>
</br>
"But-" The ten thousand clan leader's words took a sharp turn and he stared at the emperor directly in the eyes. He fiercely said, "I want to ask you - regarding the unfair treatment received by the mutated humans, what's going on!?"</br>
</br>
[Unfair?]</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k! How do you want this to be fairer? More special treatment?]</br>
</br>
The emperor didn't say anything, but the guards by the pillar were almost furious. They had never seen a mutated human this shameless.</br>
</br>
"I will order the soldiers to search for the murderers," the emperor said.</br>
</br>
"The blood of 154 mutated humans needs to be washed by 154 criminals." The ten thousand clan leader gave a bloodthirsty laugh.</br>
</br>
"I know," the emperor replied.</br>
</br>
"I hope you know, or else I'll let you know." His amber pupils were as bloodthirsty as a Death Claw's.</br>
</br>
He looked at the emperor threateningly before he turned around and left with the mutated human soldiers surrounding him.</br>
</br>
When the green-skinned things left, the emperor smashed the table and cursed out.</br>
</br>
"These monsters! They can't just bully us like this!"</br>
</br>
The emperor and elders of Empire were all raiders before; their thug nature was merely hidden by their glamorous clothes.</br>
</br>
"Emperor, what should we do?" an elder asked with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
The soldiers couldn't even find one murderer, let alone 154 murderers. Those people clearly had a plan. Otherwise, they wouldn't have committed 154 murders in three days.</br>
</br>
It was a conspiracy against the friendship between Empire and the mutated humans; anyone could easily see that.</br>
</br>
Aside from the simple-brained mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The emperor hadn't been this bothered by the intelligence of the bastards.</br>
</br>
</br>
A simple conspiracy could make them start a war against NAC, and the NAC could use tactics to force them to stand on the side opposing Empire.</br>
</br>
A silent atmosphere lingered in the palace. At that moment, someone broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Emperor, I have a strategy."</br>
</br>
An elder walked up.</br>
</br>
The elders all looked at him with shock. This elder was the least respected among all the elders, and he always sat at the end of the banquet table.</br>
</br>
He normally didn't have the opportunity to speak during meetings, but now, since no one had any good ideas, no one spoke against him.</br>
</br>
The emperor thought for a moment with his head lowered before he finally remembered the name of this elder. He slowly said.</br>
</br>
"Chen Lin, go ahead."</br>
</br>
Chen Lin walked up two stairs and smiled with a grimace. He suggested to the emperor, "The mutated humans believe their rights were violated, so we could just comfort them like usual."</br>
</br>
"But what could we give them?" the emperor asked, frustrated.</br>
</br>
"Only 154 heads. Since they need the murderers, we'll just hand them over." With ferocity in his voice, Chen Lin looked directly at the emperor.</br>
</br>
The emperor raised his eyebrows, not understanding what Chen Lin meant.</br>
</br>
But then he caught on and instantly understood the deeper meaning.</br>
</br>
Since mutated humans' brains couldn't distinguish the murderers.</br>
</br>
Then were they just going to kill a few random people and use their heads to comfort them?</br>
</br>
"Where would we find 154 people?" The emperor's fingers tapped the armrest of the dragon chair as he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
With a grimace, the elder walked beside the emperor and whispered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"There are ten thousand slaves working in Donggang Plantation. 154 missing slaves is nothing at all…"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"How long will this war last?" Standing on top of the wall, Sun Xiaorou dangled her legs while picking up binoculars to observe the horizon in the distance.</br>
</br>
In the distance, the sun was sliding west.</br>
</br>
NAC unleashed 1000 combustion missiles on the mutated humans' zone of control and suppressed them within the city. Based on the casualty reports from Aurora-20's reconnaissance, the mutated human's 5000 division lost about a third of its troops with all armored units destroyed.</br>
</br>
But NAC still hadn't served the final blow. They maintained the illusion that they were fairly matched.</br>
</br>
Before the arrival of the signal of Empire's collapse, NAC needed the mutated humans to maintain their arrogance.</br>
</br>
Next to Sun Xiaorou, Jiang Chen carefully observed the side of her face.</br>
</br>
Sometimes, he thought she was extremely similar to her sister.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then shifted his gaze to the distance.</br>
</br>
"It depends how well the Hunter Division is doing."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua stepped onto the wall and walked behind him.</br>
</br>
"The ten thousand slaves in Donggang Plantation are uprising."</br>
</br>
When he heard his long-awaited message, a victorious smile surfaced on his face.</br>
</br>
With the Hunter Division's purposeful provocation, the tension between Empire citizens and officials was pushed to its maximum. And the foolish idea of sacrificing slaves was suggested by an elder bribed by Zhao Baodong. When this news spread out between the slaves, even the numbest people couldn't suppress the fury in the bottoms of their hearts.</br>
</br>
They just needed a person to lead and a person to give them a few guns before they would naturally choose the option to riot.</br>
</br>
NAC didn't need to send out a single troop.</br>
</br>
"Good. In this case, we should start moving."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded and turned around.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou stood up from the edge of the wall, patted the dust off her hand and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Finally going to start fighting?"</br>
</br>
With a smile, Jiang Chen raised his head and gazed at the steel airship.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, time to display our true power."</br>
</br>
In the lingering sunset glow, this was the first time the Hammer of Order was stained with a menacing vibe.</br>
</br>
Just like the signal produced from a conductor's baton, the prelude to the fall of Empire was about to begin.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
No humans wanted to die.</br>
</br>
Slaves were no exception.</br>
</br>
Donggang was inhabited before. Shortly after the building of the wall, it became a plantation for mutated fruits. Later on, it became a plantation worked on by slaves.</br>
</br>
There were criminals, people captured by raiders, poor people, or people purely in debt working there. They could withstand the plantation work, and they could withstand supervisors cursing and hitting them as long as they weren't slaves of mutated humans. Once they worked their time, they could obtain their freedom and become free.</br>
</br>
But recently, a rumor spread among the slaves.</br>
</br>
Mutated humans were being murdered in Empire.</br>
</br>
Empire planned to use the heads of slaves to calm the anger of mutated humans.</br>
</br>
No one believed this at first since it was completely absurd. While they were the slaves of Empire, they were still citizens of Empire. Empire had the right to exploit them, but it had no right to take their lives away.</br>
</br>
That was their boundary, the only boundary they had since being exploited.</br>
</br>
But one night, some people came from the capital with the plan of taking away 154 slaves.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the people executing the orders didn't have a brain. Everyone in the territory knew of the rumors everywhere concerning violence against the 154 mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Combined with the "rumor" from before, the intention of taking away 154 slaves now was obvious.</br>
</br>
The plantation workers were completely enraged.</br>
</br>
No one wanted to die because of this absurd reason.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the glorious uprising started.</br>
</br>
The supervisors and guards had guns while the slaves only had hoes and shovels, but that was fine. This was the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The insurgents were divided into two groups - one group blew up the wall of the plantation, and another group used hoes and shovels to ambush the patrol route.</br>
</br>
Survivors on the wasteland learned how horrific zombies could be at night. Even Death Claws had to fear the zombies - they would chew away any living creature.</br>
</br>
When the zombies broke through the wall, the group paid a price of ten lives to break through the guards' chests. They picked up their guns and attacked the armory according to plan.</br>
</br>
The plantation was in complete chaos.</br>
</br>
The guards rushed to the collapsed wall and used barbed wire to create a line of defense. They used rifles to kill the zombies swarming inside the plantation. Inside this chaotic environment, no one noticed the patrolling guards being killed, and no one noticed the slaves with guns breaking into the armory.</br>
</br>
The mobilized slaves flooded the armory. They went from barehanded rioters to fully equipped insurgents and began attacking the Empire army.</br>
</br>
The hundreds of guards and supervisors were just a boat in the middle of a hurricane in the face of the anger of ten thousand slaves. They were quickly flooded by bullets from the insurgents and the claws of zombies. After a bloodbath and paying a price of five hundred lives, the insurgents used barbed wires and trucks to block the hole in the wall and cleared out the zombies that invaded the plantation.</br>
</br>
</br>
431 heads were cut off, including the official sent from Empire.</br>
</br>
The flag of Empire was burnt and converted into the survivors' own flag.</br>
</br>
Just like a spark, the riot at Donggang Plantation ignited the flame of separation.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Below the steel airship, the electromagnetic cannon named "The Hammer of Order" lowered slightly and aimed directly at the mutated humans' zone of control.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, blue electric arcs jumped between the tracks. Like a bright light, it illuminated the darkness. The mutated humans inside the bunkers gazed at the unnatural light source with confusion. At the same time, the NAC soldiers hidden in the bunkers silently reloaded their clips and opened tactical images on their helmets.</br>
</br>
"Firing coordinate is adjusted."</br>
</br>
"Capacitor is charged."</br>
</br>
"Bomb loaded."</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
Following captain Jiang Chen's orders, the gunner opened the safety and pressed the red button.</br>
</br>
Buzz—</br>
</br>
Like the vibration of a cicada's wings, the screeching, buzzing sound was clear even inside the airship.</br>
</br>
Water molecules were electrolyzed and oxygen was ozonized. There were ripples in the air close to the electromagnetic pulse cannon accompanying the electric blue arcs.</br>
</br>
In the mutated humans' eyes, the blinding blue light instantly turned the night sky into bright daylight, and a trail of orange light instantly flashed out.</br>
</br>
"Boom-"</br>
</br>
The 100-kilogram bomb smashed into the ground. Just like a bullet hitting jelly, the empty shell popped out onto the soil and threw everything on the ground into the air.</br>
</br>
Sand and soil covered the area.</br>
</br>
Broken shrapnel and stone shards blew by like a hurricane and shredded everything in the eye of the storm then buried the world.</br>
</br>
When the dust scattered, the bloodthirstiness in the pupils of the mutated humans faded, and only deep fear remained as they watched the massive crater in the middle of their zone of control.</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
"Why didn't the NAC use this before?"</br>
</br>
Only two questions circled in the mutated human soldiers, but before they could react to this outcome, a hailstorm of missiles dropped down.</br>
</br>
The combustion materials danced in the air and submerged everything it touched into a fiery sea. The extent of the fire was far greater and violent compared to previous times.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans began to retreat, but it was too late.</br>
</br>
The fire stopped, and the NAC soldiers charged. With the assistance of Aurora-20 airstrikes, they started to reap the lives of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The force of 5000 people collapsed in less than half an hour of battle. The mutated humans escaped to the city and jumped into the river. The scene was tragic.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the pursuing force happened to encounter the mutated humans' second division, and an intense crossfire took place in the forested area.</br>
</br>
Every ten minutes, a 100-kilogram bomb rained down on the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
In response to the terrifying heaven cannon and barrage of missiles, the mutated humans had to scatter.</br>
</br>
But once they scattered, their numerical advantage instantly disappeared.</br>
</br>
Faced with soldiers in kinetic skeletons, the mutated humans with just magazine clips and fur on their bodies were destined to face a one-sided slaughter.</br>
</br>
Kill them all!</br>
</br>
That was the only order given to the NAC soldiers.</br>
</br>
There was no mercy for the bloodthirsty mutated humans.</br>
</br>
NAC didn't need mutated human captives nor people to capture mutated humans, so there was no reason to accept a surrender!</br>
</br>
When the first light shone from the horizon and scattered the ray of dawn, the blood in the soil was the first to be lit up. It extended from the shambles of the water treatment plant, extending all the way to the west of Panyang Lake…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 640: The Doomsday of Guru Tribe</br>
</div></br>
</br>
While NAC was launching a full-scale attack against Guru Tribe, Empire's commander at the frontlines realized their opportunity might have come.</br>
</br>
The hailstorm of missiles was dominating, but they couldn't have an infinite supply. Since NAC had one thousand soldiers, their shortage in numbers meant they couldn't fight on both lines.</br>
</br>
But at the critical point of fending off an external enemy, there was a servant coup taking place in Empire. Aside from the arena in the capital, almost all territories lit up with uprising smoke. The Donggang Plantation had the largest uprising. The slaves not only occupied the armory and executed the supervisors of the plantation, but they also hung heads up on the walls!</br>
</br>
At the same time, Federation pushed their mechanized division next to Gang River, eager to move against Empire on the brink of collapse. The two sides had fought in the open and in the dark for many years. This was Empire's most tumultuous period in twenty years, so their arch enemy naturally wouldn't let go of this heaven-sent opportunity.</br>
</br>
They had been drooling over Empire's "vast" territory and massive population. If they could annex Empire's land, including the territory east of Gang River, into its borders, Federation would indeed become the most powerful force in the province.</br>
</br>
Faced with external and internal threats, the elders immediately ordered a retreat.</br>
</br>
The two Empire divisions had to give up on the perfect opportunity to attack the NAC outpost. With their backs against their mutated human allies who suffered an excruciating defeat, they had to retreat from the defense bunkers they just built.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
July 1st marked over half a month since the NAC soldiers set foot in Hucheng.</br>
</br>
They used the cover of the night to fly their flag of order over Guru Tribe's land.</br>
</br>
With the assistance of missiles, NAC's forces broke through Guru Tribe's line of defense.</br>
</br>
In the final moment of battle, their reserves of missiles and bombs were all exhausted, but they were okay without any support.</br>
</br>
Their victory was already certain. With a population of 80 thousand mutated humans, over 50 thousand died under missile fire. The remainder died, escaped, or fell under the airstrike of Aurora-20.</br>
</br>
The ten thousand clan leader died.</br>
</br>
When he rushed out from the shadows swinging his power hammer, he wanted to vent his anger through brute force. But he didn't manage to kill anyone - his head was cut off by Jiang Chen's private force captain, Li Wang, with a dagger.</br>
</br>
Guru Tribe's elder took his confidants and supplies to escape into the fallout shelter. They locked the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's orders on the mutated humans acting like turtles were concise.</br>
</br>
"Bury them."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't interested in the FEV virus anyways.</br>
</br>
It made no difference whether it was buried or destroyed.</br>
</br>
With the size of the mutated humans, they couldn't remain in the hibernation chamber. Even if the fridges of the fallout shelter were stuffed with food, it would last them ten years at most.</br>
</br>
</br>
When their food become depleted, there could only be two endings.</br>
</br>
Starve to death.</br>
</br>
Or death through internal conflict.</br>
</br>
Regardless of the ending, only despair and death awaited them.</br>
</br>
That was the punishment for the atrocities they committed under the tolerance of Empire.</br>
</br>
Soldiers in power armor threw the mini-nukes they confiscated from Guru Tribe into the end of the tunnel underground then Jiang Chen pressed the detonate button.</br>
</br>
The high temperature even melted the surface of the fallout shelter. A scorching light erupted from the ground like an active volcano and brought burning radiation dust to the surface.</br>
</br>
The explosion shook the ground. Even the capital, tens of kilometers from Panyang Lake, could sense the tremor.</br>
</br>
The 1000-meter tunnel collapsed and buried the fallout shelter stored with FEV virus data underground eternally.</br>
</br>
With the cheers of the slaves, NAC soldiers took control of mutated human territory.</br>
</br>
20 thousand slaves were all freed, and Guru Tribe was renamed Golden River Farm and categorized as an NAC economic zone in Hucheng. All citizens could join NAC at their will, record their information to obtain an identity card, receive nutrient supply aid, and wait for the next arrangements.</br>
</br>
To ease the process, under Jiang Chen's directions, Wang Zhaowu selected 500 reserves from the villages beside the water treatment plant who joined NAC from the beginning. A small amount of leadership from Third Division soldiers was provided to maintain the order of the farm while nutrient supply was distributed.</br>
</br>
The raw ingredients for nutrient supply were all available, and the mutated humans' warehouses were filled with mutated fruit, so Jiang Chen didn't feel any pain in consuming 20 thousand nutrient supplies per day. Some of the land already planted with mutated fruit trees were divided among the slaves.</br>
</br>
While these freed slaves were still planting mutated fruit, free citizens with property worked much harder.</br>
</br>
They worked for mutated humans before, but now, they worked for next month's food.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The tent of Guru Tribe elder was bulldozed, and NAC's construction robots rebuilt a concrete command past at the same spot.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was inside the command post discussing next steps with Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"Empire's First Division is currently in a stalemate on the Gang River Bridge against Federation. From the position of the cannons, it is highly likely it will escalate into a military conflict."</br>
</br>
"Picking the fruit while we're working on Empire? Federation has a good plan. Aside from a standoff, did they do anything else?" Jiang Chen didn't seem worried and laughed instead.</br>
</br>
"No." Han Junhua shooked her head. "They should be waiting for us to finish resting."</br>
</br>
"While we demolish Empire's land forces, they'll cut the meat behind their backs?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded. Her calm eyes cast a rational light. "That's right."</br>
</br>
"So your suggestion is...?"</br>
</br>
"If General is planning to include Federation in NAC's territory, how much meat they cut from Empire doesn't really affect us."</br>
</br>
"Makes sense." A smile surfaced on Jiang Chen's face then he changed the topic. "What are the movements of the other three divisions?"</br>
</br>
"Empire's Third Division retreated to the capital for defense, while Empire's Fourth Division is contracting its line of defense. They're clearing out local insurgents. Empire's Second Division moved to Donggang Plantation and surrounded the local insurgents with cannons and mortars. But due to the frequent activity of zombies and mutants nearby and lack of ammunition, the defense still remains intact while the attack caused sizeable casualties to the insurgents. The local insurgents requested assistance from us through radio."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only contemplated for two seconds before he strategized the attack.</br>
</br>
"Respond to their request for assistance. Send Aurora-20 to strike Empire's Second Division. Before the next batch of supplies arrives, we still need them to waste some more time."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 641: The Business Opportunity behind the War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
NAC's declaration of war against Empire caused an earthquake in Hucheng.</br>
</br>
But a more destructive earthquake occurred in the Sixth Street hundreds of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The morning of the third day, when the day just broke, the Sixth Street bank was crowded with a massive group of people. Compared to the survivors in ragged clothes in Hucheng, these people's hair style and fashion was much more glamorous. Their faces were also filled with excitement and joy.</br>
</br>
Eight in the morning, the bell of the hour rang from the bell tower.</br>
</br>
The instant the sign changed from  to , the crowd began to move.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Don't push me, are you rushing to reincarnate?!"</br>
</br>
"Why are you pushing? People in the front can't even walk!"</br>
</br>
"Don't cut the line! Fu*k, where's your courtesy?!"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
The guards already prepared yellow lines to separate the crowds into lines to maintain order.</br>
</br>
Because of the existence of newspapers, they received the success from the frontline at the earliest time. While at the same time, multiple newspapers of the NAC all had the same headline.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's iron seal was printed along with the headline.</br>
</br>
Underneath the headline, the Sixth Street Bank analyst assessed Hucheng population as well as the most critical investment value. With the backup of the military government, the rating was of course A+.</br>
</br>
It wasn't because Jiang Chen was trying to fool the Sixth Street investors, because Hang City's Merchant Alliance also gave a similar rating of A.</br>
</br>
Compared to the coastal area of Wanghai, the population and radiation level of the soil were both higher than inland; only the military government controlled Shengxiang Town's soil quality was better. Therefore, the plantations in NAC territory had relatively poor performance.</br>
</br>
With the increase in population, including the Sixth Street, all the Wanghai survivors consumed an astronomical amount of nutrient supply. Since not everyone could afford to eat actual food each meal, most of the people's consumption consisted of the disgusting nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
But with the average spending of the population also rising, most of the people could afford nutrient supply above B grade. And the ingredient of the B grade nutrient supply was the basic "produce" of the wasteland – mutated fruit.</br>
</br>
The mutant pasture recently popularized in NAC also required consumption of a large number of mutated fruits as the feed for Long Haired Pig.</br>
</br>
Not only mutated fruits, Carm tree sap, bullet shell grains, and other ingredients also had high demands in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Therefore, all the investors acutely captured two keywords from the newspaper: "Labor" and "Land".</br>
</br>
With those two things, whether it was mutated fruit or Carm tree sap, the demand could be satisfied.</br>
</br>
And because of this, the investors were eager to take out the cash from their pockets and rush to foot the bill of the war.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was the same as the last time when the war bond was sold. Chu Nan sat at the spot by the window while eating buns, drinking soymilk, and reading through the newspaper on the table. Zhao Chenwu sat across him; the council member that slashed the boss of Zhao Corporation woke up early every morning to not miss the breakfast at the council building cafeteria.</br>
</br>
"War is always the catalyst for the economy." Chu Nan stuffed the bun into his mouth while glancing at the jam-packed group of people outside with a grin.</br>
</br>
"I cannot agree more." Zhao Chenwu nodded.</br>
</br>
The bank sat beside the council building, and the line extended from the door of the bank all the way to the square in front of the council building. The people swinging their bills had higher morale for the war than the soldiers unleashing bullets in the bunkers six hundred kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The war against Guru Tribe consumed around one million in credits for the cost of bullets, missiles, bombs, and other supplies. But the war was only for two days before more than half of the one million credits were recovered.</br>
</br>
No, they even made some money.</br>
</br>
With the money from the investors, NAC could send more orders to the military factories. At the same time, the investors spending money in Hucheng will invest more credits there to build farms, construct factories on NAC's colony, and bring more prosperity to NAC.</br>
</br>
When Chu Nan thought about this, the usually calm Chu Nan was particularly delighted.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu, on the other hand, was more collected. It was not because he had an indifferent attitude… it was because he laughed enough last night.</br>
</br>
The bigger companies with a positive relationship with NAC didn't need to be like the investors outside, lining up at the bank door. They had special "VIP windows" to purchase a large amount of land.</br>
</br>
Although Zhao Corporation mostly focused on the food business, they maintained a segment of their business in nutrient supply. With 1000 acre of high-quality soil in Golden River farm, when he finished calling Jiang Chen yesterday, he almost fell down from his chair due to happiness.</br>
</br>
But despite being happy, in order to best develop the farm six hundred kilometers outside, he still had urgent matters to discuss with Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, the airship is indeed great." Zhao Chanwu exclaimed while looking at the people outside, "If the airship can be used in commercial transportation, we will no longer need to engage in crossfire with the raiders along the way."</br>
</br>
When Chu Nan heard Zhao Chenwu's words, he found it comical.</br>
</br>
He had worked with this guy for quite a period of time and he knew exactly what he was thinking. Although the old fox's eyes were looking out the window, his attention was on him.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you know it is pretty hard to obtain helium. Before we can meet the military demand, we don't have plans to open the production for a private airship."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu looked awkward having being caught red-handed by Chu Nan, he chuckled and continued to ask without shame.</br>
</br>
"What about hydrogen? Without helium, we can use hydrogen as a replacement. Since we are floating above the clouds, the probability of an accident is low. It should be okay if I order a few hydrogen airships."</br>
</br>
While a hydrogen airship was more dangerous, from a cost perspective, transporting by air costed much less than transporting by land. As long as the accident rate was controlled below 1%, even with a few accidents, it was a profitable situation.</br>
</br>
"You're not afraid of death, eh." Chu Nan glanced at him, "Are you sure it is safer to float in the air? The raiders even dared to shoot the NAC blimps, they won't let you go free either."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, we'll bear any loss!" Zhao Chenwu used a negotiating tone.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, there is nothing to discuss here." Chu Nan dismissed the idea before putting the last bun in his mouth, "But if we do have that plan, we'll notify you immediately."</br>
</br>
With Chu Nan's firm stance, Zhao Chenwu had no other choice.</br>
</br>
"Please and thank you."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 642: Better Wish for Luck</br>
</div></br>
</br>
An airship was indeed great.</br>
</br>
When they saw NAC's steel airship and the supply blimp sending ammunition six hundred kilometers away, all the merchants travelling at the Sixth Street acutely observed this point.</br>
</br>
Due to the six hundred kilometers distance to transport from Hucheng to Wanghai, the raiders or mutants along the way would usually cause sizable damage to the merchant fleets. Based on the road condition of the wasteland, anything sold in Wanghai from Hucheng would cost at least double.</br>
</br>
But with the existence of an airship, the situation would drastically be different.</br>
</br>
Some merchants even considered ordering a few private airships from the Sixth Street military factory. While they didn't have the money for the steel version, the normal blimp version would be fine.</br>
</br>
But the only obstacle was helium, because of the nuclear fusion power station, helium was abundant before the war. But today after the war, obtaining helium was as difficult as ascending into the air. Without helium and the hydrogen blimp being too dangerous; they had to put a hold on the idea for now.</br>
</br>
In NAC, helium was a strategic resource.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, UA in the modern world was dumping helium to the market.</br>
</br>
As the strategic reverse for blimps, UA's helium strategic reserve built in 1925 consisted of 30% of the world's helium reserve. But followed by the blimp making an exit from military operations, the reserve cost a large maintenance bill per year. Therefore, the Congress made the decision to sell all the helium 15 years ago. And this decision made helium in the global market extremely cheap with price twenty times below its actual value.</br>
</br>
And because of this, Jiang Chen could obtain large amounts of helium to aid the production in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
But if the production of commercial blimps was made available, the liquid helium he brought from the modern world would not be enough. There were approximately five hundred merchant fleets that conducted trade across long distances at the Sixth Street. If they were to maintain five hundred blimps, the helium consumed per day would be enough to build another airship.</br>
</br>
Before the helium production could be resolved, Jiang Chen had no plan to make the helium reserve available.</br>
</br>
After discussion with Chu Nan, NAC decided to establish two air transportation cargos between Wanghai and Hucheng with two new 300 tons large blimps. This route would be a supplement to the land trade route to provide transportation service for the larger companies.</br>
</br>
The blimps would also provide direct transportation to the survivors traveling between the two locations with a cost</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Five days passed since Guru Tribe ceased to exist.</br>
</br>
Empire and Federation maintained their stalemate across the river, Donggang Plantation insurgents desperately tried to hold their ground with the siege of Empire's army.</br>
</br>
With NAC's arrival, the entire Hucheng turned into a mess.</br>
</br>
</br>
Contrary to Empire's chaotic state, NAC controlled territory was pleasant. Golden River Farm resumed its production with the slaves of mutated humans turned into the owner of the land and began building houses in NAC's designated area.</br>
</br>
Inside the farm, businessmen in suits could be occasionally seen accompanied by a few mercenaries. They were mostly investors of the Sixth Street and luckily purchased land from the bank. The moment they obtained their land permit, the merchants all hopped on to the newly opened airship route and headed to Hucheng six hundred kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Brought along with them were concrete, steel, graphene pipelines, and other construction materials. The walls of Golden River Farm were reinforced and a small market sprouted from the ground. The seed of order was planted; it wouldn't take long before prosperity began to germinate.</br>
</br>
While Golden River Farm was undergoing its rebuilding phase, Empire under tremendous stress finally sent an ambassador out to Jiang Chen, expressing their desire for freedom. However, Jiang Chen with an advantage would not agree.</br>
</br>
"Get your Emperor to see me, perhaps I will let him keep his palace and let him continue to be the emperor of that arena. Or else, tell him to pray." This was what Jiang Chen told the ambassador who was kneeling on the ground.</br>
</br>
If the emperor recognized the situation and willingly joined under NAC's banner, it was not a big deal for him to continue to be the Emperor. Although he would not receive the treatment of being above all, he could easily live the rest of his life in peace and comfort.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, the elders and the Emperor were enraged by NAC General's "arrogant" attitude.</br>
</br>
"These rats, how dare they!"</br>
</br>
Smashing his cup on the ground, the Emperor cursed out.</br>
</br>
"Emperor please remain calm. As long as we mobilize the army of Empire, we will definitely be able to defeat the external bandits!"</br>
</br>
"That NAC General is way too arrogant! Does he really think Empire doesn't have people?"</br>
</br>
"But Federation's army is still across the river…" People who understood reminded in a feeble voice.</br>
</br>
With these words, the enraged elders instantly deflated and couldn't say a word more.</br>
</br>
That's right.</br>
</br>
The threat Empire faced not only came from the east, but it also came from Federation, west of Gang River. With the loss of Guru Tribe, Empire was already at a disadvantage against Federation, now they faced the threat of the NAC.</br>
</br>
The petrifying firepower advantage was hard for anyone to gain the courage to resist.</br>
</br>
Emperor on the dragon chair was silent while he watched the elders gravely. These useless things were witty when discussing how to spend the money in the treasury, they all had a flawless accounting book, and they were all peerless when it came to conspiracy.</br>
</br>
But in this critical moment, they couldn't be lousier.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, where did Chen Lin go?" An elder suddenly spoke up.</br>
</br>
The palace suddenly became rowdy again.</br>
</br>
"That's right! Where did that fool go, why didn't we see him!"</br>
</br>
"Capture him! If it were not for that dumba*s' idea, our two divisions should be fighting against NAC at the frontline rather than being forced to Donggang Plantation!"</br>
</br>
"Right!"</br>
</br>
Without being about to think of a solution to solve the difficult problem at hand, the elders put their attention into finding the scapegoat. Even if it served no purpose in resurrecting Empire from the losing situation, it was the only thing they could do and can do.</br>
</br>
When the Emperor heard the words of the elders, he began to realize what they said is true.</br>
</br>
If it were not for Chen Lin's recommendation to use the slaves to comfort Guru Tribe, how would the situation evolve to this state? He didn't come today because he realized his crime.</br>
</br>
Emperor looked at the guard beside him with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
"My order. Arrest Elder Chen Lin, and demote his wife and daughter to slaves."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The guard nodded and walked away.</br>
</br>
Just then, a familiar voice came from the door.</br>
</br>
"No need for the trouble, I'm here."</br>
</br>
Elder Chen stood tall at the door.</br>
</br>
Beside him was a figure familiar to everyone at the scene – Commander of Empire's Third Division, Wei Biao.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 643: A New Owner of Capital</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the palace cooled to freezing point. The instant Chen Lin's big belly appeared at the door, disbelief froze on all the elders' faces.</br>
</br>
"Wei Biao? What are you doing here?" The emperor frowned and asked with a cold voice.</br>
</br>
"Emperor, you still don't understand? I thought Emperor is smarter than this." Chen Lin's pair of small eyes glanced over the elders and finally stopped on the emperor's face.</br>
</br>
How many years has it been?</br>
</br>
He was excluded from the center of power in Empire. No matter how many terms, the abducted crown was far away from his grasp. But today, the "influential elders" all looked at him with fear.</br>
</br>
Emperor stared right into Wei Biao's eyes and ordered, "Arrest him."</br>
</br>
The commander previously loyal to Empire didn't move.</br>
</br>
His reaction validated the emperor's suspicion, Third Empire stationed in the capital committed treason. The brave division was the proudness of Empire before, but the emperor never would have thought that the commander he personally appointed would stand here.</br>
</br>
The emperor's throat felt dry, but he still squeezed out a word.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"We can't win." Wei Biao's response was brief.</br>
</br>
As a previous PAC soldier, his grasp on the battle was more superior than anyone in the palace. When he saw the missile hailstorm, he realized that it was an uneven war from the start.</br>
</br>
The only chance of winning was to launch an attack against NAC's outpost when NAC was unleashing its firepower on Guru Tribe.</br>
</br>
But the smokes of the uprising sealed the fate of Empire.</br>
</br>
The slaves at Donggang Plantation became insurgents to force the two divisions at the frontline to retreat. Federation took the opportunity to line troops west of Gang River to hinder the movement of Empire's First Division…</br>
</br>
Empire lost the opportunity to attack the NAC outpost.</br>
</br>
When NAC's missiles were resupplied and the bomb in the electromagnetic pulse cannon was reloaded, NAC with an absolute firepower advantage meant that Third Division stationed in the capital was only awaiting their death. If they wanted, cleansing the entire capital will only require 1000 combustion missiles.</br>
</br>
Wei Biao trusts that they had the ammunition.</br>
</br>
"Just because of this?" The emperor squeezed the words out difficulty.</br>
</br>
Wei Biao didn't look at the emperor in the eyes, he lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"Emperor, please step down."</br>
</br>
"What if I say no?" The emperor narrowed his eyes and signaled the guards beside him.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I just want to live with my brothers." Wei Biao raised his head and put his hand on his waist.</br>
</br>
The pupils of the emperor instantly contracted.</br>
</br>
Behind Wei Biao, the fierce soldiers with rifles stepped into the palace…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The gunshots lasted ten minutes; blood soaked the carpet of the palace. The guards and soldiers engaged in intense crossfire, but the ending was evident. The difference in number could not be made up by shooting.</br>
</br>
</br>
When the shooting stopped, the elders all died under the fire of the Third Division soldiers.</br>
</br>
The emperor on the dragon chair looked at everything in front of his eyes blankly without being able to say a word.</br>
</br>
Wei Biao wanted to keep the emperor's life, but Chen Lin took out the pistol hidden in his pocket and personally killed the poor elder on the dragon chair.</br>
</br>
Seeing the emperor had already died, while Wei Biao was displeased, he had to let it go.</br>
</br>
The Third Division quarantined the palace; the death of the emperor didn't cause a ripple in the Empire on the brink of collapse.</br>
</br>
When the news was controlled, Chen Lin immediately came to find Zhao Baodong to deliver the message of surrender to NAC. After an hour, when the NAC airship arrived above the capital, the residents of the capital just realized…</br>
</br>
The sky just changed.</br>
</br>
"Is this the capital?"</br>
</br>
On the drop pod of Order, Jiang Chen observed the arena just ten square kilometers in size from above. Inside the arena was filled with concrete structures and crude tents; narrow paths mixed among the buildings.</br>
</br>
"That's right, this is their capital." Beside Jiang Chen was Zhao Chenwu, looking at the palace from the top. His voice carried a hint of mockery.</br>
</br>
The drop pod was lowered by graphene cables.</br>
</br>
Bathing in the fearful sights from the square, Jiang Chen along with ten soldiers in power armor stepped into the middle of Capital Square.</br>
</br>
Empire's Third Division already dropped their weapon and first surrendered to the NAC force.</br>
</br>
Eleven survivor locations of Empire were categorized as NAC's economic zone governed by an elected government and supervised by a NAC-sent director responsible for the defense of the location.</br>
</br>
When Chen Lin waiting on the square saw Jiang Chen, he immediately came to greet him with a complemental smile.</br>
</br>
"I'm Chen Lin, I've been awaiting Mr. General's arrival."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the last elder of Empire before he focused his attention on the man behind him.</br>
</br>
"I heard you were a PAC soldier?"</br>
</br>
"That's already history."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed when Wei Biao said this, he used "history" instead of "past".</br>
</br>
Without saying more to him, Jiang Chen then glanced over to Zhao Baodong with his chest raised high, he nodded, pleased.</br>
</br>
"Excellent, you did great this time."</br>
</br>
"It is due to General's mentoring," Zhao Baodong replied, his face flushed.</br>
</br>
To receive such a grand compliment, he will definitely be promoted. While excited, Zhao Baodong used the opportunity to suck up.</br>
</br>
"That's enough. No need to suck up to me. If you have nothing to report, go stay for a bit on the airship. You will be rewarded along with the soldiers."</br>
</br>
"Thank you, General!" Zhao Baodong was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
Being left hanging by Jiang Chen, Chen Lin began to feel anxious. When Zhao Baodong came to find him, he promised that if he did as told under NAC's directions, when they conquered Empire's capital, he would be guaranteed wealth and glory.</br>
</br>
Now that the capital was part of NAC's territory, and when it was time for NAC to fulfill the promise, Chen Lin became unsettled again.</br>
</br>
Just as Chen Lin was hesitating if he should remind Jiang Chen not to forget about him, Jiang Chen looked at him with an ambiguous smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you're the last elder of Empire."</br>
</br>
"General, you're being funny." Chen Lin's back was bent and he awkwardly laughed, "Empire is already kneeling in front of you, there is no more elder."</br>
</br>
To the flattering attitude of the elder, Jiang Chen grinned and said.</br>
</br>
"There definitely should still be elders, but from now on, you're working for me."</br>
</br>
"General… the other elders are all dead," Chen Lin carefully said.</br>
</br>
"Dead?" Jiang Chen paused and looked over to Wei Biao.</br>
</br>
"Dead due to resistance," Wei Biao briefly answered.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 644: The Officials</br>
</div></br>
</br>
All dead?</br>
</br>
It certainly surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He originally wanted to select a few elders that forsake darkness for light to let them organize the affairs of this arena for him, but they all died.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Chen Lin with a deeper layer of meaning in his eyes.</br>
</br>
The ambiguous smile made Chen Lin afraid to look him in the eyes.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Chen is decisive; nice tactic."</br>
</br>
With a drop of cold sweat rolling down from his forehead, Chen Lin replied while stuttering.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"That's enough, whatever." Jiang Chen waved his hand to dismiss the topic.</br>
</br>
Chen Lin finally felt relieved when he heard Jiang Chen say this. It was his petty idea to kill the elders and emperor. Only when the officials of Empire died could his importance stand out. His only worry was Jiang Chen would have an opinion with what he did, but now it looked like while the NAC General certainly saw through his wit, he didn't mind.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment and nonchalantly asked.</br>
</br>
"What's the population of the capital?"</br>
</br>
"Permanent population 43,510. Transient population roughly 3,000," Chen Lin immediately answered.</br>
</br>
"What's the financial surplus of last month?"</br>
</br>
"90,000 crystals."</br>
</br>
"You know the situation of Empire quite well. You didn't just guess that did you?" Jiang Chen glanced at him feeling surprised.</br>
</br>
Chen Lin grinned, he used a flattering voice to say, "How do I dare to trick you."</br>
</br>
"Perfect, looks like you're not useless." Jiang Chen nodded. "Then, are you interested working for me?"</br>
</br>
Chen Lin was ecstatic when he heard this. Without regard to what other people thought, he immediately kneeled down.</br>
</br>
"Don't be too happy yet." Jiang Chen didn't make him get up and instead, with a smile, he looked at him. "I know your little wit and stuff. You should know, if you use that wit where you shouldn't use it, what kind of consequences you will have."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately put his head on the ground to express his allegiance.</br>
</br>
"If I dare to have any other thoughts, I'm willing to die by being stabbed a thousand times!"</br>
</br>
"Remember what you said. Get up."</br>
</br>
"Thank you, General!"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
While the morality of Chen Lin was still to be determined, he had talent in management. Jiang Chen sent people to verify the residents and treasury, the data was no different than what he said.</br>
</br>
As long as he kept him on a leash, it was fine to use this kind of person.</br>
</br>
It was not selecting a role model.</br>
</br>
From the way of the square to the palace, Chen Lin fully developed his sucking up nature and followed behind Jiang Chen. But Jiang Chen was uninterested in his flattering words and suck up. He only briefly asked about the situation in Empire before getting this guy to shut up.</br>
</br>
With one foot stepping into the palace, the officials of Empire already packed the palace.</br>
</br>
</br>
Looking at the compliant officials, Jiang Chen furrowed his brows, titled his head, and asked Chen Lin, "How many people are officials in Empire?"</br>
</br>
"General… there are five ranks of officials with five divisions in each rank for a total of 527 officials."</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k! That many?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen estimated that around one out of one hundred people in the capital was an official, this didn't include the officials with less important roles.</br>
</br>
"The massive government system of Empire was something that gave the elders a headache for the longest time. But these people more or less were related to the elders. With such a small community, no one wanted to mention cutting people. Therefore, the officials of Empire increased more and more, a lot of times one thing was separated into five things for ten people to do…"</br>
</br>
"There are too many people, lay some off," Jiang Chen dismissed what he said and said in an annoyed tone.</br>
</br>
Different from Chen Lin's cautiousness, Jiang Chen didn't control his voice at all. Because of this, when the officials in the palace heard what he said, their expressions all froze with displeasure written all over their faces.</br>
</br>
Chen Lin had a bitter smile in his mind, but Jiang Chen didn't care about what they thought and stepped to the seat in the front of the palace.</br>
</br>
He sat on the dragon chair, getting a slight feeling of what it was like to be an emperor. Then he spoke to the officials.</br>
</br>
"Is there anyone displeased with me sitting here?"</br>
</br>
[No sh*t, who dares to say they are displeased?]</br>
</br>
The officials were all compliant with their head lowered not saying a word. However, they had the most vicious curses in their minds.</br>
</br>
"Great, looks like no one is displeased." Jiang Chen leaned into the chair and examined the officials with his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
The emperor of Empire did know how to enjoy.</br>
</br>
The Dragon Chair was much more comfortable than the wooden chair in his office. Above the officials, the taste of power was indeed intoxicating.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cleared his throat and said.</br>
</br>
"Chen Lin, give me the officials list."</br>
</br>
Chen Lin walked out and handed him a tablet courteously.</br>
</br>
While Empire lacked in technological development, it managed to achieve digital documentation. All the names and rankings of officials were recorded on the server in the palace responsible by people with management access. Typically, it was the emperor, but if the emperor died, it passed on to the elder.</br>
</br>
Since the emperor already died, Chen Lin was the only elder left, the management access for the server data naturally passed into Chen Lin's hand.</br>
</br>
Now that Jiang Chen wanted it, Chen Lin handed to him with both hands.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took over, saw that the list was already on the screen, and began to flip through them.</br>
</br>
"Yang Liang."</br>
</br>
"Here." An older looking official stepped out and bowed to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You're responsible for the gate tax right?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Yang Liang said compliantly.</br>
</br>
"There will be no more gate tax at Qingshan Arena, you can go home."</br>
</br>
With the sound of knees hitting the ground, the older Yang Liang kneeled on the ground with tears bursting out.</br>
</br>
"Em…Emperor…"</br>
</br>
Managing the gate tax was a lucrative duty; there were at least thousands of people that entered in and out of the gate and everyone who came in must pay. While two crystals were not a lot, it was at least two to three thousand crystals in the bag per day.</br>
</br>
No one would notice if he pocketed one hundred crystals.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's decision killed his money making method.</br>
</br>
"Don't call me Emperor, call me General." Jiang Chen said while annoyed. He was too lazy to listen to his complaint. He swiped his finger and called the next name.</br>
</br>
"Lu Guangyuan."</br>
</br>
"Here." Lu Guangyuan anxiously stepped out and gulped while waiting for Jiang Chen's decision.</br>
</br>
"Market Stimulation Department, what department is this?"</br>
</br>
"Stabilizing price, promote economic development, improve—"</br>
</br>
"Then what's the Pricing Council? Wang Qianping, why don't you explain it to me?"</br>
</br>
"Eh! Here, I'm here." Wang Qianping stepped out with cold sweat dripping down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyed him, signaling him to talk.</br>
</br>
"Stabilizing price, promote economic development, coordinate—"</br>
</br>
"What's the damn difference?" Jiang Chen was growing increasingly flustered.</br>
</br>
"Hmm… General, if you listen carefully, the last word is different…" Wang Qiangping's small eyes stared at the floor as he anxiously replied.</br>
</br>
Without wasting his word, Jiang Chen swiped two times on the screen.</br>
</br>
"The two departments are abolished. The tax rate will be determined by the new administrative department after accessing market supply and demand. You can go home now."</br>
</br>
With two sounds of kneecaps hitting the ground, Lu Guangyuan and Wang Qianping both dropped down with tearless grief.</br>
</br>
If the gate tax was a juicy piece of meat, the two departments were a giant pig with countless juicy meat. Now that they were being removed, how were they willing to just let it go!"</br>
</br>
"General, you, you can't just do that to us—"</br>
</br>
"No—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was getting goosebumps, the tablet in his hand almost dropped to the ground.</br>
</br>
[You guys are disgusting, people on the outside who don't know what's going on probably think I did something to them.]</br>
</br>
Holding onto the tablet, Jiang Chen gave the two people a hard stare before eyeing the kinetic skeleton soldiers beside him. "Take them out."</br>
</br>
With the officials anxiously watching, the three officials on the ground were forcibly dragged out by the soldiers.</br>
</br>
Displeased?</br>
</br>
Anyone will be displeased!</br>
</br>
The cake being taken away was pure robbery for these people.</br>
</br>
But with a black muzzle in front of their heads, no one dared to say no.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 645: Useless</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The officials below him were petrified, afraid Jiang Chen would call their name.</br>
</br>
But what must come will eventually come.</br>
</br>
After half an hour, more than half of the five hundred something officials were cut, only leaving a scattered one to two hundred people. The massive layoff was unseen of, even a public company in an economic recession didn't layoff more than 70% of its employees.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't care.</br>
</br>
He abolished all departments he thought were unnecessary. NAC had money, but no obligation to feed useless people.</br>
</br>
The people left behind all let out a breath of relief. A lot people didn't realize they were completely drenched in sweat.</br>
</br>
Departments with odd names were all cut, departments with repetitive functions were merged, and the remaining 117 officials were temporarily put on leave while they waited for NAC's Minister of Administration's arrangement.</br>
</br>
The name "capital" was removed and replaced by Qingshan Arena Survivor Camp, referred to as Qingshan Town. While a lot of officials didn't want to change the name, the survivors had no problem with it. From their conversations, no one thought of this place as the capital, instead they referred to it as "arena".</br>
</br>
Chen Lin assisted in the "accession to the throne" and was named superintendent of Qiangshan, responsible for its affairs and was supervised by NAC director.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen already decided on the director.</br>
</br>
The captain of the power armor airdrop platoon, Cai Xuan; he first pierced into the enemy zone of control during the attack on Guru Tribe, and assisted the infantries in breaking through the line of defense to achieve an outstanding accomplishment. After Jiang Chen asked for his personal opinion, he named him the director of Hucheng Survival Camp.</br>
</br>
It was not the most attractive option for an NAC upper class citizen and knight to work far away from Wanghai. Not only would the quality of life decrease by a wide margin, the administrative rank was also two levels lower compared to Chu Nan at the Sixth Street and Yu Lu of Camp 027.</br>
</br>
But after the completion of his term, once he requested for return to Wanghai, the director of a colony on his resume would indeed help him go further in his career.</br>
</br>
The surrendered Empire's Third Division was renamed to Militia Division with the size shrinking from five thousand to three thousand.</br>
</br>
The homemade rifles were all thrown into the warehouse and replaced with the Reaper Assault Rifle produced in the Sixth Street. The leather and steel boards sealed together were thrown out and changed into carbon Nano bulletproof vest produced by the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
Other than that, one hundred trainers from Wanghai were incorporated into the division to strengthen NAC's control of the militia while at the same time increase the competency level of the force.</br>
</br>
After a series of adjustments, the lousy force instantly gained some traces of an "elite force". The primary responsibilities of the militia were to maintain the security of the location, maintain NAC's defense in Hucheng controlled area, and become a reserved force of NAC's three major divisions.</br>
</br>
</br>
The previous division commander Wei Biao maintained his position, while only the division was changed from an army to a militia.</br>
</br>
Chen Wei was shocked to discover Jiang Chen preserved his position.</br>
</br>
He previous thought his fate was at most to be given a severance package and take a few of his confidants back home to farm. But Jiang Chen allowed him to keep his position and increased his salary by two folds. While there were NAC officials mixed into the division now, it was reasonable since absolute trust was nonexistent.</br>
</br>
Other than loyalty, he didn't say much more.</br>
</br>
The reason for preserving Wei Biao's position was because of a deeper level of consideration from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
One was to set an example for the three commanders outside of Qingshan Arena, one was because he viewed highly of Wei Biao's ability.</br>
</br>
Former PAC land force soldier. While the title was not as convincing as "brigade commander" Han Junhua, he at least received military training from before the war. Compared with the "former civilian" survivors, his combat ability and strategic awareness was far stronger.</br>
</br>
The commander of the division was only training. If he proved his ability, he will be promoted in a matter of time.</br>
</br>
As to loyalty.</br>
</br>
Other than the balance of power, slavery chips exists in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After slicing the cake of the old regime into pieces, Jiang Chen threw the tablet back to Jiang Lin before he strolled out of the palace while the officials looked as if the plaque had gone away.</br>
</br>
The political change in the arena didn't cause any influence on the people.</br>
</br>
When they were sure NAC would not take away their crystals, the merchants and mercenaries there continued on.</br>
</br>
The only change was that no more green skinned figures were seen on the street.</br>
</br>
The violent maniacs were wiped out by soldiers with kinetic skeletons when NAC first occupied the arena. They were killed on the street, drowned in the toilet. The difference between mutated humans and humans was great. NAC soldiers' shooting skill was also superb, there could be no error.</br>
</br>
The bloody genocide caused resistance from the mutated humans which caused innocent civilians to be hurt.</br>
</br>
A lot of civilians, mercenaries, hunters with weapons all joined the mission to wipe out the mutated humans; quite a few of them were oppressed. However, because of the protection policy under Empire, they had to swallow their rage.</br>
</br>
The moment Empire collapsed, NAC announced that mutated humans were the same as mutants, they started their vengeance.</br>
</br>
Sacrifices did occur, but people expressed their full support.</br>
</br>
Perhaps people in modern world would be compassionate to the mutated human that suffered a tragic fate, but these people would never exist in the apocalypse unless they were the "blue skin" that just walked out of a fallout shelter and yet to experience the world.</br>
</br>
After taking care of the affairs in the palace, Jiang Chen took Sun Xiaorou waiting at the gate to visit the clinic in the ghetto Zhao Baodong mentioned.</br>
</br>
There was no one in the waiting room. It looked like the shadow of Order affected the clinic's business.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen got a number from the metallic ball robot at the door. He only waited for two minutes before he walked into the room with Sun Xiaorou and saw the fabled Doctor Sun.</br>
</br>
With a buzz cut, he looked clean with twenty years of age; he didn't look like he spent twenty years in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun put down the notebook in his hand and gazed at the two at the door.</br>
</br>
"Are you here for a diagnosis?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and gently said.</br>
</br>
"For the secret of immortality."</br>
</br>
"You are Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun nodded, without saying anything, he moved his sight to Sun Xiaorou who was leaning by the door with a hint of reminiscence on his face.</br>
</br>
"How many years has it been? You've grown so much!"</br>
</br>
"You know me?" Sun Xiaorou tilted her head and looked back at him with confusion.</br>
</br>
"When you were this big, I hugged you before." Doctor Sun smiled. He used his hands to measure a size of a baby, "If I remember correct, your name should be… Sun Jiao?"</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"That's my sister." Sun Xiaorou shook her head with a smile. "Although we do look alike."</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun paused for a second before a smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Oh? I do apologize."</br>
</br>
"It's okay." Sun Xiaorou shook her head. Her eyebrows had a hint of reminiscence present. "People often mixed up the two of us when we were young, even when we're not twins."</br>
</br>
"Let me introduce myself. I'm Sun Boyi." Doctor Sun extended his right hand to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his hand, looked at him and also briefly reintroduced himself.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, the NAC General."</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun gave Jiang Chen a friendly smile before he continued.</br>
</br>
"Because we share the same last name, my memory of that little girl is quite vivid. Since her younger sister is here, you should know her sister, right."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
She was the first person he met in this world.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou put a finger on her chin and asked the question troubling her mind." But… even if you saw my sister, she was just a baby. You shouldn't have seen her as an adult right? So how could you have mistaken me for my sister?"</br>
</br>
Doctor Sun smiled. "There was a flood of babies in the fallout shelter. Due to the lack of doctors, I was the doctor who completed the procedure. With the help of DNA replication technology, before you were all born, we already knew what you would look like in the future. But unfortunately, I didn't get to see you grow up."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou nodded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a diary from his pocket and placed it on the table. "Did you place the diary on the table of the director's office?"</br>
</br>
"The diary was there from the beginning. I just moved his body back where he was supposed to be."</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi must've been referring to the deceased fallout shelter director.</br>
</br>
"There are a few pages ripped out from the diary."</br>
</br>
"Pages from the diary were already ripped out from the beginning by its owner… Of course, I think you wouldn't be too interested in Fallout Shelter 071's past."</br>
</br>
"On the contrary," Jiang Chen shook his head, "If it's convenient for you, I hope you can tell me what happened afterward. Including the history of Fallout Shelter 071, as well as the observer… the experiments you conducted."</br>
</br>
"The observer? You know this word..." Melancholy surfaced on Sun Baoyi's face. "Even I almost forgot."</br>
</br>
He paused, looked at Jiang Chen, and invited him to sit down.</br>
</br>
"Feel free to sit. This story is quite long."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When I woke up from the hibernation chamber, it was already the tenth year.</br>
</br>
Eight years prior, the director ordered security to attack my lab and made all my efforts go down the drain. He also stole the Golden Apple. He didn't kill me, but instead, he said, "Once the fallout shelter opens, people will punish you for your crimes." He shut me into the hibernation chamber.</br>
</br>
</br>
His arrogance made me uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
It wasn't because the punishment would never arrive, but it was because of the unrealistic fantasy he had of the outside world.</br>
</br>
With this fantasy, his naivety would inevitably kill everyone in the fallout shelter, much more than the people I killed.</br>
</br>
And it would be for an extremely boring reason…</br>
</br>
I sat in the chair trembling while blankly staring at the propaganda poster in the fallout shelter. I tried to empty my mind in order to get accustomed to the unnatural time difference.</br>
</br>
Eight years. It was just like a dream.</br>
</br>
My eyes closed, eyes opened, and everything outside the glass window was covered in thick dust. Time muddied everything, but it didn't muddy me in the mirror.</br>
</br>
The Golden Apple was destroyed; the arrogant Mr. Director destroyed it after he pressed the button to start the hibernation chamber.</br>
</br>
Regardless, my mission ended.</br>
</br>
When I stepped over the security line, just like I expected, everything here was abandoned.</br>
</br>
When I stepped through the metal door, just like I expected, everything outside was destroyed in the nuclear war.</br>
</br>
The ending could've been foreseen, but most people always maintained an unrealistic fantasy before finally drowning in their dreams.</br>
</br>
Someone said a long time ago that only two nuclear bombs were needed to destroy the world - the first being fear, and the second being vengeance.</br>
</br>
I don't remember his name anymore, but I'm certain about one thing. He was elevated from a sociologist to a prophet.</br>
</br>
There were a few metal shacks on the surface. I remember those things - they were strategic reserves in the fallout shelter. The PAC flag burnt to dust fitted satirically well with the propaganda posters on the train.</br>
</br>
Once the door opened, the survivors would have to rely on those tools to rebuild their home in the ruins.</br>
</br>
But from the bones and bullet marks, I already guessed their fate.</br>
</br>
How could trained forces lose to refugees with primitive weapons?</br>
</br>
My guess was that they didn't die because of the force's shooting skills; it must've been due to comical humanitarianism as well as courtesies extended by the civilized.</br>
</br>
I dug through the shelves in the ruins to search for anything useful.</br>
</br>
A pistol, a picture belonging to god knows who, and a diary with many pages ripped out - they were all the supplies I could gather.</br>
</br>
I considered going back to sleep.</br>
</br>
Ten years was too short. If I "time traveled" to 1000 years later, the situation would probably be much better.</br>
</br>
Whether it was just a barren field outside or a city built by the new humans.</br>
</br>
If it was the former, I could use the human clone technology in the other fallout shelters to restart the PAC civilization. If it was the latter, museums created by new humans could provide with a well-paying job to teach elementary students participating in social awareness activities about how the people before the war lived, how they tarnished themselves…</br>
</br>
Regardless of the choice I made, there were urgent matters I had to take care of first.</br>
</br>
There was no power and no food; I had to find useful things among the ruins.</br>
</br>
I had to at least gather enough nuclear fusion cores needed for the hibernation chamber and a few nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
Before I searched for other survivors, I had to replace the blue skin I was wearing.</br>
</br>
If all the newbies who just left their nest wore similar clothes, I had enough reason to believe this blue skin would bring me trouble.</br>
</br>
Just like how a civilization naturally attracted barbarians.</br>
</br>
It took me quite a while to find well-fitting clothes. Finally, I chose a suit whose color was fading and wore a bulletproof vest inside.</br>
</br>
Along the highway, I walked all the way into the city.</br>
</br>
Zombies, mutants, raiders, mutated humans… and cannibals.</br>
</br>
There was danger everywhere, but I only had 14 bullets – 2 clips.</br>
</br>
Hospitals, schools, automated factories… all these places could have nuclear fusion cores, but they had all been rummaged by scavengers. There were survivor gathering spots where human activity could be seen, but out of safety considerations, I didn't dare to approach them.</br>
</br>
Since this was the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Later on, I incidentally saved a merchant from zombies and used the crystals I had to trade for some useful items.</br>
</br>
He took me to Zhonghe City and told me that as long as I had crystals, I could buy anything there, whether it was men or women.</br>
</br>
If it didn't exist on the market, I could just go to the bar.</br>
</br>
After reaching out to survivors, my life became a lot easier. When I knew they lacked doctors here, I opened a clinic to treat patients in exchange for crystals. Then with those crystals, I placed orders for nuclear fusion cores at the bar.</br>
</br>
A lot of things happened in that year, but I managed to collect ten nuclear fusion cores.</br>
</br>
The nuclear fusion core batteries were highly efficient. If they were just used to maintain the hibernation chamber, one would be enough to last me 100 years of sleep.</br>
</br>
I closed the clinic and refused the president's, parliament members', and friends' invitations to stay. I returned to Fallout Shelter 071.</br>
</br>
But the second before I laid in the hibernation chamber, I hesitated.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 647: The Secret to Immortaility</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Why?" When Jiang Chen heard that, he was eager to know.</br>
</br>
"It's the nature of humans as creatures - the more interaction they have with other humans, the harder it is to accept loneliness." Sun Baoyi sighed. "No matter how you decipher human nature, no matter how indifferent you are… it's not something you, as a twenty-year-old, can understand."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him with questions still in his eyes while Jiang Chen waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"In the story, I mentioned that I saved a merchant."</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"We later became friends, and he invested in this clinic." Sun Baoyi paused for a moment and let out a sigh. "Not only him, but also the crippled hunter, the merchant from the Northern Alliance Area, the female gunslinger from the Black Street Bar… I remember their names, even if some of them may have already died or left for places afar. Regardless, my memories are still there. The more people you know, the more you can't let them go. I admit everything is terrible, but it's not despairing to the point where you don't have the will to live."</br>
</br>
"Is that just because of the relationships you have?"</br>
</br>
"Don't describe it so simply." Sun Baoyi shrugged. "If you had to lay in the hibernation chamber for 1000 years, would you be willing to let everything go here and head for a different future alone?"</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about Sun Jiao, Yao Yao, and the people loyal to him, he shook his head.</br>
</br>
"I kind of understand now."</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi nodded.</br>
</br>
"Although I decided to stay in this era, I didn't immediately leave the fallout shelter. Instead, I used the only quantum computer left and restarted the experiment again."</br>
</br>
"What about the samples? Since your experiment, the samples… those people were all killed. "</br>
</br>
"I'm the sample." Sun Baoyi looked at Jiang Chen, took out a small bottle from his pocket, and placed it on the table. "This is the secret to immortality."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes locked onto the thumb-sized bottle.</br>
</br>
A crimson liquid was inside.</br>
</br>
"This is…?"</br>
</br>
"You've heard about hidden genetic codes before, right?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"This is a hidden DNA code expressed in a special manner after the injection of a genetic vaccine. A lot of mercenaries and soldiers take it to increase their combat abilities. Take a guess - if you unlock it to the third level, the last level, what would happen?"</br>
</br>
Without giving Jiang Chen time to think, he tapped the small bottle with his finger gently.</br>
</br>
"You will become a God."</br>
</br>
Because of his stern expression, Jiang Chen held his breath before letting the words out difficulty.</br>
</br>
"That is… absurd."</br>
</br>
But then, Jiang Chen suddenly recalled the man who referred to himself as God.</br>
</br>
"If you think that's absurd, it depends on your definition of God," Sun Baoyi said emotionlessly. "Although it's comical to define God through science, we still gave God a crude meaning. A being who can do things humans can't do is hence referred to as 'God'."</br>
</br>
</br>
"For example, the leader of the Dusk Church could use spiritual energy to explode a hundred blood crystals to trigger an explosion that could wipe out an entire province from the map. Absorbing energy from crystals is as easy as drinking water…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked Sun Xiaorou before - with her second level genetic code ability, she couldn't even explode one blood crystal, let alone hundreds of them.</br>
</br>
Of course, the definition of God wasn't only limited to destructive power.</br>
</br>
"So you mean…" Jiang Chen looked into Doctor Sun's eyes. He had an idea of what Doctor Sun meant.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you guessed it. Yes, we researched the 'side effects' of genetic vaccines before the war. Based on the genetic map, we concluded that once the genetic code 'resilience' evolved to level three, the 'immortality' ability could be unlocked."</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi paused briefly, then continued.</br>
</br>
"With current technological capabilities, the abilities in the genetic code can be transplanted. The only material required is 100mg of serum."</br>
</br>
From one perspective, immortality was something only reachable by a God. But more surprisingly, this ability only reachable by a God could be transplanted surgically.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the bottle on the table and fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the girl mentioned in the diary should be Sun Jiao - she should've been just half a year old. And the other "samples" in Fallout Shelter 071 should be normal people with the genetic code "resilience."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had an idea of the kind of experiment Doctor Sun performed that caused all the samples to die.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao told him before.</br>
</br>
In order to increase the effect of the genetic vaccine and unlock the next level of genetic code, aside from going through high-intensity training, the fastest and least technical way would be to "seek your own death."</br>
</br>
It was only when you teetered between the edge of life and death that the hidden genetic code could be exposed.</br>
</br>
The simplest way would be to throw the group of people into an "arena" to fight, and the people who survived to the end would have the highest probability of reaching the "God" boundary.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought this through, the benevolent smile on Doctor Sun's face gave him a petrifying chill.</br>
</br>
To be able to perform the experiment on the people he lived with, this guy isn't human at all…</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi read the repulsion in Jiang Chen's eyes and he had a smug expression. "It's an inhumane experiment, right?"</br>
</br>
"Is it not?"</br>
</br>
"I'm delighted you think this way. If people who shouldn't control the secret to immortality got control of the secret, that would be a disaster to civilization."</br>
</br>
"Is that really what you think?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
From his own memoirs and the diary of the director, if the alignment chart (1) was used to describe his personality, Jiang Chen could absolutely define him as an "absolute neutral." He discarded all the weaknesses in human nature and viewed selfishness and apathy as natural; his contribution was just not proactively being evil…</br>
</br>
But his reaction after he left the fallout shelter the second time was completely different.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought he belonged to "neutral order" now.</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi didn't directly answer Jiang Chen. Instead, he said gently, "Human nature is a burden to survival, but without this burden, the seed of civilization will not germinate."</br>
</br>
"I feel like I've heard this before."</br>
</br>
"I guess he's another observer." Sun Baoyi laughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and brought the topic back to the genetic code.</br>
</br>
"Did you unlock the third level?"</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi shook his head.</br>
</br>
"How's that possible?"</br>
</br>
"Then how did you not age at all in the past ten years?" Jiang Chen was confused.</br>
</br>
"Did you remember the explanation for 'resilience' in the EP?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried to recollect his memory of when they returned from the sewers and Sun Jiao explained Jiang Chen's abilities.</br>
</br>
"Expending life in exchange for healing non-critical wounds in a short period of time?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Sun Baoyi nodded, pleased. " When evolved to the second level, new abilities will be unlocked."</br>
</br>
"Revival?"</br>
</br>
"That's not the right word." Sun Baoyi waved his finger in disagreement. "Aside from fixing damaged organs, the ability also fixes DNA telomeres. From a macro perspective, it greatly increases your vitality."</br>
</br>
"Therefore…"</br>
</br>
"That's right - I'm only at the second level. But even with just level two unlocked, I gained around five hundred years in life… as long as I don't repetitively use 'resilience' and 'revive'." Sun Baoyi shrugged. "With the second level, all I can give you is the key. As long as you transplant 'resilience' into your body, you'll have a chance of gaining immortality."</br>
</br>
"A chance?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Sun Baoyi nodded. "You can only gain the 'key' from another person. As for how many doors you can open, that's up to yourself."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
From her expression, he received an affirmative reply.</br>
</br>
After he hesitated for a moment, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"If the genetic code is changed to 'resilience,' what would happen to the previous ability?"</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was unwilling to give up "fury" and "invictus," two combat abilities that almost allowed him to cheat.</br>
</br>
Sun Baoyi woke him up from his greedy fantasy with laughter.</br>
</br>
"Since it replaces, the previous ability will disappear."</br>
</br>
"I finally unlocked level two." Jiang Chen's smile was mixed with bitterness.</br>
</br>
"I found a shortcut to unlock the second level for 'resilience' - you don't have to worry about that."</br>
</br>
"Is that so…"</br>
</br>
"If you want to replace the genetic code in your body, I can do the operation for you." Sun Baoyi pushed the bottle beside Jiang Chen gently. "Of course, if you don't trust me, you can take the technology and perform the operation with other doctors."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen played with the serum in his hand and abruptly asked, "Can I ask a final question? If I evolve 'fury' to the third level, what ability would I obtain?"</br>
</br>
"Fury… the frequency of this genetic code is high, but people rarely evolve it to the second level, let alone the third level. I see that you must've evolved it to the second level?" Sun Baoyi was quite intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Because there's no precedent, I can't predict what ability you will have… but I'm certain it must be an ability that approaches the territory of 'God'," Sun Baoyi said with certainty.</br>
</br>
[Should I change my ability?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the 100mg of serum and fell into silence.</br>
</br>
(1) Alignment chart - The meme that include choatic evil, absolute neutral, ... and seven other states.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 648: Not Knowing One“s Own Strength</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the bottle of serum and information related to the surgery, Jiang Chen left the clinic.</br>
</br>
Based on what Doctor Sun said, the surgery could be done before fifty years of age. Through a special method, it would only require one to two years to evolve "resilience" into "revive."</br>
</br>
He is only twenty-something, so there is no need to make a rash decision.</br>
</br>
"Do we not need to control Doctor Sun?" When leaving the ghetto, Sun Xiaorou turned her head and asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Get someone to keep an eye on him. It doesn't seem necessary to control him," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
At the end of their conversation, Jiang Chen invited him to the Fishbone Base to serve as a doctor, but he rejected the offer. He wanted to continue staying there, living on the wasteland under the identity of Doctor Sun and treating the unfortunate.</br>
</br>
But at the same time, he expressed that once everyone around him turned old and the children turned into adults, he would consider closing the clinic and quietly leaving the place. By that time, he would consider entering the hibernation chamber to wait for a distant future…</br>
</br>
When they passed an alley, the two walked toward the exit of the ghetto.</br>
</br>
But just then, a few figures walked out from the dark and surrounded them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and looked at the group of people blocking them, intrigued.</br>
</br>
They were holding guns, knives and even sticks. He could clearly sense the unfriendliness in their eyes.</br>
</br>
[There are actually people unafraid of death?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes and said pleasantly, "You are?"</br>
</br>
The man leading the group with a bald head didn't respond. A teen with a rifle walked up two steps and thuggishly said, "Buddy, you ruined the jobs of many after you came to Capital. You think you're tough?"</br>
</br>
[Ruined the jobs?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly understood what this was about. He said while pondering, "So, an official who was cut sent you guys here?"</br>
</br>
Another thug with a scimitar tilted his head to crack his joints. He looked at Jiang Chen with vicious mockery. "You certainly are brave to come here without a guard, and you brought a girl along too. Don't you know this is the ghetto?"</br>
</br>
"Of course I know this is the ghetto, but… did I need to bring guards?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The thugs all stared at him as if he was dumb. They looked at each other before they started to chuckle.</br>
</br>
"Enough, no more bullsh*t. Someone bought your life, sorry. Haha, we'll take care of the little hottie beside you." The bald-headed man laughed menacingly. His small eyes squinted into a line and he wantonly checked Sun Xiaorou out.</br>
</br>
"I'm not little at all, although I'm a bit smaller than sister." Sun Xiaorou blinked at Jiang Chen without any sense of urgency before she turned around to grin at the bald-headed man who just disrespected her. Her voice gradually turned cold as she said, "Considering what you just said, that's enough for you to die twice."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ha, with just you?" The teen sneered, lowered the rifle on his shoulder, and pointed at Sun Xiaorou while he arrogantly said, "I want to see you—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to watch their hideous gestures, so a cold voice came out of his lips.</br>
</br>
"Fire."</br>
</br>
Bang—</br>
</br>
A gust of wind sent dust high up into the air.</br>
</br>
Once the dust settled down, only the bullet marks on the ground and the hint of blood in the air proved the thugs had been there.</br>
</br>
As the general, Jiang Chen obviously wouldn't have walked into dangerous territory without protection. Under the airship's watch, he didn't think they would be in danger there.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around to look at the peasants trembling in darkness and met their fearful gazes.</br>
</br>
They probably knew the thugs had been hiding there already. No one had told the two of them, but the peasants just remained in the dark.</br>
</br>
It didn't take too much thinking to know they want to scavenge the bodies.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly thought the frail and dark faces looked like crows watching atop tree branches.</br>
</br>
"Just leave these things for me to deal with. Now there's blood splattered all over my dress." Sun Xiaorou, who had dust on her face, turned around, picked up her dress hem stained with blood and rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen, displeased.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I'll change for you when we get back," Jiang Chen whispered into her ear with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Xiaorou's face quickly turned red.</br>
</br>
"Screw you."</br>
</br>
The two disappeared in the alley.</br>
</br>
Like crows that sensed carrion, the people hidden in the darkness swarmed the lumps of bullet holes mixed with chunks of flesh and began searching for anything valuable.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When they returned to the airship, Jiang Chen took Sun Xiaorou to change into a clean set of clothes. Then he called upon Cai Xuan, who was acting as the director. He ordered all officials who had been dimissed to be imprisoned and investigated. If they had any connections related to the attack in the alley, they were to be executed.</br>
</br>
After taking care of that matter, Jiang Chen headed to the command room of the airship and discussed next steps with Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"…First Division surrendered to Federation, and the soldiers of Federation already crossed the Gang River bridge and are building defense bunkers now. From the images collected by drones, they're equipped with anti-air cannons and missiles as well as heavy artillery support. Just like that, they're focusing on establishing an elite force."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about the other divisions of Empire?"</br>
</br>
"Second Division ceased its attacks on Donggang Plantation and fled north with signs indicating they're moving to Wu City. Fourth Division stopped its suppression of the insurgents and is in the process of negotiations for surrender."</br>
</br>
"What do they want?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Division commander Li Haicheng agreed to surrender to us, but he hopes he can continue to act as the commander."</br>
</br>
"Accept his terms." With a brief pause, he continued, "Once he surrenders, reduce the size of the force by half, retrain the force, establish the Second Militia, and make them responsible for the defense of Golden River Farm."</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
Right now, deputy captain Wang Zhaowu walked into the command room and made a report to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Federation sent an ambassador with the hopes of discussing the distribution of Hucheng."</br>
</br>
The ambassador from Federation?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about Federation taking advantage of the situation, a mysterious smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Make them wait in the conference room beside the palace. I'll personally go to see them."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Wang Zhaowu saluted.</br>
</br>
"Right, move the airship to Golden River Farm. It's unsafe to be so close to Federation's air defense power, and it's also not necessary either," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Order's long-range fire coverage could easily cover the entire Hucheng territory, even areas hundreds of kilometers away. If they weren't showing off their power, there was no need to be so close.</br>
</br>
When he left the room, he called Ji Yucheng, who was currently resting at Golden River Farm, and gave him some orders.</br>
</br>
"Come to the arena."</br>
</br>
"Now?" Ji Yucheng was shocked.</br>
</br>
"No sh*t."</br>
</br>
"Could I ask what it's about?" Yucheng whispered.</br>
</br>
"Good things," Jiang Chen answered with irritation "If you want to become the president of Federation, then stop wasting my time and come. I'll arrange people to pick you up, so wait at the gate of the farm."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes!"</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng was ecstatic. He immediately darted out the door.</br>
</br>
As a parliament member, it would be his dream come true if he sat on the throne of the president.</br>
</br>
Especially for a parliament member in "exile," the temptation to return to the seat of power was great.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 649: Federation“s Ambassador</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Your party's firepower left a deep impression on us. Since the despicable Empire and mutated humans are eliminated, why don't we redefine the boundaries, each take a step back, and remain at peace?"</br>
</br>
In the conference room beside the palace, Jiang Chen met the ambassador from Federation.</br>
</br>
"So your proposal is?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"With Gan River as the boundary, the territory west of Gan River will belong to Federation and the territory east of Gan River will belong to NAC. The borders will be open with an open trade policy in effect and no customs set in place?" the ambassador proposed with a smile.</br>
</br>
Their terms made Jiang Chen extremely surprised.</br>
</br>
He previously assumed they would have to engage in intense debate on the negotiation table or be involved in an intense standoff that could even escalate into military conflict, but negotiations went surprisingly smooth. Federation, who already crossed the Gan River, took a step back and was willing to retreat?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's finger tapped the armrest of the chair while he contemplated the real intentions of Federation.</br>
</br>
But regardless of what they thought, the terms brought by the ambassador gave him no reason to reject them.</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, he casually said.</br>
</br>
"Looks like we've reached an agreement."</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on the ambassador's face. He took half a step back and bowed courteously to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"It's a pleasure to be able to reach an agreement with your party, honorable Mr. General."</br>
</br>
Since they reached an agreement, the two parties signed the agreement that symbolized their friendship.</br>
</br>
Without staying for much longer, the ambassador took the copy that belonged to them and departed.</br>
</br>
Once the ambassador left, Jiang Chen looked to Han Junhua, who was standing by the side silently.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"If NAC needs a market and supply base, Federation's proposal satisfies our needs," Han Junhua replied.</br>
</br>
"I share the same perspective as you, although I don't think it's as simple as it looks." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long before Ji Yucheng finally reached the arena. But before he stepped into the conference room, the ambassador already left.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a helpless expression, looking at Ji Yucheng, who was gasping for air.</br>
</br>
"You're late. The Federation ambassador already left."</br>
</br>
"Th-that quickly? You reached an agreement?" Ji Yucheng stood up with his back straight and asked Jiang Chen in shock.</br>
</br>
"Of course. We agreed to set Gan River as the boundary with free trade established… This is the exact agreement." Jiang Chen nonchalantly tossed the agreement they just signed into Ji Yucheng's hands. "Unfortunately, you can't be the president. How about being a diplomat?"</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng scanned through the agreement before putting it down.</br>
</br>
"This is a trap."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen curiously examined Ji Yucheng.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Although Federation's forces have outstanding abilities, the strongest part of Federation isn't its soldiers."</br>
</br>
"What is it then?"</br>
</br>
"It's the merchants," Ji Yucheng replied.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng looked at Jiang Chen, puzzled, not understanding why he found it funny. Empire was afraid of Federation's merchants and hence established many rules and boundaries within its market. They increased tariffs and established protection policies to support the economy on the brink of collapse.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you have hopes to become the president." Jiang Chen didn't bother explaining to Ji Yucheng. He just stood and laughed as he patted Ji Yucheng on the shoulder. "But I want you to first return to Federation. Only then can you participate in the election."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng shook his head and gave Jiang Chen a pleading look. "No! I don't want to go back! They'll kill me… The president won't spare me with his forces behind him!"</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, you won't die." Jiang Chen comforted him. "You're returning as a NAC diplomat; they won't dare to kill you. Also, you've been out here for too long. It won't make sense to kill you to protect the password anymore."</br>
</br>
As long as the president of Federation wasn't blind, he would see that Fallout Shelter 071 is now under the control of NAC.</br>
</br>
"But…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dismissed his comment with irritation. "No buts. If you want to become the president, listen to me or else I'll choose someone else—"</br>
</br>
"What!" Ji Yucheng immediately stopped blabbering.</br>
</br>
[You certainly recognize the situation.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at the guy, paused, then continued.</br>
</br>
"Once you return to Federation, just do your job as a diplomat. You don't have to do anything. Just wait for my orders."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng nodded and carefully remembered Jiang Chen's words of caution.</br>
</br>
"Also, keep an eye out for me on one thing."</br>
</br>
"What thing?"</br>
</br>
"That letter - who sent it to you?" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng, with a troubled smile, said, "Didn't I say? It was Doctor Sun—"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"He didn't send it, although it was sent under his name."</br>
</br>
"I swear I didn't lie to you. It's Doctor Sun's handwriting. I delegated people to verify his writing before…" Ji Yucheng assumed Jiang Chen suspected he was lying.</br>
</br>
"I know you're not lying to me, but you've been lied to," Jiang Chen said. "The name on the letter may not represent the person who actually sent the letter. He has a clinic and signs how many forms a day? It's not hard to forge his writing."</br>
</br>
"How do you know he didn't write the letter?" Ji Yucheng rebutted.</br>
</br>
"Because I met him and I confirmed that he didn't have the intention of doing that," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll keep an eye out." Ji Yucheng nodded.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After sending Ji Yucheng off, Jiang Chen left the affairs of Qingshan Town to Superintendent Chen Ling and exchanged a few words with the newly-appointed Director Cai Xuan, then he boarded Order to return to Golden River Farm.</br>
</br>
Inside the farm were already a few tractors plowing the land. Bundles of Carm saplings were stacked on the side with a few new farmers cooling off on the side.</br>
</br>
The merchants of Sixth Street not only brought capital; they also brought advanced technology.</br>
</br>
Disregarding everything else, the farm tractors plowing the farm were the products of Sixth Street factories.</br>
</br>
In the near future, NAC technicians would build a communication base station. Once established, Hucheng would be included in the credit EP payment system. At the same time, data exchange between Wanghai could be accomplished through the network.</br>
</br>
After he arrived at the command post, Jiang Chen found his private force captain, Captain Li Wang, and inquired about the mission he delegated to him.</br>
</br>
"Did you find the quantum computer research institute?"</br>
</br>
"We already confirmed a few suspected targets and I sent the brothers of the private force to search for them. I'll have an accurate reply in three days at the most."</br>
</br>
"Excellent. I'm glad I entrusted this task to you."</br>
</br>
"It's my pleasure to share the General's burden." Li Wang saluted him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, pleased.</br>
</br>
"I have another thing I want you to do."</br>
</br>
"What is it?"</br>
</br>
"Head to the Donggang Plantation for me and convince the survivors there to join us."</br>
</br>
"Roger that." Li Wang headed out.</br>
</br>
"Wait." Jiang Chen suddenly stopped him.</br>
</br>
He stopped and turned around.</br>
</br>
"Anything else I can do?"</br>
</br>
"You've been with me for a while, and I'm pleased with your loyalty. But regarding your abilities, I still need to test you. I won't give you any hints in this mission and I don't have any expectations regarding which method you use to convince them. Your actions and the final result will be used as part of the assessment. If you pass the test, you'll become the captain of Order."</br>
</br>
Li Wang's heart trembled uncontrollably as he looked at Jiang Chen with great emotion.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath, calmed the excitement in his mind, and eventually said:</br>
</br>
"I definitely won't disappoint you, General!"</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 650: Donggang Plantation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Donggang Plantation.</br>
</br>
The scars of battle were beginning to fade. The survivors dug out the bodies of their comrades and buried them on the small hill north of the plantation. On the street outside the barbed wire, zombies tumbled along and wandered around mindlessly.</br>
</br>
In the days of continuous fire, Empire's sieging forces destroyed their walls multiple times and cut through the barbed wires to lure zombies into the plantation. The battle devolved into chaos between humans and zombies.</br>
</br>
In the chaos, over one thousand slaves died.</br>
</br>
With such a limited amount of ammunition, their ability to limit their casualties to around one thousand against an actual force showed that the slaves were certainly a force to be reckoned with.</br>
</br>
Of course, NAC's airstrike also was part of the reason.</br>
</br>
Out of fear for an airstrike from NAC, Empire's Second Division didn't focus all their efforts on launching a full-scale attack. Out of fear for NAC's forces, Empire's Second Division chose to retreat north for independence. It was only then that the siege of Donggang Plantation finally ended.</br>
</br>
Since they didn't know where to go, one thousand survivors chose to leave while the remaining seven thousand survivors gathered together. They elected a leader who led them to rebuild their home on this piece of land.</br>
</br>
One morning.</br>
</br>
An SUV darted into the street and sent a few dumb zombies flying before it came to an abrupt stop in front of the plantation.</br>
</br>
Two machine guns on the wall immediately pointed in this direction. Survivors with scarves and rifles walked up to knock on the car window.</br>
</br>
"This place isn't open to the public. Please leave."</br>
</br>
Li Wang glanced at the muzzles on the wall, took a deep breath, tapped on the door to lower the window.</br>
</br>
"I don't have bad intentions. I represent NAC and I want to see your leader."</br>
</br>
Li Wang thought these people would courteously invite him in, but the survivor's expression made a 180-degree shift as he examined Li Wang with caution.</br>
</br>
The stark difference completely caught him off guard.</br>
</br>
The soldier at the gate pressed on his collar, walked to the side, and spoke with his superior before he quickly returned to the car window.</br>
</br>
"We can take you to see our leader, but we have to search you."</br>
</br>
Li Wang's eyebrows raised and he was about to go off, but when he thought about Jiang Chen's test for him, he breathed in and suppressed the anger in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
He pushed open the door, walked out, and opened his hands.</br>
</br>
"I swear I don't have any weapons on me."</br>
</br>
The soldier ignored him and briefly scanned his body. After confirming there were no weapons, he took Li Wang into the plantation.</br>
</br>
After walking on a muddy road, they arrived in front of a three-story office building.</br>
</br>
Li Wang saw the leader of the survivors when he stepped in.</br>
</br>
</br>
His knife-sharp eyes could pierce people's minds and his defined face was tattooed with the slave mark, but from his straight back, Li Wang didn't see the meekness typical of a slave.</br>
</br>
[This isn't an easy character.]</br>
</br>
That was Li Wang's first thought.</br>
</br>
When the uprising erupted, the spies behind the conflict retreated from the plantation amidst the chaos. No one could provide him with assistance, and the only information he had was from one week ago.</br>
</br>
"Aha, let me see who came. The ambassador of NAC? You finally remembered your neighbor." The leader walked up to Li Wang. With his eyes narrowed, he aggressively stared Li Wang down. "Tell me your intentions."</br>
</br>
Li Wang didn't dodge his stare. He paused for a moment before he calmly said, "Are we not allies?"</br>
</br>
"You used us to keep Empire Second Division here and used our blood to pave your victory - would you refer to this as an alliance?" The leader started laughing hysterically and he shrugged. "What's next? After you take over the capital, do you plan on taking over the slaves in the capital?"</br>
</br>
"You're mistaken."</br>
</br>
"Let me tell you, we won't accept any enslavement from anyone, even if you're powerful enough." The leader lowered his voice. His scratchy voice rang beside Li Wang's ears as the words came out one by one.</br>
</br>
The pitiful people who just escaped from the shackles of enslavement were more sensitive and more conceited than anyone. While they only had poorly made rifles and a limited amount of ammo, they still believed they could use their faith to defend their freedom.</br>
</br>
They were sensitive and suspicious of any form of control.</br>
</br>
They wouldn't listen to anything right now.</br>
</br>
[The missiles of Order should wake these people up…] That was Li Wang's only thought.</br>
</br>
"We won't do that." Li Wang used his most reasonable voice.</br>
</br>
"But who can promise you won't do that?" the leader asked in an exaggerated tone. "We have our hands and feet and we can grow mutated fruits and Carm tree sap. Why would we join you?"</br>
</br>
"We can purchase your mutated fruits and Carm tree sap."</br>
</br>
"Federation's market can too. You're not unique."</br>
</br>
The negotiation was at a stalemate from the beginning, but fortunately, Li Wang detected the problem.</br>
</br>
"Federation came to see you?"</br>
</br>
The leader shrugged and replied with an undeniable expression.</br>
</br>
Not denying the claim was equivalent to agreeing with it.</br>
</br>
Li Wang took a deep breath, cleared his thoughts, and calmly said.</br>
</br>
"Could you give me five minutes?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the command post, Jiang Chen was working.</br>
</br>
Regarding the growth of NAC in the Hongcheng region, he was strategizing the smaller details regarding the bigger picture of expansion. While the model of Sixth Street could be used as a reference, it couldn't be perfectly replicated here and required minor adjustments.</br>
</br>
Elections, law…</br>
</br>
This time, the door opened and Wang Zhaowu walked into the office.</br>
</br>
"Are you busy?"</br>
</br>
"Almost done. Why?" Jiang Chen dropped the pen in his hand and asked Wang Zhaowu.</br>
</br>
"Nothing in particular. I just wanted to ask if you've made a decision for the captain." Wang Zhaowu closed the door behind him.</br>
</br>
The situation with Hongcheng was stabilized. After the open border agreement with Federation came into effect, NAC managed to successfully establish itself in the area. It was near the end of July. After leaving for one and a half month, it was time to return at the beginning of August.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said from the beginning that the captain of Order would be selected at the end of the conquest. As the General and Division Commander, Wang Zhaowu couldn't act as the captain and deputy captain forever.</br>
</br>
"I have someone in mind but I'm undecided."</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu was relieved when he heard Jiang Chen had a plan. He said with a smile, "I thought you forgot about it. Now I feel assured."</br>
</br>
"Enough. You think I would keep you as deputy captain forever? Head back and clean up. It won't be long until you have to return to your Second Division."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

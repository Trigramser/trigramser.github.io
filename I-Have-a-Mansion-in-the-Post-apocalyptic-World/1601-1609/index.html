</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
Four days ago.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who left the subdimension, returned to the mansion in the Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
He felt a lot of emotions flow through him when he saw the expanded Holy Shield in the sky.</br>
</br>
He almost couldn’t make it back.</br>
</br>
He did not see Sun Jiao and the others in the mansion. After he turned on the interdimensional communication chip, there was only white flickers on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
After he realized the seriousness of the problem, he rushed to the Lin Institute and found Lin Lin’s sister Lin Yi. After he learned that the neutrino tunnel was closed, he ordered the research institute to find the cause while he instructed Lin Yi to help Lilith build a new body.</br>
</br>
Just like that, about three days passed.</br>
</br>
“The reason has been ascertained. The plane parameters experienced fluctuations, causing the portals on both sides of the neutrino tunnel to lose connection with each other.”</br>
</br>
“Plane parameters… fluctuation?”</br>
</br>
“Yes.” Lin Yi nodded. “Plane parameters are just a broad term. You can understand it as a reference point. After all, there are as many planes as there are sand in the desert. To find the unique one in the desert, one must use something as a reference.”</br>
</br>
“Under what circumstances will the plane parameters change?”</br>
</br>
“In theory, the plane parameters will not change,” Lin Yi said.</br>
</br>
“Then…”</br>
</br>
“This is what confuses me the most,” Lin Yi pursed her lips and then said in a serious tone, “In theory, even things from that world are moved to this world, it is only an increase of materials in the three-dimensional space. It’s like applying different pigments on the surface of the sand, and it cannot change the structure of the sand itself, unless…”</br>
</br>
“Unless?”</br>
</br>
“It’s just a speculation, you should have heard of M-theory, right?”</br>
</br>
After she saw Jiang Chen nod, she continued.</br>
</br>
“The universe is eleven-dimensional, composed of vibrating planes, of which the four dimensions can be intuitively felt by us. Modern physics believes that there are still seven dimensions that we cannot feel but exist objectively.”</br>
</br>
“So what?”</br>
</br>
“A substance that exists in the eleven-dimensional universe…or should be described with another terminology. In short, this kind of substance directly constitutes the universe itself. If we are all things in a house, then it is what is used to build a house, like bricks.”</br>
</br>
“So, I pried a brick on this house now, right?” Jiang Chen said while he sweated.</br>
</br>
“A brick is too much of an exaggeration, it should be just a nail-sized ash…Huh? Did you do it?” Lin Yi looked at Jiang Chen in surprise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fell silent.</br>
</br>
After he recalled the conversation with the ghost in the void, he suddenly understood what the golden gravel he found in the subdimension was.</br>
</br>
[You are really lucky. You have found something by luck that a higher civilization… known as the type III civilization of the Kardashev scale in your comprehension, is using and used it on yourself.]</br>
</br>
</br>
[You will understand.]</br>
</br>
Lin Yi reached out and waved her hand in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
“What are you thinking about?”</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen recollected his thoughts, he looked at Lin Yi.</br>
</br>
“Nothing… Is there a solution?”</br>
</br>
“It’s not too difficult. You only need to modify the neutrino vibration frequency of the portals on both sides. Can you go back to the modern world? I will give you a detector and recollect the plane parameters over there.”</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen breathed a sigh of relief after he heard this.</br>
</br>
If he was asked to return the mysterious substance, he would be completely lost on how to do it.</br>
</br>
Although that matter was in his subdimension, he would have no idea how. For the past three days, he attempted multiple times to emerge his consciousness into the subdimension to touch that golden gravel, but all his attempts failed without exception.</br>
</br>
However, there were new problems.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
“Do I have to go back there?” Jiang Chen asked with an awkward expression.</br>
</br>
“Of course, do you have a way to avoid it and transfer the detector over?” Lin Yi asked rhetorically.</br>
</br>
“I might… it’s not convenient to go back.”</br>
</br>
“Why? What did you do over there?” Lin Yi frowned.</br>
</br>
“Ummm…” Jiang Chen’s expression was slightly subdued as he hesitated before he finally decided to answer truthfully and looked aside embarrassedly, “…Before I left, I blew apart Mars.”</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen managed to return to the modern world.</br>
</br>
After he sat inside a titanium alloy spherical detector about two centimeters thick, with a graviton shield on the outside, Jiang Chen traveled back to the modern world with his breathe held. After he quickly sent a message to Lin Lin, he went back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Actually, he was too careful.</br>
</br>
Planets were not stars after all.</br>
</br>
After the explosion, Mars became only a fragmented asteroid belt, and there was not any immediate danger to it.</br>
</br>
Lin Yi collected the updated coordinates and re-adjusted the output frequency of the neutrino tunnel in the apocalypse. Lin Lin received Jiang Chen’s text message and hurriedly opened the portal on Coconut Island.</br>
</br>
With the simultaneous activation of the two portals, the bridge between the two worlds was finally rebuilt.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who walked out of the portal, was received by a figure that dashed into his arms and almost knocked him back into the portal. Jiang Chen hugged Ayesha and gently held up her pretty face that was covered in tears. When he looked into her teary red eyes, he only felt a tremendous amount of guilt.</br>
</br>
It was the first time that he saw such a fragile expression on Ayesha’s face.</br>
</br>
“You promised me…”</br>
</br>
“Didn’t I come back?” Jiang Chen rubbed her chestnut hair, smiled softly, looked at the girls, and said apologetically, “Sorry, I worried you.”</br>
</br>
“Don’t apologize to me,” Xia Shiyu, whose index finger was wrapped around her hair near her temple, whispered quietly as she said with her eyes red, and unwilling to show the soft side of herself. “As long as you’re back safely,” she added as she looked away.</br>
</br>
“Speaking of which, where is Sun Jiao?” Jiang Chen couldn’t help being a little surprised when he didn’t see Sun Jiao here.</br>
</br>
Xiaorou, who stood by the door, rolled her eyes when she heard this sentence.</br>
</br>
“Is brother-in-law a fool?”</br>
</br>
“Huh?”</br>
</br>
“My sister is carrying a baby in her belly. How could she be allowed to come here? What if she is too excited and hurts the baby in her belly?” Xiaorou sighed with a defeated expression on her face, “Qian Xia has already stopped her. You should go and see her yourself.”</br>
</br>
It made sense, with Sun Jiao’s personality, she would definitely dash into Jiang Chen’s arms faster than Ayesha.</br>
</br>
“Did you really blow-up Mars?” Lin Lin, on the side, looked at Jiang Chen with an expression of disbelief.</br>
</br>
“Yes.”</br>
</br>
“This…is too crazy.”</br>
</br>
“If there was a better choice, I would also like to use a cheaper, less pricey way, but unfortunately, I’m not a god.” Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
As for the impact on the Earth after the explosion of Mars…</br>
</br>
These questions would be left to the future.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin and continued.</br>
</br>
“Speaking of which, after blowing up Mars, it seems that something special has been sucked into my subdimension.”</br>
</br>
“What is it?” Lin Lin was slightly taken aback.</br>
</br>
“It seems to be something that constitutes the origin of the universe, the things that exist in the eleventh dimension…. These are all what your sister told me, and I am not very sure myself.”</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
Attending one’s own funeral was not something he randomly decided to do.</br>
</br>
The Earth Federation required a flag to unite everyone.</br>
</br>
And a dead Jiang Chen was far more valuable in this respect than a living Jiang Chen. If he died, then all of his blemishes in history would be written off, and all his past acts of war that were criticized by the international community would be re-interpreted as positives.</br>
</br>
After all, others could not interpret a man who sacrificed himself for the entire humankind, even at the cost of a blown up Mars, as selfish based on his past actions. He could just see farther than everyone else and understood more deeply the meaning of war between civilization and civilization…</br>
</br>
Of course, these would be left for the historians a century later.</br>
</br>
On the second Friday after the explosion of Mars, that was, on the last day of May 2026, the Earth Federation was officially established at the headquarters of the Earth Defense Alliance in Coro City.</br>
</br>
In fact, this just happened, because just a week ago, high-ranking officials and dignitaries from different countries left here on SS Origin, and the dissatisfaction of the abandoned people had reached the breaking point</br>
</br>
Until the day before the founding of the Earth Federation, some countries were still in a state of anarchy, or near-anarchy. Although some countries tried to hold an election or select a transitional government, it did not produce any good results.</br>
</br>
Because of the boarding list, the credit of governments around the world had reached the lowest point in history.</br>
</br>
The most crucial factor was that no one wanted to experience the fear before the arrival of doomsday…</br>
</br>
From now on, cooperation between countries were no longer limited to space and military. Political, economic, and cultural were also included in the scope of cooperation. Countries were no longer separated, and there was only one flag left in the solar system—</br>
</br>
With the Earth drawn in the shape of a half-moon, the blue-bottomed federation flag was raised in the square in front of the Federation Building amidst applauses.</br>
</br>
More than one hundred and sixty countries became signatory states of the Earth Federation, and the remaining 30 countries and regions that had yet to join were designated as reserved areas. Most of these countries lacked in development or had remained in a state of anarchy for a long time. Some were in civil wars, or they didn’t even know what was happening in the outside world.</br>
</br>
These countries and regions were mostly concentrated in north-central Africa, scattered on the Korean Peninsula, and from West Asia to the Balkan Peninsula.</br>
</br>
After the establishment of the Earth Federation, strict military restrictions were imposed on these countries, and all weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear, biological, chemical were banned, and enforcement rights were reserved. Not only that, the rare earth elements needed for the development of the military industry and modern electronics industry were also strictly restricted.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the economic level, the World Union Reserve conducted mergers and acquisitions of central banks of each country, and the World Dollar became the only currency in the world that circulated among 160 participating states. The “Bit Spirit” monitored the global economic data in real-time and formulated monetary policies in line with actual conditions.</br>
</br>
The federation election was to be held on the last day of next month.</br>
</br>
Before the president was elected, the local councils of the federation districts would be elected to formulate local policies.</br>
</br>
Then, the local councils would prepare for referendum elections in accordance with the federation law, and based on the population base, industry strength, economic aggregate, and other indicators, they would elect one to ten members to represent the local council in the federation assembly.</br>
</br>
When the local councils and the federation assembly were established, they would then elect the federation president.</br>
</br>
All regions of the federation would pledge allegiance to the Federation Constitution and draft local laws on the basis of the Federation Constitution.</br>
</br>
It would take one to two years, based on a conservative estimate, to complete the series of procedures. It was very complicated to reunite people of different skin colors, different races, and different cultures to form a new country compared with chanting a slogan of “The solar system belongs to all humankind”.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, after people experienced the fear of doomsday, their optimism about the future of the Earth Federation was enough to tolerate all the obstacles on this path.</br>
</br>
After all, it was the only way to survive…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The federation election term began with the direct election of the second president.</br>
</br>
As the hero who saved the entire Earth civilization, the Earth Federation Provisional Committee unanimously decided to grant Jiang Chen the titles of the first Federation President and the first Federation Fleet Commander. There were also rumors that Kelvin also proposed to build two bronze statues at the entrance of the Federation Building, one to commemorate the disappearance of the fourth planet of the solar system, and the other to commemorate the great man who saved civilization from danger.</br>
</br>
Of course, this proposal was not brought to the round table of the interim committee for discussion.</br>
</br>
As for the reason…</br>
</br>
It was naturally because of Jiang Chen himself.</br>
</br>
“To be honest, I’m really surprised… How did you survive that explosion?” After Kelvin confirmed that it was Jiang Chen who stood in front of him, and not a doppelganger, Kelvin’s jaw dropped from that moment on and did not close anymore.</br>
</br>
“Since then, a lot of things happened. I am afraid that it will take more than two days and two nights to tell you everything.” Jiang Chen sat down in front of Kelvin’s desk, sighed softly, and then said, “So, what has happened since I’ve been gone?”</br>
</br>
“We… held a funeral for you and the 2,400 soldiers who died in battle, established the Earth Federation on the basis of the alliance, rebuilt the Federation Fleet, formed the Earth Federation Provisional Committee, and sent peacekeeping troops to unstable regions… …And there was the establishment of an Asset Liquidation Committee.”</br>
</br>
“What is that?” Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
“To liquidate the assets of passengers on SS Origin…they left a huge mess after they decided to leave. Many large companies lost their legal representatives, and more than 600 billion World Dollar of assets have been left in bank accounts. If we don’t properly handle these remaining issues, we’ll probably be defeated by ourselves before we are defeated by Harmony.” When Kelvin explained, his expression revealed much frustration.</br>
</br>
It was obvious that he was not very proficient in dealing with these matters.</br>
</br>
“We can talk about these things later; I’m just asking nonchalantly. The reason I came here today was mainly to ask for your opinion on another matter,” Jiang Chen leaned back against the chair while he said this, and his sight remained on Kelvin.</br>
</br>
Kelvin was unaware of what Jiang Chen wanted to ask, so he was zoned out for a second, then he said.</br>
</br>
“Please go ahead?”</br>
</br>
“About the candidate for the first Federation President.”</br>
</br>
“Isn’t it you?” Kelvin smiled.</br>
</br>
“…I mean the second one. Not that kind of useless honorable title, but a federation president in the true sense.” Jiang Chen smiled slightly as he looked at Kelvin, “Are you interested?”</br>
</br>
Kelvin held his breath.</br>
</br>
For an instant, countless complex expressions flashed in his eyes.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for a long time in the office.</br>
</br>
Finally, a light sigh broke the silence.</br>
</br>
“…I,” Those complex emotions faded from Kelvin’s pupils, and he closed his eyes and shook his head gently, “I’m not suitable for this job. If you are asking for my personal opinion, of course, I would prefer to stay in Celestial Trade Space Department. But if you already made a decision, why bother asking me.”</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen heard Kelvin’s response, he smiled and got up from the chair.</br>
</br>
“I always have to ask the employees for their opinions.”</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen put on a serious expression, stared into Kelvin’s eyes, and continued.</br>
</br>
“From today, you will be the CEO of Celestial Trade, and Celestial Trade will, as an enterprise, have a seat as a member in the Earth Federation.”</br>
</br>
“In this case, the total number of seats held by Xin will reach eleven, and the other committee representatives will not agree…” Kelvin seemed to be troubled by this decision. It was okay when Jiang Chen was the executive before, but now with Jiang Chen gone, as the interim executive, he finally realized how difficult the committee members were.</br>
</br>
However, his boss obviously did not take his difficulties to heart.</br>
</br>
“Persuade them, this is my task for you.”</br>
</br>
“By the way, the appointment letter will be issued in the form of an electronic file announcement through Celestial Trade’s database, and we will probably communicate through that in the future.”</br>
</br>
“You can do it; I have full trust in you.”</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen patted the bewildered Kelvin on the shoulder, he laughed and then left the office..</br>

</br>
In a week’s time, SS Origin had passed through the orbit of Saturn.</br>
</br>
The central computer had calculated the best route to Alpha Centauri. After the warp engine was fully engaged, SS Origin was expected to arrive at Alpha Centauri in fifty years. Elites from Earth civilization would use the colonization equipment onboard SS Origin to rebuild the glory of Earth civilization in that strange and distant galaxy.</br>
</br>
As for whether one day they could come back to the solar system and retake the home planet from the hands of those bugs…</br>
</br>
It was something that could only be determined a few centuries later.</br>
</br>
“Good drink, it’s just too spicy…what’s its name?”</br>
</br>
“Moutai,” The old man smiled lightly as he said in a quiet voice, “it’s like vodka to Russia. In our country, this kind of alcohol has become a culture.”</br>
</br>
Although they were both elites of Earth civilization, it did not mean everyone on the SS Origin was equal.</br>
</br>
Where there are people, there are classes.</br>
</br>
Major and minor member states, nuclear and non-nuclear countries, and even the nationality of the SS Origin crew members…These all directly determined the boarding list and the share of tickets allocated to each country or region, and the identity and status of the passengers.</br>
</br>
For example, Wang Dehai, who sat here at this moment.</br>
</br>
Based on the agreement before boarding, after SS Origin reached Alpha Centauri, passengers from different countries would establish colonies belonging to different countries on the Earth-like planets in the galaxy based on their previous nationalities. For example, the Russian colony would be the New Moscow, the Hua colony would naturally be New Shangjing…</br>
</br>
After Noah’s Ark was docked, the nobles were still nobles, and the common people were still common people.</br>
</br>
Although the Wang family was on the decline in recent years, the power of the Wang family in Hua was still not to be underestimated, otherwise, he would not be here to chat and joke with a foreigner.</br>
</br>
As for the man who sat across from him, it was Michael Bloomberg from the UA.</br>
</br>
Bloomberg was also an incredible person. Born in a middle-class family in 1942, he became the mayor of Nouveau York in 2001. He was also the president of Bloomberg, with assets of more than 50 billion dollars.</br>
</br>
Bloomberg was the equivalent of a success story of someone becoming successful from nothing.</br>
</br>
However, if he had to comment on his life, he was not most proud of defeating his political opponents to become the mayor, nor was he proud of his creation of Bloomberg, the leader of financial news and intelligence, instead, it was that he turned all of the assets and funds into cash, and with a net worth of 50 billion World Dollars, he bought this ticket from an arms dealer who was said to have had a relationship with Jiang Chen. He took his grandson, who was in his twenties, as well as his great-granddaughter who was less than two years old on this flight to Alpha Centauri…</br>
</br>
</br>
If it weren’t for this, he wouldn’t be here, tasting and laughing with the Red Nobleman from the East.</br>
</br>
“Are you on the ship alone?”</br>
</br>
“I’m with my grandson and great-granddaughter.” Bloomberg smiled and said softly, “The ordinary ticket allows for an adult relative and a minor relative on board. Originally, I wanted to give the spot to my son, but he couldn’t accept this kind of life. After I called him, he chose to commit suicide…”</br>
</br>
Doomsday meant that decades of life experience, hardship, and effort to achieve the goal, as well as the goal in itself, became a ridiculous joke. There were already more than one million people who committed suicide because they could not accept this reality.</br>
</br>
Although compared with the population base of more than eight billion people, these million people were only a drop in the bucket, but the people who died because of despair even exceeded despair itself…</br>
</br>
“Sorry for asking this question.”</br>
</br>
“It’s nothing. At my age, I’m actually over these things.” Bloomberg’s smile looked slightly desolate, as he gazed into the starry sky outside the window, which pointed to the direction of Earth, “It’s good that I can go see another world in my lifetime.”</br>
</br>
Although the “good” sounded quite reluctantly.</br>
</br>
“The Earth… probably has fallen now.” Wang Dehai starred at the darkness outside and let out a soft sigh, “To be honest, I never thought there would be such a day.”</br>
</br>
Perhaps because this brought back memories of the past, the two fell into a brief silence.</br>
</br>
“Unfortunately, each person is only allowed to carry ten kilograms of luggage.”</br>
</br>
“Are there any issues?”</br>
</br>
“Nothing… Survival is the most crucial element after all. It’s just a pity to think of my art collection in the basement of my mansion in Los Santos.” Bloomberg smiled, but the smile seemed weak and forced, “I only hope those bugs don’t eat them… It’s hard to say what the oil paintings taste like, but the marble statues should not be nutritious, right.”</br>
</br>
“Then how did you deal with those collections in the end?” After Wang Dehai took a sip of the alcohol from the porcelain cup, he looked at Bloomberg and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
“I gave them all away.”</br>
</br>
“Gave them away?”</br>
</br>
“To the Los Santos man who sold me his ticket,” Bloomberg smiled. “Anyway, I can’t take those arts away. If he intends to use those 50 billion to experience the feeling of being rich, then my collections may allow him to feel like the rich in a more realistic way.”</br>
</br>
The two laughed simultaneously at this point.</br>
</br>
The news that Bloomberg bought the tickets for 50 billion World Dollars became a well-known joke on the Origin starship.</br>
</br>
There was nothing more foolish than someone who exchanged the chance to live for a pile of useless paper.</br>
</br>
“What are your plans after disembarking?”</br>
</br>
“The eldest son of the Loki family wants me to be their economic adviser. They plan to build a colony on Alpha Centauri C, and call it New Boston…” At this point, Bloomberg paused for a moment and said with a smile. I don’t have any further plans. No one can promise that our friendship will be maintained until the colony is built.”</br>
</br>
“That makes sense.” Wang Dehai didn’t deny it, and said with a smile, “But allow me to be honest, the only people worthy of being our opponents are the Russians. When you joined the Earth Defense Alliance… It was a bit late.”</br>
</br>
“Maybe, these things will become clear after we open our eyes.” Bloomberg did not disapprove of the statement, instead, he just laughed it off.</br>
</br>
If the Alpha Centauri was rich in resources, it would be fine. If the planet was poor in resources, then the first thing they need to deal with would be their fellow humans who arrived at Alpha Centauri together.</br>
</br>
Almost everyone was conscious of this fact.</br>
</br>
They were the elites of human society.</br>
</br>
They followed the law of nature, that the fittest survive, more than anyone else.</br>
</br>
After all, they were the ones who survived natural selection…</br>
</br>
At this moment, a soft female voice rang above their heads.</br>
</br>
“SS Origin will enter sub-light speed in 30 minutes. The crew will remind you, please open the hibernation cabin, lie down flat with your hands rested beside your legs…”</br>
</br>
The soft female voice repeated these instructions twice in twelve languages.</br>
</br>
When her voice stopped, Wang Dehai got up from the chair, downed the remaining alcohol in the cup, and put down the porcelain cup with force.</br>
</br>
“Then, I wish you good luck.”</br>
</br>
“The same goes for you, God bless you.”</br>
</br>
Bloomberg smiled and stood up, toasted Wang Dehai, and walked towards the corridor outside the door..</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>

</br>
“Your subdimension can hold people now?”</br>
</br>
“It seems like it…”</br>
</br>
“Unbelievable…but you don’t need to wear a spacesuit? How do you breathe in it?”</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was inside Jiang Chen’s storage dimension in a spacesuit. Her small mouth was wide open because of shock, she said while she looked at Jiang Chen who was floating beside her.</br>
</br>
“I don’t know,” Jiang Chen shook his head and said helplessly, “Maybe…because I am the master of this subdimension?”</br>
</br>
Compared with when the subdimension was just formed, apart from the space becoming bigger, this spherical space did not change significantly. As for how he could stuff himself inside, how could living creatures be stored inside, it was impossible for him to understand such advanced topics with his undergraduate education.</br>
</br>
Just that instinct told him it was likely related to the golden-yellow gravel-like substance.</br>
</br>
“Where is that golden thing?”</br>
</br>
“It’s there.”</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed towards the corner of the space.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin followed the direction Jiang Chen pointed at and she found the golden gravel in the corner of the subdimension.</br>
</br>
The air box behind whizzed, and under the boost of the gas jet, Lin Lin flew towards the golden gravel.</br>
</br>
When she flew next to it, she reached out and tried to touch it, but that golden gravel slipped away through the cracks between her fingers.</br>
</br>
“Strange…” Lin Lin muttered to herself as her index finger repeatedly tried to touch it, “It’s like a holographic projection, there is no resistance at all.”</br>
</br>
“Even I can’t do anything about it.” Jiang Chen sighed, shrugged helplessly, and moved to Lin Lin’s side, “What do you think? Do you have a clue?”</br>
</br>
Countless tiny light particles floated around this group of golden matter. Upon closer inspection, the entire golden yellow matter seemed to be entangled with countless light particles. No matter if he tried to touch it with his hand, or anything else, this golden matter did not seem to exist in this world, as if it did not intersect with everything in this world.</br>
</br>
“…Is this the matter that got into your subdimension after Mars exploded?” Lin Lin carefully examined the seemingly flowing lines on the surface of the light ball, as she was lost in thought.</br>
</br>
“It should be after the explosion of Mars… before, when I took out the magnetic confinement device storing antimatter from the subdimension, there was no such matter in it.”</br>
</br>
“So, is the most crucial point that it happened after Mars exploded?”</br>
</br>
“That’s right.” Jiang Chen suddenly remembered something.</br>
</br>
“What’s wrong?”</br>
</br>
“I remember that after Mars exploded…I briefly entered the void. While in the void, the voice inside told me… that thing is only understood by a type III civilization on the Kardashev scale.”</br>
</br>
“Level III civilization?” The expression on Lin Lin’s face was quite shocked.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on the definition of the Kardashev scale, the scope of activity of the type III civilization covered the entire galaxy. Even the Gaia civilization was only the pinnacle of type I civilization, and it had just managed to pass the threshold of level II civilization on the technical level.</br>
</br>
As for the current Earth civilization, although it seemed to have built colonies to Jupiter, in fact, there was still a big gap in the full utilization of the Earth’s resources. Therefore, based on the Kardashev scale, the Earth civilization could only be described as barely touching the edge of type I.</br>
</br>
Based on Fermi’s Paradox, if such a civilization really did exist in the Milky Way, then humans would have encountered it a long time ago.</br>
</br>
Therefore, it was very likely that a type III civilization had yet to be born in the Milky Way…</br>
</br>
But the ghost in the void did not tell these things to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen repeated what he heard in the void, he looked at Lin Lin, who lowered her head and became deep in thought.</br>
</br>
About ten minutes later, Lin Lin shook her head.</br>
</br>
“Have you considered a possibility?”</br>
</br>
“What possibility?” Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
“Don’t get excited, this kind of speculation is without any scientific basis,” Lin Lin’s expression was a little embarrassed. “The four-dimensional Klein particle decayed into a three-dimensional world that can be transformed into light and energy. Based on this idea, by analogy, what kind of effect will the unknown matter existing in the eleven-dimensional world have if it decayed?”</br>
</br>
“An explosion?”</br>
</br>
“What explosion, can you be a little bit imaginative?” Lin Lin rolled her eyes at him, and after a soft cough, she continued, “The decay from the eleven-dimensional space to the ten-dimensional space, and then continue from the ten-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space, and the one-dimensional space is also filled. The things created along the way are invisible to us, but they are all necessary elements to form a complete universe…”</br>
</br>
“That is to say.” There was a look of realization that appeared briefly in Jiang Chen’s pupils.</br>
</br>
“The decay may have occurred, but from our perspective, it may not be visible.” Lin Lin looked at the golden gravel and continued, “If this inference is correct, then your subdimension is probably moving towards the transformation of a real universe”</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
20.5 light-years away, the half emerald green and half flesh red Gliese 581G floated quietly on its orbit, like a piece of unique artwork in the starry night.</br>
</br>
Under the emerald green “leaves”, there were entangled tubes, nutrients and heat were transferred from the tidal locked side to the dark side. There were large chunks of flesh-colored mass. The Harmony residents lived under the flesh-colored mass, and their bodies were filled with large and small tubes, like somatic cells connected in series by capillaries.</br>
</br>
Every individual was a cell in the gigantic behemoth.</br>
</br>
Once they entered into a fierce ground battle, no civilization could fair against them.</br>
</br>
Space warfare was not their area of ​​expertise, but for the Earth civilization still in its infancy, it was not a difficult task to overcome.</br>
</br>
Except that, they did not expect the Earth civilization would win when they were guaranteed to be victorious…</br>
</br>
When the news of the defeat of the space colonization ship finally arrived, the entire planet was filled with shrill wailing.</br>
</br>
The Harmony civilization residents sent condolences to the soldiers who had not returned from the expedition. The scaly mutants living under the huge leaf bubble roared into the air and waved their sharp claws, as they expressed their desire for war and slaughter to the will of the mother nest with high spirits.</br>
</br>
However, in the next second, all mutants became quiet.</br>
</br>
[Silence.]</br>
</br>
The cold voice reverberated in the mind of every mutant.</br>
</br>
It was not any language, and there was not any text that could record it, but for the mutants, it was an imperial edict.</br>
</br>
The flesh-red mass began to squirm, and large clumps gathered toward the middle of the planet not facing the star.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a bumpy human face grew out of the center of that planet.</br>
</br>
The eyes opened slowly.</br>
</br>
Those eyes stared motionlessly in the direction of the solar system.</br>
</br>
Even if it was very clear that the galaxy reflected in its pupils was nothing but the reflection emitted from more than 20 years ago, its line of sight still stayed on it. It was as if it tried to engrave everything about this planet into its mind.</br>
</br>
The expedition failed.</br>
</br>
There was not much frustration in its mind.</br>
</br>
The splitters began to lift off and send the organic matter to the skeleton on the synchronous orbit, and a larger space colonization ship was slowly taking shape.</br>
</br>
The contempt for Earth civilization was the main cause of failure. After all, based on their expectation, Earth would have just entered the first few years of the space age when they arrived…</br>
</br>
This would never happen again.</br>
</br>
This time, it would build a stronger fleet, allowing the endless swarms to devour the iron and steel of the Earth’s civilization.</br>
</br>
The real war had just begun….</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1605: Liquidation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
“If it weren’t for the Asset Liquidation Committee, I wouldn’t know that these people were so rich.” Jiang Chen sat in the office as he flipped through the documents in his hands. When he saw the name Liu Xiangguo, he couldn’t help but smile as he shook his head.</br>
</br>
There were very few properties under the name of Liu Xiangguo, only one old manor in Shangjing.</br>
</br>
But his children, grandchildren, and even relatives within three generations, if the total assets under their names were totaled together, their wealth could rival a nation. It was so exaggerated that the more distant the kinship, the scarier the net worth.</br>
</br>
For example, his niece’s husband was the boss of a real estate developer in Hua. The company’s market capitalization was in the hundreds of billions range, his own net worth was in the billions of dollars, and he possessed hidden assets worth tens of billions of dollars overseas.</br>
</br>
If it weren’t for three factors, the formation of the Earth Federation, the powers of countries and regions had already been given to the Provisional Committee, and Ghost Agents fully cooperated with the Provisional Committee to investigate, the money would never have been discovered.</br>
</br>
Of course, everyone else was the same.</br>
</br>
“How are you going to dispose of these assets?”</br>
</br>
Ayesha stood in front of Jiang Chen’s desk and spoke softly.</br>
</br>
“With fairness,” Jiang Chen tossed down the stack of papers on the desk, stretched his arms on the chair, then squinted his eyes in a relaxed state before he looked out the window. “Kelvin knows what to do, and the eight billion people in the world who have been abandoned also need an explanation.”</br>
</br>
SS Origin originally belonged to the Earth Fleet, but in the end, it did not fulfill its mission on the battlefield and instead, was used to help some people escape.</br>
</br>
Even if it was a compelling decision, even if it was the most sensible and logical choice. After all, a fight meant an inevitable death, but fleeing away meant at least preserving the last kindle of fire for Earth civilization.</br>
</br>
But now that the doomsday did not arrive, this behavior had naturally become a betrayal to all humankind.</br>
</br>
And it was a form of intolerable betrayal.</br>
</br>
After all, the list to board the ship was not determined by all humankind from the beginning.</br>
</br>
A small group of people used the privileges in their hands to decide that the people who survived were themselves and to let the rest of the eight billion people die. After the establishment of the Earth Federation, it was natural that these people would be sentenced by the Federation Court.</br>
</br>
Based on the laws of the Earth Federation, 2,500 passengers and 500 crew members on SS Origin would be prosecuted by the Federation Court for “treason”, and the assets under their name would be returned to the federation treasury. The World Federation Reserve and Its partner banks would list the assets for auction.</br>
</br>
</br>
This move certainly caused quite a backlash.</br>
</br>
After all, even the holders of these assets and the first-order heirs boarded the ship heading to Alpha Centaur, but based on the inheritance laws of different countries, there were always the second, third, and even fourth-order heirs to inherit these assets.</br>
</br>
However, these protests were of course invalid.</br>
</br>
The vast majority of people approved this decision of the Earth Federation, and there was no disagreement on this proposal within the Provisional Committee.</br>
</br>
After all, this decision revenged those who were left behind…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In the second month of the establishment of the Earth Federation, more than a month passed since the Earth civilization survived the invasion of Harmony.</br>
</br>
During this more than a month time, Jiang Chen cooperated with Lin Lin to conduct all kinds of experiments on the golden light particles. However, the fact proved that it was too difficult to leapfrog and challenge the areas that were only understood by a type III civilization.</br>
</br>
Even though the matter just stayed in the subdimension, Jiang Chen, as the owner of the subdimension, could not do anything with it. The only thing he knew was that the golden light particles were slowly changing his subdimension.</br>
</br>
Moreover, this change was benign.</br>
</br>
Because it was the matter produced after a planet exploded, so it was given a name called “stardust”.</br>
</br>
After all, those ethereal light particles were indeed like dust…</br>
</br>
Just like that, Lin Lin gave it a very casual name.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who had put aside “stardust”, had completely freed himself of any responsibilities, and gave himself a long vacation. In the past ten years of growth, the company structure of Celestial Trade became quite stable, with a clear division of responsibilities among the different departments, and strict checks and balances by the central computer, which drastically reduced a series of problems such as a department gaining too much power or internal corruption.</br>
</br>
Even if Kelvin, Ivan, and Zhang Yaping were the only three people that knew Jiang Chen was still alive, and the world thought he was no longer “here and “sacrificed” himself for Earth civilization, he could still use the central computer’s highest authority, or directly give orders through Lilith.</br>
</br>
So, it really did not make a difference whether he was there or not.</br>
</br>
Rather, the fact the whole world would “forget” him made him feel an unprecedented amount of ease.</br>
</br>
In the past, no matter what Celestial Trade did, the cameras of reporters from all over the world were immediately aimed at him. Politicians, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders around the world “grilled” him on the conference table as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, that kind of life was quite fresh.</br>
</br>
But honestly, he had enough…</br>
</br>
At the mansion on the north side of Coro Island, the corner of the marble wall was covered with emerald, green moss, as if it had been abandoned for a long time. Some people suggested that this should be used as the former residence of Jiang Chen, and the government should buy it and turn it into a museum, but this kind of proposal was eventually dismissed.</br>
</br>
With a sense of awe, residents generally did not approach this place.</br>
</br>
But today, a black car stopped at the gate of the mansion.</br>
</br>
“Come here to pick me up at five o’clock.”</br>
</br>
After the old man finished this sentence, he closed the door. After the car drove away, he walked up and pressed the doorbell.</br>
</br>
The doorbell rang three times.</br>
</br>
The iron gate did not move.</br>
</br>
The old man sighed softly. He did not leave but just stood there.</br>
</br>
About ten minutes later, there was a sound of a light click on the iron gate, which slowly opened the gate to both sides</br>
</br>
A glimmer of joy flashed across the old man’s face, he adjusted his collar and tie, then walked into the mansion along the stone brick road behind the wall.</br>
</br>
Loki felt emotional when he stood before the mansion; he looked at the closed red wooden door and said.</br>
</br>
“I know you aren’t dead… are you not going to invite your old friend in for a drink?”</br>
</br>
“Today is not the best day, I’m not at home.”</br>
</br>
The sound came from the garden beside the stone brick road.</br>
</br>
Loki looked over there and saw a gardening drone hover next to him. Two silver scissors were still stained with grass clippings. It was evident that the drone was in the backyard mowing the lawn..</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1606: Lonely at the Top</br>
</div></br>
</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
A hearty laugh came from the drone when Loki just stood there with a look of surprise on his face. After a monetary pause, Jiang Chen, who controlled the drone, said.</br>
</br>
“Besides my family and loved ones, now you are the fourth person to knows that I am still alive. Go on and tell me how you plan to make me believe you that you will keep this a secret.”</br>
</br>
“This kind of promise is not necessary at all. If you don’t believe me, you just need to use the scissors on the drones to get rid of me.” Loki had a faint smile as he watched the gardening scissors on the drone, ” No one will hold the accountability of a dead person. Everyone will definitely think that it was an accident caused by the aging drone, due to the lack of maintenance.”</br>
</br>
“Really? But this will affect the reputation of Future Group’s drone products, so let’s forget it.” Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Loki let out a sigh of relief when he heard Jiang Chen’s words.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen really planned to get rid of him, then he would not care about the “reputation of drone products” at all. Since he could still use this saying as a joke, then Jiang Chen probably didn’t care about the fact that he was still alive.</br>
</br>
Actually, when Loki decided to come today, it was a gamble on its own.</br>
</br>
Although he did not board SS Origin, the B City Consortium was on the list of the Asset Liquidation Committee. The Asset Liquidation Committee’s explanation was very simple. Although Loki did not board SS Origin, the consortium was not comprised of the Loki family. There were also families including Kennedy, Adams, and even Loki’s sons on SS Origin at this moment.</br>
</br>
And the most critical part was that these people received tickets to board the starship all because of their relationship to the B City Consortium.</br>
</br>
The Asset Liquidation Committee stated that Loki could retain assets under his own name, but the assets held by the B City Consortium and other family members would be confiscated.</br>
</br>
This decision was a death sentence to both B City Consortium and the Loki family.</br>
</br>
“I don’t understand, why didn’t you get on the ship? Don’t tell me that you missed it.”</br>
</br>
Inside his mansion on Coconut Island, Jiang Chen looked at the wrinkled face in the holographic screen and asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
“Except for me, everyone in the Loki family is already on board…including my wife.”</br>
</br>
“Why?”</br>
</br>
“Because you said, I can live a long time.”</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was taken back for a second, then he laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
“Is it fun to laugh at an old man?” Loki said helplessly.</br>
</br>
“No, no…” Jiang Chen laughed and waved his hand. “I have just underestimated the attractiveness of an increased lifespan for ordinary people. But haven’t you thought about it? If you stay, maybe you won’t be able to survive even a week?”</br>
</br>
“So, my family thought I was crazy, and my wife even thought I got dementia.” Loki sniffed, then narrowed his eyes and looked into the sky as he said with emotion, “I didn’t really care at the time. Before they left, I entrusted the future of the Loki family to my eldest son. I believe he will lead the people who follow us to build a new home in Alpha Centauri…”</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not deny what he said, nor did he comment, but just smiled instead.</br>
</br>
Sooner or later, the Earth Federation would bring Alpha Centauri into its territory.</br>
</br>
It could be after the final battle with Harmony, or it could be before.</br>
</br>
“I only want to ask one thing here,” Loki paused for a moment, then asked, “Is the deal between us still valid?”</br>
</br>
About a few years ago, at a state banquet in Ecuador, Jiang Chen made a deal with Loki. As long as the B City Consortium was willing to help Celestial Trade take the lead in establishing the World Union Reserve, then Jiang Chen would give him an additional lifespan of at least fifty years.</br>
</br>
“It depends on you,” Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
“What do you want me to do” Loki said respectfully.</br>
</br>
“Well… there is nothing special you need to do. You just need to do a good job being the president of the World Union Reserve and cooperate with the Provisional Committee. Sooner or later, what should belong to you will belong to you.” Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
“That’s all?”</br>
</br>
Loki looked at the drone’s camera in surprise.</br>
</br>
He originally thought that he would have to pay a certain price today, but he didn’t expect Jiang Chen to give him a pass so easily.</br>
</br>
“Mhmm.”</br>
</br>
To be honest, if it were before, Jiang Chen could have been interested in biting a piece of meat off the B City Consortium.</br>
</br>
But now…</br>
</br>
What’ the best way to describe this, the meat on the ant is too tiny to be bothered with.</br>
</br>
Earth Federation was already established, and he successfully went behind the scenes.</br>
</br>
Throughout the entire planet, there was no opponent worthy of him to seriously consider. Celestial Trade and Future Group were like two huge monsters that have contracted the future of all humankind in all aspects.</br>
</br>
As for the future of Celestial Trade…</br>
</br>
The destination was among the sea of ​​stars light years away…</br>
</br>
“Let me give you some suggestions,” Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Loki took a second to process the sentence, then hurriedly said with respectfulness.</br>
</br>
“Please go ahead.”</br>
</br>
“While the DNA telomere extension medicine is still useful to you, hurry up and give yourself some heirs,” Jiang Chen laughed and leaned back on his chair. “Don’t wait until your time has come, and you won’t have anyone to inherit your assets. Even if I crossed out your name from the list, your assets would still have to be confiscated in the end.”</br>
</br>
“…”</br>
</br>
Loki didn’t know what to say about Jiang Chen’s suggestion.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The federation assembly election was in the final stage, and the lifespan of the interim government was also in a final countdown.</br>
</br>
Just when those left behind were busy re-electing their own leaders, the space companies, led by Future Heavy Industries and Celestial Trade, under the organization of the Provisional Committee, began to rebuild the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
There was a century left for the Earth civilization, but no one thought that it was a long time.</br>
</br>
After all, the task was not only to build the Earth Fleet without a single battleship left, but the most critical shipbuilding yard had to be rebuilt.</br>
</br>
The once fiery red planet had turned into an asteroid belt. Both Heavenly Palace City and the spaceport were blown up with nothing left. Originally, Jiang Chen planned to build the planet into the largest industrial base in the solar system, and the second home of Earth civilization, but now this long-term plan had to be reconsidered.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, although Mars was gone, the mass itself did not disappear out of thin air.</br>
</br>
Except for some fragments accelerated to the third cosmic speed that could leave the solar system, most of the remaining fragments would eventually remain due to multiple factors such as mutual collisions and the influence of celestial gravity, just like the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.</br>
</br>
That rich mineral resources could still be used on the starships of the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
On the second day of the birth of the Federation Assembly, two Seagull-class starships had simultaneously set off from the port of Celestial City and were headed for the fragmented planet wreckage.</br>
</br>
The first mission was to assess the damage of the antimatter bomb, and the other mission was to investigate the situation there.</br>
</br>
Based on the plan, Celestial Trade decided to select the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt and rebuild the spaceport.</br>
</br>
This time, the Earth civilization would no longer only invest in the resources of an enterprise, but the labor, material and research and development power of the entire Earth Federation. Jiang Chen firmly believed that the next battle with the Harmony civilization would definitely not be in the solar system, but in the distant Gliese Galaxy….</br>

</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
The Earth was saved</br>
</br>
The Earth Federation was established.</br>
</br>
The Earth Fleet was also reborn.</br>
</br>
His child was in Sun Jiao’s belly, and in a few months, he would be a father.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a while if he still had any regrets in this life, but he couldn’t think of anything.</br>
</br>
He had been thinking about this question over the past few days.</br>
</br>
Whether in his life or in his career, he had reached the peak that people could accomplish.</br>
</br>
He was the majority shareholder of a trillion-dollar company, the first “leader” of the Earth, and the man ruling the world behind the scenes…</br>
</br>
Millions of people were under his direct order, the fate of tens of millions of people were associated with his name, and the production and life of eight billion people were closely related to him. Perhaps if he sneezed in the morning, the global financial market would experience turbulence the next day…Of course, it was just an exaggerated statement, since he was not wayward enough to be unreasonable.</br>
</br>
“Lilith.”</br>
</br>
“What’s wrong?”</br>
</br>
Lilith, who stood next to Jiang Chen at the moment, looked very different from the flat-chested Loli from back then.</br>
</br>
Her long golden hair extended to her waist, and the front of the white T-shirt was stuffed full. She had turned into a stunning blond who exuded hormones, which made people’s hearts skip a beat the moment people saw her.</br>
</br>
If it was not for the emotionless face that did not change much, Jiang Chen could hardly match her name with Lilith.</br>
</br>
The reason for such an “accident” was mainly because Lilith strongly requested Lin Yi to design according to her ideas when she created the new body. In her original words, “Since we have to make a new one anyway, why not make it look better?”</br>
</br>
So, its appearance now was this.</br>
</br>
“What do you think I still lack?” Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
“Why do you want to ask such a strange question?” Lilith turned her head around to look at Jiang Chen, then Lilith replied in the same expressionless state, “Isn’t this something only you know?”</br>
</br>
“…Well, human beings don’t like to do everything themselves.”</br>
</br>
“Including thinking?”</br>
</br>
“I don’t deny it,” Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Lilith fell into silence as if she was carefully processing that thought.</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen thought she was going to go play games without saying a word, she suddenly said.</br>
</br>
“Speaking of which, you haven’t held a formal wedding, right?”</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Wedding.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, I really owe them a wedding.</br>
</br>
Especially Sun Jiao. Since her belly was bulging day by day and if this matter continues, the wedding would have to be delayed until after she gave birth.</br>
</br>
Lilith’s words reminded Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He once promised to marry them with the grandest wedding in the world, and then use his entire life to protect their happiness. This sentence sounded shameless, but it was indeed the truest feeling in his mind.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was likely impossible to host the wedding in the modern world since he was already “dead”.</br>
</br>
For a dead person to crawl out of the grave to attend his own wedding was probably more shocking than a living person attending his own funeral. In order to avoid all kinds of troubles, and to keep the media that finally lost interest at bay, Jiang Chen specifically consulted Xia Shiyu, Ayesha, and Natasha about where to hold the wedding.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, they were all reasonable people.</br>
</br>
“I’m fine with anywhere, as long as I’m with you.”</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
“…I’m yours already. So, you can make the arrangement.”</br>
</br>
“Holding a wedding in the apocalypse? That sounds interesting.”</br>
</br>
Those were Ayesha, Xia Shiyu, and Natasha’s response in respective order.</br>
</br>
As for Sun Jiao, Xiaorou, Yao Yao, and Lin Lin, the apocalypse was where they came from. Although the modern world was much more prosperous than the apocalypse, they preferred the apocalypse a little.</br>
</br>
So, the location of the wedding was finally determined to be in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
“You’re getting married?”</br>
</br>
“Mhmm…what are you laughing at?”</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen looked at Liu Yao, who suddenly burst out laughing, he turned around and looked at the side of her face.</br>
</br>
“I’m thinking… You just attended your own funeral, and now you are going to attend your own wedding. Wouldn’t it be too weird?” Liu Yao turned to look at Jiang Chen with a smile that looked gorgeous but feeble, “Also those who think you are dead will be so surprised that their jaw will drop.”</br>
</br>
Liu Yao still remembered that at the time, she was in black clothes and stood in the corner of the cemetery with tears. She was then spotted by Xia Shiyu and was brought here by her. When she saw Jiang Chen in front of her, smiling, she seemed to have lost herself for a momeny, and almost fainted out of excitement…</br>
</br>
It took her an entire day to slowly accept the reality that Jiang Chen was still alive.</br>
</br>
Before she came to Coro Island, Liu Yao took a long break from her production company. After Jiang Chen invited her to stay for a few days, she agreed without much consideration.</br>
</br>
Although they had never seen this strange woman, Sun Jiao and the others had a friendly attitude towards Liu Yao. In addition, they knew exactly what kind of person Jiang Chen was. After more than a month, the relationship between Liu Yao and the girls gradually became closer.</br>
</br>
It was just that she could feel that it was hard for her to integrate into their world. What made her the most uncomfortable was that this sense of distance did not stem from someone’s exclusion, but simply because they accompanied him and experienced things that she never did, or could even imagine.</br>
</br>
This feeling of being left alone made her feel a little jealous…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled when he heard the naïve statement.</br>
</br>
If you let others know that I’m still alive, I’m afraid their jaws won’t’ drop in surprise, but rather, they won’t be able to sleep out of fear.</br>
</br>
He was well aware of this.</br>
</br>
Only those who had passed could gain the awe of the people from the bottom of their hearts and mystify his existence. After all, deep down, people only longed for a dead saint, not a living emperor.</br>
</br>
“They won’t know,” Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
“How is it possible,” Liu Yao shook her head, then said with a smile, “Unless…you don’t invite anyone to your wedding. But a wedding that no one knows…what’s the point?”</br>
</br>
She was smiling, but tears rolled down her face uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
She had endured it for a long time.</br>
</br>
But, after all, she couldn’t control her feeling anymore.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw her tears, then turned silent.</br>
</br>
The quiet atmosphere lasted for about half a minute between the two.</br>
</br>
In the end, it was Jiang Chen who broke the silence.</br>
</br>
“There is one thing I haven’t told you.”</br>
</br>
“I don’t want to know.” Liu Yao shook her head and her smile was a little haggard, “I just want…before you get married, can you promise me one thing…”</br>
</br>
“I promise you.”</br>
</br>
There was a look of surprise on Liu Yao’s face.</br>
</br>
“Are you not going to ask what it is?”</br>
</br>
“It’d be too rude to refuse my woman.” As Jiang Chen gazed into her black pupils filled with surprise, excitement, and rolling tears, he smiled and gently wiped the teardrops beneath her eyes, “Going back to the topic just now, that thing I haven’t told you.”</br>
</br>
“That thing must be… really important.”</br>
</br>
“You’re correct. After all, that’s my biggest secret….” As he gazed at the teary Liu Yao, he smiled and offered an invitation, “Do you want to go and take a look with me?”</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
The instant Liu Yao stepped through the portal, she felt like her perception of the world had been shattered.</br>
</br>
The dim-yellow dome shrouded the entire city and towering buildings that pierced into the clouds were connected together. Although the charred windows and broken walls did not suggest anyone lived there, it was still possible to see through the ruins how prosperous this place used to be.</br>
</br>
“Did an earthquake happen here?” Liu Yao said, in a state of daze.</br>
</br>
“Something more serious than an earthquake happened,” Jiang Chen smiled at Liu Yao who was in a sluggish state and said when he looked at the tall buildings in the distance. “You can’t tell right, but this is Wanghai… Although it is Wanghai a century from now.”</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was stunned.</br>
</br>
Her beautiful pupils widened with shock and disbelief was written all over her face.</br>
</br>
This… is Wanghai?</br>
</br>
Everything she saw before her eyes were beyond her imagination.</br>
</br>
It took a while for her to digest the huge amount of information as she twisted her stiff neck and looked at Jiang Chen blankly.</br>
</br>
“That means…”</br>
</br>
“Yes,” Jiang Chen nodded and said with a smile, “Most of the technology of Future Group comes from here, or is developed based on here. So, don’t consider me as great…I’m just standing on the giant’s corpse.”</br>
</br>
“Don’t say that. Ordinary people can’t bring the giant back to life even if they are standing on the giant’s corpse.” A sweet voice came from behind, and it was Xiaorou in a lavender dress. She walked to the side of Jiang Chen with a smile. “If it was someone else, they might not be able to do it.”</br>
</br>
Liu Yao didn’t notice what Xiaorou had just said, because her attention at the moment had been completely captured by this strange world. As if she was in a dream, everything here was beyond her imagination</br>
</br>
Liu Yao watched the soldiers that walked by in a row and asked in a daze.</br>
</br>
“What are those people… doing?”</br>
</br>
“If it was before, they would probably be on duty, but now…they should be rehearsing,” When he said this, the expression on Jiang Chen’s face was slightly embarrassed.</br>
</br>
His subordinates were so enthusiastic.</br>
</br>
After they heard that the General was going to be married, everyone from the General’s Mansion to the field officers seemed to be completely energized. They were so excited everyday and had nowhere to vent their energy. Every day, when there was nothing to do, they would go out to rehearse, and it was grander than the military parade.</br>
</br>
“Rehearsal?” Liu Yao looked at Jiang Chen with confusion in her eyes</br>
</br>
“Um… because of the wedding,” Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was slightly depressed when she heard the word wedding.</br>
</br>
She opened her mouth, but in the end, she closed it again as she swallowed back the words that rushed to her.</br>
</br>
Xiaorou sensibly noticed the hesitation on Liu Yao’s face was because of herself, so she smiled and turned away wittily.</br>
</br>
</br>
As Liu Yao watched Xiaorou’s back as she walked away, she sensed the silence that lingered between the two of them and said softly.</br>
</br>
“You promised me one thing…”</br>
</br>
“Mhmm.”</br>
</br>
“I want…” She bit her lower lip lightly, lowered her head because of the unspeakable words, and said with a voice that was so weak that it was almost inaudible, “Give me a child… Don’t get me wrong. I didn’t mean that…I will raise him up by myself, I won’t use him to trouble you, I just want to…”</br>
</br>
When she finished the sentence, it exhausted Liu Yao’s strength.</br>
</br>
She knew that her request was excessive, and it could even be said to be unreasonable. When she said it, she was prepared to be rejected. After all, she knew very well that her identity was just his mistress, and things like illegitimate children have always been accompanied by endless troubles…</br>
</br>
“I reject.”</br>
</br>
Although she expected that he would say that, she couldn’t stop the tears from rolling out of her eyes.</br>
</br>
She lowered her head, in an attempt to block her eyes with her bangs, as she suppressed the sadness that was about to overwhelm her. Then she whispered in a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
“Why?”</br>
</br>
“Because I am a greedy person, I can’t change this terrible quality about me.” Jiang Chen sighed softly, “I have a hunch that if I promise you, you may leave me forever… “</br>
</br>
Is that not good?</br>
</br>
Liu Yao looked at Jiang Chen, and her eyes that could speak seemed to ask Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
“Of course it’s not good.” Jiang Chen rubbed her hair, then gently lifted her face covered in tears. He gazed into the misty eyes before a smirk suddenly appeared at the corner of his mouth.” What’s more, after I let you see my secrets, do you think I will let you go?”</br>
</br>
The tears seemed to rush out like a waterfall and turned the beautiful eyelashes wet.</br>
</br>
Happiness came so suddenly that it exceeded Liu Yao’s expectations.</br>
</br>
She dove into Jiang Chen’s chest, as joyous tears rolled down her cheeks. The beautiful and pristine teeth sunk into Jiang Chen’s shoulder, as if she wanted to return the grievances and sorrows she experienced for the past few days.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
From the choked-up voice, she squeezed out intermittent words.</br>
</br>
“You… bad person.”</br>
</br>
“Inappropriate wording.”</br>
</br>
With the feeling of heat rolling down his neck, as well as the pain from his shoulder, Jiang Chen cracked a grin, then gently placed his hands behind Liu Yao’s back and reminded softly.</br>
</br>
“The word devil is more appropriate.”</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
From the beginning of preparations to the formal implementation, this wedding preparation already took more than a month.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen himself did not mean to be extravagant, it was obviously impossible for him as the NAC General to keep a low profile on this matter.</br>
</br>
Especially Jiang Chen’s subordinates. They worried about his wedding more than he himself. Since a month ago, preparations had been in full swing, and they even specially renovated the Century Auditorium in downtown Wanghai, as well as the nearby streets that had not had time to be renovated.</br>
</br>
It was rumored that before the war, this was the place where the Pan-Asia Cooperation Economic Forum was held. Therefore, after the outbreak of the war, this place was specifically taken care of by missiles and artilleries. However, the NAC engineering team took less than half a month to renovate this place.</br>
</br>
Through the wasteland, the ridiculous efficiency was only possible in the hands of the NAC engineering team.</br>
</br>
The preparation of the materials needed for the wedding ceremony was personally handled by Wang Qing, the Minister of Logistics.</br>
</br>
The pearls to decorate the wedding dresses were shipped from the Outpost Town on the West Coast of North America. The diamonds on the diamond rings came from the South African Union diamond mine. The red carpet was taken from the fluff of the mutated blood lion. The utensils and tableware on the wedding table were all made out of pure silver, even the tablecloth on the dining table, was made of fine Balinese yarn…</br>
</br>
Not only that, but Wang Qing also instructed the craftsmen in the Sixth Street to use fine velvet and exquisite wood to create a bed with a width of 12 meters and to make matching bedding for Jiang Chen. In order to move it into the mansion, the bed had to be split it into twelve parts and a wall had to be taken down.</br>
</br>
As for the purpose of the bed…</br>
</br>
Just by looking at the length, it goes without saying.</br>
</br>
Apart from it being luxurious and extravagant, Jiang Chen couldn’t find a more suitable word to describe this wedding.</br>
</br>
When he went to see Wang Qing and asked if it was too much, he got this answer…</br>
</br>
“It’s not an exaggeration at all. You are the General of NAC, and your wedding is the wedding of the entire NAC.. You represent not only yourself, but also the entire New Pan-Asia Cooperation,” Wang Qing looked at Jiang Chen, who had sought her opinion, and the corner of her mouth curled up as she winked playfully, “What’s more, without a grand wedding, how can you be worthy of your seven beautiful wives?”</br>

</div></br>
</br>
_Min_  Rainystars</br>
</br>
The busy and tiring month came to an end.</br>
</br>
Finally, it was the day of the wedding.</br>
</br>
Today was a good day. The sky was clear, and there was not a trace of depressive radiation clouds in the distance. The Holy Shield was temporarily closed, and the bright sunlight poured down without reservation; it bathed this reborn city and every face living inside.</br>
</br>
Since early morning, the fireworks over Wanghai did not stop.</br>
</br>
People took to the streets and gathered in front of the square early.</br>
</br>
Everyone’s face was filled with the same excitement and emotion, as well as different curiosity and longing. The enthusiasm in people’s hearts was like an indistinguishable flame, and in front of the wide square, they waved flags of different sizes and waited for their hero.</br>
</br>
They had been looking forward to this day for too long.</br>
</br>
Now, it was finally here.</br>
</br>
The first thing that marched through the square was a power armor formation.</br>
</br>
The bright steel plates, under the sunlight, reflected dazzling rays. The steps were uniform, their rifles were held in front of their chest, and their eyes were focused straight ahead. The sound of steel boots marching through resounded in the open square like the roar of a monster and echoed in the mind of every viewer.</br>
</br>
After the power armor phalanx, it was the NAC tank force.</br>
</br>
The torrent of steel drove across the flat road, and the rumbling of the tracks over the concrete pavement was like a mighty and majestic accompaniment.</br>
</br>
“Is this a military parade or a wedding?”</br>
</br>
“God… where did these Asians get so many power armors!”</br>
</br>
“Wait, there are tanks and planes…”</br>
</br>
There was a surprised exclaim from the foreign guests. The people who stood there included chiefs from Africa, people from the East Coast of North America, and even some people from distant Western Europe. Those exclamations did not last long and were soon drowned in even more deafening cheers.</br>
</br>
The black extended limo appeared in the center of the formation.</br>
</br>
The power armors that belonged to the General’s Guard marched on both sides in a neat and organized formation.</br>
</br>
When the window of the car was lowered, the face that no one would be unfamiliar with, appeared in the eyes of everyone for a glimpse.</br>
</br>
The mighty army was immediately taken away from the limelight.</br>
</br>
People frantically waved the flag in their hands, with cheers, applause, whistles… all the voices that could express the excitement in their hearts as they sent the highest respect to His Majesty the General. The reason for NAC’s prosperity today was because of his existence.</br>
</br>
Only he was worthy of this honor.</br>
</br>
Colorful pieces of flakes fell from the sky.</br>
</br>
Inside the extended limo, Jiang Chen waved and smiled at the crowd of excited and happy faces through the open window.</br>
</br>
</br>
Still longing for more, he had to roll down the car window at the end of the square.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The wedding convoy departed from the square in the Sixth Street and escorted by the General Guards, it went through the most crowded streets and headed to the Century Auditorium in city center.</br>
</br>
More than two thousand guests were invited to the wedding, half of whom were senior and important figures of NAC, and the other half were from overseas colonies and other large survivors’ settlements.</br>
</br>
Only the Century Auditorium could accommodate two thousand people to dine at the same time without being crowded…</br>
</br>
It was a bit regretful that no parents were present.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen promised Xia Shiyu that he would hold a special wedding just for her in the modern world to fulfill the wishes of their parents. Except that when it was the time, it would still take some time to explain to Xia Shiyu’s parents why he was still alive…</br>
</br>
The convoy stopped at the entrance of the auditorium. Jiang Chen, who got off the limo, took Sun Jiao’s hand, and together with the girls, they stepped onto the red carpet that extended from the inside of the auditorium to the stairs outside, into the magnificent auditorium.</br>
</br>
The wedding officially commenced.</br>
</br>
The earnest priest stepped forward and asked Jiang Chen in a solemn tone.</br>
</br>
“…Are you willing to love her, comfort her, respect her, and protect her as you love yourself. Whether she is sick or healthy, rich or poor, fulfill your vows until you leave this world?”</br>
</br>
“I do.”</br>
</br>
The moment that sentence was uttered, there was thunderous applause in the auditorium, and the orchestra played the wedding march.</br>
</br>
Under the bell of blessing, Jiang Chen put on rings for his women…</br>
</br>
When the ceremony concluded, the master of ceremonies offered blessings to the newlyweds, wishing Jiang Chen and his wives a happy marriage, a harmonious life, and a healthy family…Finally, amidst applause, the newlyweds walked towards the back of the auditorium and started their honeymoon.</br>
</br>
The wedding ceremony was reaching the end, but the banquet had just started.</br>
</br>
Delicious and grand food filled every round table, and the fragrance of wine lingered around the nose of every guest. Glasses clinked as the guests frequently toasted and bumped into each other and offered blessings to the General, to the great and glorious New Pan-Asia Cooperation, and discussed in excitement whether the child in the Mrs. General’s First Lady belly was a boy or a girl…</br>
</br>
In the lounge behind the auditorium.</br>
</br>
The newlyweds who just finished the ceremony would take a rest here and return to the banquet later.</br>
</br>
Ayesha enjoyed the heartfelt joy at this moment, examined the diamond ring on her hand, and a smile emerged on her face.</br>
</br>
“I feel that we’re connected.”</br>
</br>
Next to her, Yao Yao and Lin Lin sat together at the moment and their faces flushed as they looked at the ring on their finger.</br>
</br>
“Tonight is going to be the night? Hmm, I feel a little nervous… So is Lin Lin, right!”</br>
</br>
“Huh? I, I’m not nervous, it’s not like that we haven’t slept together before.”</br>
</br>
“Well, that was different. It must feel different.”</br>
</br>
On the other side, the corner of Jiang Chen’s mouth curled up when he looked at Sun Jiao in wedding gown.</br>
</br>
“It is said that newlyweds need to have a new home. Do we need to move to a new place?”</br>
</br>
“I don’t want to.” Sun Jiao shook her head.</br>
</br>
“Why?”</br>
</br>
“Because…”</br>
</br>
There was a look of heartfelt happiness on Sun Jiao’s face as she looked at Jiang Chen with joy. She was about to speak, but her sister spoke first. Xiaorou hugged her sister from behind, put her chin against her shoulder, looked at Jiang Chen as she smiled, and said the unfinished words for her sister, “Because don’t you think that place is full of the memories shared between us?”</br>
</br>
Makes sense.</br>
</br>
A knowing smile appeared on Jiang Chen’s face.</br>
</br>
Everything started from there, and it would end there. It couldn’t be better.</br>
</br>
Wait, no.</br>
</br>
It seemed strange to say that?</br>
</br>
After all, there were still hundreds of years, even thousands of years, waiting for him. To use the word end was too far-fetched.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, with them accompanying him, he would not be bored in the future.</br>
</br>
The wedding reached its conclusion, and night gradually died down.</br>
</br>
This night was still very long.</br>
</br>
And Jiang Chen’s happy life had just begun….</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 401: Land Reclamation?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A middle-aged woman in a blue suit stood at the door of the mansion. Her sharp business outfit looked professional. From the label on her briefcase, Jiang Chen could tell she was from Netherland's BMA Construction. They were currently responsible for the infrastructure development and tourist resource development projects on Pannu Island.</br>
</br>
The purpose of her trip, Jiang Chen could guess, was to ask for money.</br>
</br>
This situation was rather embarrassing. Based on the contract, at the completion of every phase, the tender should be transferred to the construction company. But since Jiang Chen hadn't been in the modern world for a while, the payments couldn't be signed off, hence payment was delayed until now.</br>
</br>
When they finally found out Jiang Chen had returned, BMA sent someone out in hopes of resolving the matter of the delayed payment. Since Future Technology was the guarantor, they weren't afraid that Jiang Chen would scam them, but late payments seriously challenged their cash flow.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't make her wait long as he opened the switch to the metal gate and greeted her outside personally.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, the lady did a light bow and introduced herself.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen. I'm Hanna Cavillian, manager of BMA's European division."</br>
</br>
"Please come in." Jiang Chen smiled and welcomed her inside.</br>
</br>
Hanna nodded and came inside.</br>
</br>
Following Jiang Chen to the mansion's door, she occasionally checked her surroundings. Dense subtropical plants bloomed neatly along the sides of the lawn while wide-leaved trees were like mini huts making the entire mansion resemble a castle guarded by trees.</br>
</br>
This was a beautiful mansion, but she felt something was odd.</br>
</br>
"What are you looking for?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Mhmmâ€¦" Hanna gave it a thought and suddenly realized the problem. "Why are there no gardeners working at your mansion?"</br>
</br>
Due to business reasons, she visited the Middle East multiple times. She saw many similar castles there and all had gardeners who tended to the plants throughout the day. Judging by the well-kept lawn, this place certainly looked like it was well-taken care of, but she didn't see any gardeners here.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled. "Meticulous observation, but my mansion doesn't need gardeners."</br>
</br>
As he said this, he waved his hand towards a bush on the side.</br>
</br>
A disc-shaped drone flew out of the bush and hovered beside his hand. From a single glance, the drone itself wasn't a shocking piece of technology, so Jiang Chen didn't bother hiding anything.</br>
</br>
But Hanna widened her eyes in disbelief. Words only came out after a long pause as she exclaimed, "Drone gardening? What a stunning piece of technology. Although we have been following the progress in this field, it's the first time I've seen an actual productâ€¦ Could I ask which company it's from?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand to send the drone back as he joked, "Bill Gates loves to modify his own mansion. Why are you certain a company made this?"</br>
</br>
Hanna laughed.</br>
</br>
"You are a funny person."</br>
</br>
After inviting her inside the mansion, they sat on the sofa as Ayesha poured a cold beverage for both of them.</br>
</br>
In this kind of weather, cold orange juice was the most wonderful refreshment.</br>
</br>
Shelving the small talk, Hanna took out some documents from her briefcase and placed them in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I am here about the Pannu Island tourism area and basic infrastructure development projects. The projects are 50% completed and are expected to be completed by December of this year. Here are the details of the work. Based on our contract, we have already completed two phases - could your party please process the payment for these two phases?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only scanned the document briefly before he said nonchalantly:</br>
</br>
"Of course, please give me the documents."</br>
</br>
Hanna nodded and took out two other documents from her briefcase.</br>
</br>
The two phases totaled 4 billion USD. After he confirmed that the number wasn't amiss or had an extra zero, Jiang Chen signed the paperwork.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen's signature, Hanna's anxious heart finally settled down as she felt relieved.</br>
</br>
To be honest, she was afraid that Future International would delay payment even further. Although under their agreement they agreed to pay by phase, an auditing process still existed. If the tendering side didn't recognize that they completed the projects or dragged out the auditing phase for some time, that could complicate things. It was a gamble to do business internationally. Hanna prepared over one hundred ways of convincing him to pay before she arrived.</br>
</br>
But this scene surprised her as Jiang Chen agreed on the payment without any mishaps as if he didn't just sign over 4 billion USD but merely the cost of a restaurant bill.</br>
</br>
Both parties each retained one copy of the paperwork. Hanna put away her copy into the briefcase in front of her, feeling reassured.</br>
</br>
"I have to admit: before I came, we thought you were avoiding us because you didn't want to pay. I apologize for our rude assumptions."</br>
</br>
Hanna then stood up and bowed to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen laughed it off and made a funny comment, "If someone owed me 4 billion, you bet I would be afraid that he would disappear."</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was the joke that made her laugh or perhaps it was Jiang Chen's broken English, but Hanna chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Also, can I ask something?"</br>
</br>
Since she successfully secured payment for the company, Hanna's mood was obviously pleasant. "Of course."</br>
</br>
"Does BMA have expertise in building artificial islands?"</br>
</br>
A famous quote goes: "God created sea, the Dutch created land." From the 13th century, this country began its massive journey in land reclamation. Over 20% of the Netherland's land was created artificially by filling in the sea. The hills were all dug out and the entire Fribland province was created through reclamation.</br>
</br>
Although Pannu Islands had an expansive sea territory, its land area had always been limited. While it looked like it had a low population density, this was because the total population was twenty thousand. Once immigration policies opened up without affecting tourism resources, Jiang Chen estimated that a maximum of one hundred thousand people could fit in the country. Yet in Hua, any town alone had more than half a million people - one hundred thousand people was clearly not enough.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen always thought that the Netherlands had highly advanced land reclamation technology. Since BMA was a renowned Dutch company, Jiang Chen thought it would be good to ask.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Of course, our company's businesses include land reclamation and shallow artificial island construction." Hanna smiled.</br>
</br>
"If I want to build an artificial island south of Ange Island near the equator, could you estimate the cost?" Jiang Chen asked keenly.</br>
</br>
"South of Ange Island?" Hanna clearly paused for a second as Jiang Chen's question surprised her.</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem?" Noticing Hanna's reaction, Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"If I remember correctly, the sea territory south of Ange Island should be deep water. Normally, artificial islands are mostly created in shallow water or on natural reefs. The amount of sand and soil to create a deep-water artificial island would be astronomical," Hanna explained.</br>
</br>
"Would it be possible to build a floating island? Just like a giant aircraft carrier." Jiang Chen wasn't ready to give up on the idea yet.</br>
</br>
"Floating?" Hanna chuckled and shook her head. "Then wouldn't it float away with the tide?"</br>
</br>
"Then connect the floating island with chains, just like an anchor."</br>
</br>
Hanna shook her head again. "That's not possible. If it is a small island, no chains would be able to withstand the immense force of the sea. Also, even if the material existed, the material to create the island itself would be a problem. It's just like putting a one-square-kilometer steel board on the water - it wouldn't take a year for it to get torn away by the tide. Unless you create this island with titanium... I can't think of any better material."</br>
</br>
Titanium was 42% lighter than steel, but its mechanical strength was two times that of pure iron. From an objective point of view, titanium would be the best choice, but the costâ€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen debated for a moment longer before he let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Okay, looks like I still need to think a bit more."</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry I'm unable to help you on this," Hanna said apologetically.</br>
</br>
Although BMA stated they had no solutions, Jiang Chen didn't give up just yet. If it wasn't possible in the modern world, it might not be as difficult in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
After seeing Hanna out the door, Jiang Chen returned to the gym. His discussion with Xia Shiyu about virtual reality helmets was interrupted halfway; now they could continue.</br>
</br>
But when he went inside, he saw Xia Shiyu lying on the recliner with the helmet on.</br>
</br>
Seeing her like this, Jiang Chen didn't wake her up. Instead, he closed the door gently.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you use this opportunity to do something?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha came from behind and hugged him.</br>
</br>
"I'm not a pervert." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
All five senses were blocked when the virtual reality helmet was active. Unless the user's environment exhibited high temperatures or other obvious changes, the safety protocol wouldn't be triggered. This was the reason why the helmet had to be worn in a private space - it was easy to be assaulted wearing the helmet in public.</br>
</br>
</br>
"That's not what I told Xia Shiyu." A faint smile appeared on Ayesha's face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's heart paused a beat then he turned his head. He picked Ayesha up and slung her over his shoulder as Ayesha gave a light shout.</br>
</br>
"Oh? You're becoming more naughty... you dare to trick me?" Jiang Chen "fiercely" slapped her butt as it made a loud sound.</br>
</br>
"Awwwwh~"</br>
</br>
She began to kick her legs in the air. While rubbing against his firm shoulder, Ayesha let out a faint moan. She turned around and looked at Jiang Chen innocently. "I... I only wanted to help the both of you."</br>
</br>
Because of her movements on his shoulder, a cool sensation constantly brushed on the side of Jiang Chen's face which tickled his mind as well.</br>
</br>
"Oh? How were you going to help?" Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
"I told her thatâ€¦ Tonight, I'll leave you to her," Ayesha said, frightened, as her eyes drifted to the gym back and forth, afraid that Xia Shiyu would wake up and see her in a difficult position.</br>
</br>
Although it wasn't like she couldn't escape Jiang Chen's hold, she never imagined resisting him...</br>
</br>
When he heard Ayesha's words, Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
[You weren't helping - you only made the situation worse.]</br>
</br>
"Could you put me down? You can do this when no one is aroundâ€¦" Ayesha pleaded in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"No, I plan to punish you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a wickedness to him and ignored her pleas as he carried Ayesha to the gym.</br>
</br>
Since people must learn by example, he would punish the "student" in front of other people. At least for the next while, Xia Shiyu shouldn't wake up.</br>
</br>
This was exhilarating.</br>
</br>
Where did the skipping rope go? He never used it before and now he had to go find it.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The world seemed to be aliveâ€¦</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of Xia Yu's personality, she chose to be a magician known for her preciseness. But after registering the account, she didn't immediately start a mission or explore the wild, but rather, she began to tour the city as a "visitor."</br>
</br>
Other than the NPC who seemed to be alive, what impressed Xia Shiyu the most was that, in this world, she could see the world clearly without glasses.</br>
</br>
It made sense since the images didn't need to pass through her cornea.</br>
</br>
Therefore, even for the disabled, they could live in the virtual world like normal people... Staring at the leaves and branches swaying in the air and breathing in the fragrance of the flowers, Xia Shiyu sighed.</br>
</br>
Seeing as it was getting late, she moved her finger in the air and chose the exit button.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took off her helmet as she sluggishly stretched her body and sat up. She felt refreshed and energized like she just took a great nap.</br>
</br>
But then she sniffed her nose and raised her eyebrows slightly.</br>
</br>
There was an odd smell in the air, but she couldn't distinguish what it was. It just made her heart beat faster.</br>
</br>
"Illusion?" She muttered as she put the helmet away and walked outside.</br>
</br>
In the hallway, she happened to bump into Ayesha with an air freshener in her hand.</br>
</br>
The girl's face suddenly turned red and she hid the air freshener behind her back. Ayesha didn't say a single word as she briskly walked by with her head buried.</br>
</br>
[Strange.]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu turned her head slightly but immediately shook her head and pushed her confusion to the back of her head.</br>
</br>
[It's fine, I still have things to discuss with Jiang Chenâ€¦]</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 403: Safety Concern</br>
</div></br>
The mansion was spacious. It took Xia Shiyu a while before she found Jiang Chen reading books in the office at the end of the second-floor hallway.</br>
</br>
He was reading &lt;Society and Economy&gt; which surprised Xia Shiyu. "You read books now?"</br>
</br>
"No other choice. At this position, even if I don't want to, I have to learn," Jiang Chen said, unfazed.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's "hardworking" attitude, Xia Shiyu nodded in praise. Although he didn't expect him to contribute greatly to the company's operation, it was never bad for the president to know more about the economy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put aside the book that he had yet to flip through the first page as he asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"What's up?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded, pulled up a chair from the side, and sat down across from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"It's about the virtual reality helmet."</br>
</br>
"Technical aspect?"</br>
</br>
"No, about the operation, somewhat related to the technical." Xia Shiyu paused, arranged her thoughts, and continued, "With Future 1.0's channel, it is easy for users to learn about our product. But I have to confirm two points. First, how likely is it for someone to make a knockoff?"</br>
</br>
"Zero percent chance, at least not possible within the next ten years." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Any attempt to disassemble the helmet would trigger the circuit to self-destruct, the internal structure of the helmet was a black box to the owner. Even without the protection mechanism, it was still challenging to mimic. The chip and circuit board in the helmet were produced by graphene material, and the graphene material's research in the modern world was only in the initial stage.</br>
</br>
Ten years was a conservative estimate. Once Future Technology dominates the market, the market's desire to research the technology would cooldown. Needless to say, the major VR equipment manufacturers would all go bankrupt. To be able to develop the virtual reality technology, the modern world would only take more time compared to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was pleased with the number ten. She nodded.</br>
</br>
"Two, the server's ability to handle the load. With the quality of the game, if I have guessed correctly, it would take an astronomical amount of computation power. With the server's ability, how many concurrent users could we handle online?"</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about this. Our server resources are more than sufficient." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
While it was a civilian model, it was a quantum computer. Nonetheless, it was more than sufficient enough to run a fantasy MMORPG without the need to replicate physics. Let alone 3.2 billion netizens, it could easily support the entire world's population.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was skeptical with what Jiang Chen said, but she still nodded.</br>
</br>
"After confirming the above two points, I can start writing up the marketing plan. Mhmm, also, have you considered another point."</br>
</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"Security concerns," Xia Shiyu said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the introduction of new technology would draw the attention of all parties. There was a lot of companies that bet big on virtual reality technology, Google, Microsoft, and even a social media platform like Facebook invested 2 billion in purchasing Oculus.</br>
</br>
With the bets on the table, the sudden emergence of Future Technology would suddenly sweep the table. Just like with Xbox, who played the SUBOR?</br>
</br>
Therefore, in the foreseeable future, the companies that were among the heavy favorites a few years ago would experience a series of rapid downturns. The hot spot would be forced to switch from virtual reality equipment to virtual reality applications.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the frontrunner that led the technological shift would receive the hostility from the potential beneficiaries.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen clearly understood what Xia Shiyu meant, but to the potential danger, he only laughed.</br>
</br>
"Now, do you think it is necessary for me to invest on this island?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a moment to process.</br>
</br>
"Could it beâ€¦"</br>
</br>
"That's right, this island is my backyard. Here, my army will protect my interests and rights."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was obviously thrown off again.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, she spoke again, "Soâ€¦ the shareholder behind Celestial Trade is actually you?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." The tip of Jiang Chen's lips curled up.</br>
</br>
Xia Shibu rubbed her forehead as she said bewilderedly, "So, the overseas organization you said is factitious right?"</br>
</br>
"Not exactly, but it works for me, not I work for it."</br>
</br>
She finally digested the massive amount of information in her head, she sighed.</br>
</br>
"â€¦Okay. In this case, security is not a big concern then."</br>
</br>
Although she still had a lot of questions, Xia Shiyu chose to bury them in her head for now. She trusted that Jiang Chen would tell her one day, just like what he told her today.</br>
</br>
At night, Xia Shiyu would obvious not go to Jiang Chen's room. But she used the excuse of the room is too big and moved to Ayesha's room. To Xia Shiyu's request, Ayesha didn't reject because she wanted to improve her relationship with her "future sister."</br>
</br>
But it made it hard on Jiang Chen. Before Xia Shiyu leaves, he could only eat discreetlyâ€¦</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Over the next few days, Xia Shiyu spent her time in the mansion and worked remotely on her laptop. She was creating a marketing plan for &lt;Godly Land&gt; based on Jiang Chen's recommendation while controlling the day-to-day operations of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen was impressed by her ability to multitask, he was afraid that she couldn't handle the workload.</br>
</br>
While Xia Shiyu was busy between things, Jiang Chen didn't sit around. He spent the days on boats between New Moon, Coro, and Ange Island.</br>
</br>
The construction of the New Moon Island military base was basically complete with five hundred soldiers serving. Most of them were soldiers recruited locally at Pannu with some soldiers from Niger.</br>
</br>
To alleviate the problem of a lack of soldiers, the manager Barkary posted a hiring post on a social media site for Celestial's security position. A monthly salary of 4000 USD a month plus a 150 square meters house after retirement. The academic requirement was only a high school diploma. With such favorable benefits, Celestial received a high number of applicants from developing countries. After the selection process, Barkary chose 1000 people out of the over ten thousand applicants.</br>
</br>
A lot of them were retired soldiers with Han making up the majority. After they arrived on the plane, Ivan didn't immediately station them in New Moon but placed them at the military base on Coro Island for three months of training.</br>
</br>
Once their ability and loyalty were confirmed, they will be joining New Moon Island as an official member of Celestial.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 404: Buy, Buy, Buy</br>
</div></br>
</br>
What did Jiang Chen do in the past few days?</br>
</br>
To summarize it in two words, spend money.</br>
</br>
With a unit of billions.</br>
</br>
The military base on New Moon Island has a 2300 meters long double runway airport, a radar station as well as a platform connected via a dam the size of two football fields. After he paid for the construction, Jiang Chen lost another 1.4 billion on his account. Including the 4 billion he spent a few days ago, he used 5.4 billion in three short days.</br>
</br>
And that was not all.</br>
</br>
To prepare for the extraction of molybdenum, Jiang Chen infused 1 billion to Future Mining, through a tender, he planned to build two semi-submersible offshore platforms south of Ange Island.</br>
</br>
The semi-submersible offshore platform will mostly be used in the deep sea with its primary application in oil and gas extraction. Its principle was similar to a submarine with the platform built on a giant floating device. The device would submerge below the water and connect to the seabed through tubes. A balancing device similar to the weight on a fishing rod will be installed below the floatation device which would allow the platform to maintain its balance through the tides and storms.</br>
</br>
The benefit of the offshore platform was that it was moveable. Once the mining deposition on the seabed has been completely exhausted, it could be transported away by a transport vessel. Jiang Chen planned to station two soldiers and three workers on the offshore platform and control the underwater mining device through electronic components. A boat would visit every week to bring the necessities and haul away the molybdenum ore rich with manganese nodules.</br>
</br>
Although the mining robot technology was still under development, Jiang Chen believes that it won't take long before results come from camp 27. Before that, it was not a bad choice to first build the offshore platform.</br>
</br>
These mined manganese nodules will be pulled to Ange Island because, in addition to the rich molybdenum oxide, more than 50% of the structure was composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide. To treat these manganese nodules, Jiang Chen had injected two hundred million more USD in Future Mining and built a manganese nodule treatment plant, a molybdenum ore refinery, as well as a steel plant and an aluminum plant.</br>
</br>
The manganese nodule treatment plant would first crush the ore, complete the initial sorting and output the manganese and rich molybdenum slag. The slag will be sent to the molybdenum refinery for secondary processing and the manufacturing of the molybdenum ore required for the virtual reality helmet.</br>
</br>
The steel plant and aluminum plant were used to process the iron and aluminum ores purchased from BHP while also treating the residues of the manganese nodules.</br>
</br>
The complete production line was expected to be completed in three months. By that time, the first step of Ange Island's industrial transformation would be complete. The rich mining resources would not only satisfy the demand on the island, but it could also be exported for profit!</br>
</br>
</br>
Once he finished taking care of Future Mining, Jiang Chen began to work on the headquarter of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Coro Island was chosen as the location of the headquarter to ensure the safety of the quantum computer. Jiang Chen spent one hundred million USD to build the headquarter with no consideration of its cost to ensure that the building was strong enough.</br>
</br>
Also, Jiang Chen decided to place the virtual reality helmet in the modern world. Since billions of virtual reality helmets would need to be produced, he would never be able to transport all of them back. Especially if he had to transport food, steel, and firearms back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Since he made the decision to produce in the modern world, then he must be cautious with security and the privacy of the production of these virtual reality helmets.</br>
</br>
But to this point, Jiang Chen had already planned ahead. The platform he built near New Moon Island was perfect for producing the virtual reality helmet!</br>
</br>
No place was more secure than right beside the military base. Under the surveillance of the wide range life signal detector, no agents would be able to escape the eyes of the workers in the radar station. Once they discovered any unregistered personnel, the drones would either capture or evict them. To the people resisting arrest, the drone would initiate its attack program to eliminate the threat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen decided that the production of the virtual reality helmet should be done automatically. Other than the input of raw resources and the export of finished products requiring some human involvement, the production process that must be kept a secret has to be done in a "black box." Although the cost to the autonomous production line would be high, it was necessary for privacy purposes.</br>
</br>
The design of the plant was based on Lu Huasheng's blueprint and built by modern world construction companies. There were a total of three buildings, and each occupied a corner of the triangle shaped platform. The cost totaled two million, which was negligible compared to the mega projects.</br>
</br>
After a buying spree, Jiang Chen used 6.7 billion of the 30 billion loan. But he didn't feel pained at all because he knew that he would make the money back in no time.</br>
</br>
Putting spending money aside, Jiang Chen certainly made a lot of money too.</br>
</br>
Tao Ming didn't disappoint him as he signed a total of four hundred thousand boxes from Future Biology. With an estimated profit of 500 USD per box, the total profit was 200 million USD.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the agent of Emma Watson quickly agreed to the sponsorship agreement and immediately arranged Emma to head to Coro Island for the filming of a commercial and advertisement design. The reason why they agreed without hesitation was partially due to the one million USD sponsorship and partially because of the opportunity to distribute advertisement through Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
The insane number of users for Future 1.0 meant that not a lot of people would reject the opportunity to put their face on there.</br>
</br>
Since the sales were successful, production could not stagger behind.</br>
</br>
To increase the production of nutrient supply, Jiang Chen made a few trips to the apocalypse and brought back five newly built organic converters, as well as 10 tons of inducers to expand the plantation area of DH seaweed.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the nutrient supply plant workers began a nightmare of overtime schedules. To finish the production task, the technicians responsible for inducing the DH seaweed even slept on the ground of the lab. The plantation boat on the sea worked rotating shifts. The workers from the three shifts poured the DH seaweed down, fertilizing the sea farm, and cutting the newly grown seaweedâ€¦</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen was generous with the overtime bonuses. Compared to the 200 million, overtime bonuses were nothing.</br>
</br>
To prevent the workers from working excessively, Jiang Chen ordered Zhan Shujie to hire 60 additional workers to fill the void in labor. To Zhan Shujie and Tao Ming's outstanding contributions to Future Biology, Jiang Chen gave them a generous bonus.</br>
</br>
A dividend of 1% per person as their annual bonus. While they were both ecstatic, they worked even harder.</br>
</br>
Everyone could see the future of Future Biology. Even a dividend of 1%, with the current growth trend, they could at least take in more than ten million USD at the end of the year.</br>
</br>
In his half month, Jiang Chen finally felt what it was like to be busy. He wanted to split himself in half so that one half could be on Ange Island, while the other stationed between New Moon and Coro.</br>
</br>
But after a busy half month, everything was finally on the right track.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought he could take some time off, a new problem quickly emerged.</br>
</br>
Without including the independent Celestial, Future International's employee number in Xin reached 400. While it was a small number on paper, Xin had a total of 20,000, to begin with; the working population barely reached 10,000.</br>
</br>
Fishing boats could rarely be spotted on Xin's sea territory, people were demanded everywhere. Basic infrastructure development boosted the local employment rate. What used to be an island with the highest unemployment rate, Ange Island, now lacked a workforce.</br>
</br>
Especially once the tourism resources were completed, there would be a more significant gap in the labor force. Jiang Chen estimated that once the projects are completed, his employees would at least increase by 2000, and at least create an additional 5000 positions in supporting industries!</br>
</br>
Xin didn't have that many people looking for work.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen set his eyes on a superpower currently experiencing an immigration wave.</br>
</br>
But he was not looking at the rich who did everything they could to leave, but the labor force with an academic background higher than high school.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
No.1 Wanghai High School.</br>
</br>
A young-looking math teacher with glasses was packing away his stuff in the office. Three days ago, he handed in his resignation letter. Today, the principal finally agreed.</br>
</br>
"Guangpin, you're really not going to work here anymore?" The director stood beside him as he said reluctantly.</br>
</br>
Li Guangpin was a teacher they hired three years ago. Although he was just an undergraduate student at that time, he demonstrated excellent teaching ability. With the philosophy that math can be fun, he employed a humorous but rigorous teaching style. Not only did he manage to increase a class with mediocre math scores to the best class today, but he also gained the respect and love of all the students in the class.</br>
</br>
This type of teacher, not a single person would be willing to let him go. And because of that, the principal dragged out his resignation for three days before seeing that he had made up his mind and finally signed the letter without any other choice.</br>
</br>
"Director Wang, you don't need to try and convince me anymore." Li Guangpin smiled and stuffed a pen a student gifted him into his bag.</br>
</br>
Director Wang let out a sigh. "Okay, I'll stop trying to convince you."</br>
</br>
Perhaps upset by the fact that a school executive personally tried to persuade him, a teacher correcting homework in a low voice said bitterly.</br>
</br>
"Private high schools have better benefits, how could the small No.1 High School hold your glorious presence."</br>
</br>
The voice was not too high, but not too low.</br>
</br>
Director Wang's expression didn't look good, but he didn't say anything as he just pretended he didn't hear anything. Private schools acquiring talents from public schools had been giving the school executives headaches, but they could do nothing about it. Since "People walked up, water flowed down," talent could not just be retained by culture. Private school's salary and bonus structure are much better than public schools. It may be more tiring but was undoubtedly more attractive to young teachers with ambition and ability.</br>
</br>
When he heard his coworker's words, Li Guangpin paused for a second, but he didn't mind and only smiled.</br>
</br>
Although Wu Jiefeng had some conflicts with him in terms of awards, since they were no longer people from the same world, he didn't let it bother him.</br>
</br>
"I'm not going to a private school, I'm going to teach overseas."</br>
</br>
"Overseas?" Director Wang was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, a few high schools in Xin posted positions, and I happened to pass the interview. They wanted me to come as soon as possible." Although he used a casual voice, from the smile on his face, however, he was proud.</br>
</br>
When they heard Li Guangpin's words, the teachers who were working on their own things began to chat amongst themselves.</br>
</br>
"I saw the posting too. It is through a video conference with a salary of 4000 USD a month!" A male teacher whispered.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Really?" A female teacher said, shocked.</br>
</br>
4000 USD was 24000 RMB in salary, and it was just a starting level salary! To the average teacher at a public school, it was an astronomical number!</br>
</br>
"It shouldn't be fake, Xin government is doing the hiring. They wanted to solve the lack of talent in their schools and hospitals, so they are offering a competitive package to oversea teachers and doctors. The news even went on Future 1.0's headline.</br>
</br>
"Xin is this rich? Weren't they in a war before?" A Han teacher was skeptical.</br>
</br>
"That was half a year ago. With the new government, they introduced a series of stimulating economic measures. They want to build Pannu Islands into the Hawaii of the west Pacific!" A slim male teacher said very vocally.</br>
</br>
He was the type that enjoyed reading the news. Seeing how uninformed his coworkers were, he began to sell what he knew.</br>
</br>
"Also, Xin introduced a labor immigration policy. Anyone with a work visa could apply for Xin nationality once they have worked two full years in Xin."</br>
</br>
"Old Li, once you get the green card, when we go visit you, you can't pretend not to know us." A teacher that had a good relationship with Li Guangpin joked.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Haha, once I settle down, I will invite you all over."</br>
</br>
Li Guangpin said goodbye to his colleagues.</br>
</br>
Only one person in the entire office was gloomy; head uncomfortably buried, and eyes filled with jealousy. Wu Jiefeng would not tell other people that he saw the job and applied. But unfortunately, he was eliminated in the first round.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Similar scenes happened all over Xin.</br>
</br>
It all originated from an immigration promotion video on Youtube. The entire video had three central ideas. The place was stunning, filled with work opportunities, and just waiting for you to go!</br>
</br>
Then, the video was reposted by Future 1.0 news channel and hence spread across the country. This began a frenzied amount of reposting and comments. Compared with the lack of response in UA and Europe, the citizens of Hua had a favorable impression of Xin.</br>
</br>
As to why?</br>
</br>
It was because of the cultural similarity.</br>
</br>
The only other country in the world that used Han as its official language. The Han society obviously felt close to Xin. People may fear the culture difference from immigrating to the UA or Europe, but it would not happen in Xin.</br>
</br>
Especially when the place was filled with job opportunities, beautiful sceneries, a loose political structure, the desire to immigrant was even stronger. Another important thing was, the cost to immigrate to Xin was low.</br>
</br>
Without the need for a lot of money, people could immigrate without money!</br>
</br>
Two types of immigration policy were open; investing immigration or labor immigration.</br>
</br>
Investing immigration had a policy of possessing property over one million or providing at least ten work positions in Xin. They would only need to submit proof to the Bureau of Immigration before they could directly obtain Xin nationality.</br>
</br>
The labor immigration was even more accessible. Xin needed a tremendous workforce with an education background greater than high school. Any of the foreigners with a proof of work could immediately obtain a work visa. As long as they work over two years in Xin, they would obtain permanent resident status while enjoying the same social benefits as citizens. Work for five years, and they could obtain Xin nationality.</br>
</br>
For companies looking to hire enough people, Xin even pushed a special policy. Any of the companies requiring labor could post its hiring needs on Xin's minister of foreign affair website to ease the process.</br>
</br>
In the country where everything was in its infancy, anyone could find a position that belonged to them. Han's curiosity and longing for Xin were just like European's longing for America in the 18th century.</br>
</br>
The day the immigration policy was made available, Xin's embassies received a total of 4410 immigration applicants with two-thirds coming from Hua. It wouldn't take long before the lack of a labor force that's disturbing the growth of Xin would be solved by the gradually heated immigration wave!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 406: The Relaxing Time on the Beach</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It has been over half a month since Xia Shiyu arrived at Coro Island. She had spent a relaxing time there, but it made life tough on Jiang Chen. Because the two girls slept together, Jiang Chen basically had no intimate time with Ayesha.</br>
</br>
The only thing that made it worthwhile was that Ayesha and Xian Shiyu's relationship got a lot closer. Perhaps because they slept on the same bed, the faint hostility Xia Shiyu had toward Ayesha faded after a half month of meshing together.</br>
</br>
All in all, the three people lived harmoniously together. Xia Shiyu spent the day working at home, Jiang Chen stayed out among islands, and Ayesha would sometimes drive for Jiang Chen, occasionally visit Jiang Chen's parents and do the chores in the mansion from time to time.</br>
</br>
The busiest half month passed by. Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu both had free time. To treat himself for his hard work, Jiang Chen proposed a vacation on his private island.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's proposal, Xia Shiyu only hesitated for a moment before she agreed. After such high-stress work, the rare trip to the beautiful southern island would be a waste if not enjoyed now. Since she lived most of her life among the noise of the city, the proposal was indeed attractive to her.</br>
</br>
As to Ayesha, she never had any opinions on Jiang Chen's proposals. She was timider than a small lamb.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the two days' vacation had been agreed on.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Other than the nine islands, hundreds of deserted islands also spanned across Pannu Islands. Some of them looked only as big as a house with a single wave capable of flooding the entire island. Some of them were as big as New Moon Island, only uninhibited due to the lack of access to fresh water.</br>
</br>
This inhibited island was 170 nautical miles to the east of Coro Island, one of the islands was sold to Jiang Chen from Xin government. The island was one square kilometer big with dense vegetation in the middle of the island and was surrounded by beaches on all sides. Other than the wooden cabin on the beach, there was no other facility on the island.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen intended to retain the original scenery of the island.</br>
</br>
"You certainly know how to enjoy life," Xia Shiyu exclaimed.</br>
</br>
She lied soothingly on the recliner. Staring at the waves mixed with white bubbles and feeling the saline sea wind that swayed her hairs, she sucked on the cold orange juice. It was like living in heaven.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu felt all her weariness leave her body. Her mood couldn't have been better.</br>
</br>
"I'll take that as a compliment. But to be honest, this is my first time on the island too," leaning on the chair with his arms under his head, Jiang Chen said sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"Oh really?" Xia Shiyu turned her head.</br>
</br>
The sea blue two-piece swimsuit fitted perfectly on her figure of perfection. Although she didn't intentionally show off her body, her gorgeous face was revealed without anything obstructing it. The water droplets left on her body after playing among the waves sparkled on her smooth leg, just like a lotus after the morning dew.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at." Sensing Jiang Chen's gaze, Xia Shiyu felt her face burn. She put on a straight face and said with some harshness to hide the panic in her heart.</br>
</br>
Under the sunlight that made people lazy, Jiang Chen answered without processing it in his head.</br>
</br>
"A hot girl."</br>
</br>
"â€¦" Xia Shiyu bit her lower lip and turned around to hide her burning red face.</br>
</br>
Looking at the door, Ayesha had a smile on her face.</br>
</br>
Their progress was far better than she had expectedâ€¦</br>
</br>
The sun began to slide down the east coast. Under the ray of the dusk, Jiang Chen began to set up the BBQ on the beach, took out the ingredients and beer that was chilled on the boat, and began to prepare for a bonfire party.</br>
</br>
As he chugged the cold beer while biting on the crispy and golden skewers, Jiang Chen was thrilled by the experience. On the contrary, Xia Shiyu was more reserved as she ate the skewers bite by bite, enjoying the delicacy.</br>
</br>
As to Ayesha, compared to eating, she seemed to enjoy being eatenâ€¦ Mhmm, that sounded weird. Correction, she enjoyed watching the happiness that flowed out of Jiang Chen and his praises when he ate her work.</br>
</br>
After a nice dinner, they cleaned up the garbage, and the three fooled around on the beach for a while before they lied back down.</br>
</br>
Peace returned to the beach.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen stared at the sun slowly descending, Jiang Chen abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"Are you leaving the day after tomorrow?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was silent and then nodded.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I have been away for a while, I have to be there for a lot of things."</br>
</br>
"It's been hard on you." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"Not at all." Xia Shiyu shook her head and watched the same dusk. "Although tiring, not hard."</br>
</br>
To be able to prove her worth was something she dreamed of doing, why would she think it is hard? Or rather, it was an exhilarating experience to be able to witness the growth of an internet empire in her own hands.</br>
</br>
The dusk glided a golden edge on her face. The faint smile on her face made Jiang Chen hold his breath.</br>
</br>
It was not her stunning beauty, but something even brighter.</br>
</br>
But then, Ayesha suddenly stood in front of Jiang Chen and put him behind her.</br>
</br>
"What's going on?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Helicopter.' Ayesha's eyes narrowed as she gazed at the sky. Her eyes became alert and flickered with cautiousness.</br>
</br>
Following Ayesha's sight, he also discovered the black dot that surfaced in the distance.</br>
</br>
Not long after, the edges of the helicopter become more and more clear.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows at the miniature helicopter. He didn't remember buying this model. He became more alert and prepared to take out his weapons from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
But when he saw the person at the side hatch, his loosened up, sighed, and sat back down.</br>
</br>
"By the looks of it, the higher being doesn't want me to have a good vacation."</br>
</br>
As he muttered, he drank the last drops of his orange juice.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Frankberg, the library of the University of Ber.</br>
</br>
The dusk had long been gone, but the library was still bright from inside out.</br>
</br>
A teen with a relatively attractive face sat at the corner of the library and concentrated on the laptop in front of him with his fingers typing furiously on the keyboard. Other than the laptop computer, a couple of German computer textbooks laid on his table along with a cup of black coffee.</br>
</br>
When he pressed the last button, Xie Lei let out some of the air in his chest and sunk into the chair.</br>
</br>
It has been half a month. The opponent hid carefully, and their skills were impressive, but they finally exposed some information. After breaking through a series of firewalls, Xie Lei finally managed to capture the real IP masked behind layers of fake IPs.</br>
</br>
The IP was located in Poland.</br>
</br>
After Xie Lei captured the real IP, he didn't alert the opponent. Instead, he used the opportunity when the opponent relayed information back to send the Trojan program to their computer. The Trojan program would not do any harm to the computer, it would only package some of the documents in the computer discreetly and discreetly transfer the information back to his computer.</br>
</br>
Watching the progress bar on the screen, an egotistical look appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Let me see who you are."</br>
</br>
As Xie Lei muttered, he reached for the coffee on the table.</br>
</br>
But when his finger touched the cup, a couldn't be helped expression surfaced.</br>
</br>
The coffee was cold.</br>
</br>
He looked up at the clock on the wall, he mumbled.</br>
</br>
"Already 8?"</br>
</br>
He'll just do the rest at homeâ€¦</br>
</br>
He was a bit hungry. Seeing that the progress bar was complete, he stood up, put the laptop on his back, and headed out.</br>
</br>
But just when Xie Lei went downstairs, he caught a glimpse of two black vehicles parked outside.</br>
</br>
Four men in black suits and shades walked out and headed to the front door of the library.</br>
</br>
"Did the library do some donation program again? But it's already so late." Xie Lei mumbled to himself and didn't mind these people.</br>
</br>
When he passed by the men in black, however, he felt a chill run down his spine.</br>
</br>
It was as if a venomous snake was staring at him.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the feeling faded away in a glimpse.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because he looked too young, the sight of the men in black stopped for a second before they left as they began to scan in the library.</br>
</br>
But just in that one glimpse, Xie Lei felt his entire back was drenched in cold sweat.</br>
</br>
[Dammit, what kind of people did that guy mess with?]</br>
</br>
Xie Lei left the library and cursed in his mind. Instincts told him that the men in black were definitely not friendly individuals. They were probably looking for him!</br>
</br>
IP location was reversibly trackable, and he didn't have a clue! With how fast they responded, they had been monitoring him for a while.</br>
</br>
If he stayed in the library, the consequence would be unimaginable.</br>
</br>
Also, he was lucky that he used the library's wifiâ€¦</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The helicopter with a name he didn't know hovered above the beach. A rope was thrown down. A hot blonde lady in a white tank top and short shorts agilely hopped down.</br>
</br>
Without any equipment, only Russians could do such risky things.</br>
</br>
Natasha.</br>
</br>
Since the last time Jiang Chen saw her at the hotel in Xiangjiang, he hasn't seen her for half a year.</br>
</br>
When both of her feet touched the ground, she signaled the helicopter pilot before walking to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The helicopter turned around and Jiang Chen focused on the Russian girl walking in his direction.</br>
</br>
Natasha stood in front of Jiang Chen and ignored Ayesha's cold expression as she raised her chin.</br>
</br>
"You still owe me a shot of Vodka."</br>
</br>
"When did the audacious Russian get so pesky?' Jiang Chen said as he sat up from the recliner.</br>
</br>
"Sniff-, I smell BBQ and beer. Unfortunately, looks like I'm late to the partyâ€¦ Don't look at me like that; I'm not hostile." With Ayesha's cautious look, Natasha put up both of her hands, but her tone was flirtatious.</br>
</br>
"Who is she?" Xia Shiyu frowned and whispered to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"A KGB agent, or should I call them the Russian Federation Security Bureau? Anyways, both are not wrong," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu heard the word agent, she instinctively felt fear since she was captured by the CIB before. She could still not let go of the fearful memory. But when she saw Ayesha, her tense heart became calm again.</br>
</br>
To the anxiousness on the beautiful Han girl's face, Natasha only scanned it before moving away.</br>
</br>
Then, she stared straight at Jiang Chen and smiled.</br>
</br>
"We haven't seen each other for a while, why such a cold expression, are Han men this heartless?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glared at her, "Your Han is improving, but I have to say, your choice of words could be better."</br>
</br>
The tip of Natasha's mouth curled up as he walked up to him. But Ayesha didn't have any intention of moving away as she just stood there.</br>
</br>
Although the small B was not convincing enough for the "massiveness," the emotionless expression added another vibe no less than Natasha's.</br>
</br>
'Hello, I'm a security personnel responsible for the safety of the embassy, are you trying to start a diplomatic conflict?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha's expression didn't make Natasha unhappy at all. She pointed at her gun multiple times, now that she finally was without a gun. The Russian girl grinned and looked down at her with aggressiveness.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha." Jiang Chen coughed.</br>
</br>
When Ayesha heard Jiang Chen's reminder, although she still didn't want to back down, she stood silently to the side.</br>
</br>
With a pause, Jiang Chen asked Natasha, "The security personnel of the embassy? Could you explain?"</br>
</br>
"Xin and Russia officially established a diplomatic relationship. I'm here along with the Russian ambassador. I got off the plane at noon. When I heard you were here, I immediately came with the helicopter." Natasha walked beside the recliner and sat beside Jiang Chen's leg.</br>
</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyebrows jumped at the scene as she had a bad feeling. Ayesha only silently stared at the back of her head. Although she didn't mind how many women her husband had, to the woman who clearly had other intentions, she didn't want them to get close at all.</br>
</br>
"Does KGB know that I'm the shareholder of Celestial Trade?" Jiang Chen asked while he discreetly moved his leg away to avoid the flirtatious curve.</br>
</br>
[Sending out a KGB agent as the bodyguard for diplomats, the Russians are quite interesting.]</br>
</br>
"Is this a secret? You didn't intentionally hide it." Natasha grinned.</br>
</br>
"Then your intention is?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Would you believe I'm here just to visit you?" Natasha's said while raising the massiveness that would even make Liu Yao envious.</br>
</br>
[36D, 36E? It looks like I underestimated her before.] Jiang Chen said shockingly in his mind.</br>
</br>
It was not that the massiveness did not tempt him, but he knew better than to touch the rose with thorns. Perhaps after they hooked up, she would have sold him already.</br>
</br>
"Our diplomat discussed an arms sale with president Zhang, but he told us to discuss it with you." Natasha leaned on the side of the chair as her body moved towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The deep trenchesâ€¦</br>
</br>
"Arms? If it is AK or something like that, then it's okay," Jiang Chen gulped while he said courteously.</br>
</br>
"Tank, fighter jet, artillery, we sell everything." Natasha glanced at Jiang Chen's beach shorts as she the tip of her mouth dubiously curved up.</br>
</br>
The eyes seemed to be saying, [You are saying no, but your body is more honest.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the teasing look as he rebuked, "You sell everything? Do you sell people?"</br>
</br>
Natasha was clearly not agitated by Jiang Chen's words. Instead, she flirted back, "If you want, we can have a deep discussion about it."</br>
</br>
"Ahem." Xia Shiyu coughed loudly.</br>
</br>
Natasha turned around as she seemed to have understood something, she looked dubiously at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You certainly have the joy than most men desire."</br>
</br>
"Don't say random stuff." Jiang Chen was out of sorts.</br>
</br>
Natasha then abruptly said, "Also, just a reminder, you are being monitored."</br>
</br>
'Monitored? By who?" Jiang Chen paused, suddenly alerted.</br>
</br>
Natasha stood up.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to welcome me to your party?"</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what Natasha had planned, but he agreed to her staying in the wooden beach cabin. While the cabin looked primal from the outside, all the necessary amenities were available.</br>
</br>
Guest room, bathroom, even a spa; a range of equipment only available in five-star hotels.</br>
</br>
But the most fun thing on the island was the hot spring. As long as a hole was dug on the beach, once a wave passed through, a hot spring mixed with sand would form. It looked muddy, but it was filled with unpolluted natural minerals. Great for the skin.</br>
</br>
The hot spring on the beach was across from the cabin and because Xia Shiyu wanted to try it, Ayesha accompanied her. Not confident with leaving Natasha with Jiang Chen, the two girls "kidnapped" her along. Jiang Chen wanted to go too, but they had to be naked. With how stern Xia Shiyu's face was, Jiang Chen stayed in the cabin.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was in the spa ready to drift off to sleep, the phone on the table began to ring.</br>
</br>
He picked up the phone. It was an international number.</br>
</br>
Caller: Xie Lei.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"I confirmed the opponent's identity," Xie Lei said in short breaths.</br>
</br>
"Are you okay?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"I'm fine, but they almost saw my face." Xie Lei looked back on the street, still feeling anxious.</br>
</br>
He was in a public phone booth and cautiously scanning the street.</br>
</br>
"Keep it simple," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei took a deep breath as he said briskly, 'I obtained a filed named V from their database, but the file inside was encrypted, and the encryption method was the most outdated one, I could not crack it without the password. Also, the opponent detected my presence and almost just blocked me in the library."</br>
</br>
"Where is the file?"</br>
</br>
Xie Lei adjusted his breathing, "I sent it to a safe email at the net cafÃ©, and I'll tell you the account and password now."</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed a few buttons on the phone and opened the notepad function.</br>
</br>
Once Xie Lei finished the last letter, Jiang Chen saved the information.</br>
</br>
"Be safe."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Xie Lei nodded.</br>
</br>
"If it is not safe, just stop. Your sister is there after all."</br>
</br>
He knew how restrained it felt when his family was being threatened.</br>
</br>
"Thank you!" Xie Lei said sincerely.</br>
</br>
His sister was his concern. He at least received three months of military training in Nigeria and could easily run when discovered, but it would be a different scenario if he had to bring his hospitalized sister along.</br>
</br>
The game of cat and mouse should end soon.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 408: Arms Sale and Conditions</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When the three ladies returned, it was almost nine o'clock.</br>
</br>
The pursuit of beauty was a natural tendency for women. When they found out that the hot springs could slim down their figures in addition to whitening and contracting their pores, they all agreed unanimously to stay there a bit longer, so it was late when they got back.</br>
</br>
After they dragged their weary bodies back to the beach cabin, all three dived into the bathroom to wash off the sand and seawater from their bodies and change into new clothes. Then Natasha, still unsatisfied, proposed another BBQ on the beach.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu and Ayesha rejected the idea at first because it was easy to gain weight from eating at night, but Natasha didn't care for their opinions. Seeing as no one was going to accompany her, she set up everything by herself in front of the hut and took out food from the fridge as if it was her house.</br>
</br>
In comparison to Ayesha and Xia Shiyu who were both full, she didn't eaten dinner yet.</br>
</br>
Because Xia Shiyu couldn't resist the temptation of BBQ meat, she forced herself to sleep. On the other hand, Ayesha had mental fortitude and ignored the smells carried by the wind. But Jiang Chen's resistance was much weaker as his eyes lit up when he smelled the meat.</br>
</br>
Because he didn't need to worry about his weight with his body superior to that of Superman's, it wouldn't be a problem even if he ate a cow.</br>
</br>
"Sigh, it's so nice to be rich; being an agent means you have to worry about being shot every day." Natasha chewed on the BBQ while chugging down a cold beer as she swung around her wet blonde hair.</br>
</br>
"You make it sound like it's so easy to be one." Jiang Chen made a skewer disappear as he grinned.</br>
</br>
Russian BBQ was like Turkey's roast meat, but it was his first time seeing the meat mixed with orange juice and red wine. Mixed with garlic, even if the meat was relatively big, it was delicious nonetheless.</br>
</br>
"I just have to marry rich." Natasha' lips raised as she put her bottle to the side.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her flat but athletic abs; he didn't know where all the food she ate went.</br>
</br>
"Then that wealthy man's life would be miserable; his wife is a KGB agent, so he must prevent himself from doing anything naughty outside."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? To men with ability, I don't mind how many women he has." Natasha glanced at Jiang Chen's beach shorts and said aggressively, "But without ability, it's better not to bring trouble on oneself."</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, why don't you try to see if I have the ability or not, I'll make youâ€¦ Mhmm, I can't fall for her tricks.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's arousal was quickly suppressed.</br>
</br>
He paused for a moment before changing the topic.</br>
</br>
"Earlier, you said I'm being monitored."</br>
</br>
"That's right, being monitored by me." Natasha's chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Be serious." He glared at her.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Let's first talk about the arms sale." Natasha also diverted the topic.</br>
</br>
"Is this an added condition?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Not exactly, but since you want us to share our intelligence with you, at least convince us that we're standing on the same frontier together." Natasha leaned on a wooden post while she stretched her legs out sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"Can't I stay neutral?' Jiang Chen ignored her seductive position and smiled.</br>
</br>
Natasha tossed her hair behind her back as she audaciously burped, then she looked mockingly at Jiang Chen. "Neutrality is the dumbest choice, especially when you have NATO allies surrounding you."</br>
</br>
"You do make a good point." He laughed. "Then should I accept the friendly gestures from the UA or stand with you? You guys have been dragged into a mud pit in Eastern Europe and aren't in the best state due to the problems in Syria."</br>
</br>
The meaning was obvious: [You guys can't even hold your own - what makes you attractive enough for me to stand with you?]</br>
</br>
"You won't join the UA as long as you're not dumb." Natasha shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Explain."</br>
</br>
"Country F is an ally of UA, but in establishing a strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific, did F manage to gain a lot out of it?" Natasha said with a grin.</br>
</br>
"So, we choose not to stand with anyone," Jiang Chen said dubiously.</br>
</br>
"You're like a beautiful girl with an ambiguous attitude towards your pursuers. But have you considered that since you're a needle stuck in the second island chain to block China, the UA will keep compromising with you? There are two methods to conquer a woman; one is to use flattering words, the other is to use force." Natasha gave a derogatory but easy-to-understand analogy.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen scoffed.</br>
</br>
[Funny, I haven't even taken out your nuclear weapons yet! If it wasn't for Xin being in a state of economic development to avoid unnecessary international problems, Xin could be a part of the nuclear club right now. It's a bit too early, but once I establish a few nuclear silos in the Pacific, even the five thugs will have to be afraid.]</br>
</br>
Natasha noticed that Jiang Chen was silent. Thinking that he didn't believe her, she laughed, "Don't forget what happened in Kane."</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"If the UA is willing, they only need one billion USD to form a 'civilian force' equipped with tanks and artillery in Xin." Natasha wolfed down another skewer.</br>
</br>
To Natasha's words, Jiang Chen only laughed.</br>
</br>
"I will consider your arms sale, but our stance to maintain neutrality internationally will not change. Arms sales in Hua have a much lower barrier compared to you guys. If you insist on adding conditions then I hope we can form a partnership in other areas instead."</br>
</br>
[Whatever, it's not like you're the only store. Only Iran and India are willing to do arms business with Russia. Who's more eager to expand into the international arms market? Natural gas and crude oil from Eastern Europe are no longer highly sought after. Without arms sales, what do you have to feed the almost bankrupt arms plants?]</br>
</br>
Natasha's eyebrows raised as she said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"If you purchase Han firearms, the UA will be tense."</br>
</br>
This was indeed true - compared to Russia who had nothing to do with South Asian affairs, an arms sale from Hua would have a higher chance of crossing UA boundaries. But Natasha clearly ignored a key point:</br>
</br>
"We are a private company; we don't represent the country of Xin."</br>
</br>
This was a shameless excuse.</br>
</br>
The mercenary Xin hired had nothing to do with the Xin government. Although everyone knew that Celestial was Xin's unofficial army, the army was not controlled by the government after all.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Natasha spoke with her eyes narrowed. "You are devious."</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your compliment. If you are interested in doing business without conditions, can you first tell me how you are monitoring me?"</br>
</br>
Natasha spoke a name which made Jiang Chen surprised.</br>
</br>
"Willie society.</br>
</br>
"Willie society?" With shock in Jiang Chen's eyes, he frowned. "Aren't they only active in Eastern Europe?"</br>
</br>
"Who told you they're only active in Eastern Europe?" Natasha continued, "Their eyes are all over Europe. We call them Neo-Nazis; NATO refers to them as reformed 'good friends." What's important is not how they made history but the role they play now."</br>
</br>
"What role do they play now?"</br>
</br>
"The disruptor of Eastern Europe," Natasha said emotionlessly. "NATO provides them with funding, intelligence support, and even weapons, attempting to use these Nazis to prevent us from unifying our people-"</br>
</br>
"But what does it have to do with me?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
South Asia and Eastern Europe were two completely distinct places.</br>
</br>
"That's what we're curious about too." Natasha turned to look at Jiang Chen. "What does it have to do with you?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused then asked:</br>
</br>
"Do you not know either? I thought you could give me answers."</br>
</br>
"KGB's influence is nowhere near as strong as before." Natasha sighed. "Willie society surfaced in the Gorbachev era. During that time, we could no longer even look after ourselves; there was too much bloodshed in our domestic conflictsâ€¦ For so many years, our agents only managed to obtain one keyword."</br>
</br>
"What keyword?" Watching the waves, Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils instantly contracted.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 409"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 409: It was not a Secret after all.</br>
</div></br>
[The Golden Apple? The fu*king Golden Apple again.]</br>
</br>
Two clues intermingled in his head.</br>
</br>
Based on the Golden Apple symbol on Carmen's ring, Rothschild may have some connection to the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Based on Natasha's words, Willie society was also connected to the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Then Rothschild must be connected to the Willie society somehow!</br>
</br>
[Allies?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned but immediately rejected the thought.</br>
</br>
The Rothschild family was Jewish and even supported the founding of Israel. Considering what Natasha said, the Willie society consisted of Neo-Nazis. Therefore, the two groups had to be in an eternal rivalry.</br>
</br>
[So, are they competitors then?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes; his deductive skills were only mediocre at best. Without any more clues, this was the only conclusion he arrived at.</br>
</br>
Natasha definitely didn't provide him with all the information. Jiang Chen wasn't even sure how much they know about the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of the Golden Apple?" Natasha asked.</br>
</br>
"The apple that Eve and Adam ate?" Jiang Chen disguised the shock in his mind and spoke with a smile.</br>
</br>
He wouldn't tell Natasha what the Golden Apple actually was, just like how she must've held back some information from him. It was better to play the fool now; his instincts told him that a lot of people were searching for the Apple.</br>
</br>
It was obvious as to why everyone wanted to control the mystery behind the Nazi's technology.</br>
</br>
Natasha's question may have been a test to begin with.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen really wanted to explain to her that the knock-off Golden Apple was at best a one-way radio that received certain information based on a specific time frame but didn't possess the ability to communicate with the futureâ€¦ No one would accept his explanation anyways.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ You need to catch up on your history; the Golden Apple originated from Greek Mythology, not the &lt;Bible&gt;." Natasha glared at him and took a sip of beer.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? I will remember your words. It's getting late, time to sleep." Jiang Chen got up and headed inside.</br>
</br>
"Hello? About the arms - are you going to buy them or not?" Natasha turned her head and shouted at him with her mouth reeking of alcohol.</br>
</br>
"Submarines and vessels â€“ I'll only buy these two, nothing else."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the door.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
[Submarines and vessels, those are going to be hard to secureâ€¦] Natasha frowned.</br>
</br>
Although they were included as part of the arms sales project, they were usually only sold to their allies.</br>
</br>
[It was better to contact the ministry of national defenseâ€¦]</br>
</br>
Natasha took out her satellite phone.</br>
</br>
What she didn't know was that Ayesha, in the next room, was monitoring her calls under Jiang Chen's instructions.</br>
</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a great sleep that night.</br>
</br>
What woke him up from his dream was the sound of the tide shuffling and the tickling of his ear.</br>
</br>
He opened his eyes and saw a pair of sapphire-like pupils.</br>
</br>
It was Ayesha.</br>
</br>
She was kneeling beside the bed, watching him quietly.</br>
</br>
"Are you a cat?" Jiang Chen caressed her face with a smile.</br>
</br>
It was rumored that cats would observe their owners while they slept. Although he didn't know if the urban legend was true or not, Jiang Chen thought Ayesha gazing at him was cute.</br>
</br>
Ayesha closed her eyes as she leaned her head against Jiang Chen's warm head and gently asked:</br>
</br>
"Should we go see the sunrise first or eat breakfast?"</br>
</br>
"Let's see the sunrise first," Jiang Chen said then sat up on the bed.</br>
</br>
After a few routine stretching exercises, he walked outside with Ayesha.</br>
</br>
When he was outside, he was surprised to find that Natasha was already up. And by the looks of it, she already took a morning jog.</br>
</br>
"I'm really curious â€“ considering how sluggish your routine is, could you still beat me now?" Looking at Jiang Chen with eyes still half-closed, Natasha joked.</br>
</br>
[Funny, do I need to exercise to beat you?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Natasha and walked out on the beat, took a breath of fresh air, faced the turbulent waves and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh-!"</br>
</br>
This loud roar felt so delightful. With Natasha rolling her eyes, Jiang Chen laughed presumptuously then took Ayesha to go wake Xia Shiyu up.</br>
</br>
The four of them then headed to the east beach to watch the sunrise and returned to the cabin for breakfast.</br>
</br>
Right now, the satellite TV in the living room was playing CNN's morning news.</br>
</br>
The news was reporting on the open trial records of the supreme court of Xin regarding the captured country F soldiers. 41 F soldiers who disguised as pirates and trespassed on another country's territory shocked the world; it made the world understand how shameless a country could be. The 59 casualties were unfortunate but deserved. Xin's government was willing to return the soldiers' bodies back; they would mockingly place country F's flag on the 59 caskets.</br>
</br>
The Han media had the biggest reaction and the most unified response. They stood firmly with Xin and criticized F's hideous actions, and they also stated that F's actions in the south sea were unreasonable.</br>
</br>
Because CNN had an ideology in line with the Liberal party, while they questioned some of the actions of Xin, they mostly mocked F's unlawful "government-organized pirates."</br>
</br>
Aquino called for two press conferences that day - one international while the other would target the domestic population in an attempt to change F's image, but it was futile.</br>
</br>
"I can't believe your security is actually pretty good. I remember F used to conduct joint military exercises with the UA before." Natasha stuffed some buttered toast into her mouth while she chatted casually.</br>
</br>
"So what? My soldiers are superior to them," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
[It's because of technology.]</br>
</br>
M4A1's bullets couldn't penetrate the polyethylene blast board of the kinetic skeleton, but the Reaper assault rifle could penetrate most of the walls they used as cover.</br>
</br>
"No wonder you just need submarines and vessels." Natasha grinned before she gobbled down the last piece of toast.</br>
</br>
"So? What's your verdict?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"I'm not the one calling the shots. I can only relay information, so I passed your request to the Kremlin." Natasha crossed her arms and leaned into her chair.</br>
</br>
[Is that so?]</br>
</br>
The tips of Jiang Chen's mouth imperceptibly curled up.</br>
</br>
He listened to her phone call with the Kremlin last night. Her superiors' orders for her were to try to persuade him, even if she had to sacrifice her body to better understand his connection with the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the Russians obviously understood the "use" of the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Since Willie society was investigating him, the KGB became interested in him as well â€“ this was the only explanation.</br>
</br>
Also, Jiang Chen heard from yesterday's conversation that the Kremlin already agreed on the arms sale because they really needed money. And Jiang Chen was a person with money who wasn't "picky" and willing to pay for their inactive vessels.</br>
</br>
They were right - Jiang Chen really didn't care about the outdated technology their vessels and submarines contained since he could make modifications. For example, he could replace the engine, missiles, anti-radar equipment, and add life-detection devices.</br>
</br>
"I'm really curious if Xin knows that the head of security for Russian diplomats is a KGB agent. What kind of expression would president Zhang have?" Jiang Chen said with a joking voice.</br>
</br>
"It would depend on what expression you want him to have, right?" Natasha glared at Jiang Chen as she grinned back.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
It wasn't a secret after all.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Just like yesterday, the second day of their vacation was still spent on leisure. But because of the arrival of the unexpected visitor Natasha, the four of them could now do some fun activities.</br>
</br>
Such as beach volleyball which could make people's face turn red and heart pump faster.</br>
</br>
Ayesha and Xia Shiyu were okay - one of them hadn't completely matured yet while the other possessed the slim figure unique to Asians. Aside from her beauty, there was nothing that could make him "nosebleed."</br>
</br>
But Natasha was different.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt his nose becoming warm because of the two balls jiggling from her jumps.</br>
</br>
The only person who could compare to her would probably be Liu Yao. Speaking of her, he hadn't seen her for a while. Although they had been in contact through WeChat, Jiang Chen still missed her.</br>
</br>
In the evening, they still enjoyed delicious BBQ. Natasha's Russian style BBQ and Ayesha's Chinese style BBQ all had their bright spots. The two seemed to be in a silent competition in the field of BBQ.</br>
</br>
It was a fantastic experience for Jiang Chen because he was the judge, so his stomach was treated well.</br>
</br>
After going through a long day, the gang all felt tired, and even the resilient Ayesha was tired as well. But since they were leaving tomorrow, the girls still dragged their weary bodies and spent two more hours in the beach hot spring.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed that the three seemed to be getting along better. Even Ayesha showed less hostility when she looked at Natashaâ€¦</br>
</br>
As long as Natasha maintained a "safe distance" with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The morning of the third day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did some simple cleaning before he took the three women onto a boat. The garbage left on the island would be cleaned up by servants; they didn't need to worry about it.</br>
</br>
The boat docked at a private port on the south coast of Coro Island because Xia Shiyu needed to catch a flight at 3 in the afternoon. The three of them still needed to return to the mansion to pack up, so Natasha said goodbye to them. Before she left, she thanked Jiang Chen for hosting her and said she would visit often.</br>
</br>
After blowing a kiss to Jiang Chen under two pairs of eyes filled with hostility, she turned around before quickly disappearing at the end of the street.</br>
</br>
After spending half a month together, Jiang Chen and Ayesha were accustomed to Xia Shiyu's presence. The idea of returning to a private life with Ayesha made Jiang Chen feel joyful and melancholic at the same time.</br>
</br>
Was this what it meant to: "Eat the food in the bowl while looking at the food in the pot?" Sometimes Jiang Chen felt he was a terrible personâ€¦ Mm, that might be too harsh; maybe he was just honest about his own desires?</br>
</br>
All in all, when he helped Xia Shiyu pack her things, he felt dismayed.</br>
</br>
At the airport terminal.</br>
</br>
</br>
Ayesha and Jiang Chen both sent her off at the airport.</br>
</br>
"When I head back, I'll start the selection process of internal test users as soon as possible and initiate the marketing campaign preparing for the release of the game. I'll have to count on you for establishing the server and preparing accommodations for the internal test users." Before she boarded, Xia Shiyu reminded Jiang Chen of this multiple times.</br>
</br>
Because of issues with privacy, before the game helmet could be released officially, internal tests had to be conducted on Pannu Island. It was all part of their plan which could be immediately executed once Xia Shiyu returned to Xiangjiang.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, leave it to me." Jiang Chen smiled confidently.</br>
</br>
"Mhm."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu suddenly lowered her head.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was puzzled by this sudden change, Xia Shiyu dropped her luggage, walked up two steps and pecked him on the cheek.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was still processing what happened, Xia Shiyu stiffly turned around, took her luggage, and walked away briskly.</br>
</br>
He touched his cheek. A wetness still lingered on that spot.</br>
</br>
"You got kissed." Ayesha, standing beside Jiang Chen, had a smile on her face as she spoke in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhm, I got kissed."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched Xia Shiyu's back and shook his head as he watched the plane take off.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
When they left the gate, they walked to their car at the airport entrance.</br>
</br>
Ayesha helped Jiang Chen open the car door then sat in the driver seat.</br>
</br>
"Let's head home?"</br>
</br>
"Mhm." Sinking into his soft seat, Jiang Chen closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
With his free time, he wanted to set a plan to prioritize the next steps.</br>
</br>
But then a call came through.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out his phone and when he saw the name, he laughed and picked up.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" Jiang Chen said with a grin.</br>
</br>
He already knew who it was.</br>
</br>
"It's me, the Kremlin agreed," Natasha said concisely.</br>
</br>
[Nice acting, they already agreed last night.] Jiang Chen mocked her in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Do you sell nuclear submarines?" Jiang Chen said jokingly.</br>
</br>
"Don't even think about it." She rejected it without hesitation.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, you're so heartless in your rejection. I didn't even want it.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
[Once I replace the engine with a nuclear fusion engine, who would want your nuclear fission engine?]</br>
</br>
[Weak!]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a rough idea of what arms he wanted to buy already. He didn't care about the weapons and equipment on board since they would all have to be modified and replaced anyway, so he chose a type that was relatively agile and easily hidden.</br>
</br>
"'Guardian' class frigate, Type-636 'Kilo' class submarine," Jiang Chen requested.</br>
</br>
"Kilo" class was a submarine with the highest displacement that Russia exported. It was renowned for its strong firepower and quietness. Type-636 was its improved modern version, known as the "Song of Warsaw." It was considered the leader in diesel power submarines, one of the quietest diesel submarines in the world.</br>
</br>
And the "Guardian" class frigate was one of the best multipurpose frigates Russia possessed. It was equipped with a helicopter pad. Its compact weapon configuration and agile mobility was the reason why Jiang Chen choose it. The 100 mm A-190 cannon in the front could easily be replaced with a Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon.</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, the noise of paper flipping was heard through the phone.</br>
</br>
"'Guardian' class frigate, 130 million USD. Type 636 'Kilo' class submarine, 250 million USD," Natasha replied.</br>
</br>
[So expensive.]</br>
</br>
"Could you give me a discount?" Jiang Chen tried to bargain.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't lack money, a single submarine close to 300 million still made him feel pained.</br>
</br>
"If you can buy eight at once, I can sell them to you for 200 million."</br>
</br>
[Eightâ€¦]</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen remembered correctly, a single submarine required a crew of 50-60 sailors. Even if he wanted to buy eight to build a massive nuclear fleet, he didn't have enough crew to man them.</br>
</br>
"Two 'Guardian' class frigates, two Type 636 'Kilo' class submarines - 650 million USD." Jiang Chen made a counter-offer.</br>
</br>
"700 million USD with ammunition, training, and two K-27 'Snail' anti-submarine helicopters."</br>
</br>
"Do they include a warranty?" Jiang Chen proposed without shame.</br>
</br>
"No," Natasha answered with eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"Okay, deal," Jiang Chen said, sensing that he had no option but to accept.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was never good at bargaining.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen became alert.</br>
</br>
Ayesha sensed something too as she cautiously narrowed her eyes.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the small truck in front of them suddenly decelerated and the trunk jerked open.</br>
</br>
Staring inside the container, Jiang Chen's pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 411: The Clash on the Expressway</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The back popped open, and a soldier in a black, special forces uniform raised the rifle in his hand as the muzzle pointed directly at Ayesha in the driver seat.</br>
</br>
The instant Ayesha saw the rifle, she released her foot on the gas and slammed the brakes while her hands turned the steering wheel rapidly.</br>
</br>
The screeching tires left black skid marks on the ground; their car skidded to a small road beside the highway. At the same time, the rifles began to fire.</br>
</br>
Tatatata-!</br>
</br>
The rifles unleashed a barrage of bullets. With the jumping sparks and bullets, Jiang Chen saw with the illumination of the bullets that two shooters were inside.</br>
</br>
The windshield shattered and glass scattered all over their bodies. The bullets also left a trail of bullet holes on the car roof. People on the street let out deafening screams as they ran for their lives and put distance between themselves and the scene unfolding in front of them. The cars on the street were also in a panic as they desperately tried to maintain control; some even slammed onto the sidewalk.</br>
</br>
"Ughhhh!"</br>
</br>
Ayesha shouted in pain as blood splattered on her shoulder and began to spread on her white shirt.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha!"</br>
</br>
Witnessing the blood splattering, Jiang Chen's pupils violently contracted as rage filled his body. He almost uncontrollably entered Fury.</br>
</br>
"I'm okay."</br>
</br>
With gritted teeth, Ayesha's hands stayed on the steering wheel as she drove the car back onto the highway.</br>
</br>
Using a nitrogen shield in this enclosed space would cause suffocation, so Jiang Chen could only duck with Ayesha to avoid the bullets whizzing above their heads.</br>
</br>
"Drive to the port." Jiang Chen took out the PK2000 from the storage dimension while suppressing his internal rage.</br>
</br>
"Understood!"</br>
</br>
Beyond the rubber posts beside the road was the sea. With one simple mistake, they could end up in the ocean, but Ayesha wouldn't allow that to happen. Even if the pain in her left arm was about to make her lose consciousness, she still grasped the steering wheel tightly.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, not a lot of people took this route to the deep-water harbor; it was just their two cars in the middle of a Hollywood-esque pursuit.</br>
</br>
The car stabilized as Jiang Chen smashed his car window open with the barrel of his gun before he took aim at the shooter.</br>
</br>
But before he could fire, the opponent was quick to react. The shooter who climbed on top of the truck fired at Jiang Chen's hands outside his window.</br>
</br>
The bullets barely whizzed by Jiang Chen's hands, forcing him to retract them. These people obviously received specialized training with more accurate shooting compared to average soldiers. Even Jiang Chen, who had experienced battles before, felt a sense of danger from these men.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k you," Jiang Chen cursed as he took a heat sensor grenade from the storage dimension and tossed it out the window.</br>
</br>
</br>
Trailed by flames, the heat-seeking grenade made a noticeable pause in the air before it redirected its course and flew to the small truck.</br>
</br>
With flames and a large explosion, the top was blown off the truck. But these shooters were obviously prepared - not only was the truck reinforced, but even the windows were bulletproof. The truck rammed through the smoke of the explosion, remaining hot in pursuit.</br>
</br>
Due to loss of blood, Ayesha's eyesight was beginning to blur, but she still held the wheel tightly and locked her gaze onto the curved road ahead. Jiang Chen noticed that a fine mist of sweat covered her forehead.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed her seat was stained red; his heart was bleeding.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath as he lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"Stop the car."</br>
</br>
"I can still do it." Ayesha's lower lip was about to bleed, but her foot didn't release the gas.</br>
</br>
"I said stop the car, I'm going to kill them." Jiang Chen's pupils turned into a crimson red.</br>
</br>
The daunting crimson red reflected his bloodthirsty fury.</br>
</br>
Not far in the distance, a black helicopter appeared in the air as it maintained the same speed as the car. Jiang Chen noticed there was a sniper at the hatch door, aiming into the distance.</br>
</br>
The sniper didn't shoot, perhaps afraid of hitting Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
They intended to kidnap, not assassinate.</br>
</br>
"Noâ€¦ Your secret will be revealed. We're almost at the port â€“ there's no one there." The rare occasion when Ayesha went against Jiang Chen's wishes, she stuttered.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Is your life more important or is the fu*king secret more important?!"</br>
</br>
Roaring, Jiang Chen kicked open his car door.</br>
</br>
When she heard these words, Ayesha's face instantly turned red.</br>
</br>
But before she could relish this warm feeling, her eyes widened in shock.</br>
</br>
"No-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored her words as he ripped off his seatbelt.</br>
</br>
A grim smile surfaced on his face as he jumped out of the car and dropped to the sea, ten something meters below.</br>
</br>
"If there are fu*king reefs down there, I'll be done."</br>
</br>
With his eyes locked onto the sea, Jiang Chen gritted his teeth.</br>
</br>
Splash!</br>
</br>
Staring at the splash created on the sea surface, everyone was shocked.</br>
</br>
They didn't expect Jiang Chen to jump.</br>
</br>
This type of courage wasn't typical of a rich person. In their heads, Jiang Chen would get out of the car and beg on the ground for their mercy, just like the influential people they kidnapped before.</br>
</br>
The truck came to a sudden stop. The black helicopter also hovered above the area where Jiang Chen jumped. No one bothered with the car Ayesha was in.</br>
</br>
They only had one mission: to capture Jiang Chen and use him as a hostage to force a swap. The moment the helicopter lifted off the fishing boat, it appeared on New Moon Island's radar. The force stationed on New Moon Island was on its way; if these kidnappers couldn't secure the target quickly, they would be surrounded.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, is that guy crazy?" A bearded man with brown skin cursed as he jumped out from the back of the truck.</br>
</br>
Their uniforms had a small arrow representing their identity.</br>
</br>
Arrow Military Company.</br>
</br>
Registered in South Africa, they were stationed on the island of Madagascar across the Mozambican Strait. They were one of the most despicable private military companies in the world. Most of their members were retired NATO soldiers who participated in the Iraq war. For a generous sum, they were willing to turn on the force they served without any consideration, or they could help the CIB capture drug lords in Africa.</br>
</br>
They were hired by the country F government.</br>
</br>
They had to capture the primary shareholder of Celestial Trade and threaten him to pressure the Xin government to release the 41 captured F soldiers.</br>
</br>
F finally learned its lesson. When they realized their "special force" was no match, they decisively threw out ten million USD and hired international experts to conduct this operation.</br>
</br>
"Change of plan. Team C, move to coordinate (301,212)." Another soldier in a helmet got out of the car and scanned the sea surface before he immediately spoke into the microphone attached to his ear.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The large fishing boat docked 10 kilometers away suddenly moved to where the helicopter was hovering.</br>
</br>
"Team A, follow me to build a line of defense. Team B, help me retrieve the package."</br>
</br>
"Affirmative."</br>
</br>
The truck stopped in the middle of the road. A soldier brought out machine guns and rocket launchers from the back of the truck while the other three made an "L" shaped barrier and set it around the truck.</br>
</br>
The engine of the helicopter roared as it slowly made its descent.</br>
</br>
Waves began to form on the surface of the sea because of the turbulence created by the helicopter. A soldier in diving gear with a rope attached to his back signaled his comrade before he dived inside.</br>
</br>
"Did you find him?"</br>
</br>
Fortunately, there were no reefs under the water - the target should still be alive.</br>
</br>
"Waitâ€¦"</br>
</br>
He turned on his searchlights. The diver moved underwater while searching for the target.</br>
</br>
The water wasn't deep, but the jagged reefs and corals obstructed some of his vision. When the light scanned the area, the Clownfish swam away to hide in seaweed, but a crab just stayed there blowing bubbles.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, where is that guy hiding?" The diver cursed.</br>
</br>
The soldiers in the helicopter watched the police force appearing at the entrance of the road, preparing their rifles.</br>
</br>
"Liam, stop playing, quickly."</br>
</br>
"I knowâ€¦ sh*t! What is that!? Ahhh!"</br>
</br>
"Liam! What happened! Liam!"</br>
</br>
Watching the blood gradually bubble up to the surface, the soldier in the helicopter widened his eyes. When he saw the object appearing on the surface of the water, dumbfounded, a single word came out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"God-"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 412"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 412: Tearing it Up</br>
</div></br>
Splash!</br>
</br>
Because of Jiang Chen's body position when he dived in, the sea surface contacted his chest. Even considering his strength, the collision was still able to force some water into his mouth.</br>
</br>
Bubbles rose to the surface.</br>
</br>
He maintained his downward momentum and tried his hardest to hold his breath while swimming forward.</br>
</br>
When his hand reached ten meters under the surface of the water and he confirmed that the people above couldn't see to this distance, Jiang Chen immediately started interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
The force of the water squeezing his body instantly disappeared as he appeared on the bed in the mansion in the apocalypse, completely wet.</br>
</br>
Without stopping, Jiang Chen took out the backup T-3 power armor he kept in the storage dimension and squeezed inside.</br>
</br>
&lt;Enclosed mode activated&gt;</br>
</br>
The four turbine engines behind the armor contracted inward and closed the engine outlet. The vents around the armor were all closed and the oxygen storage system inside the armor opened. The entire power armor was closed off from the external environment, preventing any material exchange with the outside world.</br>
</br>
In theory, neither the airdrop type or the land type power armor could be used to dive under water because the massive amount of metal in the armors caused it to sink. There was also no air inside the water, so the turbine engines in the power armor using air as force would naturally lose their function.</br>
</br>
But while the power armor had no diving functions, it could act as a simple waterproof suit!</br>
</br>
After confirming the equipment was operational, a grim smile surfaced on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"See how I will torture you all."</br>
</br>
Interdimensional travel, activated!</br>
</br>
Just as he left, Sun Jiao pushed open the door.</br>
</br>
Seeing the empty room and the wet sheets, she pouted her mouth in disappointment.</br>
</br>
"I thought you were back for good."</br>
</br>
But seeing as he came back only temporarily, he must've met some trouble on the other side.</br>
</br>
When Sun Jiao realized this, she began to worry.</br>
</br>
"If only you could take me there."</br>
</br>
She sighed.</br>
</br>
She grabbed the wet sheets before she walked out.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The water in his surroundings was emitting an even amount of pressure. Just as Jiang Chen appeared on this side, his eyes fell upon a diving mask. Although he couldn't see the expression of the person behind it, judging by the person's stopped movements, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
The shock only lasted for a second before he immediately raised his underwater pistol.</br>
</br>
With a trail of white bubbles, the bullet hit Jiang Chen's armor and deflected without any damage done.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately stepped on the seabed and without pulling out his gun, he grabbed the person's face.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh, glooglooo-!"</br>
</br>
</br>
With his face stuck, the diver desperately fought for his life.</br>
</br>
The person's sounds of agony rang out, but Jiang Chen didn't care as he grabbed his head with a grim smile and freely unleashed his anger. He smashed the person's head on the reefs by the side.</br>
</br>
"Go die!"</br>
</br>
His head exploded like a watermelon. The nearby group of fish scattered because of the blood that began to diffuse through the water.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tossed aside his corpse. He took out a knife, cut the rope on his back, grabbed the rope and looped it a few times around his own hand.</br>
</br>
Another grim smile appeared on his face again as Jiang Chen ascended to the surface along with the diffused blood.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to reach the surface, Jiang Chen's left arm violently pulled the rope and leaped out of the water.</br>
</br>
&lt;Enclosed mode deactivated&gt;</br>
</br>
"Liam is down."</br>
</br>
"Cut the rope!"</br>
</br>
"No, ascend, we'll seek revenge for Liam!" The soldier took out his machine gun, attached a hook to the helicopter door and set the machine gun on the side of the helicopter with blood-red eyes.</br>
</br>
"Turn the head, quick!"</br>
</br>
"Roger." The pilot pulled up the helicopter.</br>
</br>
The rotor blades instantly began to accelerate as the helicopter quickly climbed in elevation; the three-hundred-kilogram mass that was Jiang Chen was nothing for the mid-sized helicopter. At the same time, the pilot "dashed forward" while "rotating the head." Using the momentum of the helicopter, the power armor at the tip of the rope began swinging in the air.</br>
</br>
The crosshairs locked onto Jiang Chen at the tip of the rope. The soldier maintained his aim while trying to keep still from the momentum of the helicopter. He pressed fire with a ferocious expression.</br>
</br>
"Go die, monster-!"</br>
</br>
The bullets hit the surface of the armor. The 12.7 mm caliber machine gun bullets were deflected by the power armor and just left a trail of barely visible dents on the surface of the black paint.</br>
</br>
Sparks flew everywhere. The light was blinding to the eye, but it didn't do any damage to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a battle on the highway was already underway. Xin police cars lined up in the middle of the road while exchanging fire with the three mercenaries stationed around the truck. But in terms of firepower and experience, the Xin police force was clearly weaker than the experienced mercenaries. With their light machine guns set up behind barriers, the mercenaries quickly managed to gain the upper hand in the exchange.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to use the minigun on his right arm to finish the group of mercenaries, but his eyes caught the people screaming on the street in the distance as well as a few people, unafraid of death, raising their phones to record the whole ordeal. He quickly changed his mind as he put his arms above his head, pretending to be completely helpless.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! I can't penetrate this thing!" The cold air cut his lips as the soldier roared out while he took out another clip.</br>
</br>
"Don't bother with that thing! Bob! Cut the rope and get rid of him! Use your machine gun to take down the ground units!"</br>
</br>
"Affirmativeâ€¦ Fu*k!" A few bullets flew by Bob's forehead, causing him to be immediately drenched in a cold sweat.</br>
</br>
A pickup truck in police camouflage drove to the road not far away, and behind the pickup truck was a Type 67-2 heavy machine gun. It was the type of machine gun removed from the Pannu force's armory because Celestial didn't need such an old weapon, so it was left with the police department. It now had a use.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, are they the police or terrorists?!"</br>
</br>
Bob ducked down in fear.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the sound of bullets hitting the helicopter surface echoed inside.</br>
</br>
The pilot immediately moved the helicopter up while dragging the annoying power armor away from Coro Island.</br>
</br>
"The enemy has anti-air units! Team A, you're on your own!" He shouted into the microphone.</br>
</br>
"Affirmative, head to the retreating point and meet with team C."</br>
</br>
"Okay!... Bob, why's that metal thing still hanging on there?!" The pilot turned his head and asked his comrade in the back.</br>
</br>
"Wait, I'll cut it off now."</br>
</br>
"Hold on! Find a deserted island; we need to get revenge for Liam!" the mercenary beside Bob said with fierce eyes.</br>
</br>
"Heh, great point." Bob sneered as he retracted his knife.</br>
</br>
When he saw the helicopter leaving Coro Island, Jiang Chen's eyes began to turn cold as a curvature appeared on his lips.</br>
</br>
[Wait until I can't see Coro Island, it will be your death sentence!]</br>
</br>
The mercenaries clearly didn't realize what they were dragging along; they thought it was just a "dragon scale" full-body bulletproof suit. Aside from the armor's sci-fi looking appearance, it didn't look dangerous at all at a surface level.</br>
</br>
But soon they would feel deep regret for this mistake.</br>
</br>
One of these wiped out an entire elite CIB agent force!</br>
</br>
They flew around Coro Island for ten minutes before the pilot finally found an appropriate island. With jagged cliffs at the bottom, a sneer appeared on his face as he hovered the helicopter 2000 meters above the island.</br>
</br>
Falling down from this height, the armor would definitely be shattered into pieces, even if it was made out of titanium.</br>
</br>
"Bob, do it!"</br>
</br>
"Affirmative." Bob put his machine gun to the side as he took out his dagger. He smiled grimly at Jiang Chen without knowing any better. "Goodbye, buddy-"</br>
</br>
But his expression quickly froze.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out the tactical rifle on his waist, aiming it at him.</br>
</br>
Tatata-!</br>
</br>
After unleashing the bullets, Jiang Chen also pressed the trigger with the same grim smile.</br>
</br>
A bullet penetrated the soldier's head. The knife slipped out from his hand and fell into the ocean along with him.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! Bob is down too!"</br>
</br>
When the pilot saw the rifle in Jiang Chen's hand that appeared out of nowhere, he felt a fear he never felt before, but since he was an experienced soldier, he immediately made a decisive choice.</br>
</br>
"Jim! Cut the rope-"</br>
</br>
As he said the first word, the mercenary called Jim was already doing exactly that.</br>
</br>
But it was too late.</br>
</br>
The helicopter tilted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen jerked on the rope with his left arm while the turbine engines behind his back burst out and quickly shortened the distance between himself and the helicopter.</br>
</br>
Jim cut the rope, but it was too late. A moment later, he met Jiang Chen at the hatch.</br>
</br>
Jim's expression was as if he had seen a ghost!</br>
</br>
"Here's your rope."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled maliciously. He lifted up his left arm, still wrapped by the rope, and punched.</br>
</br>
The sound of steel crashing through bone faded quickly. Blood splashed onto the power armor.</br>
</br>
"Die, Devil!" Another soldier screamed, dove onto the helicopter floor, raised his rifle and fired it as fast as he could.</br>
</br>
Bullets bounced within the narrow space. Jiang Chen glanced at his frightened expression for a moment then instantly popped his head.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Fu*k! Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
The pilot tried to tilt the helicopter in an attempt to force this demigod out of the open hatch door. But instead, he merely dropped out the two corpses.</br>
</br>
Sensing his intentions, Jiang Chen laughed contemptuously.</br>
</br>
"You really don't welcome me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen abided by the pilot's wishes. He shook his head and jumped out of the helicopter.</br>
</br>
But before he jumped out, he left a small gift.</br>
</br>
A pulled EMP grenade.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! Finally got rid of him." The pilot quickly checked the condition of the rotor blades.</br>
</br>
The assistant pilot was curled in his seat, still traumatized.</br>
</br>
"What is that monster?"</br>
</br>
"Who knows! Fu*k! Those guys never said he was like thisâ€¦ Wait, wait, what's going on?!"</br>
</br>
A static noise entered his ears.</br>
</br>
The space immediately turned white. The pilot desperately shook the joystick in desperation, but it was futile.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! What are you doing!?"</br>
</br>
"I, I don't know! Dammit! AHHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
With a trail of blue flames behind his back, Jiang Chen descended slowly in the air.</br>
</br>
As he watched the helicopter fall 2000 meters in the sky, he sneered.</br>
</br>
But just as he was watching the helicopter crashing to the earth, he swore and slapped himself on the forehead.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, forgot to leave one alive!]</br>
</br>
He shook his head with a wry smile. Jiang Chen looked back at Coro Island, which was so far away that it looked like a dot.</br>
</br>
[Whatever, there's three more.]</br>
</br>
[I'll just change into the amphibious K1 kinetic skeleton and head back. Hopefully, they haven't escaped.]</br>
</br>
As he thought, Jiang Chen lowered the engine output while directing the power armor to land.</br>
</br>
[How is Ayesha doing? Did she get taken to the hospital?]</br>
</br>
There was a giant splash in the sea.</br>
</br>
After a short silence, a trail of white bubbles came up from underneath and headed towards the Coro Island harbor.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Fu*k! What is team B doing!"</br>
</br>
The bearded man held up the rifle and shot back while retreating back to the deep water harbor in panic.</br>
</br>
"Mission failed, retreat, I repeat, mission failedâ€¦" Blood dripped down from the scratch on his forehead, Srell in a black combat suit shouted into the microphone ordering team C to immediately retreat.</br>
</br>
An unprecedented defeat. A helicopter crashed. An entire team of elites fell without any survivors. The opponent's combat ability far exceeded what they had imagined. The metal thing that popped out from under the water instantly suppressed team B. They didn't expect this at all.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, is that Ironman?" A soldier with a rifle cursed while panting.</br>
</br>
"Bullsh*t!" Someone else swore.</br>
</br>
"Then what the fu*ck-"</br>
</br>
"Shut up! Retreat to the boat and remain alert!" Srell in short breaths slowed down, threw a C4 on the ground and caught up with the team again.</br>
</br>
The siren in the distance was becoming more visible.</br>
</br>
When he estimated the location was about right, he pressed the detonation button.</br>
</br>
Flames blew five meters high and engulfed the police vehicle rushing to their location. He scorned and threw away the detonator.</br>
</br>
[Garbage even weaker than the Mexican police.]</br>
</br>
The fishing boat they prepared beforehand was parked in the deep water harbor; they purchased this from the local fishers. Xin's labor demand helped them tremendously. Without much convincing needed, they bought the fishing boat from a fisher now working in a factory. They replaced the engine with a much more powerful one.</br>
</br>
As long as they board the boat, no one could stop them on the vast sea.</br>
</br>
But just as the beard dashed into the cabin, his eyes were met with a black muzzle.</br>
</br>
Before he could react, his consciousness stopped in front of a flashing light.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
Type 11 pistol spit out its flame, blood and brain matter splashed beside an indifferent face. Without stopping, Ayesha ducked into the shadow of the cabin, readjustment, and pressed the trigger again. "Bang!" another headshot.</br>
</br>
In a glimpse, two out of three died.</br>
</br>
Just as she was about to take care of the last person, a sharp wind blew by and kicked away the pistol in her hand.</br>
</br>
Slightly shocked, Ayesha didn't bother with the pistol that dropped on the ground. She lowered her body and smoothly wielded the dagger around her waist and stabbed in the person's direction.</br>
</br>
Sharp metal sounded. The two blades collided.</br>
</br>
While she had a small figure, she was injected with the genetic vaccine. Ayesha still had the upper hand.</br>
</br>
Her hand was in pain because of the intense collision. The opponent was also shocked as he kicked out without holding back.</br>
</br>
Ayesha agilely dodged the fearsome kick as she swung the dagger toward his standing left leg. If the dagger hit, his left leg would be done.</br>
</br>
</br>
But that person was not to be underestimated. He used the recoil force from kicking the wall and fell back. Ayesha's slash only barely cut open his muscle and unfortunately missed his vital point.</br>
</br>
Srell rolled to the wall of the cabin and picked up the rifle on the ground. Though before he could press the trigger, a knife pinned his arm.</br>
</br>
"Ahh!"</br>
</br>
With a scream, the girl had already dashed in front of him. He lifted his hand and threw the barrel in her direction.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's movement was uninterrupted as she moved aside to avoid the hit. At the same time, her left hand reached for his wrist, and her right pulled out the second dagger, searching for his throat.</br>
</br>
But then, a mishap happened.</br>
</br>
Because her left arm muscles were tightened, the crudely bandaged wound on her left shoulder suddenly exploded. The sharp pain made her left hand lose its strength.</br>
</br>
The force restraining his wrist loosened. Srell, who caught the opportunity, was ecstatic as he used his brute force and swung the barrel.</br>
</br>
"Ooooh-"</br>
</br>
With a deep sound of pain, the barrel smashed right onto Ayesha's eyebrows and forced her to tumble. Blood dripped along her face; the dagger didn't manage to penetrate his throat. It only managed to cut his collar.</br>
</br>
With droplets of sweat on her face, she kicked her legs without hesitation. While she was ducking down, he extended his left leg, clamped onto her throat, and pinned her against the wall.</br>
</br>
"Gurr-"</br>
</br>
Ayesha desperately tried to fight him off in pain with both legs kicking at his hands, but she couldn't use any power because of the lack of blood.</br>
</br>
"Go die."</br>
</br>
He stared gravely at her.</br>
</br>
Her feet left the ground as her movements became weaker and weaker.</br>
</br>
For some reason, looking at the girl in front of him, he suddenly remembered the time he served in Afghanistan. He remembered the hell that he wasn't even willing to remember.</br>
</br>
[Oh no, almost to the limit.]</br>
</br>
Ayesha's consciousness began to blur.</br>
</br>
[Sorryâ€¦ I can't anymoreâ€¦]</br>
</br>
She suddenly felt a bit sad.</br>
</br>
How ironic.</br>
</br>
The same day, when she was fleeing, she could use a nonchalant tone and ask him "could you give me a bullet?" She was prepared to die for him from the beginning, but now she began to fear.</br>
</br>
[I don't want to dieâ€¦]</br>
</br>
[Iâ€¦ I finally got it.]</br>
</br>
[â€¦]</br>
</br>
White foam and blood began to drip out of her mouth. She began to fight back with a rush of energy. She attempted to claw away from the hand locked on her throat and despairingly kicked his legs with all her force, but the feeble limbs made everything feel powerless.</br>
</br>
"Gurr-"</br>
</br>
"Go die with my comrades! B*tch."</br>
</br>
With anger in his eyes, Srell stared at the girl.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered the Taliban that shredded his comrade to pieces with the roadside bomb. When he caught the bastard, the murderer looked contemptuously at him, as if he had just completed a virtuous mission, and already put aside his life.</br>
</br>
Still, he remembered what he did. He chopped off his hands, pinned both his arms to the wall, shot his legs, and waited until his eyes began to turn into despair before finally dripping out his last drop of blood.</br>
</br>
Although he was brought to the military court, he had no regrets. The sensation of unleashing his anger made him addicted to the feeling. He spent two decadent years in Los Santos before he joined "Arrow". He had stored that memory in the back of his head, but now everything flooded back.</br>
</br>
There was nothing more enjoyable than watching the enemy die struggling.</br>
</br>
"Hahahahaha, go die-!"</br>
</br>
He laughed hysterically. He increased the power in his hand as he watched the despair of the weak.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, he felt a pull on the back of his neck.</br>
</br>
Before he could react, he was thrown out by an explosive force.</br>
</br>
He smashed onto the door as his spine made intimate contact with the barriers outside of the cabin.</br>
</br>
A sharp and crisp sound, his back bent back in an unimaginable 90 degrees as his spine was broken in half by the force.</br>
</br>
His eyes almost popped out from his eye sockets. The broken spine penetrated his intestine but didn't kill him immediately. He slid down from the barrier and collapsed onto the ground.</br>
</br>
[Is this what it feels like to suffocateâ€¦]</br>
</br>
His lungs were clamped by his ribcage, he coughed blood, but he couldn't breathe in a single molecule of air.</br>
</br>
At the end of agony, consciousness drifted into darkness.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen who threw the mercenary back hugged the girl sliding down from the wall. He hugged her tightly in his arms as if he was holding onto a fragile porcelain doll.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes were covered in a crimson red, the calmed emotion almost exploded into fury again.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha. Ayesha!"</br>
</br>
Because of the loss of blood, she couldn't respond anymore.</br>
</br>
Holding onto her, Jiang Chen ran out of the cabin, hopped onto the harbor, and ran to the road. When the police and ambulance saw that there was someone in his arms, they all stopped, and the doctors dashed over with stretchers.</br>
</br>
[Savedâ€¦]</br>
</br>
Looking at the side of the furious face, Ayesha felt the relief of surviving through a disaster.</br>
</br>
She should be happy, but she suddenly wanted to cry.</br>
</br>
Although she never cried before. She was never fragile.</br>
</br>
Tears rolled down her eyes and splashed onto his firm shoulder.</br>
</br>
Blue and red light. A stretcher. The shaking blood bag, and the panicking face â€¦</br>
</br>
[Once I wake up, he will be really madâ€¦ I made the decision myself to do something so dangerous.]</br>
</br>
[Whatever, I'll think about it once I wake up.]</br>
</br>
Ayesha closed her large eyes.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Outside the emergency room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat silently in the chair with a gloomy expression on his face.</br>
</br>
No one dared to approach him other than the soldiers in kinetic skeletons. The fluid-looking armor covered their chest, and the sleek helmet shielded their head. The soldiers with rifles on full alert protected him in the middle. They examined anyone approaching with sharp eyesâ€¦ If anyone dared to approach in the first place.</br>
</br>
An assassination in public.</br>
</br>
With an accident like this in broad daylight, Ivan didn't say anything and handed in his emblem himself, but Jiang Chen tossed it back at him.</br>
</br>
Ivan was not to blame. New Moon Island was hundreds of kilometers away from Coro Island. From start to finish, the whole incident took place in ten minutes. The mercenaries entered the border disguised as tourists, and the weapons and equipment they used were all smuggled into Xin with fishing boat marked with Xin's flag.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen was furious, he didn't blame anyone. Unleashing his anger on his people was the most foolish and useless choice.</br>
</br>
The doctors and nurses in the hospital passed him anxiously, fearing to anger the demigod that is clearly fuming.</br>
</br>
Then, a soldier with a rifle turned from the corner and stopped in front of Jiang Chen. He leaned forward and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Four pedestrians wounded; one person pronounced died in the hospital. Eight police wounded; two pronounced died in the hospital; four police died because of C4 explosionâ€¦"</br>
</br>
The cold casualty numbers didn't stir any emotion in Jiang Chen's heart. After the soldier finished, he only said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Who's the perpetrator?"</br>
</br>
"Reliable evidence indicated that the perpetrator is Arrow Military Company. Xin's Ministry of Foreign Affairs already protested against the Madagascar government to punish the perpetratorâ€¦"</br>
</br>
But everyone knew that these protests were useless. It was not that Madagascar didn't want to take care of these problems, but because their military force would not even win against the battle-trained soldiers.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the emerging nations maintained the stance of keeping an eye open and an eye closed to the illegal militants' misdeeds internationally. As long as they didn't cause trouble domestically, they would not question their legality.</br>
</br>
"I'm talking about the actual perpetrator."</br>
</br>
"â€¦Sorry, we didn't manage to capture anyone alive. But the boat fled in the direction of country F's territory, and our boats were blocked by F's coastal guards at the border." The soldier lowered his head.</br>
</br>
The fishing boat that released the helicopter immediately fled to Xin's border. Although New Moon Island sent out fast boats to chase them, when they escaped into country F's borders, Celestial had to stop pursuing.</br>
</br>
Country F's coastal guard freely allowed the militants to enter. It was almost certain that country F was the perpetrator behind this kidnap mission. The only problem was the lack of evidence, and it was virtually impossible to find proof hiring mercenaries to do the dirty deeds.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
He was reflecting on his mistake.</br>
</br>
The army stationed at New Moon Island could protect Xin like a steel fortress, but he ignored the work in intelligence. Willie society's spy already reminded him, but he didn't think too much of it. Only till now did he realize the severity of the problem. Xin's national security was as penetrable as a piece of paper. And the immigration policy would continue to deteriorate the security of the country. He somehow overlooked this problem before.</br>
</br>
He must establish an intelligence department fast before the national security worsens.</br>
</br>
Ayeshaâ€¦</br>
</br>
The corner of his eye glared at the closed doors. Jiang Chen felt twisting pain in his heart.</br>
</br>
[Fool, why were you trying to prove yourself with woundsâ€¦ so what if a few rats ran away?]</br>
</br>
At the corner, Zhang Yapin with flowers walked over.</br>
</br>
He looked at Jiang Chen face full of gloom and let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Tulips. Help me give these to the wounded. Sorryâ€¦"</br>
</br>
"I'll form a national security department as soon as possible," Jiang Chen said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin paused, sighed.</br>
</br>
"That would be best."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin patted Jiang Chen on the shoulder as he didn't know how to comfort him. He left the flowers on the chair before turning around.</br>
</br>
"Execute," Jiang Chen said apathetically.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin stopped, turned around, and looked at him in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Died of fire, 41 captives all died."</br>
</br>
"Are you insane!"</br>
</br>
"The circuit board is outdated, the fire equipment lacked maintenance, and there were security disturbances at Xin that day. Just release the statement and send your condolences."</br>
</br>
"That's impossible! It's too much of a coincidence! I know you are sad, but we don't have evidence to prove that country F did this. Even if they if they did, we can't seek revenge by executing the prisoners of war. We are a civil society! The international image we finally managed to create-"</br>
</br>
"You do it." Jiang Chen tilted his head and ordered a soldier.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The soldier nodded and left.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin blankly stared at the soldier leaving, he opened his mouth wanting to say something, but he knew the soldier would not listen to him.</br>
</br>
[This lunatic, what would killing a few prisoners of war do? The international society would all stand with country F. 41 lives! Captives without any weapons! The despicable crimes against humanity! Even if they started a war, people would think it would be with a cause.]</br>
</br>
Or rather, if Xin did execute the prisoners, it would be the exact response country F was looking.</br>
</br>
"Wait," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The soldier stopped and turned around.</br>
</br>
"Commander?"</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, Jiang Chen slowly closed his eyes, "Just wait a bit."</br>
</br>
"Yes, commander."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin let out a sigh of relief. He felt as if he was about to collapse.</br>
</br>
"Thank god, you finally regained your rationality."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glared at him and didn't say anything.</br>
</br>
[Is that so?]</br>
</br>
He suddenly felt that it was not only too low to execute the prisoners of war, but it was also too easy of a punishment for them.</br>
</br>
A curvature appeared on his lips, and his eyes flashed with coldness and apathy.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin watched the silent Jiang Chen as he felt a chill down his spine.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
A video filmed by tourists appeared on Youtube.</br>
</br>
The video shook violently, but a helicopter dragging "Ironman" could still be barely made out." People on the helicopter fired at the "Ironman" with the machine guns, but it didn't manage to do any damage.</br>
</br>
The video stopped after the helicopter dragged the armor away from Coro Island. It didn't manage to capture the iron armor from being pulled out of the water nor where the helicopter headed. People were speculating about the identity of the "Ironman", the cause, and the ending.</br>
</br>
No one knew the ending, but the cause could be traced.</br>
</br>
People connected it to the gunfights at the city of Coro that day. A lot of the media believed the two were connected.</br>
</br>
But because of the gunfight, the government of Xin tightly controlled the information. They only revealed it was two groups of criminals attempting to rob a bank to divert the public opinion from the truth. Although there were a lot of skeptical information, people had to accept this as the truth and build off of the facts by using their imagination.</br>
</br>
Because the fight between the iron armor and the machine gunner was very Hollywood-esque, the truth behind the story was completely hidden and mysterious. Also, the government's lack of disclosure to the event caused the view of the video on Youtube to be extremely high, and it became a hot topic on the web. Even the actor of Ironman, Robert Downy Jr. wrote a joking status on Facebook.</br>
</br>
Burp, I was drunk last time, who saw my armor?</br>

</br>
The buns on the table were a bit cold, and the back of the egg was somewhat dry. It has been a while since he faced an empty dinner table. The person that always brought him delicious breakfast was in the hospital. The doctor said that she was no longer in critical condition, but it would still be a lengthy recovery process.</br>
</br>
The gun wound triggered acute inflammation, the blood loss pushed her body to the limit as she had constant fevers.</br>
</br>
Two days passed by and she still didn't show any signs of waking up.</br>
</br>
Whenever he thought about the frail face, a sharp pain would penetrate his chest.</br>
</br>
He took a bite of the egg stuffed inside the bun and frowned.</br>
</br>
He put down the bun back onto the plate and brought the plate back into the kitchen, he stuffed the food as terrible as his mood into the trash. Then took out the frozen pizza from the fridge and put it in the microwave.</br>
</br>
He brought the steamy pizza back to the dinner table and expressionlessly turned on the TV. Then he picked up the pizza with a fork and stuffed it in his mouth.</br>
</br>
He didn't feel like eating, so he tried to put his anxious attention on the TV.</br>
</br>
The morning news was on.</br>
</br>
It happened to play the gunfight that occurred three days ago and had a glimpse of the iron armor being dragged away.</br>
</br>
A UA military expert who wished to remain anonymous commented that the single soldier armor's usage in actual warfare is limited. The increased defense as the cost of hiddenness perhaps could block normal bullets, but it would be futile against anti-armor snipers or cannons. The combination of tanks with infantries is enough to make up for the lack of defense of infantry force, there is no reason to spend high cost to develop the "useless" single soldier armorâ€¦</br>
</br>
Some experts also questioned the authenticity of the video, especially the fact that the crew on board the helicopter were reluctant to cut the rope.</br>
</br>
As to the effectiveness of anti-armor sniper to power armor, Jiang Chen never tried it before, but it shouldn't be possible. Since the power armor in the apocalypse could withstand a few shots of the sniper.</br>
</br>
The TV is a great thing to waste time on. As he watched TV, he mechanically stuffed pizza into his mouth before he finished feeding himself.</br>
</br>
He put the plate into the dishwasher and glanced at the time, he wanted to take a nap.</br>
</br>
But then, the phone rang.</br>
</br>
It was Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"I saw the newsâ€¦ are you okay there?" Xia Shiyu was worried.</br>
</br>
She didn't know that the protagonist in the news was Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I'm okay." Jiang Chen stiffly forced a smile and tried to use the least suspicious voice he could muster.</br>
</br>
"Your voice is making me worried, are you sick?" Xia Shiyu raised her eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"No. Ohâ€¦ you should have arrived in Xiangjiang yesterday. I had something to do and didn't get to call you, sorry."</br>
</br>
</br>
"No, it's okay. I don't mind." Xia Shiyu's face turned red as she could only use her cough to hide the panic in her heart.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words made her remember the kiss at the airport.</br>
</br>
She didn't know what kind of courage she had to make that move. When she got off the airplane at Melbourne, her heart was still pounding furiously.</br>
</br>
"The selection of the internal test users have been completed. They will arrive early July, so you'll have to take care of them." Xia Shiyu jumped to another topic.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, leave it to me." Jiang Chen didn't sense Xia Shiyu's mental state and nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about Ayesha, is she doing okay?"</br>
</br>
"â€¦ She, she is sleeping." Jiang Chen made up a not fake lie.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu paused as she was slightly bitter and jealous, but she couldn't do anything about it. She knew that once she left, the two would definitely start living their intimate and shameless life again.</br>
</br>
She just didn't want to torture herself by thinking about the problem.</br>
</br>
"Okay. Youâ€¦ Mhmm, don't overdo it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process as he sensed the jealousy that drifted all the way from the other side of the ocean. He couldn't help but smileâ€¦</br>
</br>
"Don't overdo what?"</br>
</br>
"Don't overdo, that."</br>
</br>
"What's that?" Jiang Chen pretended not to know.</br>
</br>
"It's, it's thatâ€¦" Xia Shiyu's face was completely red, her lips trembled, and only a word squeezed out of her mouth, "PERVERT!"</br>
</br>
She hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile.</br>
</br>
It was only a while before his mood became better and he cheered up again.</br>
</br>
"I'll go visit Ayesha in a bitâ€¦ Mhmm, it's almost the end of the month, I'll go to the warehouse first and send food-" Jiang Chen suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
The apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Right, the apocalypse! He almost forgot about that side!</br>
</br>
He slapped his forehead and walked out in quick steps.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Grains, wheat, flour were piled into a small mountain, as well as fresh meat, preserved meat and all kinds of canned food, and added to that were dairy products and salt. This batch of food had the cost of over half a million USD. Part of the food was produced at Xinlong Food Processing Plant relocated to Pannu Island, while some were from Australian farms.</br>
</br>
Followed by the increased amount needed to be transported, Jiang Chen hired a professional in Australia to assist Cassan who chewed on sugarcanes at the door. This ensured that food would stuff the warehouse to its fullest on the second last day of the month.</br>
</br>
After spending ten minutes moving the warehouse full of food to the apocalypse. Jiang Chen returned to the mansion in the apocalypse. He directly looked for Lin Lin and explained to her his intention.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha? Is that the girl I saw last time?" With a finger pressed against her bottom lip, Lin Lin asked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. She is wounded and still unconscious now, is there some all-purpose medicine or something?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"There is no all-purpose medicine." Lin Lin rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen and said with an attitude, "It's hard if I don't know where she is injured or if her brain is damagedâ€¦"</br>
</br>
"It's not the brain.' Jiang Chen shook his head, "It's a gun wound, but because of the loss of blood and the wound rupturing there is a bacterial infectionâ€¦ and hypoxia."</br>
</br>
When Lin Lin heard Jiang Chen's words, it made her jump up. [How severe was the wound?]</br>
</br>
But it was all good.</br>
</br>
Since there were all external injuries, without any damage to the brain region, it shouldn't be too hard to heal.</br>
</br>
"Smart Medical Chamber, I remember the community center at the base has around seven or eight of them. That thing is extremely effective in repairing normal damage to human tissue. Based on the severity of the injury, float in there for a while, and she should be okay. How behind is your medical condition over there?" Lin Lin ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you just look through the history textbook."</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen said that, his tensed heart calmed down.</br>
</br>
He didn't even know the base had something amazing like this which was his mistake. He always heard that people were injured at the base, but didn't see anyone recovering on a bed. No wonder this was the case with such advanced technology.</br>
</br>
"Be aware, before lying inside the Smart Medical Chamber, the special nutrient liquid must be poured. That should be in the base's warehouse. Remember not to forget."</br>
</br>
"Thanks."</br>
</br>
"No worries, just bring me some mango pudding back-"</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Lin Lin covered her mouth and began to gag.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was startled by her abrupt action, and he immediately asked her, "Are you okay?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing. Just some small problems in the past few daysâ€¦ might be better after a while." Lin Lin dodged Jiang Chen's eyes as she replied ambiguously.</br>
</br>
"What exactly is the problem? Explain." Jiang Chen grabbed Lin Lin's shoulder and stared into the differing color pupils with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin blushed at the "fervent" sight. She twisted her body and turned her burning face away.</br>
</br>
"It's getting hotter, fool."</br>
</br>
"Hotter?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked in confusion, but he didn't receive the appropriate response.</br>
</br>
She buried her blushing face and pushed him out of the door without explaining anything.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Because of the chaos that happened, the hospital hall was empty without anyone to be seen. Being "frightened" by the four soldiers, the people who usually came to the hospital instead headed to local clinics. The doctors and nurses all enjoyed their free time. (Xin has a universal health care system.)</br>
</br>
After six hours in the emergency room, Ayesha's condition was stabilized. It would be a matter of time before she woke up.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was told this, the director of the hospital felt relieved.</br>
</br>
If something happened to that girl, he was afraid that man would tear this place apart.</br>
</br>
Leon hadn't closed his eyes for 24 hours. He put the diagnostic report on the side of the table as he wearily put his head on the table to take a nap.</br>
</br>
But before he could fall asleep, someone knocked on the door and interrupted him</br>
</br>
Leon got up from the table, rubbed his heavy eye bags, and said tiredly.</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
It was the head nurse that came in.</br>
</br>
"Director, Mr. Jiang Chen handed in the discharge application for Miss Ayesha."</br>
</br>
'Ohâ€¦ What? Discharge?" Leon who just processed the information almost fell off his chair. He immediately pressed himself against the chair and stood up.</br>
</br>
"Yes, he wanted you to immediately arrange an ambulance and send Miss Ayesha to his home," The head nurse said in wry.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible! She just left critical condition and hadn't even woken up yet. She doesn't meet the discharge standard. This is putting the patient's life on the line! If she is discharged now and her condition suddenly deteriorates to that she becomes permanently unconscious, who would bear the responsibility?" Leon said emotionally.</br>
</br>
"But directorâ€¦ this is his order," the head nurse said with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
Leon felt conflicted before finally let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Grant the discharge applicationâ€¦ Also get him to sign a disclaimer."</br>
</br>
"He already signed the disclaimer." The head nurse took out the paper from the brief.</br>
</br>
"Then he can do whatever he wants." The director snatched the disclaimer from her hand and walked outside wearily.</br>
</br>
Not long after, the ambulance arrived at Jiang Chen's mansion. A few doctors and nurses helped unload the stretcher while companied by two soldiers. Then they anxiously sent people inside the mansion.</br>
</br>
The two nurses put Ayesha on the bed and injected her with the infusion again.</br>
</br>
"If there are any symptoms, please immediately contact us."</br>
</br>
Because of her sense of responsibility, before she left, the head nurse still made notes to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the important person wasn't as difficult to communicate with as she had expected, the head nurse discreetly felt relieved before she left.</br>
</br>
The mansion door closed and the mansion returned to its tranquil state.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went back into the bedroom and sat beside Ayesha.</br>
</br>
He combed the hairs in front of her forehead and caressed the haggard face. Jiang Chen's throat moved a little before only one word came out.</br>
</br>
"Foolâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood up and took out the Smart Medical Chamber from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The fluid design, the pristine white color. From its appearance, this device was quite similar to the hibernation chamber; the only difference was its size being slightly bigger and the top of the chamber not having a processor used to run the virtual reality program.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen carefully removed the needle on Ayesha's arm and then removed her clothes.</br>
</br>
He looked the flower buds, then followed her abs to her soft and athletic waist till he finally reached the holy land.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped.</br>
</br>
But then he knew that this was not the time to be distracted. He focused again.</br>
</br>
"Medical Chamber activated, patient please lie flat inside."</br>
</br>
The gentle voice played. Based on its description, Jiang Chen carefully picked up Ayesha as he controlled his aroused mind and put her in.</br>
</br>
"Please inject 300 L of nutrient liquid."</br>
</br>
The storage dimension opened as Jiang Chen took out five fist-sized black balls. Those were the concentrated forms of the nutrient liquid, its density was the same as steel. The cost of a single ball after the war was as high as ten crystals. So most survivors who had access to the Smart Medical Chamber would only choose to put one bag inside. Although the time would be longer, there was no difference in terms of effect. Since a cost of 50 crystals per treatment was not something typical survivors could afford.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't care.</br>
</br>
If it was not for the fact that only a maximum of five could be dissolved, Jiang Chen wanted to stuff more in so she could wake up faster.</br>
</br>
He injected 300 L of distilled water and dropped the five concentrate inside and put on the cover.</br>
</br>
The indicator flashed green as the drum device gently buzzed. From the transparent glass, the 300 L liquid already turned an emerald green color with a thick, gel-like consistency.</br>
</br>
"Treatment program activated."</br>
</br>
The breathing device was automatically attached to her and the cover of the medical chamber slowly closed to cover Ayesha's body. From the transparent part on the surface, the liquid was starting to submerge Ayesha until it completely surrounded her.</br>
</br>
A blue laser scanned her entire body and drew out her hologram picture at the top of the chamber, revealing areas that were damaged.</br>
</br>
"Estimated treatment time is 21 hours, please wait patiently."</br>
</br>
The soft announcement dragged Jiang Chen back from his astonishment towards the technology.</br>
</br>
If every single family had one of this, clinics and hospital can all close.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen exclaimed in amazement as he put his hand on the surface of the medical chamber.</br>
</br>
[Please wake upâ€¦]</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
21 hours passed by, Jiang Chen waited quietly beside the medical chamber.</br>
</br>
Ding-.</br>
</br>
A noise and the liquid level in the hibernation chamber slowly dropped.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the door opened.</br>
</br>
The gorgeous face with more life in it reappeared in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Slowly, Ayesha opened her eyes.</br>
</br>
Her eyes met with his. Sparkling teardrops swelled in her pupils. It was the first time Jiang Chen saw such a fragile expression on her face. A lot of criticism and blaming words were stuck in his throat and swallowed down.</br>
</br>
"My sleeping beauty, you are finally awake." With a smile, Jiang Chen extended his trembling hand and caressed her face.</br>
</br>
He almost lost her.</br>
</br>
He carried Ayesha out of the medical chamber and put a towel around her. Although she said she could do it herself with a blushed face, Jiang Chen demandingly carried her in his arms and then sat her down beside the bed to wipe off the droplets from her hair.</br>
</br>
"Don't do dangerous things ever again." Jiang Chen felt the softness he almost lost while he said with a tone of criticism.</br>
</br>
Ayesha buried her head.</br>
</br>
"I can't promise you that."</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Because, protecting you is the meaning of my existence, I am willing to- AHHH!"</br>
</br>
While Ayesha screamed, Jiang Chen threw her on the bed and slapped her firm butt.</br>
</br>
Pa!</br>
</br>
"Nooo-"</br>
</br>
A whimpering noise slipped out of her throat as her face instantly turned bright red, Ayesha gritted her teeth.</br>
</br>
With the burning sensation on her butt, she said with defiance.</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Why? You dare to ask me why? Do you know how worried I was?!" Jiang Chen said fiercely and raised his hand simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Pa!</br>
</br>
"Nooo!"</br>
</br>
Another whimpering noise, Ayesha twisted her body, a wronged mist covered her defiant eyes.</br>
</br>
"I, I was thinking for you-"</br>
</br>
"If you really are thinking for me, then while you take care of me, take care of yourself! Do you really think you dying would make me happy?! I would rather those bastards cause a mayhem here and escape than you becoming like this!"</br>
</br>
It was the first time Jiang Chen was angry at his woman.</br>
</br>
Pa!</br>
</br>
"Noooo!"</br>
</br>
The intense burning sensation made Ayesha struggle. Her eyes were filled with sparkling mist.</br>
</br>
In heavy breaths, Jiang Chen looked at the vivid "five fingers mountain" as he couldn't even endure the sight. His emotional state gradually stabilized.</br>
</br>
He stopped and used a more gentle tone.</br>
</br>
"Do you know why you are wrong?"</br>
</br>
"I know."</br>
</br>
"Why are you wrong?"</br>
</br>
"Iâ€¦ I shouldn't have tried to be brave. I was injured, I should have goneâ€¦" Ayesha's voice was mixed with a whimpering tone as she said while stuttering. The expression was just like a girl that made a mistake with her hand being slapped by the teacher's bamboo stick.</br>
</br>
"Gone where?"</br>
</br>
"The hospital," Ayesha said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhm," Jiang Chen said calmly.</br>
</br>
He was afraid. He was afraid that she would do something stupid for him. He didn't think Ayesha's thought process was a bit "dangerous" until three days ago when he realized his mistake.</br>
</br>
Even if it is Superman, how much combat power would be left if he lost blood?</br>
</br>
"Ayesha."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Ayesha replied faintly.</br>
</br>
"Do you think the purpose of your existence is to protect me?" Jiang Chen used a calm voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhmmâ€¦ Nooo!" Just as she replied with her head buried, her head raised again as she cried in pain.</br>
</br>
A slapping sound.</br>
</br>
Her butt had another five finger mountain added to it. It looked painful.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't bear the sight anymore. But he knew that he had to do it. If he doesn't change her perspective, she would kill herself one day.</br>
</br>
"You said, you were willing to be my bride."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Ayesha nodded with force.</br>
</br>
But her eyes were filled with grievances.</br>
</br>
"Then keep your safety in your mind, okay? Just for me," Jiang Chen looked into her eyes and said earnestly.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ Okay."</br>
</br>
She whimpered in a quiet voice with her head buried. She hid her face behind her dark brown hair. Her legs kneeling on the ground trembled for some reason.</br>
</br>
With how mistreated she looked, Jiang Chen let out a sigh and didn't say anything else.</br>
</br>
But then, an odd expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
The silvery silk, the water stain on the sheetsâ€¦</br>
</br>
[This girl, she-]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
He almost forgot that Ayesha was an M.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 417: I need a list</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Because of some reason, the lecture that was supposed to end was extended for another two hours. If it were not for a visitor, Ayesha's "grievance" would last for two more hours.</br>
</br>
Natasha was standing outside. If it was for Jiang Chen's instruction, Ayesha wanted to lock the girl outside.</br>
</br>
"Oh, recovered alreadyâ€¦What happened to you?"</br>
</br>
When Natasha walked into the mansion and noticed Ayesha's limping motion, she raised her eyebrows in confusion, but then she started laughing as she realized something.</br>
</br>
"â€¦" Ayesha looked at her coldly and stood beside Jiang Chen again.</br>
</br>
Natasha sniffed the air and looked dubiously at Jiang Chen on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Do you not welcome me?"</br>
</br>
"Very welcome." Jiang Chen exaggeratedly opened his arms and showed a welcoming gesture. Then he pointed at the vodka on the table with "please," "The vodka you wanted."</br>
</br>
Natasha grinned and sat across Jiang Chen as she leisurely crossed her legs.</br>
</br>
"You owe me vodka from Moscow, not vodka from Coro. Drinking hard liquid in the tropics is not a fitting scene."</br>
</br>
"Ayesha, lower the air condition temperature to Moscow temperatures."</br>
</br>
"No need, I'm not here for a party," Natasha rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen as she uncrossed her legs. "Country F's vice minister of national defense hired Arrow Military Company. The decision maker is F's presidential palace. They planned to kidnap you, and use your influence on the Xin government to force them to release the 41 prisoners.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Natasha, surprised.</br>
</br>
"KGB is on my side?"</br>
</br>
"KGB is on Russia's national interest side." Natasha smiled.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to obtain from me?" Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"It's only a friendly gesture, Kremlin thinks we have the opportunity to work closely together." Natasha shook her head. "If there is a condition, I wouldn't have disclosed everything to you from the start."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched Natasha without any change in expression; he didn't know what her plan was.</br>
</br>
As he was looking at her, she was also observing him with a grin.</br>
</br>
The eye contact lasted for half a minute before she said abruptly.</br>
</br>
"You are a man the KGB doesn't understand."</br>
</br>
"It's my honor then."</br>
</br>
"Do you not want to know why?" Natasha chuckled.</br>
</br>
"If you are willing to tell me," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"You can always bring out something amazing." Natasha looked at Ayesha," For example, an injury that would need a month of recovery time was healed in 24 hours."</br>
</br>
Precisely, it was 21 hours.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked apathetically at Natasha and was unmoved by her smile.</br>
</br>
"How many rats did you put on my island." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
"Only me."</br>
</br>
"Do you think I will believe that?" Jiang Chen glared at her.</br>
</br>
"Up to you." A smiling curvature appeared. The green pupils gazing into his eyes seemed to penetrate his soul.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment and then said.</br>
</br>
"Can I ask you a question?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"By telling me this information, is your intention making us disrupt the landscape in southeast Asia thus accelerating UA's strategy of returning to the Asia Pacific, therefore balancing your disadvantage in Veit and Syria?" Jiang Chen didn't dodge Natasha's eyes.</br>
</br>
Surprise flashed across the green pupils as Natasha looked quite interested in Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I want you to take the word disadvantage out. At least change it to equal."</br>
</br>
Therefore, not rejecting the first part?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I don't like being used."</br>
</br>
"You are not being used, it just happens that we share the same interest," Natasha swayed the hair on her shoulder and leaned on the sofa with her arms across her chest, "If I don't come find you, are you planning just to let go of your disobedient little neighbor?"</br>
</br>
"Then your purpose today?"</br>
</br>
Natasha's lips curved up, "Kremlin is willing to provide you with some support."</br>
</br>
A pillow just when you need it.</br>
</br>
Although without Russia, he also had the confidence that he could do it. However, with their support, it would indeed save him some costs.</br>
</br>
"Oh? That's perfect then."</br>
</br>
"First, let me be clear. We are not going help you on boring and useless things like assassinating the ministry of national defense or the president. Although KGB has some agents in country F, it doesn't mean we are willing to take the risk for you. The most we can do is to selectively provide you with some intelligence support." Natasha reminded him.</br>
</br>
"That's enough." Jiang Chen looked at Natasha with a smile, "I only need you to provide a list, the type with contacts."</br>
</br>
List?</br>
</br>
Natasha raised her eyebrows as she didn't know what Jiang Chen was planning.</br>
</br>
But when she heard the list that Jiang Chen was looking for, her eyes lit up immediately.</br>
</br>
"You are such a bad person." With a grin, Natasha smiled.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your compliment." Jiang Chen accepted the compliment without any shame at all.</br>
</br>
She stood up and walked to Jiang Chen in cat steps. Then she caressed Jiang Chen's chin flirtatiously.</br>
</br>
"Wait for my good news."</br>
</br>
Ignoring Ayesha's cold stare, Natasha stood in front of her and raised her head.</br>
</br>
"You've been standing for a long time, why don't you sit for a bit."</br>
</br>
"â€¦"</br>
</br>
A hint of embarrassment flashed through her cold pupils, but Ayesha quickly controlled her emotion.</br>
</br>
Natasha scanned her butt with other intentions before she left in quick steps.</br>
</br>
The door closed.</br>
</br>
Once she left, Jiang Chen asked Ayesha in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Did you leave any voice recorders?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, to Ayesha's anti-reconnaissance ability, he was confident.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out his phone and opened the monitoring function, the screen quickly switched to the camera in the garden.</br>
</br>
Natasha walked innocently to the gate of the mansion and didn't "touch" the flowers and plants along the way. But when she walked to the door, she stopped and blew a kiss to the camera.</br>
</br>
"This girlâ€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't help but shake his head.</br>
</br>
Ayesha gently dragged on Jiang Chen's sleeve.</br>
</br>
"She is a dangerous woman."</br>
</br>
"I know, That's why I didn't do anything to her that day." Jiang Chen referred to when he was in Donetsk.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was surprised too because it was the first time Ayesha was jealous.</br>
</br>
She seemed to have read Jiang Chen's mind as her face turned red and she rushed to explain.</br>
</br>
"Not because of jealousyâ€¦ I'm just afraid you'll be tricked by her."</br>
</br>
"Haha, am I the type that can't control my lower body?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
[Mhmmâ€¦]</br>
</br>
[Perhaps a little bit?]</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 418: Xin National Security Bureau</br>
</div></br>
A large number of tourists and immigrants flooding into Xin led to many unfamiliar faces filling the streets. Not only did foreigners bring their bills, but they also brought crime, drugs and even terrorism.</br>
</br>
The warm tropical climate made it easy for people to become complacent. Xin had a police force of 50 before, but the stable Xin didn't experience a lot of crime. Now, with their door opened to internationals, the Xin government had to introduce three changes.</br>
</br>
The police force increased to 200 people, added five police helicopters and twenty police vehicles from Australia, in addition to delegating Celestial Trade to form a national security bureau.</br>
</br>
The first two changes were meant to target typical criminals, but the last one was to fill the void in the national security protection of Xin.</br>
</br>
Xin must have its own intelligence department.</br>
</br>
And Jiang Chen clearly wanted to have a part in forming it himself.</br>
</br>
The newly formed intelligence department was named the National Security Bureau of Xin. It would remain independent of Celestial's management structure and directly report to Jiang Chen. As for the director position, after careful deliberation, Jiang Chen chose Ayesha.</br>
</br>
When it came to her abilities or loyalty, Jiang Chen had no doubt.</br>
</br>
"The director of national security?"</br>
</br>
At the dinner table, when Jiang Chen proposed this, Ayesha looked at him, perplexed.</br>
</br>
"Mhm. Xin must form its own national security department, and I want you to be the director," Jiang Chen said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was hesitant.</br>
</br>
"But I want to stay with you."</br>
</br>
"Being a director doesn't mean you have to be far away from me."</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen said this, Ayesha still had some concerns. She liked the life she had now without the need to appear in public frequently. She only needed to cook for her husband, drive for him when needed, and occasionally visit his parentsâ€¦</br>
</br>
"But I can't manage people," Ayesha said in a small voice.</br>
</br>
That is a concernâ€¦</br>
</br>
It was just like how a great athlete may not be a great coach, and the best coach may not be the best athlete. Ayesha's individual combat, reconnaissance, and anti-reconnaissance abilities were all strong, but she might not be able to manage an agent force equally well. Especially since she wasn't good at communicating with people, that would prove to be a significant obstacle to her being a leader.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to reconsider while scratching his chin.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked disappointed because she couldn't help Jiang Chen, but Jiang Chen quickly came up with a good solution.</br>
</br>
"How about this - could you help me train a group of agents?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha deliberated for a moment before nodding.</br>
</br>
"If it's just training, I can do that."</br>
</br>
"Okay then." Jiang Chen snapped his fingers. "I will post the hiring information on Celestial's website. After the deadline, help me pick 100 applicants with potential and train them to become qualified agents. Once training ends, you can choose a talented individual to become the director. Can you do that?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Ayesha agreed. It wasn't that hard.</br>
</br>
That afternoon, Jiang Chen sought out the logistics manager, Barkary, and explained the hiring information to him. But to Jiang Chen's proposal for posting it online, Barkary brought up one concern.</br>
</br>
"It might not be secure to post it online - there may be other agents hiding among the agents we end up hiring. Unless we can investigate the background of every applicant, it's hard to prevent something like this from happening. I propose that we do the hiring process by approaching people in person."</br>
</br>
Take MI6 for example - their hiring process at top university campuses was done by patting people on the shoulder. Usually, university professors working for the intelligence service would scout candidates then ask students to come in for a talk. If students were interested, they could join MI6 or they could choose to reject.</br>
</br>
Although this selection method was highly secure, the efficiency was lackluster. Jiang Chen refused to spend two to three years to select 50 agents.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I have my own method of investigating their background."</br>
</br>
[Funny, what secret cannot be revealed by truth-telling serum? Even senior KGB agents won't be able to withstand interrogation that way.]</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's explanation, Barkary didn't try to convince him further. He knew his boss had a lot of secrets unknown to him or methods he had yet to disclose to uncover people's backgrounds. He didn't need to be curious; he only needed to do his part of the job.</br>
</br>
Just like that, an interesting, or rather, a suspicious hiring post appeared on Facebook and Twitter.</br>
</br>
&lt;Do you want to do something meaningful? Do you want to escape a dull and routine life?&gt;</br>
</br>
Under these tempting words was a line of distinct red words, as well as a picture of the beautiful tropical island.</br>
</br>
&lt;Salary of ten thousand USD per month, and a plane ticket to the new world.&gt;</br>
</br>
The description of the position was as follows:</br>
</br>
"You must be acute in your observations and remember every detail you encounter."</br>
</br>
"You will frequently drive day and night, and you must be able to calmly maneuver any kind of road conditions."</br>
</br>
"You must be able to use only a tourist map to freely traverse between two points in a foreign country."</br>
</br>
"This job is prone to unexpected changes. Therefore, you must be able to make the best choice in the shortest time."</br>
</br>
"Because of job demands, you may not be able to contact your family for a prolonged period of time. Before you accept this job, please carefully consider this."</br>
</br>
"If you have thought everything through, please join us."</br>
</br>
"Perhaps you will be the next 007!"</br>
</br>
The posting also explained the number of people required.</br>
</br>
The number of positions was 100-150.</br>
</br>
The applicants had to be adults with complete civil capabilities. Males must not exceed a height of 185 cm while females must not exceed a height of 177 cm because taller people would be more conspicuous in a crowd, thus harder to disguise.</br>
</br>
No alcohol or drug addictions.</br>
</br>
Applicants with IT knowledge were preferred.</br>
</br>
After the applicants finished inputting their information, there was an additional test.</br>
</br>
The test was comprised of three games: finding a difference, audio, and reaction speed.</br>
</br>
Finding the difference tested for observational skills - applicants must find the discrepancies between two almost identical pictures in one minute.</br>
</br>
The audio test looked not at language ability, but rather the filtering of information. For example, one question was: "Eight people got on the bus, five people got off at the first stop, then nine people got on two stops laterâ€¦" Once the problem was done, the question asked how many times the bus stopped and how many people got on the second time. If the applicants only focused on how many people were left on the bus, then unfortunately, they were cut.</br>
</br>
The reaction speed test was pretty straightforward - it required playing against a fighting team to determine how high the applicants could score in reaction speed.</br>
</br>
After the three games were completed, the applicant's information and test result would be sent to Celestial Trade. Applicants would only need to wait for one week before they received a response.</br>
</br>
If they were hired, the applicants would receive a corresponding email with a ticket to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Then came the benefits.</br>
</br>
Agents in training would receive a salary of ten thousand USD per month. After 80 days of highly intensive training, the salary would increase to fifteen thousand USD without the need to pay income tax. Even in developed countries, this was a generous salary.</br>
</br>
An "exciting and wild" experience and a competitive salary.</br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen expected, the posting was only open for two days on social media before Celestial Trade received over one thousand applications. And this number grew exponentially in the next few days.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 419: The new Ghost Agent Recruits</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Something worth mentioning was that the teens and young adults were easy to trick.</br>
</br>
A society with great social benefits allowed people to be fed without needing to work, but it could also kill a person's drive. Why would so many foolish people run to IS to become sex slaves and soldiers? People in most developing countries thought it was incomprehensible foolishness. But from a different perspective, most were searching for excitement to appease the adventurist spirit hidden in their genes.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen was recruiting agents, not terrorists.</br>
</br>
In seven days, Celestial Trade received a total of 437,401 applicants from all over the world. Just like what Jiang Chen expected, most of the applicants were from western Europe, some were from Russia and even South America. Because of the influence of tradition, applicants from Asia and the Middle East made up only a small percentage. Due to the lack of internet infrastructure in Africa, the number of applicants from there was nearly zero.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased with this result. It would be against his intentions if he tricked his own people.</br>
</br>
After seven days of deliberation, Ayesha chose 117 qualified applicants from the four hundred thousand applicants and forwarded them to Celestial Trade. Immediately after, Barkary responded to the applicants and arranged plane tickets along with necessary documents.</br>
</br>
These people boarded different flights and finally arrived in Melbourne before taking a chartered flight to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
The third day.</br>
</br>
Under the bright sunshine, around one hundred lively figures walked out of the Coro airport. They had colorful luggage, wore beach clothes and slippers, and looked like a planned field trip group from a high school.</br>
</br>
They had varying skin colors, but most of them were white.</br>
</br>
The high number of foreigners simultaneously showing up at the airport made locals turn their heads. Even with the increasing number of tourists, this was not a common occurrence.</br>
</br>
On the street not far away, Jiang Chen asked Ayesha while facepalming:</br>
</br>
"Why did you just choose girls?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head and used a defensive tone:</br>
</br>
"Didn't you tell me to do as I wanted?"</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen didn't mind, in Ayesha's traditional culture, a qualified wife could not have excessive contact with men other than her husband, let alone lead training where contact was common. Therefore, even if 80% of the applicants were male, she stubbornly chose a hundred females out of the remaining 20%.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen trusted Ayesha so much, he didn't even ask for information about the selected applicants beforehand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was speechless as he let out a sigh, his head throbbing.</br>
</br>
"Okay. That's fine, just train them wellâ€¦ All in all, I'll have to count on you for this since I have to return to the other side soon."</br>
</br>
</br>
He was prepared to make a speech to the new recruits, but upon seeing all the chatty girls, Jiang Chen lost interest. He left Ayesha in charge and took off by himself.</br>
</br>
Staring at Jiang Chen's back, Ayesha nodded with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Her serious expression meant that the new recruits would suffer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't realize that the "Ghost Agents" who could make people tremble in fear were surprisingly born on this ordinary morning.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
When the girls got off the plane, they waited at the spot instructed by the email.</br>
</br>
For a lot of them, it was their first time leaving the country. Everything here seemed so refreshing to them. They exchanged names on the plane already, but now, they gathered in small groups taking photos and discussing how to spend their 80-day "vacation."</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade didn't make them wait for long - three buses appeared in front of them soon after their arrival.</br>
</br>
Six female soldiers in kinetic skeletons and an indifferent looking girl walked up to them. Ayesha called their names off her list. She crossed off the seven people who hadn't arrived, divided the remaining people into three groups, and assigned seating plans.</br>
</br>
While cheering, the girls loaded their luggage and boarded the bus as if this was a field trip. Then Ayesha and the six female soldiers all boarded their bus and signaled the first bus to start moving.</br>
</br>
Ayesha sat at the front of the bus in silence as she glanced at the talkative girls. Although the girls had yet to understand the situation, when they arrived on the island, she would make them understand that this was no joke.</br>
</br>
An Asian girl who was sitting beside a window quietly gazed at the scenery outside. In contrast with the rowdy crowd, she looked quiet and a bit left out of the group. The black hair falling over her shoulders looked silky. With her glasses, she really looked like a dedicated student.</br>
</br>
"My name is Penny. I'm from California, what about you?"</br>
</br>
Beside her was a blonde white girl who was chewing on bubble gum. She looked at her with a grin. Judging by her appearance, she seemed to have recently graduated from university.</br>
</br>
"Zhu Yu, Michigan," Zhu Yu said softly.</br>
</br>
Penny's eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
"Michigan? My grandma from my mom's side is from there too. I spent three years thereâ€¦ You don't like to talk?"</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu smiled peacefully.</br>
</br>
"Not exactly. I just don't know what to say right now."</br>
</br>
"You could say a lot of thingsâ€¦ For example, why did you choose to be an agent?" Penny attempted to make small talk.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu titled her head as she thought. "Because I want to live a life without studyingâ€¦ What about you?"</br>
</br>
"Me?" Penny laughed. "I want to live a life that doesn't involve having an endless amount of parties to attend. Of course, there's also the fifteen thousand salary."</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu smiled but didn't speak.</br>
</br>
Compared to her introvert personality, Penny was an extrovert.</br>
</br>
"Also, what were your test scores?"</br>
</br>
Penny was proud of her test scores as all three subjects were above 80. For her, a fresh university graduate, it was an unimaginable achievement.</br>
</br>
"91,98,100," Zhu Yu answered honestly.</br>
</br>
Penny looked at the high-school-looking girl with an expression like she just saw a ghost.</br>
</br>
"God, do you Asians know all the answers from the moment you're born?"</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu only smiled and didn't respond.</br>
</br>
She received too many compliments like this in school. The reason why she chose to leave home for this place was to escape her planned-out life.</br>
</br>
Although she was an adult now, she had to use a lot of courage to make the decision to leave the life planned out for her by her parents. But she believed that this decision would pay off.</br>
</br>
What she didn't know was that, within two short hours, she would start to regret her decision.</br>
</br>
Before signing the contracts, Celestial Trade repeatedly reminded the applicants that the job wasn't a joke.</br>

</br>
The three buses arrived at a hospital, and the girls were injected with an anti-virus vaccine there. After they were injected, however, they lost consciousness. Faintly, they heard people ask them if they worked for any intelligence service before, and they all responded truthfully.</br>
</br>
When they woke up, they realized they were on a boat.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh!"</br>
</br>
Penny screamed as she checked her clothes. After realizing she hadn't been violated, she seemed to calm down. The other girls on the boat all had the same reaction; any girls woken up from unconsciousness would first check their clothes.</br>
</br>
"What happened?' Zhu Yu had a frown.</br>
</br>
Although she was an introvert, in this unclear abnormal situation, she still felt a sense of panic.</br>
</br>
Then someone started to have a mental breakdown.</br>
</br>
"I knew it. This is too weird! They said they were hiring men and women, but only women were selected. I knew there was something fishy about that! I want to go home, dadâ€¦." A blonde girl kneeled on the ground crying while grasping her own head in agony.</br>
</br>
People started to stare at her.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, fear was contagious, especially in an enclosed space.</br>
</br>
One girl started crying, another was pounding on the window screaming, someone else tried to turn on their phone but the signal was clearly jammed.</br>
</br>
"The door is locked."</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu came back to sit beside Penny.</br>
</br>
"Why're you so calm? Maybe we will be sold as sex slaves to Africa." Penny's voice carried a hint of trembling fear.</br>
</br>
Even if they were sold, it wouldn't be to Africa.</br>
</br>
"Because there's no use in panicking." Zhu Yu shook her head and sat down.</br>
</br>
She was also afraid, but when she realized that being afraid wouldn't solve anything, she quickly calmed down.</br>
</br>
What the girls in the cabin didn't know was that their actions were all being recorded by the camera and viewed by Ayesha in the control room.</br>
</br>
&lt;That Asian isn't bad, she controlled her emotions quickly.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;That Italian is pretty good too, she's trying to comfort her friend.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Thatâ€¦&gt;</br>
</br>
Other than the camera, the EP on Ayesha' left wrist also displayed everyone's heartbeat.</br>
</br>
When they were injected with the truth-telling serum, an electronic collar was put on them. Until the private doctor Jiang Chen hired was familiar with spine neural injection technology, their electronic collar would be replaced with slavery chips.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was recording every person's reaction in this crisis situation while focusing on each person's development. This training knowledge was all obtained from her studies in the virtual reality training chamber.</br>
</br>
Because of the limited number of training chambers, the new recruits' primary training method would be physical training combined with the effects of the genetic vaccine; the virtual reality helmets would be the secondary method.</br>
</br>
</br>
After five hours of travel, the vessel docked at an island.</br>
</br>
The uninhabited island was five square kilometers in size, located at the easternmost edge of Pannu Islands. The island was covered in dense vegetation and had a hill in the middle. There was a hotel on the island which was now converted into a military camp.</br>
</br>
Six fully armed female soldiers opened the cabin door. Directly in their fearful eyes, they pointed their guns at the girls, forcing them to board the boats heading to the island. After ten trips, all 110 people finally reached the island.</br>
</br>
When they arrived on the island, Ayesha, in a captain uniform, appeared in front of the recruits. When they saw it was a girl in charge, everyone felt relieved, but their emotions also exploded.</br>
</br>
"Where's our luggage?" A blonde European walked up and questioned Ayesha in front of her face.</br>
</br>
Judging by her shirt exposing her belly and her pair of sunglasses, she seemed to be here on vacation.</br>
</br>
"You'll get it back after 80 days of training," Ayesha said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"80 days? You dare to confiscate our luggage?! You can't do that! I want to go home. I'm quitting now!" The blonde girl, who was half a head taller than Ayesha, spoke aggressively.</br>
</br>
"The terms were clearly stated in your contract - the moment you became an agent, you gave up your previous nationality and joined our group. You'll obey the order of the group, even if it means making personal sacrifices."</br>
</br>
The beauty's face instantly turned white; her lips trembled in fear.</br>
</br>
No one read the contract word by word, and even if they did, they merely thought those were typical clauses in a normal contract. Just like new soldier recruits, although their contracts stated that they might die, they wouldn't necessarily be sent to their deaths.</br>
</br>
"Th-that contract. That's illegal! You don't have the right-"</br>
</br>
"This is Xin; it's legal under Xin's law," Ayesha said apathetically.</br>
</br>
"You! Let me go!"</br>
</br>
The beauty dashed up and wanted to strangle Ayesha's neck.</br>
</br>
But Ayesha merely glared at her before she used one hand to clamp on the beauty's hand decorated with nail polish then swept her legs out from under her.</br>
</br>
It was a fluid motion.</br>
</br>
Before the beauty could react, she felt her world spinning around her then she was slammed to the ground. At the same time, a pistol was pointed at the back of her head.</br>
</br>
Witnessing this scene, a deafening scream erupted from the crowd as they moved away in fear. But behind them was the sea; they had nowhere to go. The boat that delivered them had already left, and the entire island was cut off from the rest of the world.</br>
</br>
The beauty's teeth shook, unaware that sand had slipped into her mouth.</br>
</br>
"No, no, don't kill me, I'm sorry!"</br>
</br>
"The captain has the right to execute any deserters. This is a warning." Ayesha pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
The beauty, curled up on the ground, quivered at the bullet hole two inches away from her face.</br>
</br>
Pungent smoke was still coming out of the bullet hole.</br>
</br>
"Ahh-!"</br>
</br>
An even louder scream came from the girls on the beach, but Ayesha watched everything expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
The mission Jiang Chen gave her was to train a group of agents capable of completing any mission; she would do anything to accomplish this.</br>
</br>
"Tie her to the tree. Let her go after 24 hours." Ayesha used a volume everyone could hear as she ordered the female soldier beside her.</br>
</br>
"Yes, Ma'am!"</br>
</br>
The female soldier walked up in front of everyone and dragged the beauty, struggling to escape, to the coconut tree on the beach.</br>
</br>
Ayesha closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
She wasn't a cruel person, but when the occasion called for it, she wouldn't have any excessive mercy either.</br>
</br>
Even if Jiang Chen ordered her to kill everyone here, she would do it without any hesitation.</br>
</br>
"This deserted island is 200 nautical miles away from Coro Island. If you think you can swim there, I'll remind you that you may encounter sharks along the way. I believe you have all noticed an electronic collar around your neck by now - it will record your location information and heartbeat. To the person who is trying to cut it off with a nail clipper, you can stop now. Any attempt to destroy the collar will trigger the self-destruction mechanism, just like this.</br>
</br>
As she spoke, Ayesha tossed a collar on the ground and threw a dagger at it.</br>
</br>
The sharp dagger cut through the collar and it blew up in everyone's face.</br>
</br>
"Although the amount of explosive is small, it is more than enough to take a person's head off. Any betrayal will trigger the self-destruction mechanism, so please follow the terms of the contract you signed about your commitment to loyalty."</br>
</br>
"You will receive 80 days of training on the island. During this period, you have no freedom or rights; your superiors' orders are absolute."</br>
</br>
"80 days later, you will obtain your new identity and officially become a member of the National Security Bureau of Xin. You'll transition into different roles based on your performance. Fifteen thousand USD per month will allow you to have endless Martinis just like Bond. To live that life, it is a given that you have to suffer nowâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu listened to Ayesha's orders and let out a sigh. It sounded like she was reading off a script.</br>
</br>
Like she expected, these people were serious.</br>
</br>
They followed the six female soldiers acting as the assistant trainers to the hotel on the hill then picked up the keys to their rooms. The girls were excited when they saw the luxury hotel â€“ based on the design, it was probably a five-star hotel.</br>
</br>
But by the second day, all their excitement vanished.</br>
</br>
They crawled in mud and over uneven rocks and reefs with their hands tied behind their backs, did push-ups beside the beach, and did sit-ups on the burning sand. If someone couldn't withstand the training, the punishment was ten laps around the beach. The electronic collar would record their location information, so any shortcuts or slowing down would be faced with severe punishment.</br>
</br>
Although the training was torturing, Ayesha knew clearly that without this training to hone their endurance and will, they would kill themselves during their missions. Although she didn't experience this training herself in the real world, the training in the virtual reality training chamber was no less taxing on her mind.</br>
</br>
The training chamber could not be revealed to the public, and the virtual reality helmet wouldn't familiarize people with pain accurately enough, so they had to train physically.</br>
</br>
At night, when they dragged their weary bodies back to the hotel, they were forced to put on the helmet and use it to learn all kinds of theories and practice working with weapons.</br>
</br>
When they first saw the famed virtual reality helmet, everyone widened their eyes in astonishment. Especially when they realized the helmet's technological superiority to modern-day VR equipment, their amazement was inexplicable.</br>
</br>
But Ayesha didn't give them the leisure to appreciate the helmet after they put it on; the virtual reality training started immediately.</br>
</br>
Weapon usage, combat simulation, theory training.</br>
</br>
The things learned during sleep would save a lot of time and ammunition.</br>
</br>
Other than their cruel training, the girls had to endure disgusting food. It wasn't that the chefs' cooking skills were terrible, but rather, there was no chef on the island.</br>
</br>
Every meal was something called Grade-A nutrient supply. Different from the nutrient supply sold on the market for weight loss, it was the "imported" stuff brought by Jiang Chen. Although it didn't taste like anything, it was enough to provide the calories and vitamins needed.</br>
</br>
But the fun of eating was no longer there.</br>
</br>
The only thing that comforted the girls was their one-hour routine bath before they slept.</br>
</br>
The bath water had some kind of odd stuff that looked green. Although the color looked suspicious, it was surprisingly relaxing to bathe inside. The tingling sensation produced felt so good that they wanted to moan.</br>
</br>
After their bath, everyone discovered in surprise that their sunburned and cut skin was repaired to be smooth again. The black pigment and toxins in their body seemed to have dissolved in the bathwater since the bathwater turned a dark green by the end.</br>
</br>
Other than that, their sore bones became refreshed again as if they received a new skeleton entirely. This kind of relaxation was ten times better than sleeping.</br>
</br>
As to what was inside the bathtub, it was the nutrient liquid normally used inside the training chamber. It was also the most expensive kind at 40 crystals per kilogram.</br>
</br>
These grain-sized particles were commonly used in the training chamber. Not only would they increase body coordination and reflex, but they could also allow the abilities learned in virtual reality to sync with their real bodies. But even if the nutrient liquid was used alone, it was a great product to alleviate soreness, remove toxins, and strengthen the body.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen invested heavily in these agents.</br>
</br>
He knew that the investment would absolutely pay off.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 421: Exchanging Intelligence</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xin's agent training was all being conducted on the deserted island. Other than boats hauling over necessary supplies every week, the island was separated from the rest of the world. Because of this, in the next 80 days, Jiang Chen didn't have the opportunity to see his adorable Ayesha at all.</br>
</br>
But while Ayesha was busy training the female agents, Jiang Chen didn't sit around.</br>
</br>
A force of agents alone couldn't make up the entire intelligence department.</br>
</br>
Logistics, organizational structure, phone monitoring, customs monitoringâ€¦ All these would require employees. Of course, while Barkary did most of the work in the formation of these functions, Jiang Chen was also involved in the process.</br>
</br>
And the formation of these departments would require the cooperation of internet companies, customs, police and other government agencies, in addition to Jiang Chen's abilities to encourage cooperation between these agencies.</br>
</br>
Also, Jiang Chen logged into the email provided by Xie Lei. After he downloaded the file, he brought it to Yao Yao in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Although there was no password book, due to the computational power of the supercomputer as well as the techniques known by artificial intelligence, Yao Yao only spent two days to complete the deciphering of the file, or rather, "archeology."</br>
</br>
Based on what Yao Yao said, it would take a long time, but it wasn't tiring.</br>
</br>
After he read through the deciphered document, Jiang Chen had a frown on his face.</br>
</br>
Willie society was indeed monitoring him and started doing so approximately three months ago. As to the reason, it wasn't explained in the document. It only vaguely stated that the purpose was to record the sea activity of Celestial Trade as well as the supply consumption of New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
Because the leak was only present for a short period of time without even reaching New Moon Island, the information leaked was all non-sensitive information.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Willie society as an organization had a weak presence in East Asia. Since the organization started off as a NATO puppet used to cause trouble for the Soviets, its major area of operation was mostly in Kane nowadays. If they wanted to penetrate Xin, that would be a wild dream.</br>
</br>
After they confirmed the identity of the spy, Jiang Chen transferred the information of the spy to Ivan and captured the mole inside Celestial. But Ivan, unfortunately, told him that the person quit a month ago. Based on the information at customs, the person left the country soon after he resigned.</br>
</br>
One month ago happened to be when Xie Lei obtained the information. Perhaps realizing his identity was exposed, the spy immediately fled when he received news that the information leak was uncovered. When Xie Lei sent the information about the email, the spy had escaped already.</br>
</br>
There was nothing they could do other than urging Ivan to investigate all the employees carefully. Jiang Chen granted the usage of a small amount of truth-telling serum at critical times to prevent the infiltration of spies again.</br>
</br>
</br>
It would be a lost cause, but necessary nonetheless.</br>
</br>
After these incidents were dealt with, it was nearing the end of July already. Based on the information from Xia Shiyu, the virtual reality's internal test spots were nearing the end of the distribution. The first group of internal test players would arrive in Xin by the end of July at the latest. With that completed, Jiang Chen was prepared to go back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
But before he left, he planned to teach F a lesson.</br>
</br>
He had been waiting for the list Natasha promised him.</br>
</br>
Now, there was finally some progress.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
At the door of the mansion.</br>
</br>
"Where's your little beauty?"</br>
</br>
"She's busy." Jiang Chen welcomed Natasha inside and smiled.</br>
</br>
"For example, training agents at a secret base?" The tip of Natasha's lips curled up as she said this dubiously.</br>
</br>
"Who knows?" Jiang Chen neither denied nor agreed.</br>
</br>
"We suspect that three Russian citizens went abroad for a special position," Natasha said with narrowed eyes.</br>
</br>
"Possible. Although Celestial Trade hired a group of agents, all applicants are adults who maintain their civil abilities," Jiang Chen said, without revealing any information.</br>
</br>
It was up to him in Xin to say who was legal or not. Based on Xin's laws, other than the law stating 18 was the legal age, the court could use a source of stable income as a criterion for granting legal status or not. When they arrived in Xin, the future agents would automatically become Xin nationals.</br>
</br>
"That's fine; I'm not here to look for people," Natasha said as she stuck two fingers out and took out a list in front of her chest then handed it to Jiang Chen with a grin. "The list you wanted."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen reached for it, but Natasha moved her hand.</br>
</br>
With eyebrows raised, Jiang Chen looked at her questioningly.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to express something?" Natasha teased.</br>
</br>
That look seemed to be hinting at something.</br>
</br>
Unless his brain was shut down, Jiang Chen wouldn't choose to engage in a deep conversation with a KGB woman.</br>
</br>
He curved his lips up. Jiang Chen didn't do as Natasha wished. Instead, he took out his phone.</br>
</br>
"Give me your email address."</br>
</br>
Natasha looked skeptically at him and told him her email. Soon after, an email was sent to her phone.</br>
</br>
"Thisâ€¦" When she opened the email, her eyes were instantly astonished.</br>
</br>
"A Willie society agent with identity confirmed escaped from Xin to France a month ago. The rank in the organization is currently unknown, but I think the KGB might be interested. Also, this password book is related to some documents from Veit. You mentioned we can cooperate in intelligence." Jiang Chen just sent the picture and information of the Willie agent as well as the password book Yao Yao created by deciphering Natasha's email.</br>
</br>
Although Xin didn't have the ability yet to capture the mole that escaped, a cat that could stretch its paws there would be more than enough.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen found the polar bear also interested in Willie society.</br>
</br>
"Of course I'm interested, our agent will warmly welcome him for a shot of vodka in the Black Dolphin Prison. Also, thanks for your password book, this is a great help." Natasha smiled and then walked briskly to the door.</br>
</br>
Black Dolphin Prison, the infamous prison. Jiang Chen mourned for the poor guy for half a second.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't get to read more about KGB's influence in Western Europe, from Natasha's reaction, the KGB seemed to be confident with capturing the agent whose identity was exposed.</br>
</br>
Natasha was walking to the door but stopped in her tracks as if she suddenly remembered something. She turned around and added:</br>
</br>
"Also, the ships and submarines you purchased will arrive in December. You can now organize the crew to receive training in Moscow. You have to take care of your own accommodations and food."</br>
</br>
"They will be there in seven days."</br>
</br>
"Also, to create trouble for your neighbor, do you need Russian weapons?"</br>
</br>
"No, we already solved the weapon problem." A smile surfaced on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Since it would cause a problem for the UA ally, it was more fun to use UA weapons.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 422: The Reunion with Robert</br>
</div></br>
</br>
MLL Island was the fourteenth biggest island in the world and the second largest island in country F. It was also the island with the most frequent terrorism, hence the name "the home of terrorism."</br>
</br>
There were two anti-government militant groups in country F currently, one being "Moro Liberation Front" (MLF) and the other being "Moro National Liberation Front" (MNLF).</br>
</br>
The latter was previously the strongest anti-government militant group, but because of internal conflicts and a decrease in foreign support, it broke into three separate divisions with two of the divisions supporting the establishment of autonomy in the MLL area while the other division promoted the separation of MLL from country F to form an independent country. The former group, the MLF, was currently the largest anti-government military force in F with ten thousand people, originating from the MNLF division that supported independence.</br>
</br>
Due to the pressure from regional conflicts, the F government signed an initial agreement with the MLF in 2012 and promised to form the "Federation of Moro" on MLL island to the south of country F. What was worth noting was that it wouldn't be an independent country but rather an autonomous area under F with more self-governance.</br>
</br>
Then the question was: although country F satisfied MLF's political demands, it completely ignored MNLP's demands. At the same time, even in MLF, there was a loud faction demanding the formation of an independent country, refusing to maintain the "sub-country" status quo.</br>
</br>
Thus, after the Aquino government prepared to sign the peace agreement, MLF separated from MNLF. The founder of MNLF, Sauli, immediately expressed his opposition to the signing of the peace agreement and threatened to start another military conflict.</br>
</br>
He obviously wasn't lying as a tragedy occurred in 2013 - 300 MNLF militants attacked a city located in the west of MLL island and engaged in heavy fire with the local forces.</br>
</br>
Until 2016, the MLL anti-government militants refused to cease fire.</br>
</br>
From Google maps, all of country F was like a shredded puzzle - any force could rip it apart. To unite the divided nation, Aquino had to maintain a strong stance internationally and blow national security issues out of proportion.</br>
</br>
Promoting patriotic beliefs in the country to strengthen the cohesion of the nation had been a useful tactic since the age of colonization.</br>
</br>
However, it was only useful at best.</br>
</br>
In the first step to destroy country F, Jiang Chen planned to start with MLL Island. As the second largest island in country F, not only did the island possess rich mining resources, but it had the most violent ethnic and religious conflicts. He didn't even need to add fuel to the fire himself - he just needed to give the people eager to light up a pile of wood the lighter they ever so desired, and they would frantically rush to light up the bonfire known as a coup.</br>
</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Before Jiang Chen headed to country F, he first flew to South Africa and met his old friend Robert.</br>
</br>
Compared to when they met in Iraq, this guy was a lot paler; at least people wouldn't mistake him for an Indian anymore.</br>
</br>
His life in Hollywood was sensational. The moment he saw Jiang Chen, he gloated to him about having Hollywood girls keeping his bed warm every day. He then put his hand on Jiang Chen's shoulder and invited him to visit Los Santos someday.</br>
</br>
It was easy to become a producer in Hollywood. With money, anyone could hang their name on the credits of a movie. After he helped Jiang Chen with Pannu Islands, he received his "film salary" of one hundred million USD. A few parties in Los Santos later, he became the star of the Hollywood "upper class," and his girlfriend count increased from one to multiple.</br>
</br>
After they did some catching up, Robert hailed a taxi and took Jiang Chen to the warehouse located in the rural area of Abington.</br>
</br>
It contained 12000 assault rifles and 90 tons of ammo, 1700 RPG-7 rockets and 150 launchers, boxes of M2 grenades, bulletproof vests, night-vision goggles and other equipment.</br>
</br>
Also in the corner of the warehouse were twenty-something mortars and thousands of mortar rounds.</br>
</br>
Firearms totaling 60 million USD were piled into a mountain in the giant warehouse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked by the number of firearms.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that Robert managed to hoard this quantity of arms in South Africa; the equipment was enough to equip a fu*king battalion. Did the South African government really have no clue?</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen was inclined to believe that Robert pre-cleared the way to customs.</br>
</br>
"This is the last batch of my supplies." Robert closed the warehouse door and handed the key to Jiang Chen then lit a cigarette. "I've stayed away from the firearms business since Iraq. I was planning to sell it at a discount to the dictator in West Africa, but since you need it, it's yours."</br>
</br>
"Not much difference â€“ they'll end up in the hands of a dictator either way." Jiang Chen took the key and joked.</br>
</br>
Robert grinned. "Let's have a drink?"</br>
</br>
"My plan too." Jiang Chen gladly accepted his invitation.</br>
</br>
They found a restaurant in the rural area of Abington city then ordered a table full of South African dishes and a few bottles of beer. They began to chat.</br>
</br>
Robert had many interesting experiences to share partly because he was humorous, but mostly because of his wealth of experience.</br>
</br>
This guy started the firearms business with Mexican gangs when he was 17. One day, by chance, he managed to connect with the national security force. He went from being in the firearms business in Veit to selling crude oil in Iraq, from being the kingpin of the industry to being blacklisted by the FBA. Because he met Jiang Chen in Sanya who was eager to get rid of the gold, he, fortunately, survived the FBA's master plot to kill him through other hands. That was what made him choose to leave the industry and become a producer.</br>
</br>
As they chatted, Jiang Chen exclaimed that this guy's experience could be compiled into a book.</br>
</br>
"Once I'm 50, I'll film an autobiography. I have the name already: let's call it 'The Merchant of Death,' burp-" Robert said with high spirits.</br>
</br>
"With how fast you spend money, you'll have to pick up your old gig by 40."</br>
</br>
Robert grinned then he shook the cup in his hand. "Eh? Not at all. If you manage to become a big deal in Hollywood, the future is not less bright than trading in firearms. Have you heard that the  that will be in theatres by December? Remember to look for my name in the credits."</br>
</br>
[Will normal people see that? Without post-credit scenes, most people leave by the start of the credits.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to discourage his old friend's passion for the film industry, so he diverted the topic and asked nonchalantly:</br>
</br>
"Where's Nick? Why didn't he come along?"</br>
</br>
"He's in the acting industry now." Robert chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Acting?" Jiang Chen thought he heard wrong.</br>
</br>
"That's right, he's been with me for so many years. Now that I'm not in the business anymore, I couldn't let him starve. His fighting ability is great, a natural for action movies. I recommended him to a director that I know pretty well. After a few years of training, maybe he will become a top Hollywood star one day. Anyway, it's a lot better than being a bodyguard." Robert laughed while he burped.</br>
</br>
"Acting in films? Not a bad exit option."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his cup with a smile and toasted Robert.</br>
</br>
After the dinner, it was seven in the evening already. Because there was still a party to attend in the afternoon, Robert booked a flight back to Los Santos at ten at night, so the two said goodbye.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched the taxi Robert was in to leave then headed to the warehouse.</br>
</br>
He confirmed that there were no suspicious figures following him before he shut the door.</br>
</br>
With the warehouse full of firearms, he took a deep breath, put on the bracelet Lin Lin gave him, then opened the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
He left the warehouse after he transferred everything to the other side.</br>
</br>
With the door locked, he broke the key into two pieces and threw it in the trash. Then he left the dark alley without turning his head.</br>
</br>
His flight was that night too.</br>
</br>
The next stop, country F.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 423: Dismember Country F</br>
</div></br>
Country F, in a remote town on an island.</br>
</br>
In a small restaurant, three F citizens in grey sweaters sat around a table.</br>
</br>
"What time is it?" The man with darker skin glanced at the door and asked his companions in a low voice.</br>
</br>
The person being asked looked at his watch. "It's already 1."</br>
</br>
The chubby man that didn't speak inhaled deeply and anxiously pulled on his collar.</br>
</br>
"Santos, do you think that person will come?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know, I don't trust the Han," Santos said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
The chubby guy moved his fat lips, didn't comment on Santo's words and just leaned on the chair. As to why they would appear here, it had to do with a phone call they received last night.</br>
</br>
The people who sat here were all top officials of MNLF. Although most of the force of MNLF was stationed on MLL Island, their headquarter was on a small island next to MLL Island.</br>
</br>
Santos was just about to doze off when an unknown number reached his phone. After careful deliberation, he cautiously picked up the phone. But when it went through, the person on the other side didn't introduce themselves and directly said he wanted to provide weapons for MNLF.</br>
</br>
From the accent, the person on the phone should be Han.</br>
</br>
To the olive branch extended by the Han, Santos was somewhat cautious. In Country F, 1% of the Han controlled over 60% of the economy. No one liked to be around their wealthy neighbors.</br>
</br>
But that person's offer was too hard to reject.</br>
</br>
It was enough weapons to equip an army.</br>
</br>
What shocked him, even more, was that the person said the weapons were transferred into the country already.</br>
</br>
With the weapons, MNLF's shortage of arms would be significantly alleviated. He could quickly build a force of 7000 from his supporters and increase the strength of the guerrillas substantially.</br>
</br>
But what made Santos cautious was that it was a Han that made the offer, and the Han knew all the details about him, he even stated the hotel room he stayed in.</br>
</br>
Of course, to prevent his phone number from being tracked, Jiang Chen didn't state which hotel in which city.</br>
</br>
Cold sweat rolled off his forehead. Due to the heated internal conflict, Santos finally agreed to his request to meet. The police didn't come to his door; it at least explained that the person on the phone didn't have any hostility.</br>
</br>
Therefore, this scene happening now occurred.</br>
</br>
After he secretively deployed soldiers around the restaurant, Santos and his two close officials sat in the restaurant. They sat in the private room the person arranged, ordered two dishes, and carefully waited for the other person to come.</br>
</br>
But it was already the time they had arranged.</br>
</br>
"He fooled us," the chubby guy said.</br>
</br>
Santos closed his eyes and deliberated for a moment. "Wait ten more minutes. If no one comes, we'll leave."</br>
</br>
</br>
But just as he finished his sentence, someone knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
The person with the watch instinctively moved to his waist, seeing Santos shack his head, he put his hands back on the table again.</br>
</br>
"Please come in," Santos spoke to the door.</br>
</br>
The door opened, but it was a ten-year-old boy that came in.</br>
</br>
Seeing the people in the room all look at him in surprise, the boy timidly brought out the tablet.</br>
</br>
"Someone asked me to bring this here."</br>
</br>
"Where is that person?" Santos gazed with deadliness into the boy's eyes.</br>
</br>
With a frightened expression on the boy's face, the boy shook his head fiercely. His hands holding the tablet trembled uncontrollably with words rapidly spitting out. "I don't know, he had a mask on. He gave me 10 USD and asked me to bring this here."</br>
</br>
Then the boy carefully placed the tablet on the sofa beside the door and he quickly ran out.</br>
</br>
Without regard to the boy, Santos signaled the chubby guy to bring the tablet over.</br>
</br>
And then, the phone rang again.</br>
</br>
Seeing the caller, Santos picked up and said with a low but menacing voice, "What tricks are you playing with me?"</br>
</br>
Without wasting a word, Jiang Chen directly said.</br>
</br>
"There is a map on the tablet, the password is 1234, you can try to open it."</br>
</br>
Though frowning, Santos still followed the instruction and opened the map.</br>
</br>
"And then?"</br>
</br>
"There are eight armories in total. They are hidden in the rural area at the southern area of the country," Jiang Chen said with eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"Where are the armories?" Santos asked briskly.</br>
</br>
"You notice the checkboxes beside the map? For every mission you complete, I'll provide you with a password, every time you input a password, you can unlock the location of the 'treasure.'"</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k does that mean?]</br>
</br>
Santos took a moment to process this while he cursed in his mind. "What's the purpose of you doing this?"</br>
</br>
"I'm providing you with firearms and cash to support your cause, not as a chip in negotiation with the government force. I want to see you separate MLL island from the country's territory. Do you understand what I mean?"</br>
</br>
With his eyes lighting up, Santos attempted to convince him.</br>
</br>
"I promise I will bring Moro people to independence, you can absolutely trust me!"</br>
</br>
"Haha, the most worthless thing in the world is trust, especially to two strangers." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Then why should we trust you?" Santos said with gloom in his voice.</br>
</br>
"So I decided to pay first." Jiang Chen shrugged. "The first password, ad2ge#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1135513f3f3f">[email&#160;protected]</a> After you input the password, you will unlock the location of an armory, and also a mission brief. Complete it. After I confirm it on the news, I will tell you the next password."</br>
</br>
"That's all I have to say, good luck."</br>
</br>
"Wait!" Seeing that the person was about to hang up, Santos who just inputted the password wanted to stop him, but only silence followed.</br>
</br>
After stuffing his phone into his pocket, Santos looked on the tablet with gloominess on his face.</br>
</br>
"Boss, what do we do?" The chubby guy asked in a low voice.</br>
</br>
Santos looked speechlessly at the red dot located in Ludink town. He was silent. Then he said.</br>
</br>
"Kard, take people to the location on the map."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The man with the watch stood up and memorized the location on the map in his head.</br>
</br>
Santos closed his eyes and sunk into the chair.</br>
</br>
He didn't like the feeling of being manipulated. But the generous offer was irresistible. If Jiang Chen provided all the arms to him at once, he would indeed choose the safer option. For example, first, form a force, and prepare for a year before he launched an attack.</br>
</br>
Not long after, his phone rang.</br>
</br>
He picked up with Kard's tense voice.</br>
</br>
"Boss, we found it."</br>
</br>
"How much stuff is inside," Santos said in an urgent tone.</br>
</br>
Kard's throat felt dry, "There are bulletproof vests, night vision goggles, and even C4s. We also found 2000 rifles, 40 boxes of rifle ammo, 10 RPG 7 with 100 roundsâ€¦ and five mortars, also with 100 rounds. As well as five million USD in cash."</br>
</br>
Firearms! Five million USD!</br>
</br>
Santos sat up abruptly. The hand holding the phone shook violently. "Immediately arrange people to transport it to our gathering spot."</br>
</br>
"Understood!" Kard nodded.</br>
</br>
Kard was his confidant, he trusted his loyalty.</br>
</br>
He hung up the phone and ignored the question on the chubby guy's face. He scanned the mission brief on the tablet.</br>
</br>
&lt;Target: City PJ. Destroy the police station, power station, government building, and kill at least 80 government forces.&gt;</br>
</br>
Santos licked his dry lips. He felt his heart beat faster.</br>
</br>
If he followed it, it would be the biggest attack planned by MNLF since 2013. And with the firearms and cash support, MNLF could easily conduct this attack.</br>
</br>
But then, there would be no backing out.</br>
</br>
A trace of hesitation crossed his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by fervent. He made up his mind.</br>
</br>
It was time for a major headline.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 424"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 424: Smoke and Dust</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Yesterday, the anti-government militant launched a surprise attack on the city of Gadian, west of MLL Island. The attack destroyed four police stations, two bus terminals, two government buildings and two power stations in the city. This caused a massive outage in the city center."</br>
</br>
"The two sides exchanged heavy fires in the north side of the city which caused 311 casualties with 101 dead. Five hours after the attack, the MNLF was declared responsible for the attack and stated their commitment to the liberation of MLL Island.</br>
</br>
"Based on our sources, a total of 1000 militants participated in the attack. The anti-government militants were equipped with M4A1 assault rifles, night vision goggles as well as other UA weapons. They also possessed large quantities of RPG-7 anti-armor weapons as well as mortars and other heavy weapons. The attack could be the biggest attack in 30 years. The sophistication of the weapons even surpassed the local government force. While the source of the MNLF's weapons remains a mystery."</br>
</br>
"12 hours after the attack, the Aquino government denounced the attack and condemned the organization that provided the anti-government force with the weapons. They'll consider the possibility of sending an armored force to clear out the local guerillas at MLL Island and search for the perpetrator behind the attack at all cost."</br>
</br>
"Experts stated that this attack marked the collapse of the peace agreement reached between the F government and MLF in 2012. The Aquino government sending a force to MLL Island may receive the opposition of the MLF under the peace agreement. But without increasing the military presence, the local stability may continue to deteriorate which will put the Aquino government in a tough spot."</br>
</br>
"Military analysts suggested that the F armor force could not utilize its full strength in the rough terrains of MLL Island. Even with the armored force, the opposition is equipped with anti-tank weapons which would drastically reduce the effect of the deployment. The Aquino government's primary concern is to understand the source of the anti-government militant's weapon. They must strengthen their border control to prevent the situation from further deteriorating."</br>
</br>
"The UA spokesperson stated that UA will continue to follow the development of this attack and is willing to assist in the investigation of the weapon source. When the reporter questioned if UA is willing to send out ground forces to assist country F in its military actions against the MLNF, UA stated that they would not consider intervening with country F's domestic affair. However, they don't rule out the possibility of sending out reconnaissance drones to support country F's military actions."</br>
</br>
"From 7 o'clock today, the Ministry of Tourism issued a red alert on traveling to country F and recommend travelers with a plan to travel change or cancel their plans, or avoid tension areas where guerrillas may be active."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Yang Yong reporting at the scene."</br>
</br>
The TV showed the footage of government forces firing behind covers. Although they didn't manage to capture footage of the attackers, from the grenades flying, the debris left by the bullets, as well as the unclear screams in the background, it was more than enough to know the gruesomeness of the attack.</br>
</br>
There were constant explosions and smoke rising in the distance. It was nearly impossible to avoid civilian casualties by using a killing tool like mortar in the city center. The government force must be cognizant of the consequences of accidentally wounding civilians, but the anti-government militants didn't need to have the same concern.</br>
</br>
A few stretchers moved by the street and ran to the temporary medical clinic set up beside the armored vehicle. The windows to the shops on the road were all shattered, people taking advantage of the situation swarmed into the store and grabbed whatever they could.</br>
</br>
A lot of people will die.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen will not seek forgiveness.</br>
</br>
He was not coldblooded, but instead, country F was asking for it. They selected the reckless government and promoted reckless behaviors among the civilians, and then the attack on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Everything was just the price they must pay.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned on the sofa and turned off the TV.</br>
</br>
It looks like Santos made the right choice, saving Jiang Chen a lot of trouble. The MNFL's guerrillas have been in a state of conflict with the F government for 44 years, and it was the first time they received military assistance of this scale. They finally left their mark in history.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen had no positive feelings toward the MNLF or F. He only needed this pawn to separate the annoying neighbor. Once Moro was entirely independent, he will pocket the rich Iron, Copper, and Gold reserves on MLL Islandsâ€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out the phone he bought at a random store on the street, texted a message, and sent the next password to Santos.</br>
</br>
Since he already fulfilled his promise, he'll not be stingy on the reward. With the second batch of equipment, the MNLF will upgrade to the next level.</br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen expected, he only needed to throw the lighter into their hands before they lit the zoo on fire.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the satellite phone on the table began to ring.</br>
</br>
Without thinking, he knew it must be Robert. The satellite phone was Robert's special line for special services and was absolutely secure in theory.</br>
</br>
When he picked up, the old friend's voice came through.</br>
</br>
"My friend at FBI asked me for a chat."</br>
</br>
"What did you talk about?"</br>
</br>
"Just random things, for example, what I did when I went to South Africa? Who did I see?" Robert said with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What did you tell him?"</br>
</br>
"What could I say? I said I went to take care of the shell company thereâ€¦ Buddy, I'm not joking, but you went pretty far this time." Robert took a deep breath and lowered his voice. "Terrorism has always been the bottom line for the Rainbow House, especially in their allies' territory. Although they haven't agreed on sending in the ground force, the CIB agents are already investigating."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen contemptuously scorned.</br>
</br>
The definition of terrorism has always been a double standard. The anti-government militants in UA's allies border are terrorists and separatists, and the anti-government militants in UA's enemy territory are freedom fighters, nationalists.</br>
</br>
The CIB agents? Santos doesn't even know who he traded with. Especially since Jiang Chen pointed out his whereabouts were exposed, as long as he is not dumb, he will hide carefully. The CIB won't be able to catch him.</br>
</br>
Robert sensed the contemptuousness from Jiang Chen's scorn and sighed.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'm not calling to ask you to stop, I just want to remind you to be careful. I wasn't the only one being asked to have a chat, a few other arms dealers still in the scene were also there. Transporting arms from South Africa to Southeast Asia would have to go through multiple countries' airspace, and thus it is impossible to do it without leaving a trace. There won't be enough time to do it by freight, so I'm not too suspiciousâ€¦ Although I don't know how you transported it to country F, instinct tells me that it has something to do with you."</br>
</br>
"But I will never admit." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Never admit." Robert said sternly, "Never let the Capitol know that it was you that did it, or we are both dead. Dammit, if I knew you were going to do this, I would have sold it to the dictator in West Africa. Now, there are a few more thousand people that would die indirectly because of me."</br>
</br>
In the end, Robert's voice was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I did this discreetly. Didn't you say you wanted to shoot a biography called "The Merchant of Death"? Now I added another event to it," Jiang Chen comforted him in a casual voice.</br>
</br>
After hanging up, Jiang Chen stretched, threw the phone to the side, and got up.</br>
</br>
It was already to the end of July. He'll have to return to the apocalypse by early August at the latest. He missed Sun Jiao and them quite dearly after being away for so long.</br>
</br>
But before his returns, he still had a few things to do.</br>
</br>
He took his private boat to New Moon Island and found Ivan who was training new recruits. He did a brief audit of the soldiers' ability before he told him to recruit 300 sea crews as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
Before he left, Jiang Chen gave the phone that he used to communicate with Santos to Ivan and told him to read the news in the morning and then provide the password based on the mission status Santos was able to complete.</br>
</br>
Since he would be in the apocalypse for a while, he should give the task of "causing a stir" to someone he trusted.</br>
</br>
After all this, Jiang Chen headed to Coro Island and transported the iron and aluminum produced in July to the apocalypse. It was too inefficient to transport the ores, it was much better to transport the processed product.</br>
</br>
With this batch of steel, there was no need to worry about the supplies for the factories in the apocalypse. There were plenty of iron and aluminum to forge the C-type steel, and the extra could be sold to the factories in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Then, he also made a visit to headquarter of Future Biology to understand the sales of nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
All in all, this month's financial result was stellar.</br>
</br>
A profit of one hundred million USD for the month!</br>
</br>
The 200,000 boxes of nutrient supply produced around the clock were delivered in two batches; the remaining 200,000 would be completed by month end. With Future 1.0 and massive retail chains like Walmart's promotion, nutrient supply easily entered people's sight.</br>
</br>
Pure natural green degreasing liquid food, lose 30 pounds in 30 days. With Emma's advertisement, based on the feedback from the retailers, the sales of the nutrient supply were extremely pleasing. All the retailers increased their order and the bigger chains even offer to obtain exclusive sales right to the nutrient supply at a high price, but Tao Ming rejected the offer.</br>
</br>
The reason was simple, there was no reason to abandon an entire forest for a single tree. Selling the exclusive sales right meant that they would have to give up on the e-commerce platform and other retailers. It was not a good trade.</br>
</br>
After Tao Ming reported the sales number, he urged Jiang Chen to increase capacity on the production line. Orders flew to Future Biology like snowflakes as all the workers in the nutrient supply factory were pushed to their limit, but still unable to meet the increase in demand.</br>
</br>
Based on Zhan Shujie's estimate, to meet the production demand, the production equipment and seaweed farm must at least double.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. The organic converters were hard for him to obtain.</br>
</br>
When he moved the production equipment and ten tons of inducers to the warehouse on Ange Island, Jiang Chen left for Coro Island. The rest of the hiring and other tasks will be taken care of by Zhan Shoujie.</br>
</br>
But on his way home, Xia Shiyu called.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard her voice, he was extremely delighted</br>
</br>
The internal test plan was finally completed!</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 425: Godly Land Internal Testing</br>
</div></br>
Wei Wendong, known as Shadow King, was an honorary member of the King's Esports Club as part of the League of Legends team runner-up in the S4 series. After the S4 he chose to retire from the scene and became a streamer, but surprisingly had a lackluster performance in the streaming world.</br>
</br>
But because he grasped on the historical opportunity of &lt;New Era&gt; coming online, he boldly chose to become a mobile game streamer that didn't seem to have a future. He finally used &lt;New Era&gt;'s influence, stunning game content, and first mover advantage to become the leader in New Era streaming.</br>
</br>
Right now, New Era's market penetration had already far surpassed Heartstone, and even edging out the PC platform League of Legends, his influencing in the streaming world obviously increased because of that as his follower on Weibo was comparable to his old captain.</br>
</br>
Therefore, half of his achievement today was because of Future Technology. So to the name that changed the lives of many, he had a strong connection to the company.</br>
</br>
Just sometimes ago, Future 1.0 suddenly had a pushup notification which perked his interest.</br>
</br>
&lt;Dear valued users, Future Technology's current under-development VR MMORPG &lt;Godly Land&gt; is in internal testing phase! To support the users' continuous support, Future Technology decided to draw 2000 internal testing players to the tourist destination Pannu Islands, tour the beautiful Pacific and experience the astonishment of the era-defining MMORPG.&gt;</br>
</br>
The internal testing phase will be two months. In this period, the player can obtain 2000 USD in monthly salary with flight and accommodations covered by Future Technology. After the internal test, participants will receive a collector game helmet. The helmet will be sent to participants on the first day of the official release.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the name used in the internal test will be retained in the official release.</br>
</br>
Virtual reality MMORPG? Free international travel?</br>
</br>
Disregarding the international aspect first.</br>
</br>
With the release of this news, it erupted among domestic forums as the netizens all expressed Future Technology's lunatic move.</br>
</br>
The 2000 USD monthly salary, no one really cared about. People who were not dumb all knew that by being the first in obtaining information about the game, guilds would kill for you to join them. Even if you didn't join a guild, with the experience through the internal test, it was easy to make a living through the game.</br>
</br>
The profit by that time would far exceed 4000 USD! Even the most foolish person would know.</br>
</br>
Just take New Era, for example, professional players could make ten thousand easily through taking players to level up and selling gold. If they obtained legendary equipment, rich players would often pay millions just to get their hands on it.</br>
</br>
</br>
Almost no one questioned the fact that the Godly Land had a future without a ceiling.</br>
</br>
On a forum:</br>
</br>
"Virtual reality MMORPG? I can't believe I can see this in my lifetime? Let me go calm down first."</br>
</br>
"Are the officials of Future Technology stupid? Playing games with this kind of technology? If this is used to train soldiers, our soldiers' combat ability will increase by ten levels! The military budget for training would be reduced by 50%! But you use it to make games, what a disgrace!"</br>
</br>
"What a dumba*s!"</br>
</br>
"The second comment poster just connected to the Internet? Virtual reality technology is already mature overseas. Plextek's virtual reality equipment is already used in training by the British forces, but it has yet to replace the whole training process. I don't know where you got the ten levels of 50% data from. Also, Eve's VR equipment could already simulate intergalactic travel, if VR is as insane as you have described, why don't you go up in space?"</br>
</br>
"I just want to know where the public beta is! I'm not selected. QQ."</br>
</br>
"Asking for internal testing spot for one million RMB, message if interested."</br>
</br>
"The internal spot is connected with your ID, you really can't buy IQ with money."</br>
</br>
"â€¦"</br>
</br>
The posts on the game's official website already exceeded twenty thousand on the first day. It was evident that the players were all eager for the virtual reality MMORPG.</br>
</br>
As to the game itself, Future Technology left enough mystery to it and only released a one minute CG as well as a portal for the draw. Before the draw, the players must confirm that they can head to Pannu Islands. If the player cannot attend, they will be banned for ten years once the game is online.</br>
</br>
With anxiousness, Wei Wendong pressed the button.</br>
</br>
With the number of participants in the draw continuously increasing, he didn't have too much hope. But happiness suddenly came around the corner when he managed to obtain a spot!</br>
</br>
When he saw the notification &lt;Please confirm the availability during internal testing period&gt;, he pressed yes without hesitation, then uploaded the screenshot to Weibo which instantly caused an explosive reaction among his fans.</br>
</br>
&lt;Damn! The Shadow King is switching games?"</br>
</br>
"What about streaming?"</br>
</br>
"The Shadow King definitely did butt stuff with the president, Jiang Chen. No way he would be this lucky!"</br>
</br>
"Brother Shadow King, could you bring me there, I'm cute, and I can warm the bedâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong looked at the fans' envious replies as he lips curled up. He ignored the comments filled with jealousy. While his vanity was fulfilled, he thought about how to grasp the opportunity.</br>
</br>
The only information provided by the game designer was a one-minute cinematic trailer with an ancient Oriental and Western background. There were warriors, archers, mages, thieves, and a lot more.</br>
</br>
In New Era, Wei Wendong chose an archer, but he planned to change his style and play as a mage. Since it was virtual reality MMORPG, the mage would definitely feel more powerful compared to physical damage dealers! Anyone could swing a sword and shoot an arrow in real life, but who could throw a fireball?</br>
</br>
But just as he was planning how he would spend the two months, his phone began to ring.</br>
</br>
"Who is calling me this late?" Wei Wendong glanced at the darkness outside and picked up his phone.</br>
</br>
When he saw the caller, he was stunned. It was his formal boss calling him, the big boss of King, Wang Tao! Wei Wendong was deliberating on what made the boss call him personally as they didn't have any contact for over a year.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, Little Dong, do you still remember me?" Wang Tao said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Of course, how is Boss Wang doing?" Wei Wendong chatted with his old boss.</br>
</br>
"Doing well, oh, do you have any interest in returning to Kings?" Wang Tao asked.</br>
</br>
[Return to Kings? Play League of Legends? Who plays that anymore?]</br>
</br>
Wang Tao seemed to have sensed Wei Wendong was about to reject as he immediately dropped a mega bomb.</br>
</br>
"Twenty million, yearly salary."</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong held his breath.</br>
</br>
[Twenty million, damn, two times the premium!]</br>
</br>
Even as a streamer with the highest earning potential, Misaya was only worth twenty million. Although Wei Wendong's influence and reputation were not far off, New Era was not a game that could easily pump up the viewership as competitive games do. It is less common for the viewers to give "666 (1)" compared to LoL, therefore his yearly income was only nine million.</br>
</br>
"But boss Wang, I don't want to scam you, my LoL skill has already-" Wei Wendong squeezed the words out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
The offer was attractive, but he knew his skills well.</br>
</br>
"Who is asking you to play LoL." Wang Tao laugh, he paused, before he asked in a quite reserved voice, "Is the screenshot on your Weibo real?"</br>
</br>
"Screenshot?" Wei Wendong came to a realization.</br>
</br>
Kings made the wrong judgment call when New Era first came online. Wang Tao initially thought the game had a great promotion with great graphics, but it was still lackluster compared to the dominate LoL kingdom.</br>
</br>
Therefore, while Kings did form a New Era division in the beginning, it didn't invest in too many resources. But then, once the guilds that invested heavily rose with the rise of New Era, Kings began to regret their decision, but it was too late. A bunch of esports clubs with a name no less than Kings spawned out. A club named Conquerors was almost edging Kings out as the dominant club in Hua.</br>
</br>
Therefore this time, Wang Tao would not miss the &lt;Godly Land&gt; ship!</br>
</br>
Everyone knew that the big trend on internet development was virtual reality. PC games were on a downward trend, and Future Technology was the leader in domestic artificial intelligence technology. With the release of this Godly Land, it was combing their competitive edges together. The throne of Tencent's empire might not be so secure after all.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, none of Kings member obtained an internal test spot.</br>
</br>
Although Future Technology provided some spots for the major guilds in New Era, the spots were mostly targeted towards guilds with major influence. What made Wang Tao frustrated was that the Kings' Guild had no influence in New Era at all.</br>
</br>
He threw in some money a few months ago, but it only managed to bring the guild to above average. Compared to the top five in the server, there was still a noticeable difference.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Wei Wendong's Weibo post made him see hope.</br>
</br>
Professional player plus internal test participant! It was easy to foresee that this guy's future in the Godly Land was bright. Therefore, Wang Tao immediately called him and extended an offer to the ex-member.</br>
</br>
Wang Tao coughed, used a serious tone, and spoke to Wei Wendong with sincerity.</br>
</br>
"The Kings Esports Club sincerely wishes for your return and bring Kings our formal glory. Also, you'll be the guild leader of "Godly Kings", are you interested?"</br>
</br>
The guild leader of the Kings guild.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong's eyes widened. He didn't think the always cautious formal boss would bet on such a risky move.</br>
</br>
-With Kings' resources as well as his own professional ability, and the experience as an internal playerâ€¦</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath as he felt his heart pumped furiously.</br>
</br>
The feeling of one step to heaven was just like this.</br>
</br>
"Yes. I'm very interested!"</br>
</br>
"Welcome home, my Shadow King." Wang Tao laughed out loud.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 426: The Open Ceremony on the Cruise</br>
</div></br>
From Wanghai to Melbourne, then boarding a luxury cruise from the port of Melbourne to Xin.</br>
</br>
The luxurious cruise contained a self-serving restaurant, bar, pool, gym, net cafe, store, medical center, club, and a luxurious grand hall big enough to serve 2500 guests. With twelve levels and exquisite interior design, the place was not just a six-star hotel, but also a giant amusement park.</br>
</br>
Inside the grand hall of the cruise, every single one of the 2000 players attended. Everyone here was a diehard fan of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
When selecting players, although it was stated to be equal in opportunity, Future Technology did include some indicators for guidance. For example, players with longer play time in New Era were more likely to be chosen; the same was for players with higher VIP.</br>
</br>
Other than the 2000 players, the remaining people were staff members on the cruise and the employees of Future Technology. Because it was not a news conference and only a ceremony for internal testing, Xia Shiyu rejected the media's request and just arranged three Future 1.0 news reporters to record the ceremony and conduct some interviews with the players.</br>
</br>
Full tables of champagne, courteous servers.</br>
</br>
In the grand hall, the luxurious atmosphere made Wei Wendong gasp for air. Although his income was close to tier one celebrities, people who play games typically stayed at home without spending too much time outside. Before he came, he prepared a rather expensive suit, he felt it didn't match the environment.</br>
</br>
But when he saw the players around him completely stunned, he quickly got used to the feeling.</br>
</br>
Compared to the other poor suckers, he was an elite among them. A lot of people wore just a T-shirt in the middle of the grand hall; they were the definition of not understanding the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Among the players, he surprisingly saw a lot of familiar faces.</br>
</br>
For example, a pro player from the Conquerors guild, and a streamer on the same platform as him</br>
</br>
Since only 1500 spots were open globally, the remaining 500 spots were all gifted by Future Technology to guilds with influence or to streamers with high influence.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to chat with the people he knew, the lights suddenly dimmed.</br>
</br>
People began to whisper to each other while waiting for the official start of the ceremony.</br>
</br>
Then, on the previously dimmed podium, a spotlight suddenly appeared. Jiang Chen in a suit walked in confident strides from the back of the stage to the podium. The light followed his footsteps and presented him in front of the crowd.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen came emptyhanded to the stage. But behind the podium was a giant 1050 inch screen and in the middle of the screen was Future Technology's logo.</br>
</br>
&lt;We lead the future&gt;</br>
</br>
When Wei Wendong saw him, he widened his eyes.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was known as the Bill Gates from the east, the president of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"Wow, look, look, it's Jiang Chen!" A streamer with big boobs gently covered her mouth as she dragged on to the new friend she just met and exclaimed with excitement.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ So young." A female pro gamer blushed.</br>
</br>
"The president of Future Group is personally here," a player said in shock.</br>
</br>
".,.."</br>
</br>
The players below the stage all took out their phone in excitement and snapped photos of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
To the excitement of the players, Jiang Chen smiled along and said in a joking voice, "You can take photos, just remember to turn off flash, or else once the internal testing is over, I won't give you a signature."</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen spoke in Han, a lot of international players were confused, but those who understood laughed.</br>
</br>
The female player with flash on turned off the flash with her face completely red.</br>
</br>
Seeing the atmosphere was appropriate, Jiang Chen signaled everyone to quiet down.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time he came up without a script.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he was used to people being in awe, with the 2000 something people in front of him, he didn't feel any emotional fluctuations.</br>
</br>
He calmly adjusted the earpiece in his ear and smiled at the players. "To all the players attending this ceremony from all over the world, welcome!"</br>
</br>
Just as he finished his sentence, the triangular logo on the screen exploded, the explosion formed into millions of dust particles and turned into words.</br>
</br>
Those were translations in English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Korean, and Arabic!</br>
</br>
The international players were all complaining in their mind that they didn't understand Han. But when the words were displayed, they finally felt relived.</br>
</br>
Then, their eyes widened.</br>
</br>
Real-time voice translation!</br>
</br>
It had been a technical challenge to be able to conduct real-time voice translation through a computer. Although Microsoft launched a software called Touch-Talk, the software was weak for long and fast sentences. But the technology displayed by Future Technology was obviously not on the same level as Touch-talk.</br>
</br>
It not only could accurately translate in a noisy environment, it could automatically translate to reflect the tone of the message!</br>
</br>
"Where is the applause?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The stunned players were dragged back into reality and all gave Jiang Chen a thunderous applause.</br>
</br>
When they thought about it, they were no longer shocked. Since it was a tech company that created an artificial intelligence like Little White, it would not be too tough for the artificial intelligence to do this.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood on the stage and waited for the applause to stop with a smile. He then continued, "Today, Future Technology will bring everyone an era-defining technology. Let us witness this historical moment togetherâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his right hand. Light particles emerged and became concentrated in his opened palm and formed a motorcycle helmet. The people below the stage all had their eyes wide open and shockingly witnessed this moment.</br>
</br>
Hologram technology!</br>
</br>
â€¦Okay, it was not a fascinating technology. But it was indeed a stunning performance by Future Technology, the helmet hovering in Jiang Chen's hand seemed to really be there.</br>
</br>
"Virtual reality. Future Technology has always been striving for innovation, whether in software or hardware. I know all of you shouldn't be unfamiliar with virtual reality games, even when you are dreaming, you still fantasize about having a pair of wings to take you anywhere, to be able to be part of an exciting adventure on a continent filled with swords and magic."</br>
</br>
He stared at the faces with expectation and enthusiasm and smiled pleasingly.</br>
</br>
"Now, I am pleased to announce to everyone, this is no longer a fantasy, it is a now a reality!"</br>
</br>
Everyone held their breath with excitement and hope emerged from their eyes.</br>
</br>
"Now, let us first see a video, and get to know the virtual reality helmet named "Phantom." Jiang Chen walked down from the stage and sat on the open seat reserved for him.</br>
</br>
The translation on the giant screen faded, just like waves on a lake returning to peace.</br>
</br>
Immediately, a man with a figure similar to Jiang Chen appeared in the middle of the screen, he put on the helmet and lied on the bed.</br>
</br>
The scene flashed, in the blink of an eye, it changed from God's view to "Jiang Chen's" first-person perspective and was observing the inside of the helmet.</br>
</br>
"Activated."</br>
</br>
The pitch black internal helmet screen suddenly lit up. Countless particles flashed forward in a three-dimensional manner. Everything had clarity as if it really existed.</br>
</br>
"Iris verification program activatedâ€¦"</br>
</br>
"Registered as a new user."</br>
</br>
"Registeringâ€¦"</br>
</br>
"Genetic code registered, please set the name."</br>
</br>
"â€¦"</br>
</br>
Till this point, the players' emotions were rather stable without anyone being shocked. Right now, Future Technology had yet to demonstrate the difference between this VR equipment and the rest of the VR equipment on the market.</br>
</br>
But by the next second, everyone was stunned.</br>
</br>
The light on the screen began to turn dark, it was if people closed their eyes and fell asleep.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the scene cleared up. An epic symphony played, butterflies flew and stopped on the finger of an elegant elf. She looked towards the world outside of the forest; it was a human state.</br>
</br>
The sharp blade edge was accompanied by a soul-stirring war hammer chant. Soldiers roaring leaped at the Ogres defense lineâ€¦ but then was shattered by the wolf knights' iron hoofs.</br>
</br>
In the distant mountain, dragons roared. A dragon knight flew down from the peek. The scorching fire unleashed its fury and tore down the defense of the Ogres.</br>
</br>
Everything seemed so real.</br>
</br>
What shocked everyone was not the vividness of the pictures, but the feeling of being in the game.</br>
</br>
Could it beâ€¦</br>
</br>
"The virtual reality helmet in novels! It is not the garbage VR equipment on the market. You could fly!"</br>
</br>
"God, this is too unbelievable! This astonishing technology is born in the hands of a Han company."</br>
</br>
"Nani? Isn't this the NERVGear in Sword Arts Online? And Future Technology created it!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patiently waited for the players to unleash their astonishment and exhilaration, waiting until the crowd began to die down. Then he raised his hand and signaled the crowd to look at him.</br>
</br>
"The video included how to use the Phantom virtual reality helmet, as well as the complete version of the cinematic trailer. As to the exact content of the game, please wait until you arrive at Pannu Islands and use your own eyes to experience the beauty of this virtual reality MMORPG."</br>
</br>
"Now, I announce the official start of the two-month internal test!"</br>
</br>
"Please enjoy your time on the cruise, the food and alcohol are complimentary. This is Future Technology's way of saying thanks to all participants from all over the world."</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
As the last syllable finished, an explosive applause abruptly bellowed towards the stage as Jiang Chen left the stage.</br>
</br>
The grand hall was lit up again, and elegant music began to play as people were finally dragged back to reality.</br>
</br>
"So handsomeâ€¦" A girl in a long dress holding her phone said while staring at the podium.</br>
</br>
The blush on her cheeks could either be from the makeup she used, or the fantasy in her mind.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong not far away mocked in his mind.</br>
</br>
"The light is already on, but people are still in their dreams."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 427: Investment Euthanism</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Young, rich, "single," easy going, Jiang Chen naturally became the center of the ceremony.</br>
</br>
With a bunch of girls surrounding him, a lot of female streamers with "excellent balls" chatted with him which made the male players all envious of the scene.</br>
</br>
It made sense since if they could manage to dig a wealthy man like this, it was not working how many years less, it was working how many lives less.</br>
</br>
But at Jiang Chen's level, the typical girls didn't interest him anymore. He nobly accepted the toasts of the beauty, but to the obvious hint, he didn't suggest anything.</br>
</br>
Because he only knew one foreign language, he didn't chat much with the international players. Instead, he spoke with some of the renowned domestic players.</br>
</br>
A player called Wei Wendong suggested to him important events such as annual or monthly tournaments. Once the MMORPG has a competitive element, player's desire to practice skills and the subsequent user stickiness would drastically increase.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the suggestion to heart and indicated he would consider adding it in the public beta.</br>
</br>
A lot of times, experienced players may know more than the developers about the pros and cons of a game. Even if they haven't started playing it yet, at least they know what they want to play.</br>
</br>
A British player also asked Jiang Chen about the price of the helmet and the pay model of the game. Jiang Chen didn't answer it as he only stated that before the game's official launch, Future Technology would reveal the information during a press conference.</br>
</br>
After spending half an hour in the grand hall, seeing that there were more and more people gathering around him, Jiang Chen had no choice but to leave.</br>
</br>
He felt that if he stayed any longer, it would become a press conference instead.</br>
</br>
But there was one question he didn't answer.</br>
</br>
It was whether the game was made with VR equipment such as sensor vest and gloves, or the immersive virtual reality described in anime, novels, and movies.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only had one response.</br>
</br>
"You will understand everything the moment you put on the helmet."</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The cruise was not heading straight to Coro Island. The trip was to go slowly from Melbourne toward the coral sea, dock in the Solomon Islands, and then go through New Guinea waters, before heading to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
The three days cruise trip cost Jiang Chen seven million USD. It was partially to create news to hype up the game's release, partially to provide advertisements for tourism at Coro Island.</br>
</br>
When he returned to his room, he immediately lied down, stretched out on the bed, and began to burp. Then he loosened the tie around his neck.</br>
</br>
[What does it feel like to be drunk off of champagne?]</br>
</br>
He didn't know whether he was burping because of the alcohol, or because of being too full.</br>
</br>
</br>
His phone rang. He took out the phone.</br>
</br>
It was Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"You're drunk?"</br>
</br>
"A bit, what's up?" Jiang Chen unbuttoned two buttons in the front of his chest as he tried to cool himself down by waving his hand.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I want to ask you how is it going over there," Xia Shiyu said in a considerate tone.</br>
</br>
"Absolutely perfect." Jiang Chen cockily chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Okay, looks like you're really drunk." Xia Shiyu facepalmed. "I have something serious to talk about, are you free right now?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu cleared her throat and began to report.</br>
</br>
This is what happened.</br>
</br>
InterContinental Hotels Group, Hilton International Hotel Group, Jumeirah, St. Regis, Four Seasons and other five-star hotels operating internationally renowned enterprises have also sent a letter of intent to Future International, hoping to cooperate in this development project.</br>
</br>
For example, they wanted to cut a slice of the pie in the tourism hotel infrastructure.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was more than welcoming because he couldn't make all the money himself. But what confused him was that based on the current situation, Standard, and Poor, Moody and Fitch Ratings all downgraded Xin's Sovereign credit rating, why was there still so many corporations in favor of investing in Pannu Islands?</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu heard Jiang Chen's question, she gave a professional explanation.</br>
</br>
Just like the stock's trade volume is opposite of the company's quarterly report and the credit agencies' rating. The risk is always propositional to reward. Country F is amidst a civil war without any energy to focus on the prisoner situation. The terrorist attack in Xin had caused the investor's desire to cooldown, but Celestial Trade's emergency announcement of 200 million USD in the establishment of the national security department reignited investors' interest with its decisive and robust policy.</br>
</br>
The investment was a bet on expectations. And the liveliness demonstrated by Xin was indeed worth their investment.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, based on Xin's strong stance toward country F as well as the tension escalating in the South Sea, the hostility between Hua and country F would continue to escalate. Since the "enemy's enemy is a friend." Hua was most likely to favor Xin. The diplomatic relationship between societies would most likely be reflected economically, it was especially more prominent in patriotic Asia.</br>
</br>
Therefore, once the 8.7 billion USD infrastructure and tourism resources development projects were completed, it would trigger an in flood of Han dominated tourists. With consideration to the mild weather, fantastic scenery, wealthy Han tourists, and high-paced economic growth, it was easy to foresee that as long as the new regime remains stable. This place would become the Maldives of the Pacific!</br>
</br>
"Also, Xia Shiyu."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"Are you interested in becoming the CEO of Future Group," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ Do you really mean it or are you just drunk?"</br>
</br>
"I really mean it," He forced the burp down and said earnestly.</br>
</br>
With a flushed face, Xia Shiyu put her hand on her elbow and changed the hand she was holding the phone one.</br>
</br>
"Could I know the reason?"</br>
</br>
She wanted to hear "I want you to stay by my side".</br>
</br>
"Because I trust your ability," Jiang Chen said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"â€¦"</br>
</br>
The other side of the phone was silent for half a minute. Just as Jiang Chen was confused why she didn't say anything, Xia Shiyu let out a wry sigh.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ Once the virtual reality project is on the right track. I'm the most familiar with its plan, and I don't trust other people enough to handle it."</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
After he hung up the phone, he flung his phone onto the pillow.</br>
</br>
[It feels lonely without Ayesha beside him. Maybe he should go find Sun Jiaoâ€¦ Mhmm, it is not the best idea to attempt interdimensional travel on a cruise ship. There is no guarantee I won't end up in the sea by the time I return.]</br>
</br>
[Maybe I should take a shower to sober upâ€¦]</br>
</br>
As he thought this, he sat up and walked to the bathroom.</br>
</br>
But then, the doorbell rang.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 428"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 428: Probe</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With his eyebrows raised, Jiang Chen walked to the door and turned on the small TV screen installed into the wall.</br>
</br>
The view from the camera outside the door turned on - it was a woman in server's clothes. She had a European face. Under the cap was curly brown hair and outside the purple vest was a silver name tag. She held a tray with cups and champagne and she looked into the camera with a smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that the white shirt underneath the vest had the first two buttons undone. There were also two crystal cups on the tray.</br>
</br>
She seemed to be hinting at something.</br>
</br>
"I didn't remember ordering champagne. I want to puke at the sight of it," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"Sir, you'll need it," the female server said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, her Han was fluent.</br>
</br>
Staring at the deep trench, Jiang Chen felt thirsty.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to welcome me in?" She used a flirtatious tone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows. With a slightly intoxicated mind, he opened the door.</br>
</br>
The female server walked in with cat-like steps and a trace of what seemed to be pheromones. She walked by Jiang Chen with the tray.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he tried to guess what game she was playing.</br>
</br>
"I don't think you're a server."</br>
</br>
She put the tray on the nightstand. The beauty poured the liquid into the two crystal glasses as she spoke seductively.</br>
</br>
"If I didn't pretend to be a server, your bodyguards wouldn't let me approach this room."</br>
</br>
"Then who are you?" Jiang Chen said with doubt as he walked behind her.</br>
</br>
"Your female fan."</br>
</br>
"I don't fu*k my fans."</br>
</br>
The beauty rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen. She turned around and made contact with his chest while elegantly holding onto a glass. She placed her right hand on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Are Han men always this uncourteous?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently squeezed her left hand.</br>
</br>
"Then I should courteously ask you to leave?"</br>
</br>
"It's not courteous to reject a lady; you should courteously carry me into the washroom." She leaned closer to Jiang Chen's ear as she let out a warm breath.</br>
</br>
With a tingling sensation in his lower body, little Jiang Chen raised his head.</br>
</br>
Sensing Jiang Chen's change in demeanor, the tips of the girl's lips raised up.</br>
</br>
[Who is this girl?]</br>
</br>
"I don't even know your name." Jiang Chen's eyes flashed as he played with and squeezed her small hand as she spoke into his ear.</br>
</br>
"Isn't that exciting? You just need to know that I'm one of the 2000 players you invited." The beauty bit Jiang Chen's ear as she whispered.</br>
</br>
[One of the 2000 players?]</br>
</br>
"I don't remember seeing you at the ceremony?" Jiang Chen carefully recalled the ceremony in his head but he had no memory of her at all.</br>
</br>
"You can't remember all 2000 players. After tonight, you'll only remember me."</br>
</br>
</br>
The beauty raised the glass and took a small sip of the champagne as she kissed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The liquid was exchanged through their long French kiss. Jiang Chen used this opportunity to grab her by the waist.</br>
</br>
Their lips parted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned while breathing heavily.</br>
</br>
"I need to check to see if you have any illegal items on your body."</br>
</br>
"Sir, I'm glad to assist you." The beauty unbuttoned her shirt.</br>
</br>
Her purple vest and white shirt dropped to the ground. With a smirk, Jiang Chen carried her into the bathroom.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The sounds of water dripping on the ground accompanied by what seemed like hand-clapping echoed in the room.</br>
</br>
It was an intense battle.</br>
</br>
The beauty laid on Jiang Chen's body with redness all over her face. She breathed rhythmically while her finger drew circles on his muscular chest.</br>
</br>
"Are you thirsty?"</br>
</br>
"A little bit." Jiang Chen caught his breath and grinned.</br>
</br>
"I told you that you were going to need it." The beauty covered his mouth and grabbed the champagne on the nightstand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and reached for it, but she dodged him.</br>
</br>
"Let me feed you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged and just laid down. The beauty held the liquid in her mouth and approached him.</br>
</br>
He didn't know if it was his imagination, but the concentration of alcohol in the champagne seemed a bit high. He had sobered up after their exercise, but after a few gulps of the champagne, Jiang Chen felt a bit drunk again.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel sleepy?"</br>
</br>
"A bit."</br>
</br>
"What's the color of my underwear?" The beauty teasingly said while lying next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Purple." Jiang Chen yawned wearily.</br>
</br>
He still could remember this detail.</br>
</br>
"Then, what about the Golden Apple?" The beauty asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
[Blackâ€¦ Wait!] Jiang Chen immediately realized that he needed to maintain his intoxicated appearance.</br>
</br>
"Of course it's golden." Jiang Chen chuckled and slapped her firm butt.</br>
</br>
The Golden Apple was, of course, black, but if he revealed its true color, the situation would've taken a drastic turn.</br>
</br>
Just like he suspected, the girl's identity wasn't simple.</br>
</br>
KGB? No, Russia and Xin were in a honeymoon phase.</br>
</br>
Willie Society? Possibly. Rothschild family? Possible too, but unlikely, since Carmen just loaned him 30 billion, he wouldn't do something that would naturally strain their relationshipâ€¦</br>
</br>
What other organizations? CIB? MI6? Since the KGB knew about the Golden Apple, there was no reason why the NATO intelligence department that controlled Willie Society wouldn't know either.</br>
</br>
A distinct disappointment flashed across the beauty's eyes, but it was quickly hidden by a smile on her red lips.</br>
</br>
The technology possessed by Future Technology was enough evidence to suspect that Jiang Chen could have the Golden Apple and consequently the technology from the future. She slipped drugs with a sleeping effect into the champagne, so if Jiang Chen was unsuspecting and under the influence of alcohol, he couldn't possibly lie.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't give the right response, and his expression didn't change eitherâ€¦</br>
</br>
Could it be that the technology he possessed really was the work of his team?</br>
</br>
The beauty was a bit lost.</br>
</br>
Just then, she received her superior's command from the earpiece hidden inside her ear ordering her to end the mission and prepare to retreat.</br>
</br>
Her superior also believed that the Golden Apple wasn't in Jiang Chen's possession.</br>
</br>
"Are you a Christian?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, if my body wasn't injected with a genetic vaccine, I definitely would've said something I shouldn't have.]</br>
</br>
"Perhaps you should relearn your world history - the name Golden Apple came from Greek Mythology and signaled the holy and pristine, such as love," the beautiful spy said gently as she caressed Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
[Is that an actual explanation? I'm a bit illiterate, don't trick meâ€¦] Jiang Chen mocked her in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Let me guess - you're an Italian?" Jiang Chen used this opportunity to change the topic as he continued to play dumb.</br>
</br>
"I'm from Poland." She didn't look like she was lying.</br>
</br>
"Could I know your name?" Jiang Chen wrapped his hand around her waist more forcefully while he whispered in her ear seductively.</br>
</br>
"Of course not," the beautiful spy said while putting her arms around Jiang Chen's neck. "But considering how good you are, we can do it one more time before we say goodbye."</br>
</br>
She didn't want to leave like this; she was still relishing the sensation from the two hours of battle they had. But since he was no longer a suspect, the objective behind her seduction no longer existed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed her onto the bed with a smirkâ€¦</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 429: Pretending not to know</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had two choices.</br>
</br>
One - capture her then use truth-telling serum to obtain some intel from the beautiful spy's mouth and discover her identity. But then the opponent would know that he did, in fact, know about the Golden Apple. Jiang Chen believed that she definitely had some technology hidden somewhere; it didn't take advanced technology to hide a telecom device in her ear canal.</br>
</br>
Two - pretend to know nothing and just let her go. Even if he didn't find out her identity, he would no longer be a suspect.</br>
</br>
Reveal his card and declare war or keep his card hidden?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only wavered for two seconds before he chose the latter option.</br>
</br>
Because if he chose the former, he couldn't do anything to them without a proper intelligence group, even if he knew the opponent's identity.</br>
</br>
The battle lasted for two more hours as Jiang Chen almost made the beautiful spy's bones collapse before he finally spared her from her pleading and agony.</br>
</br>
After taking a shower, she didn't stay in Jiang Chen's room overnight but said goodbye instead.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen half-heartedly tried to convince her to stay before he saw her to the door.</br>
</br>
After closing the door, Jiang Chen noticed that it was already deep into the night, so he headed to bed.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen pretended to want to see the spy again. He ordered the bodyguards to bring the staff list to him. When he didn't see her name on the list, Jiang Chen went to see the captain of the cruise ship and asked about the spy, going by the name on her name tag.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't believe she had no accomplices on the ship, so he had to play dumb throughout the whole process.</br>
</br>
After confirming that a woman of this name wasn't on the ship, Jiang Chen ordered the bodyguards and servers to search the cruise ship.</br>
</br>
Although they didn't find the woman, they managed to find a server uniform folded neatly at the back of the cruise ship. The name tag was exactly the same as the one Jiang Chen saw the night before.</br>
</br>
After the bodyguard brought the clothes to Jiang Chen's room, Jiang Chen managed to find some tangled underwear along with a neatly written note.</br>
</br>
"Hello, I already left. Now that you know I'm already gone, are you surprised?"</br>
</br>
"Before coming, I poisoned my bodily fluids, so any person who slept with me would be poisoned. I originally planned to use the antidote to force you to come to Poland with me as my hostage. But after carefully thinking it through, it would be too unromantic if I just kept you with me."</br>
</br>
"If you find these clothes, it means you looked hard for me. The antidote is in the underwear. However, if you forgot about me after you slept with me, why don't you go die?"</br>
</br>
"So bye bye~ See you, handsome Asian man."</br>
</br>
The note didn't reveal her identity as a spy, but instead, she made up an excuse to cover her actions.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laid on his bed, sighed and muttered to himself, "Don't you know that for someone with immunity above 20, even AIDS would be ineffective?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put on his EP and saw the line  in his stats and scoffed.</br>
</br>
Just like he expected, there was no irregularity in his status.</br>
</br>
However, he hadn't expected the beautiful spy to poison her pu*sy. He also hadn't expected her to leave the antidote behind and even create a story to cover her intentions.</br>
</br>
[Was it because of my face? Or because of my di*k?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stroked his chin as he thought to himself narcissistically.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The three-day cruise trip was tranquil; the ship avoided all the dense clouds and the journey was absolutely gorgeous.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong spent the day wandering the ship's artificial beach to enjoy the sunshine and the bikinis of all the beauties. At night, he returned to his room and streamed New Era.</br>
</br>
After some careful deliberation, he decided he would put aside New Era after Godly Land was officially released and he would concentrate all his effort on the virtual reality MMORPG. He had a feeling that once the mature virtual reality MMORPG was introduced, it would completely change the gaming landscape.</br>
</br>
Once people became used to immersive gaming, would they be interested in games on the screen anymore? Maybe, since mobile games could fill people's spare time. A lot of people were also passionate about these games, but people had limited energy and Wei Wendong knew how much energy it consumed to play two MMORPGs at the same time.</br>
</br>
With virtual reality games becoming more common, people's selection of mobile games would shift toward fast-paced, simple, and casual games. Not to mention other mobile game MMORPGs, but even the New Era game by Future Technology would most likely be impacted by Godly Land.</br>
</br>
Although Future Technology hadn't admitted that "Phantom" was immersive virtual reality equipment, Wei Wendong, accustomed to the surprises crafted by Future Technology, believed that they would shock the players around the world once they revealed the truth.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, what was the point of their extensive marketing?</br>
</br>
Regardless, it was a massive gamble for him since he was at the top in New Era.</br>
</br>
But he didn't feel like this gamble was overly risky since the Kings already signed him for five years. He also had the confidence in his strong skills, game sense, and internal test experience to make his mark in the game.</br>
</br>
Three days later, 2000 players got off the cruise ship at Coro Island. With the beckoning of Future Technology employees, the players arrived at a business hotel. The hotel had been booked out by Future Technology for two months to serve as the test location. The ballroom, big enough to host 2000 people, was renovated to form the official testing grounds.</br>
</br>
There were 2000 custom-made recliner chairs and 2000 "Phantom" helmets.</br>
</br>
Based on the description, everyone's identity was tied to their helmet number. The helmets could not leave the testing grounds.</br>
</br>
Also, no photos or videos were allowed on the testing grounds. If violated, participation would be revoked and the player would be sent off the island at their own expense.</br>
</br>
The test would run between eight in the morning to six at night. During this time, the players had to play the game for at least six hours. The testing grounds would be open on weekends and the players could choose to continue to play the game or wander the island freely.</br>
</br>
After reading the terms and conditions, Wei Wendong picked up helmet number 0008 which belonged to him.</br>
</br>
When he discovered there was no sensor vest and gloves, an inexplicable joy erupted in his mind.</br>
</br>
[Indeed!]</br>
</br>
[Immersive virtual reality!]</br>
</br>
He immediately laid down on the chair that belonged to him and he quickly put on the helmet. He followed the system commands and registered his ID as Shadow King. With an exhilarated heartbeat, he entered the game.</br>
</br>
His pounding heart was stripped away from his body.</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes again, he faced a grey and white cubical dimension.</br>
</br>
He stood in the middle of a cube. He was tempted to kneel down and kiss the cold ground.</br>
</br>
A menu popped out, just as the host described. He chose the game "Godly Land" and registered the user "Shadow King" then chose "mage" as his class. His figure was randomized based on 80% similarity.</br>
</br>
He couldn't wait to make a fireball and experience the feeling of controlling magic.</br>
</br>
Light illuminated the room when he opened his eyes again; now he was at an ancient-looking street, the starting village of humans.</br>
</br>
Chattering voices filled the street as pedestrians in adventure-type clothes strolled by. A musician hummed songs along the street while the surrounding crowds offered up a coin or two. Everything seemed surreal; all the NPCs seemed alive.</br>
</br>
[Right! Artificial intelligence! Future Technology must've used artificial intelligence similar to Little White!] Although he knew how massive a project it must've been to install artificial intelligence on all the NPCs, he didn't have time to ponder this further as he was completely immersed in the astonishment of living a "second life."</br>
</br>
With a long, wooden rod in his hand, he took in the one-hundred-something new players standing dumbfounded on the square in the beginner village.</br>
</br>
In order to fully appreciate the virtual world he was in, he didn't move a single step while he scanned his surroundings enthusiastically.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, his expression froze.</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k! 90-something mages?]</br>
</br>
The 90-something mages didn't do anything else as they waved their fingers in the air in excitement; they were probably all trying to figure out how to form fireballs.</br>
</br>
Wei Wendong blanked out.</br>
</br>
[What a big class disparity just in internal testing.]</br>
</br>
He had an ominous feeling - this class would definitely be nerfedâ€¦</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 430: Decisions</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside the office building of Tencent was a busy scene. The occasional employee walking in the hallway didn't have the most optimistic expression. With company performance continuing to slide, employees sensed the risk of upcoming layoffs.</br>
</br>
Yes, the lifespan of QQ wasn't the longest these days.</br>
</br>
Once Future 1.0's messenger function came online, the number of active users on QQ trended negatively. The QQ project lead was so stressed that his hair almost turned completely white, but he was still unable to come up with a solution to reclaim the messaging throne.</br>
</br>
What? User stickiness? That's right - when your friends, family, and friends on the internet all use QQ, it might be difficult to change users' messenger tool of choice. But when all your friends, family and friends on the internet already installed Future 1.0 and Future 1.0 happened to come out with a messenger function, was QQ really irreplaceable?</br>
</br>
Especially since Future Technology used a "shady" technique - friend synchronization technology!</br>
</br>
WeChat and QQ could synchronize a phone's contact list, and Future 1.0's overpowering function could synchronize WeChat and QQ friend lists. So any user with Future 1.0, QQ, and WeChat installed, Future 1.0 would be able to sync all a user's friends with the click of a button and separate the friends based on the filter.</br>
</br>
This move made the project lead of QQ curse Future 1.0's mother, but he couldn't do anything about it. Future Technology hadn't violated any laws - it synced friend lists with the user's permission and didn't pose any threat to QQ's functionality, nor did it trigger any laws regarding vicious competition.</br>
</br>
At least for messaging software on mobile platforms, Future Technology already snatched more than half of all users. It was fortunate that QQ was still competitive because of its PC platform, but WeChat, which normally always had a stunning performance, suffered greatly.</br>
</br>
The foundation that formed the skyscraper of Penguin Empire was QQ - all other products were based on this foundation.</br>
</br>
And now, Future 1.0 was attacking the foundation itself.</br>
</br>
"Boss, Future Technology has made a new move." An assistant with square glasses walked in and slid a document gently in front of Ma Huateng.</br>
</br>
He sat in front of his table with gloom all over his face. His eyes didn't leave the laptop screen at all.</br>
</br>
It was an article reposted by News Net.</br>
</br>
Future Technology had been promoting virtual reality technology lately. Ma Huateng was skeptical if they could make their money back with the massive campaign they launched.</br>
</br>
He had some understanding of virtual reality technology. While the country had made some technology in the field domestically, compared to Google and Microsoft, there was still a sizeable disparity.</br>
</br>
[Virtual reality MMORPG overseas is still in its infancy, yet you wanted to get ahead of the game - what's the point? Once they eat the meat, they will just take the leftovers and fry it, and it will still be delicious. What's the need for innovation? In a 1.3 billion market, copyright is nonexistent.]</br>
</br>
</br>
[Foolish, how foolish.]</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng shook his head.</br>
</br>
If virtual reality MMORPG in internal testing was really as magical as they made it sound, it would be an unprecedented shockwave to the traditional MMORPGs on PC and mobile platforms.</br>
</br>
What made it difficult was that the testing location of Godly Land was in Pannu Islands; there was no media coverage and no leaked photos. Penguin possessed only minimal information.</br>
</br>
Was it the traditional sensory VR equipment or the rumored immersive virtual reality technology? There was great debate about this on the internet. Some people claiming to be internal testers said it was, in fact, the traditional equipment. But other internal testers stated that Future Technology had developed the legendary immersive technology.</br>
</br>
Because there were no leaked photos, the Godly Land seemed mysterious.</br>
</br>
"Boss?" the assistant spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Is there any renowned virtual reality company domestically?" Ma Huateng let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Wanghai Lexiang Technology Company. They just introduced the Deepoon virtual reality equipment which uses Samsung AMOLED 1080 high definition screen with 75Hz rate and 120-degree wide angle screen. It performed superbly during the CES exhibition."</br>
</br>
"Send people to discuss the acquisition," Ma Huateng ordered.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The assistant nodded and left with quick steps.</br>
</br>
It shouldn't be difficult to acquire the company - the virtual reality industry was never hot domestically, and the mild state meant there was a lack of capital in pursuit. If someone was willing to pay for their creativity, they were probably more willing to exchange their technology for cash.</br>
</br>
Ma Huateng stood up and walked to the giant window.</br>
</br>
He glanced down at Shen's streets as well as his reflection in the window. His eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
[Okay, since Future Technology has entered the virtual reality era, let me play with you then!]</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The so-called Icarus paradox referred to an enterprise with a monopoly in the market and a fear of change; the company would be reluctant to conduct management, technology, and business model updates. This would make it difficult to adapt to the ever-changing environment and the company would lose its advantage with the arrival of new competition.</br>
</br>
What was the Icarus effect? It referred to an enterprise already with a monopoly in the market using all its resources to prevent change from occurring. Examples could be seen by energy giants divesting from new energy resources or hostile takeovers of new energy companies.</br>
</br>
But because of Future Technology's unbreakable share structure and excellent operating conditions, it gave the tech giants no vulnerabilities to target.</br>
</br>
At the Microsoft headquarters in Seattle:</br>
</br>
The chief executive officer, Satia Nadra, sat in front of his desk while staring at his coffee. He zoned out while listening to his assistant's report.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ HoloLens' sales in July increased by 27%."</br>
</br>
When he heard this, he recollected his thoughts.</br>
</br>
HoloLens was virtual reality equipment based on the Windows 10 design by Microsoft. It received a positive market reaction since it was introduced to the market in 2016, but the significant fluctuation in sales was a rare sight.</br>
</br>
"â€¦ Till the market closed, Nasdaq's virtual reality sector all ended in the green. Due to virtual reality division, our company's stock also rose by 3%."</br>
</br>
A 3% rise for a mega-corporation like Microsoft was substantial.</br>
</br>
Satia closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Establish a subsidiary to operate the HoleLens project and immediately release the announcement for HoloLens2."</br>
</br>
The assistant's eyes widened and he stared at Satia in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"But HoloLens was just introducedâ€¦ Could it be-"</br>
</br>
Satia glanced at his assistant without saying a word.</br>
</br>
He knew what the assistant wanted to say. Establish a shell, make an announcement, create a subsidiary first then an IPO and find the next buyer.</br>
</br>
But virtual reality had a bright future, so why would he do that?</br>
</br>
"The board won't agree," the assistant carefully cautioned him.</br>
</br>
"Don't overthink. I'm preparing just in case." Satia stood up. "I'll go explain to the board. I have to also ask Gate's opinion."</br>
</br>
Then Satia left the office and the shocked assistant.</br>
</br>
With the document in his hand, the assistant stood still for a long time.</br>
</br>
He didn't understand - with Microsoft's power, why would they need to prepare just in case?</br>
</br>
In the office building of 361 Corporation:</br>
</br>
"Godly Land? Virtual reality MMORPG? Interesting."</br>
</br>
Zhou Hongwei scanned the webpage on the screen, feeling intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Boss you don't seem to be worried?" Zhang Jiefeng, beside his desk, said with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
"What's there to worry about?" Zhou Hongwei glared at him and sank into his chair. "Is this something to be worried about? Future's about to update to Future 2.0, yet there's nothing from the team assigned to crack the software. What a bunch of useless tools."</br>
</br>
Zhou Hongwei felt angry when he thought about it.</br>
</br>
Although 361 and Future Technology had project partnerships, Zhou Hongwei never stopped the process to crack Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
But just some time ago, he ultimately gave up on the cracking of Future 1.0 and dissolved the project team. He knew he wasn't the only company that made that choice. Future 1.0 encryption was as hard as a turtle's shell and left him nowhere to take a bite.</br>
</br>
He remembered that at the beginning of the year, he went to his friend at the Bureau of Patents, wishing to obtain some information from Future Technology's patent. But his old friend helplessly stated that the people from the Bureau of Patents spent countless time to convince Future Technology to submit specific technicalities and the benefits of patents, but Future Technology's CEO was firm.</br>
</br>
No need.</br>
</br>
It certainly looked down on the countless programmers who spent their time cracking Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
But then, Future Technology threw out a smokescreen on virtual reality. Zhou Hongwei couldn't help but a curse: [can't you fu*king slow down on releasing the technology? We haven't even cracked the first one and now you throw out another one. With steps so big, aren't you afraid of pulling your balls?]</br>
</br>
"Boss?" Zhang Jianfeng looked at the color changing on the boss's face as he questioned.</br>
</br>
Zhou Hongwei took a deep breath and snapped back to the present.</br>
</br>
"I want to hear your thoughts."</br>
</br>
Zhang Jianfeng nodded. He was clearly prepared as he immediately began to explain.</br>
</br>
"There are two routes in front of us - one is to purchase virtual reality technology companies and see if we can cut a slice of the pie from the virtual reality hype created by Future Technology. Two is to give up on this opportunity since there's still plenty of room for growth in the PC and mobile market. If everyone decides to pursue virtual reality, that's the perfect opportunity for us to expand our market share in PC and mobile devices."</br>
</br>
Zhou Hongwei closed his eyes and thought for a long time.</br>
</br>
After a while, he sighed.</br>
</br>
"I prefer the second choice."</br>
</br>
Zhang Jiefeng felt relived too.</br>
</br>
"I also think so too."</br>
</br>
Future Technology's massive advertisement campaign was meant to hype up the virtual reality MMORPG and see if they could stretch their balls, but if 361 followed the same massive steps, they would definitely stretch their balls.</br>
</br>
It was better to play it safe.</br>
</br>
Even if virtual reality was as magical as it was advertised to be, it could not replace the phone. Compared to the BAT giants (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent), 361 had quite a discrepancy in terms of resources. Even if Zhou Hongwei wanted to compete with them, their chance of winning was not high. Cash was one thing, technology was another, and 361 had no advantage in either.</br>
</br>
What they should do now was to not follow blindly but instead, use this opportunity and consolidate the mobile market while all the capital flooded to virtual reality. 361 search was already shaking the market penetration of Baidu search. If they spent more effort on it and let the big thugs battle with Future Technology, they would definitely win on this battlefield.</br>
</br>
Due to Lingyu Technology's incident, 361 and Future Technology were still in a honeymoon phase.</br>
</br>
Zhou Hongwei let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he wasn't willing to make this choice, but he had no other options.</br>
</br>
What he didn't know was, just after a few months, he would feel glad about the decision he made.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 431: The Mutants Flood</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gave Jiang Chen an update of the industry.</br>
</br>
For example, Tencent acquired 51% of Wanghai Lexiang shares at a premium from the hands of Xunlei and Kaiying Web for 60 million USD to become the majority shareholder. They also indicated on the day when the deal closed that QQ would officially enter the virtual reality field, then they displayed a mysterious looking CG animation, indicating that virtual reality MMORPG development was in progress.</br>
</br>
Baidu instead went international and established a strategic partnership with Sony which signaled their battle horn to the virtual reality market.</br>
</br>
Microsoft, Googleâ€¦</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this information, he wasn't worried at all.</br>
</br>
His situation now was like a tank charging forward while his opponents were still busy shining the tips of their arrows.</br>
</br>
A battle between the indigenous and civilized - although it was in the same ring, it was not on the same level.</br>
</br>
After two months, internal testing would end and the world's media would finally receive some information. The helmets would go on sale a month later and the official launch of the game was set for the upcoming month. The world would be shocked by Future Technology's virtual reality technology.</br>
</br>
Future Technology would lead the first intimate contact between consciousness and circuit boards.</br>
</br>
"Also, I received several emails from Hua's Arms Industrial Company, Britain's Plextek Company, UA's Thunder God Company and other three arms industrial companies interested in our technology. They said if we provided a technical description of our technology, they were willing to cooperate with us in the military training field," Xia Shiyu continued her report.</br>
</br>
Military arms companies interested in a partnership with a tech company? It was a rare occurrence.</br>
</br>
But from the way the emails were worded, they seemed to be cautious of the partnership since it would involve a lot of technical parameters of confident military tech. In principle, military tech companies should not cooperate with foreign companies. Even if a partnership were to exist, it would mostly be under the table.</br>
</br>
At least for now, the server parameters of virtual reality, computation ability, and maximum user threshold were all unknown to the external world. But with the introduction of virtual reality to the world next year, his nuclear silo would be built already.</br>
</br>
He would use nuclear weapons to deter the five thugs and connect the world with the "virtual web." When the world could no longer leave the second world built by Future Technology, no one would be foolish enough to go against Future Technology.</br>
</br>
The game was only the tip of the iceberg for virtual reality.</br>
</br>
By that time, it would be time to reach space.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's thoughts drifted far away as he fantasized about the blueprint he had in his mind.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen?" Seeing as he didn't respond, Xia Shiyu tried to rouse him from his dazed state.</br>
</br>
He recollected his thoughts and only deliberated for two seconds before he made a decision.</br>
</br>
"Reject the offers."</br>
</br>
"Okayâ€¦ Also, the Bureau of Patents is making frequent visits." Xia Shiyu scoffed.</br>
</br>
"Let them come. When we have the absolute technological advantage, we don't need any patents to protect us. If we made our technology public for other people's reference, we would be kicked out of the competition."</br>
</br>
Any country would be reluctant for new technology to leave their borders. As long as Future Technology was irreplaceable, even if the Wang family wanted to eat him, they couldn't do anything to him. When they forced Jiang Chen to become an "international company," the Wang family received a lot of criticism and pressure from the higher-ups.</br>
</br>
At the same time, he wouldn't register for any patents in any country because it was unnecessary for him; he didn't plan to permit other people to use his technology. To crack his Future 1.0, people needed a textbook on D++ first.</br>
</br>
After he hung up the phone, Jiang Chen stretched sluggishly and sat up on the sofa.</br>
</br>
He finally had the time for leisure activities lately, but with his mansion completely empty, it did feel boring. He occasionally visited his family, accompanied his father on fishing trips, and chatted with his mother. Being with his family was always a great and relaxing time.</br>
</br>
He just missed Ayesha and wondered about her training progress on the island.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to focus on the virtual reality internal testing anymore - Barkary sent out 20 security personnel and 30 employees to oversee the internal testing process. All the game data would be sent to the fourth-dimensional messenger chip Lin Lin created on her computer before she sent the information off to the game development department at Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
It was August 7th already. Jiang Chen was planning to delay his return to the 15th, but a message from Lin Lin changed his mind.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
When Sun Jiao saw Jiang Chen, her eyes lit up as she stood to greet him. Han Junhua only glared at him emotionlessly before she focused on the hologram command map on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kissed Sun Jiao before he walked up to the command map.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"We confirmed that a flood of mutants erupted in Wanghai," Sun Jiao said sternly, a rare occasion when she wasn't acting naughty.</br>
</br>
"A flood of mutants?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Based on the information from the drones, the activity level of zombies in the city center greatly increased, and the packed zombies in the city center began to disperse towards the rural areas. At the same time, all mutants in the Wanghai area entered into a frenzied state. Even the mutant cockroaches without much hostility turned aggressive," Han Junhua explained with her arms crossed, her eyes never leaving the map.</br>
</br>
Cockroaches were scavengers; the mutations didn't change their food habits. Typically, cockroaches were considered safe - they wouldn't attack you unless you provoked them.</br>
</br>
The same went for flies and rats - they were often not aggressive. But when the mutant flood erupted, the "mild" mutants entered a frenzied state too.</br>
</br>
There were only two solutions to solve the mutant flood.</br>
</br>
One was to migrate, the other was to kill.</br>
</br>
Only when the zombie and mutant concentration decreased to a certain level would their expansion to secure land stop.</br>
</br>
The mutant flood was a battle between mutants and humans for survival space!</br>
</br>
"That's right." Sun Jiao nodded at Han Junhua's explanation.</br>
</br>
"Even with a wall, these creatures could still get inside?" Jiang Chen asked in shock.</br>
</br>
"Hypothetically, if thousands of zombies all leaped at the wall at the same time, the zombies in the front would fall, and the zombies at the back would stomp on top of the fallen zombies. In a massive zombie flood, a wall is not reliable. Also, not only are the zombies a threat, but the mutants will be a great danger. The mutants that previously only lived in wet, high radiation areas will enter the rural areas," Han Junhua said sternly.</br>
</br>
"For example?"</br>
</br>
"Mutant mosquitos. Their high flying speed along with their slim bodies means they are hard to target. A total of seven soldiers died at the hands of mutant mosquitoes already, along with thirteen injured at camp 27." All the stats were ingrained in Han Junhua's head.</br>
</br>
"Looks like we'll have to cancel the expedition," Jiang Chen said with a frown.</br>
</br>
"We can't," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao both looked at her.</br>
</br>
"Even if we terminate the plan, the mutated humans would not give up their military action this winter. Not only can we not terminate the plan, but we have to take care of the mutated humans before the mutant flood escalates."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a bit then asked, "But there are already signs of a mutant flood. What do you think we should do?"</br>
</br>
"Immediately send out a force and fight on two fronts," Han Junhua said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"That's too risky. You haven't experienced a mutant flood before, and you don't know how terrifying it is," Sun Jiao interrupted.</br>
</br>
"For that exact reason, we have to do what I said. Even if we lasted through the mutant flood, we might not be able to defend against the backlash of the mutated humans. The best strategy would be for the east line to focus on defense while the west line gathers the entire armored force to attack. We need to use the shortest time to wipe out the mutated humans then return to defend the Wanghai rural area."</br>
</br>
As the Colonel of the PAC land force, it wasn't the first time she had to make a definitive decision like this.</br>
</br>
"What if the west line enters a stalemate?" Jiang Chen asked sternly.</br>
</br>
"Then prepare to give up the east line and retreat from Wanghai."</br>
</br>
[Give up Wanghai? How is that possible?!]</br>
</br>
Han Junhua seemed to have read the hesitation on Jiang Chen's face as she continued.</br>
</br>
"A leader should consider the consequences of failure but should not be fearful towards the consequences of the failure."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, he abruptly said:</br>
</br>
"If we choose to fight on both lines, how will the force be distributed?"</br>
</br>
"Gather the power armor to equip the First Division with the support of the Hunter Division to launch a lightning attack to Jia city and Seventh Area. The Third Division will remain stationed in the Sixth Street with local mercenaries hired to reinforce the defense. The Second Division stationed at camp 27 will partially retreat to the Fishbone base and the defensive line will completely shrink to the outskirts of the rural areas." Han Junhua pointed on the hologram map and quickly completed the force deployment plan.</br>
</br>
The power armor didn't have an advantage against a massive amount of zombies, so it was better to be bold and send it all to the east line to be used against the mutated humans. Although the mutants couldn't rip through the armor of the Wanderer tank, a total weight of 112 tons wasn't impenetrable to the powerful mutants. If they couldn't bite through the tank, surely they could flip it at least?</br>
</br>
They couldn't forget about the vomiter vomiting acid - it would also be a threat to the armored units.</br>
</br>
"Let's follow your plan."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded and walked out the door.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 432: Tightening the Defensive Line</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After five days of resistance, the command center ordered camp 027 to retreat strategically.</br>
</br>
It was a prudent decision.</br>
</br>
The core of camp 27 was the scientists. Even if the buildings on the surface were abandoned, there wasn't much lost since the mutants didn't tend to destroy buildings. They simply could re-capture the base later.</br>
</br>
But if they remained stationed there, once the mutant flood escalated, the supply line between camp 27 and Fishbone would be cut off. Without an ammo supply, camp 27, which was closer to the city center, would be the first to collide with the mutants. Even with the protection of the wall, it wasn't the most reliable during a mutant flood.</br>
</br>
The zombies packed together could create a zombie ladder. The throwers' infant zombies could pass over the wall, and the Roshan, which had a bad habit of throwing things, could even push down the wall.</br>
</br>
The most horrifying thing was the mutant mosquitos. They were the knights soaring in the sky, their mouths as sharp as spears. One charge could quickly take a person's life away.</br>
</br>
To deal with the annoying creatures, the fallout shelter designed a simplified flamethrower. Soldiers in power armor could wield one and fire at these mosquitos on the front line, which had surprisingly effective results.</br>
</br>
But regarding the intensifying mutant flood, the situation was less and less optimistic.</br>
</br>
The mutant flood was going on its fifth day and the soldiers stationed at the camp already lost 15 people. If they continued to be stationed here, it was difficult to determine the outcome of the situation.</br>
</br>
With Wang Zhaowu's organization, Xu Lu led the non-combat personnel and some security forces down into the fallout shelter with the doors shut tight. They would return to the surface once the situation stabilized. The fuel rods and supplies stored in the fallout shelter were more than enough to sustain them for two years of consumption, and the mutant flood would only last a few monthsâ€¦</br>
</br>
If nothing unexpected happened.</br>
</br>
A total of 500 combat units loaded the firearms and stationary weapons onto the trucks then welded the top of the trucks with machine guns.</br>
</br>
With the Tiger II leading the way, trucks began to trickle out of camp 27 and smash into the zombies wandering on the street.</br>
</br>
The machine guns unleashed their fury onto the street, leaving a trail of copper shells behind.</br>
</br>
The flood of zombies swarmed to the fleet, but most were shredded to pieces by the bullets. The occasional zombies that managed to survive would die from the bullets of the Reaper Assault Rifle.</br>
</br>
In the distance, Roshan tossed the lamppost in its hands and moved toward the fleet with heavy footsteps. Tiger II, which spotted the target, slowly moved its cannon as the Type-50 electromagnetic cannon unloaded its bomb and pierced through the lard.</br>
</br>
</br>
Blood and bullet shells paved the way.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
The engineering soldiers were installing four anti-air machine guns onto the wall in addition to the Type-50 electromagnetic cannon used against large-sized mutants. Soldiers patrolled the walls and fired continuously at the areas with a high concentration of zombies.</br>
</br>
Under the waving NAC flag, zombies with dangling heads wandered below the wall. Their crimson pupils displayed a thirst for blood.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, zombies weren't hostile during the daytime. But because of the mutant flood, the situation changed a little. The zombies seemed to be influenced by some form of power and naturally gathered around areas with humans.</br>
</br>
The situation was similar to the x2 bacteria incident; the only difference was that air indicators remained normal during the mutant flood.</br>
</br>
The Fishbone base was quite some distance away from the city center, so they hadn't encountered any powerful mutants, but Jiang Chen had a feeling that the good days were coming to an end.</br>
</br>
On the patrol tower on the wall, Jiang Chen observed the streets in the distance with a pair of binoculars.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a Tiger II appeared in his field of vision. Meat chunks solidified on its armor, and the belt was colored black by the fat and blood of the zombies. Immediately following it were the outlines of trucks which became more and more clear. The machine guns fired continuously, piercing any zombies approaching the trucks.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down the binoculars and spoke concisely into the radio:</br>
</br>
"Clear an area in front of the gate."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The soldiers stationed underneath the wall all headed up with their rifles. Some rushed to the machine guns while some set up the rifles in the firing spots. Following the commands of a knight in a kinetic skeleton, everyone entered their battle positions quickly.</br>
</br>
"Fire!" The soldiers on the wall pressed their triggers simultaneously.</br>
</br>
A glorious scene unfolded.</br>
</br>
The orange bullet trails were unleashed onto the zombies like pouring rain and instantly tore down the zombies approaching the wall. Grenade soldiers threw grenades and Molotov cocktails at the swarms of zombies.</br>
</br>
Explosions were everywhere. Broken limbs flew across the battlefield. The zombies made of flesh were no threat at the hands of the survivors' firearms.</br>
</br>
"The success against normal zombies would make people blow up in confidence," Sun Jiao exclaimed while she worked beside Jiang Chen and stared at the zombies being shredded.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was wearing a bulletproof vest with the SK10. She hadn't used it in a long time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled but didn't respond. He took out a cigarette and lit it up.</br>
</br>
During the amount of time it took to finish a cigarette, the zombies outside the wall were mostly wiped out.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the fleet arrived in front of the main door before the zombies could regroup. The soldiers at the door immediately pressed the button to open the gate as the metal gate slowly opened and allowed the red-stained fleet to enter.</br>
</br>
A few medics ran up and carried the wounded on stretchers to the hospital. Then a few soldiers in protective gear with circular bottles sprayed the entire fleet to disinfect it.</br>
</br>
The weary soldiers jumped down from the trucks and hugged each other with their families waiting by the side. As for the people stained with blood, they all chose to take a shower first.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the base, their tense nerves could finally be relieved.</br>
</br>
"Let me go make a visit."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen extinguished the cigarette on the wall as he headed downstairs.</br>
</br>
Right now, it was a busy scene in front of the base.</br>
</br>
"Quick! Quick! Vomiter's acid hit him."</br>
</br>
"Poor guy, treat it first before sending him to the medical chamber. Help me out hereâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Stretchers continuously passed by him. Due to the limited number of medical chambers, soldiers with less severe injuries had to be transferred to the ward first. Soldiers with serious injuries were treated by doctors on the spot before being sent to the medical chambers for recovery.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the soldier with the bones on his face exposed by the acid. His stomach started doing flips.</br>
</br>
[To be able to live like this is definitely his luckâ€¦]</br>
</br>
He paused for a few seconds before he continued to walk forward.</br>
</br>
In the front of the fleet, aside from the Tiger II, he saw Wang Zhaowu.</br>
</br>
Because he sat in the tank, Wang Zhaowu's condition was somewhat positive; at least he hadn't sustained any injuries. But from his dark circles, it was clear he hadn't closed his eyes for a long time.</br>
</br>
He passed the rifle in his hand to the soldier beside him and saluted Jiang Chen sharply.</br>
</br>
Without engaging in small talk, Jiang Chen passed a cigarette to him. Finely made cigarettes had always been the luxury good in short supply on the wasteland. Although he could purchase them with his salary, not everyone could have the honor of their leader passing them a cigarette.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu took the cigarette in astonishment. Jiang Chen smiled and used a casual tone to ask him.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation at camp 27?"</br>
</br>
"Extremely terrible." With gloom on his face, Wang Zhaowu slowly blew out a smoke ring. "Throwers already appeared there, as well as mutant mosquitos. Along the way, we also saw vomiters moving in this direction. Fortunately, a Tiger II was in front of the fleetâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Throwers were most active in the outskirts of the city, and they rarely entered the rural areas. If Throwers already appeared at camp 27, the mutant flood was beginning to intensify.</br>
</br>
After a momentary pause, Jiang Chen asked:</br>
</br>
"Did you bring the thing?"</br>
</br>
"I did. Do you want me to take you there now?"</br>
</br>
"Now," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu nodded and took Jiang Chen to the center of the fleet.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the location, a few workers were already operating a crane to unload the equipment.</br>
</br>
"This is it. The construction robots and deepwater mining equipment. They won't be useful now by the looks of it." Wang Zhaowu stared at the eight massive containers with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
With the current situation, it would be hard to reach the sea in the first place.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu might be wrong. Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously without answering.</br>
</br>
It wasn't an easy task to transport the deepwater mining equipment from camp 27. All of the equipment weighed 400 tons with each container weighing 50 tons. To transport these containers, Wang Zhaowu arranged four heavy-duty trucks to be positioned in the middle of the fleet. With the risk of slowing down the retreat, he managed to drag the equipment back,</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the eight containers and nodded, pleased.</br>
</br>
Deepwater mining could finally be initiated. The production of virtual reality helmets would require a massive amount of molybdenum, and with the current price of molybdenum, importing would significantly increase the cost of the helmet. If Jiang Chen mined the molybdenum himself, he calculated cost savings of at least 50%.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"No problem. Compared to defending camp 27, this is much easier." Wang Zhaowu smiled.</br>
</br>
"Go rest for a bit. Remember to come to my office for a meeting in two hours."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu saluted and headed to the living area.</br>
</br>
After a long journey, he was indeed tired. He just wanted to take a shower and take a nap before the meeting.</br>
</br>
After Wang Zhaowu left, Jiang Chen looked at the soldiers by the side and ordered them to transport the containers to the backyard of the mansion. Then he headed to the community center.</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 433: A Risky Choice</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The recent expansions caused the defense line of the Sixth Street to be extremely stretched out. The military government utilized almost all the construction companies and reinforced the walls surrounding the Sixth Street and machine guns and cannons were also installed.</br>
</br>
Contracts totaling one million crystals.</br>
</br>
But not a lot of people were cheerful of the news. The mutants flood about to arrive made everyone feel a deep fear. Some people chose to flee, but most chose to stay.</br>
</br>
It was because of a policy enacted by Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
"Anyone who leaves the Sixth Street during wartime, properties registered under its name will be confiscated and used to pay for the defense budget. The extra amount will be used as a reward for individuals or organizations who provide outstanding contribution during wartime. If the person must leave and is reluctant to give up its property here, then a war tax between 20-40 crystals per square meter must be paid for any properties here. This amount will be used to pay for the mercenaries' salary, reinforce defense, and ammunition."</br>
</br>
The policy sounded unreasonable on paper, but it was fair.</br>
</br>
Why would the Sixth Street soldiers bleed for you to protect your property here and the people with stakes here would escape during this critical time? Either contribute your force, or provide money, or the NAC government would recognize you as surrendering your property by default!</br>
</br>
Although a lot of soldiers attempted to use the council to protest, they clearly didn't understand the situation. Out of the ten council members, five were injected with the "honorary chip".</br>
</br>
The policy was enacted without any opposition and gained the support from the majority of civilians.</br>
</br>
The civilians finally managed to own their home in the Sixth Street, who would want to return to the homeless life? As to the people that escaped with the slightest obstacle and wanted people who stayed behind to protect their property, they didn't gain any sympathy.</br>
</br>
Therefore, other than the merchants based elsewhere, no one chose to leave at this time.</br>
</br>
What's the purpose of tying down the irrelevant people in the base?</br>
</br>
There were a lot of purposes.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street military stationed comprised mostly by three forces, the first being the NAC's Third Division, the second would be the mercenaries, hunters, and some equipped scavengers, the third being the private force of the merchants!</br>
</br>
Although after the nuclear non-proliferation at the Sixth Street was enacted, all of their nuclear material was confiscated. Though the Sixth Street never limited their arms. As to do business on the wasteland, a weak force meant that the merchant would be sheep to the bad wolves out there. Even if they managed to escape the claws of the mutants, they could not avoid the robbery by their same kind.</br>
</br>
</br>
Most of the merchants stayed, meaning they would retain their private force here. The merchants were usually much richer than the mercenaries demonstrated by the quality of their equipment. Although the merchants didn't have the restricted Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon, they still possessed a few armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
The civilians joined the force. The merchants in pain send their private force to the frontline. Once the mutants flood erupts, the gate to the city would be closed shut. Since they chose to stay, then the option of leaving was no longer there. There was no purpose of hiding any force now as it was better to send them to the front line for some commission.</br>
</br>
The military factor was operating at full capacity as it produced the iron and aluminum transported from the Fishbone base into firearms.</br>
</br>
At this time, the production of the Sixth Street finally came in handy.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen released part of the technology of the T-3 power armor to the small workshops and contracted parts out to be produced. The military factory he purchased for Zhao Chenwu produced 20 T-3 power armors in one month.</br>
</br>
It was ten times their previous production capacity.</br>
</br>
Not only the power armors, the Type-99 anti-tank cannon, the Roar mortarâ€¦ Followed by the optimization of the industry, the heavy weaponry with low production before now became streamlined and exited the factory quickly.</br>
</br>
With so many heavy weaponry dragged from the factory to the frontline and the boxes of ammo and bombs being transported to the supply station, almost everyone was confident towards this war.</br>
</br>
Only if it was just the zombies that came.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Currently, 300 meters to the north gate of the Sixth Street, the soldiers from the First Division built a simplified defense line with a moving barrier and sandbags. They shot the zombies approaching with machineguns. The wall behind them was being reinforced, and their mission was to defend here until the reinforcement is complete.</br>
</br>
Constant screams came from behind them. It was the sound of the mortars launching electromagnetic shells.</br>
</br>
Three shells raised into the air and then smashed into the zombies. The scattered shrapnel instantly shredded the zombies nearby as their intestines, and meat chunks rolled all over the ground.</br>
</br>
Then, from the dust of the explosion, a massive creature appeared. It swung a billboard in its hand while marching toward the defense line in giant strides.</br>
</br>
"Roshan located."</br>
</br>
A soldier at the machinegun continued to fire while screaming into his mic.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
A calm response followed by the explosive sound of the bomb unloading.</br>
</br>
The bomb dragged an orange trail of flame and blew the skull of the Roshan into pieces.</br>
</br>
"Nice shot!" The soldier roared out while he reloaded the machinegun. Seeing the attack slowed down, the scavenger waiting on the side rushed to the body of Roshan with a knife to retreat the crystals at the back of its neck. When they obtain the crystals, they could retain 40% as their commission.</br>
</br>
On top of the patrol tower, Zhao Gang observed everything with his binoculars.</br>
</br>
Different from the optimistic feeling of the crowd, as the leader of the Third Corp, the expression on his face didn't suggest optimism at all.</br>
</br>
After days of continuous recruitment, the Third Corp already expanded to 4000 people. However, even including the First and Second Corp, it still didn't manage to bring him optimism at all.</br>
</br>
As a previous survivor of Qingpu, he had witnessed the horrifying mutants flood.</br>
</br>
The mutants flood back then even broke the line of defense established by the World Alliance Organization soldiers which made the organization surrender to Wanghai. And the survivors at the Sixth Street used a significant amount of PAC weapons left by the organization and barely managed to defend the base.</br>
</br>
But after the next civil war, the only equipment left was the Wanderer tank. Right now, the tank was sent to the First Corp, the Sixth Street could only depend on self-produced heavy weaponry.</br>
</br>
"Report, Director Chu Nan send me to notify you to attend the meeting."</br>
</br>
"I see." Zhao Gang nodded.</br>
</br>
The soldier saluted and stood aside.</br>
</br>
He took a last look at the front line before he stuffed the binoculars into his pocket and left.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
In the hologram conference room, Zhao Gang nodded to Chu Nan and sat in his spot.</br>
</br>
The conference started. General Jiang Chen, advisor Han Junhua, the three corp leaders, the Sixth Street executive Chu Nan, logistics lead Wang Qin, administration lead Lu Huasheng, and all the NAC executives were present.</br>
</br>
Around the conference table hovered a hologram map of Wanghai with the force's distribution on the map. From the map, Zhao Gang could guess the purpose of this meeting.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin first explained the status of supplies at the base, and then Lu Huasheng reported on the status of the reserve force.</br>
</br>
Last, the advisor explained their entire plan. Because the plan was first discussed with the general, Jiang Chen only needed to nod during the conference.</br>
</br>
But when Chu Nan heard the plan, he had a slight frown as he stood up and objected.</br>
</br>
"I object. Wanderer tank, eight Tiger IIs, and 15 armored vehicles are all assigned to the First Division? Even if the Sixth Street's objective is to defend, it doesn't mean this place doesn't need armored force protection."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Zhao Gang.</br>
</br>
After a moment of deliberation, Zhao Gang nodded sternly.</br>
</br>
"I agree with Chu Nan's perspective. Without any armored force to cover fire, that means that once we lost the control of the gate, we no longer possess the ability to recapture the gate. We could only completely abandon the lost defense line. To be safe, we need at least four Tiger IIs stationed here."</br>
</br>
"Just don't lose control." Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I know it is best to have no mistakes, but-"</br>
</br>
"Tanks protecting a city are the least efficient choice. All the armored forces equipping the First Corp will allow Jia City to be captured in the shortest period, and then return for defense after." Han Junhua used an indubitable voice.</br>
</br>
A risky decision.</br>
</br>
If there were any mishaps in the Sixth Street defense line... If the First Corp battle with the mutated humans entered a stalemateâ€¦</br>
</br>
The First Corp leader Cheng Weiguo didn't say anything. He only looked at Zhao Gang apologetically. Zhao Gang also didn't' speak as he looked at his colleague to signal his understanding.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan took a deep breath and stared at Han Junhua before he slowly sat down.</br>
</br>
"I hope your decision is correct. It has to do with the lives of eighty thousand people."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded.</br>
</br>
After the end of the conference, the hologram faded.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin, Lu Huasheng, and Wang Zhaowu left. When there were only two people in the conference room, Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"You have to learn the art of rejection."</br>
</br>
"There is only execution to an order, the art of rejection doesn't exist."</br>
</br>
"I'm only concerned about the relationship between my subordinates," Jiang Chen said wryly.</br>
</br>
But Han Junhua didn't seem to mind as she said emotionlessly, "It's okay, let me be the bad guy."</br>
</br>
"â€¦ Are you an M?" With the expressionless face in front of him, Jiang Chen had to ask out of curiosity.</br>
</br>
"What is an M?" Han Junhua raised her eyebrows, "I'm only making the best choice. Especially as you have told me, once everything ends, I will be heading into the future."</br>
</br>
"What if we can solve your problem without going to the future?" Jiang Chen asked intriguingly.</br>
</br>
"Then we'll speak once the time comes."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't seem to want to discuss this problem further. She took the documents on the table that belonged to her and left the conference room.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 434: Lightning Attack against Seventh Area</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Clouds of dust accompanied the roaring noise of the engine.</br>
</br>
The metal belt rolled over the barren land; only the crushing sound of the wheels could be heard.</br>
</br>
Like a piercing arrow, the tank formulation comprised of all the NAC's armored forces, led by the Wanderer tank, was heading from Shenxiang to the Seventh Area between Jia and Wanghai.</br>
</br>
It was the mutated humans' production facility. Once the place was captured, the mutated humans would lose all of their ammunition supplies. Once they freed the slaves prisoned in the Seventh Area, the First Corp would continue to head west and crush the mutated humans stationed in Jia.</br>
</br>
The Wanderer tank led the way, eight Tiger IIs, 15 armored vehicles, 30 supply trucks, 2300 soldiers, and two helicopters. It was half of NAC's net worth.</br>
</br>
Right now, in the armored vehicle modified into a command center, Cheng Weiguo and Ma Zhongcheng sat across from each other. In front of them was a hologram map with a red marker on the map indicating the mutated humans' zone of control. The arrow formation created by blue dots were soldiers from the First and Hunter Corp.</br>
</br>
"Based on the reconnaissance soldiers' observation, the mutated humans stationed 9000 soldiers in Jia with 80 anti-tank cannons, 60 anti-air machine guns, and 220 machine guns," Ma Zhongcheng reported to Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
"A tough opponent," Cheng Weiguo cursed.</br>
</br>
Because the mutated humans managed to capture Jia city, their number increased substantially. They could foresee that it will be a fierce battle.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, there was a loud explosion from the front.</br>
</br>
A shell landed beside a Tiger II in high gear mode. The shrapnel created screeching sounds on the Type-A steel armor, but it didn't manage to do any damage. Then a few more rounds landed but didn't manage to hit its target.</br>
</br>
"Enemy anti-tank units spotted!"</br>
</br>
"Initiate combat." Cheng Weiguo clicked on his earpiece and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The supply truck that carried the soldiers all slowed down to allow the soldiers in the back to jump down and charge toward the Seventh Area in a scattered formation. The soldiers that sat outside of the armored vehicles also got off as they spread out to advance towards the mutated humans' zone of control.</br>
</br>
An armor piercing round smashed right onto the front armor of the Wanderer's tank and was deflected without a doubt. The electromagnetic reaction armor that used Meissner effect would render most of the kinetic weapon with metal shells useless! And even if there was no electromagnetic reaction armor, 140 mm Type-A steel armor was not something typical shells could penetrate.</br>
</br>
The type-52 main particle cannon emitted an eerie blue light before it exploded like fireworks once it hit the target. Then it instantly vaporized the anti-tank cannon hidden behind the defense line. The secondary 2 kg rapid electromagnetic cannon continued to emit electric arcs as the shells eight times the speed of sound easily shredded the building into pieces. The mutated humans hiding in the building couldn't even scream before they were crushed by the building.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was a moving fortress.</br>
</br>
Compared to the Wanderer tank's outstanding performance, the "locally produced" Tiger II had lackluster performance. However, with the mutated humans without any armored force, it was more than enough to take care of the enemies with its thick front armor and powerful electromagnetic cannon.</br>
</br>
The Type-50 constantly unleashed 5 kg bombs on the mutated humans' position and instantly destroyed their first line of defense.</br>
</br>
Once the line was broken, the armored vehicles, in front, instantly accelerated and dashed out from the force, into the Seventh Area Industrial Zone. The machine guns installed on the tops of the tanks spat out its fury as the high caliber bullets reaped the life of the mutated humans hidden behind the walls. The armored vehicles also occasionally threw out heat trap grenades and electromagnetic trap grenades.</br>
</br>
The guided rockets being misguided by the trap grenade immediately lost its target and redirected to the location of the heat trap grenade. The none-guided rockets were unable to hit the armored vehicles due to their high speed.</br>
</br>
Rockets flew aimlessly inside the industrial zone and didn't manage to hit a single armored vehicle. Instead, they wounded a lot of mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The armored vehicles rushed into the industrial zone and in the shortest time, cleared the hidden anti-tank and anti-air weapons. Then, they paved the way for the tank formation. At the same time, the Hunter Division in power armors and kinetic skeletons broke the first line of defense and began to clear the mutated soldiers that hid among the shambles with the help of the infantry.</br>
</br>
Only two armored vehicles were damaged. One because of the anti-tank mine, the other one was unfortunately hit on the side by a non-guided missile.</br>
</br>
However, compared to the success they were able to achieve, the sacrifice was indeed worth it. They destroyed or confiscated 17 anti-tank armors, 31 anti-air machine guns, and killed more than 2000 mutated humans; the remaining enemy all retreated to the second line of defense.</br>
</br>
"The first line of defense captured!'</br>
</br>
The captain in the frontlines reported the status to the command center, seeing the blue and red dots tangle together on the hologram map, Cheng Weiguo looked at Ma Zhongcheng.</br>
</br>
"Deploy the drones."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Ma Zhongcheng took out the tablet and pressed a few buttons.</br>
</br>
The second line of defense was built around the complex building layout in the industrial zone where even the armored vehicles could not rapidly advance through. The mutated humans defending the streets were all equipped with a significant amount of non-guided missiles as well as sticky explosives. Although those could not damage the Wanderer, they posed a substantial threat to the Tiger IIs and the armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
The Tiger II's side armor and back were all its weaknesses. An anti-tank rocket in close range would more than likely stall the tank.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the task to protect the infantry force advancing would fall to the drones.</br>
</br>
After receiving the order, the two helicopters hovered in the far air immediately moved toward the already broken first line of defense. Then it parachuted two containers to the ground.</br>
</br>
Blue flames sparked out the descending device fired to reduce its velocity. The five-meter-long container smashed onto the second line of defense. The first container landed on the street while the other one landed on the top of the building.</br>
</br>
The memory metal on the container instantly deployed with the intense force of the landing, it exploded the bee nest like structure and released the drones inside.</br>
</br>
The buzzing noise even covered the sound of gunshots. The mutated humans could only use their rifles and machine guns to furiously unleash their bullets against the drone attack formed by the plate-sized "hummingbirds". However, their effort was negligible.</br>
</br>
With the hive used as a terminal and center for the drones, hundreds of agile Hummingbirds roamed the streets to remove the lives of the mutated humans. Even with the thick C-type front armor, they could not defend against the sneak attacks from the back. In a street battle with drones, without any EMP weapon, it was pure slaughter.</br>
</br>
But obviously, the mutated humans in the Seventh Area didn't prepare much EMP!</br>
</br>
When the hive landed, the location scanning device inside recorded its detailed coordinates into the server, so the Hummingbirds were even more familiar with the area than the mutated humans themselves.</br>
</br>
At the same time, 20 T-3 power armors followed into the second line of defense, with the support of the light infantry, an intense battle along the streets broke out.</br>
</br>
The orange bullet trails lit up the entire zone. The mutated humans defending there had to retreat due to First Corp's intensive attack.</br>
</br>
The infantry force completely cleared out the anti-air positions at the second line of defense. The helicopter then moved up and unleashed the nightmare known as death to the mutated humans with its Type-50 electromagnetic cannon. Any defense could not withstand the powerful smash of the 10 kg bomb. Although the lead mutated humans with power warhammers, and the suicide mutated humans with miniature nuclear grenades managed to cause some casualties to the infantries on the streets, the mutated humans could not change the outcome of the battle.</br>
</br>
The second line of defense was broken, the tank continued to push forward. The soldiers that confiscated the anti-tank cannons turned the cannon around to the mutated human's third line of defense. The last line of defense.</br>
</br>
The electronics factory at the Seventh Area!</br>
</br>
A high tech factory with a size of 1500 acres stood distinctively in the Seventh Area industrial zone. Because of its distinctiveness, the mutated humans chose the place as its base. The outskirt was built with high walls, and the plant inside was reinforced into a fortress.</br>
</br>
In front of mutants and most survivors, the fortress was unbreakable, but that was not the case in front of the NAC.</br>
</br>
The castle in the mutated human's eyes will become their own grave!</br>
</br>
After capturing the second line of defense, the First Division unleashed a total of 1000 shells into the factory which turned the walls around the factory and its primary structure into shambles.</br>
</br>
After the rain of destruction, the armored vehicles equipped with drone terminals moved along with the power armors and the soldiers followed right behind them. They engaged in heavy fire with the mutated humans inside the factory.</br>
</br>
A gruesome battle.</br>
</br>
To both sides, there was no concept of surrendering.</br>
</br>
Humans and mutated humans were not the same species.</br>
</br>
With six hours of a full-scale battle coming to an end, the First Corp soldiers finally killed the last mutated human. They put up the NAC flag on the roof of the half-destroyed plant and signaled their victory in the Seventh Area!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 435: Peacekeeper</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Only nine thousand something hostages were being rescued. When the NAC soldiers saved the pitiful people from the ruins and shambles, they were so emotional that they began to burst out in tears.</br>
</br>
Rescuing the Defenders was only a side mission they did but not the obligation of the First Division. So during the rain of destruction, Cheng Weiguo was not concerned about them at all.</br>
</br>
It was reasonable because Cheng Weiguo would never risk the soldiers' lives for strangers. It was a great deed to be able to save them in the first place.</br>
</br>
After they captured the Seventh Area, Cheng Weiguo ordered the soldiers to fortify while the supplying trucks returned to Shenxiang for ammo, each squadron reported their casualty numbers. The confiscated the weapons and ammo recorded on the books. The useful ones were brought along, the not useful ones were placed together as junk with the recovered Type C, B, and A steels while these supplies waited for the trucks to be dragged to Shenxiang Colony.</br>
</br>
As to the prisoners rescued, Cheng Weiguo ordered the soldiers to settle them into the temporarily constructed camps and provided them nutrient supply. He also recruited soldiers and engineers willing to join the force.</br>
</br>
A lot of them were soldiers from the Jia City Defenders. They only needed a rifle without any training to become a capable soldier. When they heard that Cheng Weiguo planned to attack Jia to seek revenge from the mutated humans and free their home, they joined under the banner of NAC without any hesitation.</br>
</br>
The First Corp obtained arsenals of weapons from the mutated humans. Cheng Weiguo then scattered a part of the1400 soldiers among each of the infantry battalions while the other part formed their own infantry battalion. They also brought the 1000 engineering soldiers along which could help with repairs and help build the defense fortifications.</br>
</br>
After regrouping, the First Corp force instantly expanded to more than four thousand people.</br>
</br>
The next morning, the regrouped First Corp continued to head to Jia City.</br>
</br>
As to the remaining prisoners rescued, after Cheng Weiguo sought Jiang Chen's opinion, he temporarily settled them in the Seventh Area and promised that once he captured the city, he would come back for them.</br>
</br>
The actual battlefield was in Jia.</br>
</br>
And the mutated humans stationed in the Seventh Area were only an appetizer.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
"Five power armors, 31 kinetic skeletons, destroyed. 110 fatalities, 132 seriously wounded. 210 thousand rounds of ammo and 2200 shells consumed." Inside the office, Han Junhua reported the battle stats of the First Division to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The proverb of as soon as the first shot is fired, million would be spent was indeed true. The first battle cost over 350,000 crystals. Even Jiang Chen who made millions in the food business exclaimed at the amount of money a war burned through.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, he didn't need to pocket the bill, but rather the war fund from the Sixth Street paid for it.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation at the Sixth Street?" Jiang Chen stared at the hologram map and asked.</br>
</br>
"The wall reinforcements are almost complete. At the same time, throwers activity is observed outside of the Sixth Street," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
With throwers arriving at the Sixth Street, it meant the zombies and mutants on the outskirt of the city center had spread to the rural areas already.</br>
</br>
"Lightning before the thunderstorm?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the red dot on the hologram map before he fell into silence.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the only thing he could do as a general was to sit in the office and wait for the news from the frontline. Followed by the expansion of the NAC, the number of things he needed to personally do decreased substantially. All the casualties and results were only presented to him as numbers.</br>
</br>
He heard someone knock.</br>
</br>
"Come in." Jiang Chen looked at the door.</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open, and the director of the Aerospace Technology Research Institute walked in. He had a delighted expression on his face which was unseen on everybody else in the base.</br>
</br>
"The thing you needed is now prepared."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then looked at the clock on the wall and got up.</br>
</br>
"Could you take me to have a look?"</br>
</br>
"Okay." Jiang Lin nodded and headed for the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"I'll have to leave this place to you."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Her response was always concise.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen arrived at the Aerospace Technology Research Institute's launching field along with Jiang Lin. A few workers were surrounding four-stories-high rockets while busy working on them. The meters high mechanical arm was connected by wires to the tablet as a technician was busy tapping on the screen while controlling the mechanical arm to extend the welding gun to weld the steel boards together.</br>
</br>
Other than the useless tools being sent for land reclamation, all the scientists in Fallout Shelter No.27, excluding the people from the Research Institute, entered into the fallout shelter. When Jiang Chen ordered Jiang Lin to start the Aerospace Technology Institute, these scientists moved to the Fishbone base with their families.</br>
</br>
They were first unwilling but did Jiang Chen really care about their unwillingness? The benefit was great, excluding the possibility of returning to the fallout shelter. Seeing the objection failed, they had to honestly contribute their knowledge and design rockets for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Dolphin-10 intercontinental ballistic missile, developed in the late 21st century and used till now, it was the most deployed missile type in PAC territory." Staring at the rocket, Jiang Lin certainly looked proud.</br>
</br>
To create this missile, he spent a lot of efforts learning. Although he didn't know why Jiang Chen needed a weapon that could hit the western hemisphere, he still followed Jiang Chen's order.</br>
</br>
This one missile spent more than one million crystals in supplies. Jiang Lin had repeatedly received rolled eyes from Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
Out of all the projects at the base, the Research Institute spent the most crystals because a lot of parts could not be produced, so they must pay expensive commission to explorer teams that headed out of the province.</br>
</br>
For example, the propulsion engine of the missile was transported from the shambles of the Taipei launch base six hundred kilometers away from Wanghai. To transport this propulsion engine, the mercenary groups had to take the risk of being shredded to pieces by mutated sharks, so the commission was indeed not low.</br>
</br>
But regardless of her rolling her eyes or not, she still had to grant the budget since it was the project personally approved by the general.</br>
</br>
"Why is it called the dolphin? That's a strange name." Jiang Chen was intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Deployed under the ocean, peace ambassador, you know." Jiang Lin used a welding gun to knock on the base on of the missile as he chuckled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen first took a moment to process his words before understanding the meaning behind it as he laughed along.</br>
</br>
Peace ambassador. (A play on words. Peace is pronounced the same way as nuclear destruction.)</br>
</br>
[People from the future were quite humorous.]</br>
</br>
"The entire missile is 11 meters long with a diameter of 1.55 meters; the launch weight is 35.1 tons. It could be deployed in nuclear silo 1200 meters deep into the sea with a maximum range of 21,000 kilometers."</br>
</br>
"The launch mechanism is a non-separate three-stage propulsion model, that is, the underwater propulsion ring will advance the missile 100 meters underwater after the missile separation. Then the missile engine ignites and pushes the missile to the near-Earth orbit after the engine flame stalls. After the missile approaches the target, the engine is reignited and strikes the target area vertically."</br>
</br>
"The missile shell is coated with an anti-radar material that reduces the radar 's reflected signal to the extent of a seagull, and theoretically only the' passive coherent positioning system can detect signs of the missile launch."</br>
</br>
In terms of its size, the 11 meters long ballistic missile seemed like a miniature toy compared to the twenty to thirty meters long ballistic missiles of the modern world. But without a doubt, anyone who dared to question its strength must pay for their mistake.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 436"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 436: The Construction Robot</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Based on a length of 11 meters and radius of 1.55 meters, the size of the missile was approximately 20.7 cubic meters, with a storage dimension the size of 30 cubic meters, it was not a big problem to haul it to the modern world.</br>
</br>
"Is the warhead placed inside?"</br>
</br>
"A five hundred ton hydrogen warhead is being welded in right now." Jiang Lin pointed at the mechanical arm.</br>
</br>
What's the meaning behind a five hundred ton hydrogen warhead? Four numbers could be used for reference.</br>
</br>
Personnel exposed: 4.1</br>
</br>
Personnel in a tank: 1.9</br>
</br>
Personnel in a bomb shelter: 0.7</br>
</br>
Personnel in a fallout shelter: 0.46</br>
</br>
The four numbers refer to the lethal striking radius to personnel by a five hundred ton hydrogen bomb in kilometers, it doesn't include the radiation damage. Of course, it was estimated based on the modern world's standard.</br>
</br>
The power armor and tank in the apocalypse were often designed with a lead fiber insulation layer which was highly effective against radiation damage. Because of this, the purpose of a nuclear missile was often to cripple the enemy's basic infrastructure and prevent the light infantry from entering the battlefield.</br>
</br>
Only two or three deployed under the sea were necessary for the almost impossible to intercept five hundred thousand ton nuclear warhead to create nuclear deterrence. Once Xin announced itself as a nuclear nation with possession of global strike capability, even if the UA wanted to plot against Xin, they would have to weigh in the total worth of New York and Washington.</br>
</br>
Deterrence was enough.</br>
</br>
If possible, Jiang Chen hoped he would never use it.</br>
</br>
Because once the button is pressed, the thing could not be stopped. Even with the technology in the 22nd century, it could not stop the brutal yet straightforward weapon.</br>
</br>
"How many warheads can be produced with the remaining nuclear material?' Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Including the Uranium as well as the nuclear material confiscated from the Sixth Street, probably two more." Jiang Lin estimated and gave a conservative number.</br>
</br>
The material required for the production of the dirty-type thermonuclear weapon is mainly tritium and tritium lithium, while uranium 235 is only the initiation device. There is only one way to get tritium on the wasteland and that is to extract one or two grams of tritium from the nuclear materials that have not been used up.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was much easier to produce the non-dirty type thermonuclear weapon. Helium-3 would be extracted from a commercial-type nuclear fusion battery as raw material. However, because helium-3 and deuterium thermonuclear reaction will only produce non-radioactive protons, the use of helium-3 as nuclear warhead raw materials will not produce radiation so that the deterrence would be much smaller.</br>
</br>
Such technology has yet to be developed in the modern world, even if the technical capacity were there, it would be hard to achieve.</br>
</br>
</br>
Because the total helium three reserve was estimated to be 500 kilograms, the closest helium three mine was located on the moonâ€¦</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he was pleased with the result. "Great, your next mission is to create two more peace ambassadors."</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to use these to clear out mutants? Allow me to be frank, nuclear weapon's damage to mutants are not ideal, those things crawled out of the nuclear crater in the first place. And the nuclear crater produced from the explosion may be used as a nest for mutants like Death Claw." Jiang Lin hesitated for a moment and reminded him.</br>
</br>
"Of course it will not be used against mutants. If I wanted to blow mutants up, wouldn't it be better for me to get artilleries to launch the warheads? What's the point of creating an intercontinental ballistic missile? As to the purpose, you don't have to worry about it, just help me move this missile to the backyard of the mansion.</br>
</br>
As soon as Jiang Chen finished, he left.</br>
</br>
As the general, he didn't need to explain his actions to anyone. And because of that, Jiang Lin only let out a sigh wryly before he began ordering people to transport the Dolphin-10.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Returning to the backyard of the mansion, Jiang Chen began to disassemble the eight containers brought back by Wang Zhaowu from camp 27. The 400 tons of equipment included two construction robots, an underwater floatation device with a maximum capacity of four people, and a construction module; mining module that could be installed on the underwater floatation device.</br>
</br>
The construction robot was a great invention. It could use the construction information downloaded on its chip to auto-complete construction. Although the automatic construction process was slower than manual operations, it was more precise and convenient.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen wanted to modify the vessels Russia sold him, he only needed to scan the model of the vessel with a scanner back. Then bring it to the experts' familiar with the area in Fallout Shelter No. 27, use the quantum computer to create a modification plan, and then download the construction information onto the construction robot's chip. He only needed to provide the material, the specific steps would be auto-completed by the construction robot.</br>
</br>
After that, he returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen drove by himself to a deserted island east of Ange Land.</br>
</br>
One advantage of Pannu Islands was the number of islands in the territory, Due to the ten billion construction projects, most of the deserted ideas in Xin were under his name. It included this island called "Coconut". Although when Jiang Chen landed on the island, he didn't see a lot of coconut trees; there were mainly short woods typical to rainforests and the barren gravel.</br>
</br>
After a trip to the apocalypse, Jiang Chen first brought back the two construction robots and a drone terminal.</br>
</br>
The robot was one and a half meters in height with a fluid looking shell. Although it looked a bit dumb, it was meticulous in its work. The crab-like claws were equipped with welding equipment, multiuse wrenches, and other tools. The half belt half walking base could move rapidly on flat ground while being able to traverse in complex terrains.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen installed a drone terminal in the dense forest in the middle of the island and released 20 Hummingbird drones to scan the less than one square kilometers wide island, and then he registered the hologram map onto the control of the construction robot.</br>
</br>
After the data finished uploading, Jiang Chen made several runs and brought the components of the underwater floatation device, the solar generator, as well as some reinforce steels and concrete over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen first marked the area where the supplies were stored on the island and then chose a relatively high point on the 3D map for the location of the solar panels.</br>
</br>
The two construction robots immediately turned its' belts and moved to the components of the solar generator. After they transported the parts to the targeted location, the two construction robots skillfully began to assemble to solar generator together.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only waited 15 minutes before the two robots completed the work.</br>
</br>
"This is amazing."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the masterpiece of the two robots as he exclaimed out loud.</br>
</br>
The technology from the 22nd century, the ability to complete constructions automatically, it made building things as simple as RTS games, just build wherever you click. If this technology were introduced to the market, a lot of construction companies would kill to get their hands on it.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen would not introduce it to the world in the next little while.</br>
</br>
The really good things must be kept in his own hands. He'll introduce it once he gets bored of it.</br>
</br>
With the tablet in his hand, Jiang Chen sent the two robots to be charged on the drone terminal. Then he set a project to construct a two dock harbor and then added the assembly of the underwater floatation device onto the construction list.</br>
</br>
With the symbol of  on the screen, he verified to ensure he didn't miss anything before closing the tablet.</br>
</br>
He only needed to wait for construction to finish.</br>
</br>
To ensure the safety and privacy of the island, Jiang Chen deliberated for a moment before he decided to not station any soldiers of Celestial Trade. It was not that he didn't trust his own soldiers, but he was afraid people who kept an eye on Celestial would notice this place.</br>
</br>
Once the island is stationed with people, it meant constant supply to the island which would reduce the hiddenness of the "Coconut Island". At least before the construction robots finish construction, it was better to keep it as hidden as possible.</br>
</br>
For now, the best security would be the drones.</br>
</br>
Returning to the drone terminal, Jiang Chen changed the drones' mission from reconnaissance to alert. Once the drones notice any boats approaching, the fourth-dimensional messenger device located inside would alert his EP.</br>
</br>
After all this, Jiang Chen stretched his body and returned to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
But what he didn't expect was that just as he returned, he encountered a severe situation.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<hr id="Chapter 437"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 437: A Sea of Zombies</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Standing on top of the patrol tower, the pack of zombies swarmed together to form a sea of zombies. This scene could only be seen in the city center before, but now they were here in the quiet rural areas. No one knew why the mutant flood erupted; maybe it was because of a lack of living space in the city center or possibly because of the desire to hunt in groups. Regardless, they were here.</br>
</br>
This despairing scene made any bystanders uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
The twenty-meter-high wall couldn't bring a sense of security to the people, becauseâ€¦</br>
</br>
Amidst the howling noises, a thrower, with tumbling steps, ran to the Fishbone base wall and tossed the infant zombie in its hands at the soldiers on the wall. The infant-sized zombie screamed with its dry lips and leaped at the soldiers firing on the wall.</br>
</br>
Then it suddenly exploded.</br>
</br>
"Ahh! My eyes!" A soldier with acid splattered in his eyes covered his face while he howled and rolled on the ground. He was better off than the others because the two soldiers at the center of explosion instantly lost their ability to breathe.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! It's the thrower - get it!" Wang Zhaowu roared at the top of his lungs into his earpiece.</br>
</br>
Just as his voice faded, a sniper rifle exploded the head of the thrower.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, with one foot on the wall, reloaded the Ghost sniper rifle with a crisp "Clang" before she continued to target the zombies. She pressed the trigger another time and executed another thrower with its hand just starting to come into view.</br>
</br>
Watching this scene, Wang Zhaowu couldn't feel more tense. It wasn't because of Sun Jiao's shooting skills but rather her identity as the missus of the general.</br>
</br>
If anything happened to her, Jiang Chen would shred him to pieces. But even though he used up all the excuses he could think of to convince her, Sun Jiao disregarded all his comments and still stood fearlessly on the wall.</br>
</br>
Objectively speaking, Sun Jiao was the person with the strongest combat abilities in the entire base. The soldiers standing there had barely gotten training for more than a year while Sun Jiao started roaming the wasteland from a very young age - more than ten years in total.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he couldn't persuade her, Wang Zhaowu gave up.</br>
</br>
There were only five T-3 power armors stationed at the Fishbone base - the rest had been transported to the Sixth Street to provide it with an extended line of defense. The situation was even more critical there as the swarms of mutant mosquitos had almost broken their line of defense. Fortunately, there were a lot of experienced soldiers at the Sixth Street who were all masters who had wandered the wasteland from the beginning. They took out their flaming robots and Molotov cocktails since director Chu Nan announced that the military government would compensate any damaged equipment. To save their own lives, no one dared to hide their treasure horde of weapons any longer.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the Fishbone side, aside from the five T-3s, only two newly developed T-4s had been produced. And now they were stationed on the wall, unleashing their firepower upon the zombies.</br>
</br>
The drone attack force roamed outside the base and sniped the zombies' heads with their small caliber machine guns.</br>
</br>
Then there were the soldiers in heavy bulletproof vests kneeled behind the cover of the wall, their backs carrying a cylinder full of organic fuel. With their flamethrowers ready, they were cautious of any flying mutants that could appear.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the light infantry with Reaper Assault Rifles or gunners firing machine guns, all the combat units on the wall had the same mission:</br>
</br>
It was to keep the zombies as far away from the base as possible.</br>
</br>
Just as Wang Zhaowu looked at the swarm of zombies with a perplexed look, Jiang Chen stepped into the patrol tower.</br>
</br>
"General." Wang Zhaowu saluted.</br>
</br>
"How's the situation?"</br>
</br>
He had only been gone for a few hours as the situation deteriorated to this point. As he stared at the endless sea of zombies, he suddenly felt like the base was a small boat in a massive ocean.</br>
</br>
"Terrible. There are too many zombies," Wang Zhaowu said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
The zombies wouldn't die unless they were hit in the head. After fighting for so long, even though the wall was packed with fully equipped soldiers and sentry guns firing, the zombies still managed to reach the bottom of the wall.</br>
</br>
Below the wall, the zombies raised their heads and screamed ferociously. They extended their arms, attempting to reach the 20-meter-high wall, pass over it, and rip apart the humans on the other side. The zombies in the back swarmed in and used the zombies in front to boost themselves up, creating a slope made of corpses.</br>
</br>
This was what Wang Zhaowu was most afraid of.</br>
</br>
Twenty meters was only six stories high. It would only take thousands of zombies to create a slope. And how many zombies were radiating out from the city center? It would be an underestimation to say a million.</br>
</br>
To prevent the corpse ladder strategy, the soldiers on the wall tossed grenades at the tightly-packed zombies. But this was only a band-aid solution as even though grenades could do significant damage to the zombies, their corpses would still remain behind the wall.</br>
</br>
Through the bulletproof glass, Jiang Chen gazed at the countless broken faces. Occasionally, a few infant zombies would smash into the glass of the patrol tower, creating dark green stains.</br>
</br>
"General." Wang Zhaowu took a deep breath and carefully opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Your missus is there." Wang Zhaowu pointed at the wall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched Sun Jiao firing her sniper rifle as he spoke helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Just let her be."</br>
</br>
He could understand her intentions of wanting to help. Right now, they were only in the initial stage of the mutant flood, so it wasn't too dangerous for her to be on the frontlines; he might as well just let her be. Especially considering her combat abilities, she would be okay even if everyone else on the wall died.</br>
</br>
"What's the status of the Roar mortars at the base?" Jiang Chen picked up the binoculars and observed the distribution of zombies in the distance. Inside the sea of zombies, Jiang Chen spotted a few vomiters with their bellies raised.</br>
</br>
"Prepared and ready to launch," Wang Zhaowu answered.</br>
</br>
Since mortar shells weren't unlimited, Fishbone base only had a reserve of 2000 rounds. Only when the zombies were in large enough numbers would bombardment by the mortars be most effective. So up til now, Wang Zhaowu hadn't used the mortars yet.</br>
</br>
"Then use it now - I see vomiters appearing 6.6 kilometers away," Jiang Chen lowered his binoculars in front of his chest as he spoke gravely.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu was shocked as he immediately picked up the binoculars and looked into the distance.</br>
</br>
He was too busy having a headache about what was happening that he forgot to check the horizon.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu put out the order:</br>
</br>
"Attention mortars, angle 72 degrees, distance 6.5 kilometers, fire!"</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The sound of shells being unloaded transmitted from the square at the center of the base. The ten mortars formed a formulation with ten soldiers operating them. The shells were launched into the sky with an electromagnetic propulsion with a maximum range of 12 kilometers.</br>
</br>
The mortars could launch 20 shells per minute on average. In just a minute, 200 shells were fired.</br>
</br>
In their field of vision, the twenty-something vomiters were instantly covered by the shells raining down from the sky.</br>
</br>
Thick smoke engulfed the sky. A minute later, new zombies made their way through the thick smoke. And the vomiters were blown to pieces.</br>
</br>
"How many shells can the military plant produce?" Jiang Chen asked Wang Zhaowu as he gazed at the black smoke in the distance.</br>
</br>
"If there are enough supplies, the maximum production is 200 shells."</br>
</br>
[200 shells? A day's production isn't enough for one minute.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was thinking hard.</br>
</br>
He was contemplating if he should bring something over from the modern world.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 438: Incinerating Zombies</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The zombies behind the wall were piled two to three meters high already. Seeing as the opportunity was right, the survivors brought the fuel cylinders up to the wall and began to pour it onto the zombies. Then the survivors tossed down torches.</br>
</br>
The fuel wasn't gasoline but an organic fuel similar to an alcohol mixture. It is worth mentioning that most of the vehicles in the 22nd century used high-capacity batteries, not fossil fuels. Because of this, all of Wanghai City barely had any fuel stations; what replaced them were charging stations.</br>
</br>
Controllable fusion made electricity extremely cheap in the 22nd century. Power was produced from the fusion power stations located on the moon then transported through wireless technology to relaying satellites before reaching the earth's surface. Fossil fuels naturally, were replaced.</br>
</br>
And because of this, ten minutes after the war erupted, the world was vulnerable to a massive blackout. The small number of nuclear power and geothermal stations could only sustain military production rates. A lot of the nuclear fusion batteries used in civilian facilities were all confiscated and sent to the frontlines as fuel for power armor and tanks.</br>
</br>
What was worse was that in the next few nuclear winters after the war, the survivors couldn't find any fuel at all. Without power, electric heaters became scrap metal. The one saving grace was that the World Alliance Organization was at least somewhat useful - they left the survivors technology related to crystals, a large number of unused weapons and functional production equipment. This allowed the survivors, who had to face mutants and harsh winters, to have a chance at survival.</br>
</br>
Although these weapons consequentially caused the birth of raiders, they did help the survivors pass through the most challenging period of time. Even if most survivors felt angry and disappointment towards the space colonization ship project, they still recognized that the World Alliance Organization did something good for them.</br>
</br>
Flames were blazing and burning sky-high.</br>
</br>
Thick smoke from four different directions engulfed Fishbone base. The soldiers all wore protective masks and the survivors all fled from the wall, covering their noses and mouths.</br>
</br>
The fuel itself produced only a small amount of smoke; the burning zombies were the major source of the smoke. The thick smoke surrounding the base was almost comparable to a chemical weapon which substantially impaired the vision of the soldiers on the wall.</br>
</br>
It wasn't easy to produce the fuel - aside from requiring Carm tree sap as the raw ingredient, the fuel consumed 1.3 times the electricity compared to the heat generated through burning. With twenty cylinders dumped down, it used a total of 15 tons of Carm tree sap and five thousand crystals.</br>
</br>
War is the same as burning money; Jiang Chen just witnessed a fine example to this point.</br>
</br>
</br>
Because of the obstruction due to the smoke, the zombies couldn't rush up the wall for the time being. Aside from retaining the instinct to hunt for people, zombies also retained a fear of flames. Although they wouldn't necessarily flee, zombies wouldn't come any closer either.</br>
</br>
After the drones confirmed the zombies halted their attack, the soldiers on the wall finally got some breathing room. Soldiers with sore shoulders and necks all sat along the wall while volunteer workers and women headed onto the wall, bringing nutrient supply, water, and towels to the people protecting them.</br>
</br>
The flames lasted two hours.</br>
</br>
Once the flames stopped, the carcasses piled one-story high turned to dust and left with the wind.</br>
</br>
"The most difficult period is the night." Wang Zhaowu, with eyebrows furrowed, stared at the outside.</br>
</br>
"Can the soldiers handle it?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Rotating five shifts. Every two hours, 400 people go to sleep. The production line for the machine guns and ammo can't stop; they have to handle it. There isn't much fuel at the base, so we have to do this."</br>
</br>
The patrol tower, acting as the command tower, had been fitted with an air filtration device. Although there was thick smoke outside, the air in the room was somewhat normal.</br>
</br>
"Can you use gasoline?" Jiang Chen asked abruptly.</br>
</br>
"Gasoline?" Wang Zhaowu processed this for a second before he said with a wry smile, "It would work, but where are we going to find that? Wanghai City before the war was an economic center, not an industrial base. Even if there were factories that used fuel before, they're most likely cleaned out by survivors searching for fuel."</br>
</br>
Although fossil-based fuels were abandoned, there were still industrial applications for oil. Aside from burning, oil could be used as an excellent organic solvent as well as the raw material for rubber and plastic products.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu naturally assumed Jiang Chen was talking about industrial fuel since he didn't know Jiang Chen's secret.</br>
</br>
With a smile on his face, Jiang Chen said, while scratching his chin: "You don't have to worry about it. I'll think of some ways to bring some here.</br>
</br>
"That would be the best." Wang Zhaowu was out of solutions himself.</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a weak knocking sound at the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
The door opened and a figure that surprised Jiang Chen appeared at the door.</br>
</br>
The girl wore a giant protective mask and timidly walked into the room. Her white cotton dress was stained with dirty smoke. Jiang Chen noticed there was a delicate lunchbox tightly clenched between her arms.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao? Why are you here?" Jiang Chen walked over, surprised by her presence.</br>
</br>
"I-I was afraid you might be hungry," she said timidly. Then she took out a giant mask, smiled at Jiang Chen and handed him the lunchbox between her arms. "So I cooked some food for you and brought it over."</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu knew too well what to do in this situation and turned around to face the wall.</br>
</br>
But he muttered in his mind: [Good thing my daughter is only a one-year-old.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen would have a spectacular expression if he could read his mind.</br>
</br>
"Did you eat?" Jiang Chen kneeled down and tousled Yao Yao's head.</br>
</br>
"I haven't." Yao Yao scratched her face and said in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Then let's go eat together." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"But, is this place going to be okay?" Yao Yao looked warily at the thick smoke outside.</br>
</br>
"General, don't worry, I'm here." Wang Zhaowu turned around just at the right time, speaking at just the right moment.</br>
</br>
[Nice, I like you.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled at him and nodded before he picked up Yao Yao's hand.</br>
</br>
"Let's go. Let's ask Sun Jiao to come along."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Yao Yao nodded as she held onto his familiar, big hand with a joyful smile.</br>
</br>
After he put on his protective mask, Jiang Chen managed to find Sun Jiao with a sniper rifle at the corner of the stairs. With her face pitch-black, Jiang Chen couldn't hold in his laughter and passed her a protective mask.</br>
</br>
"This place is going to choke me to death." Sun Jiao rolled her eyes exaggeratedly as she snatched the protective mask and put it on.</br>
</br>
"I told you to stay home, but you just had to come out," Jiang Chen chirped.</br>
</br>
"I wanted to. And I took out 51 throwers today - shouldn't you compliment me?" Sun Jiao swished her luscious hair filled with dust as she spoke with her chest raised proudly.</br>
</br>
"If you dare to get hurt, I'll make sure you learn a lesson or two."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave her a hard stare, although no one could see his expression behind his giant mask.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 439: The Heartwarming Bubble Bath</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When they returned home, Sun Jiao didn't even take off her mask before she ran into the shower. Although she didn't care about her appearance on the frontline, the civilized side of her loved being clean in her everyday life.</br>
</br>
She definitely didn't want to expose her ugly side to the people she liked. Although Jiang Chen thought Sun Jiao with a face covered with dust and soot was still cute.</br>
</br>
There were two bathtubs in the mansion. Jiang Chen also wanted to take a shower after sneaking out from the smoke of the burning zombies, but when he realized there were only two bathtubs, he met a pair of big, timid eyes filled with hope.</br>
</br>
"If we bathed together, Yao Yao wouldn't mind."</br>
</br>
With a completely red face, Yao Yao buried her head, her fingers twisted together.</br>
</br>
After wavering for a moment, she worked up the courage to continue: "And-and Yao Yao has great back rubbing skills. If you don't believe me, you can ask Xiaorou."</br>
</br>
Without any impure thoughts, and purely because he didn't want to reject the eyes filled with hope, Jiang Chen gulped and led her soft hand into the washroom.</br>
</br>
He felt like he was a thief.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat in the bathtub filled with bubbles as the girl hummed cheerful tones while she rubbed Jiang Chen's back.</br>
</br>
Her wet strands of hair, mixed with a refreshing fragrance, constantly stroked Jiang Chen's back because of her movements.</br>
</br>
The on-and-off coolness somehow made him lose control, especially since the soft hands seemed like they had some magical effects as he felt all his weariness being washed away.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it was a delightful experience having a Loli rubbing his back.</br>
</br>
[Yao Yao, grow up soonerâ€¦]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered in his mind.</br>
</br>
When would the inducer effect be alleviated?</br>
</br>
"Turn around; the front needs to be washed too." Yao Yao didn't notice the change in Jiang Chen as she spoke to him in a cheerful tone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt a warm itching beside his ear and he inhaled deeply. He used some bubbles to cover up his waist while forcing a smile.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I can do it myself."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao turned her head and her cute mouth moved.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen felt relieved and thought it was over, the sound of water came from behind him.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao stood up, held the side of the bathtub, swiveled her smooth legs, and carefully turned around before she sat back in the water.</br>
</br>
After she gained her balance, Yao Yao nervously shook her legs in the water and said what she had been hoping with a blushed face.</br>
</br>
"Could you help Yao Yao rub her back?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's instincts told him it was better to say no.</br>
</br>
But the cute voice made it impossible to refuse.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
When the blushing Yao Yao and Jiang Chen came out of the bathroom, it was already dark outside.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the dining room, the three girls had already been waiting for a while. The hungry Lin Lin pouted and sat in front of the table with her chopsticks. When the two latecomers finally appeared in the hallway, she secretly peeked at them before moving her gaze away. Sun Jiao and Sun Xiaorou gazed at Jiang Chen slyly.</br>
</br>
One was slightly jealous; the other had other nefarious intentions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt awkward under their gazes. He sat down while scratching his nose while Yao Yao, with her face still red, ran into the kitchen.</br>
</br>
When he sat down, he felt three pairs of eyes focused on him.</br>
</br>
"Did you eat her?" Sun Jiao grinned.</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen shook his head as he had a wry smile. "Am I that big of a pervert?"</br>
</br>
The three girls all nodded simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression changed as he wanted to rebut, but he didn't know what to say so he stared at Lin Lin instead.</br>
</br>
"Why are you involved in this? Aren't you afraid I'll turn into a pervert?"</br>
</br>
For some reason, Lin Lin didn't use her loud mouth and only made a funny face at Jiang Chen before she looked away.</br>
</br>
[Eh? Something feels odd.]</br>
</br>
[Is she sick?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wondered.</br>
</br>
When he recalled the last time Lin Lin coughed, he felt concerned. Although Lin Lin always argued with Sun Jiao and himself, she was a kind person (digitalized human) inside. But just as he was about to ask about her health, Yao Yao brought some steaming food over.</br>
</br>
"Time to eat. We're eating hotpot today." Yao Yao happily removed the cover of the pot.</br>
</br>
"Smells so good! Finally, we can eat. I'm starving." Lin Lin stood up excitedly and reached out with her chopsticks first.</br>
</br>
"No one's trying to fight you for it." Sun Jiao rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"If you're slow, the delicious lamb rolls will be gone." Lin Lin chewed while she smirked.</br>
</br>
"â€¦"</br>
</br>
The question hanging in Jiang Chen's mind was quickly taken over by the happy atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Considering how energetic Lin Lin looked now, he didn't ask more.</br>
</br>
[Perhaps it was just an illusion; maybe she's okay nowâ€¦] Jiang Chen thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
After dinner, Sun Jiao left with the sniper rifle again. Jiang Chen rested on the sofa for a while before he headed to the backyard. Since the apocalypse lacked fuel, he planned to bring back some gasoline.</br>
</br>
Speaking of gasoline, when he saw the swarms of zombies, he suddenly had an idea: what if he brought back weapons from the modern world?</br>
</br>
He always had the perception that the weapons from the modern world were all subpar in penetration and stability compared to the arms of the apocalypse. And since the apocalypse had never lacked weapons before, he never considered this option.</br>
</br>
But when he carefully thought it over, weapons from the modern world weren't necessarily useless. At least when used against flesh, there wasn't much difference between the Reaper Assault Rifle and AK47. A headshot yielded the same result with the only problems being recoil and accuracy. If they weren't being used against zombies with higher mutation levels or mutants with stronger defenses, modern weapons could still be useful in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
A lot of the pistols and rifles created by survivors weren't necessarily stronger than their modern world counterparts.</br>
</br>
Of course, this wasn't to say Jiang Chen planned to bring light weapons back; Fishbone base had a high reserve of ammo and rifles, and the ammo production line was also in steady production. As to what exactly to bring, he needed to think carefully. The most crucial task was to solve the fuel problem.</br>
</br>
"Do you need my help?" Just as Jiang Chen reached the door, Sun Xiaorou stopped him and said with seriousness, "With my abilities, I can be helpful in combat."</br>
</br>
The ability to explode crystals?</br>
</br>
[It will be helpful, but it'll burn too much moneyâ€¦] Jiang Chen muttered in his head.</br>
</br>
"It's okay. Your sister is giving me enough of a headache."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou gave up the idea.</br>
</br>
"Be careful when you're out there.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." He nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
He put on the protective mask and left again.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 440: Purchasing Gasoline</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The scenery changed and the repressive atmosphere instantly vanished.</br>
</br>
Interdimensional travel took him to Coconut Island.</br>
</br>
As part of his routine, he confirmed that there were no calls before he headed to the beach.</br>
</br>
The two construction robots were still working meticulously on the construction site. After he checked their progress on the tablet, Jiang Chen let them be and boarded his boat. He took out the backup oil canister and filled up the boat before he soared to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
It was deep into the night; only a few scattered lights were visible in the city center.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't immediately return to his mansion when he got off the boat. Instead, he drove to a gas station at the southern end of the island.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen parked beside a self-serving pump, he honked a few times.</br>
</br>
Immediately after, the employee working the night shift walked out.</br>
</br>
The man in uniform rubbed his eyes while walking out sluggishly. He had been taking a nap.</br>
</br>
Most of the citizens in Xin were bilingual. Kebal glanced at Jiang Chen in the car, yawned, put his hand on the roof, and spoke in annoyance.</br>
</br>
"How much do you want to add?"</br>
</br>
"As much as possible."</br>
</br>
Kebal took a moment to process what he just heard and tugged on his mustache.</br>
</br>
"How much?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to waste words on him as he took out a stack of cash and slapped it onto his car hood. "2000 USD. Please prepare a few barrels for me."</br>
</br>
Just in case, he usually kept some cash in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
2000 USD?!</br>
</br>
Kebal was instantly awake. He didn't move, but he looked suspiciously at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"2000 USD? Why do you need so much gasoline?"</br>
</br>
He had to ask because Xin wasn't completely at peace, which made everyone uneasy. If he sold this much gasoline and someone used it for terrorism, he would be the one to blame.</br>
</br>
Even if selling this much gasoline would get him more commission at the month's end, he was afraid to sell this much right now!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh, took out the Presidential Palace document and waved it in front of him.</br>
</br>
"It's not good for you to ask too many questions, buddy."</br>
</br>
Kebal took a look at the document and all his suspicions disappeared. To be able to freely enter the Xin Presidential Palace, this guy was definitely not a terrorist and likely working for the president.</br>
</br>
"The barrels are in the warehouse, wait a moment." Kebal handed the document back to Jiang Chen before he jogged to the warehouse.</br>
</br>
"Wait, do you have a truck here?" Jiang Chen stuck his head out the window and stopped him.</br>
</br>
Kebal shook his head. "No, but my pickup truck that I use is there."</br>
</br>
"Okay, what's your name?"</br>
</br>
Kebal paused.</br>
</br>
"Kebal. Why?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Kebal, do you want to make 1000 USD?" Jiang Chen put his hand in his pocket and pulled out another stack of cash with a smile.</br>
</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Because the Development and Reform Commission (1) didn't exist, the oil prices in Xin reflected the international market. After the global crude market plunged to below 30 USD per barrel, the 91-grade gasoline dropped down to 1.3 USD per gallon, equivalent to 0.34 USD per liter.</br>
</br>
By conversion, how much gasoline could 2000 USD buy?</br>
</br>
A total of 5882.4 liters!</br>
</br>
With a barrel capable of storing 159 liters, 2000 USD could purchase 37 barrels in total! Kebal flipped through the entire warehouse and finally managed to find enough barrels.</br>
</br>
With this large batch of gasoline, it was enough for the zombies outside Fishbone base to have a great time.</br>
</br>
Kebal worked diligently with the thousand dollar tip motivating him. He hauled empty barrels onto his pickup truck before he started to pump in gasoline.</br>
</br>
[1000 USD to move the barrels to Celestial Trade's warehouse. Where can I find more of this work?]</br>
</br>
After a few trips, he finally managed to transport all the barrels.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen handed him the tip and told him to "keep everything that happened today deep inside your heart." Kebal promised to all the greater beings he could think of, then Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder, told him to prepare a few more barrels for next time before signaling him to leave.</br>
</br>
Watching Kebal drive away, Jiang Chen closed the door of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
He moved the gasoline into the storage dimension before he traveled back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The moment he arrived, he heard gunshots in the distance.</br>
</br>
He placed the gasoline into the warehouse in the backyard. He called Wang Qin, ordering her to move the barrels into the storage.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin was used to the general's mysterious ability to make supplies appear in the backyard, so she didn't ask more and immediately commanded the workers from the logistics department to carefully transport the highly explosive substance to a standalone warehouse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stepped onto the command tower again as he met Wang Zhaowu with a stern expression.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation like now?"</br>
</br>
"We already consumed 40% of the fuel reserve at the base, the production of fuel is far slower than the consumption, and the remaining Carm tree sap will only allow us to produce 30 more barrels. The Sixth Street's fuel is barely enough for them and they can't spare any additional fuel to help us. With our current state, we won't be able to clear the zombie bodies even after three days." Wang Zhaowu provided the bad news.</br>
</br>
Looking at Wang Zhaowu's expression, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"I already solved the fuel problem."</br>
</br>
Considering that only six hours had passed, there was no way Jiang Chen could've acquired so much fuel. Therefore, Wang Zhaowu smiled wryly. "A few barrels aren't enough to solve the problem. There isn't a lot of fat in the zombies' bodies; it would take around 300 L of fuel to burn the bodies just surrounding one wall, and the base has four walls."</br>
</br>
"Is 37 barrels enough?"</br>
</br>
[37 barrels?]</br>
</br>
[37 barrels!]</br>
</br>
After he finally finished processing, Wang Zhaowu's eyes widened and he stared at Jiang Chen. "37 barrels?! How many liters per barrel?"</br>
</br>
"159 liters. It's in the warehouse now."</br>
</br>
"159 liters, that'sâ€¦ 5883 liters! Hahaha! That's amazing!" While he was thrilled at the news, Wang Zhaowu banged his hand on the table and pressed his earpiece. "Attention incinerating team, prepare to transport fuel from the warehouse. Let's burn these motherfu*kers!"</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
After finishing his command, Wang Zhaowu realized his blunder, so he started to laugh awkwardly.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't mind. "Don't worry about the fuel, I'll bring a few more batches over. You must keep the walls secure - don't skimp on the fuel, understand?"</br>
</br>
"Understand!" Wang Zhaowu saluted with confidence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's 37 barrels of fuel solved the urgent crisis at the base. As to how he obtained it, who cares? As a subordinate, Wang Zhaowu only needed to complete the mission assigned to him!</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 441: It had just began</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A battle in the night was extremely disadvantageous to the survivors - not only would the soldiers' view be obstructed, but their weariness would also increase. They had some night vision goggles, but nowhere near enough to supply all 2000 soldiers, so the strategy Wang Zhao decided upon was using a physical light source.</br>
</br>
After a period of time, the mortars would launch a few lightning bombs that would linger in the air and illuminate the battlefield with a bright red luminance. Although they couldn't make the battlefield as bright as day, there would be ample light for shooting.</br>
</br>
On the zombie's side, the night brought them several advantages.</br>
</br>
When the zombies were free from the sunlight, they were suddenly more fierce as if they were all on drugs. The typical zombies weren't only faster, but the arm strength of the throwers was also stronger as they tossed their "sons" into the base. The exploding infant zombies indeed created a lot of problems for the soldiers on the wall as they were taken down, one by one. This scene alone depressed everyone's mood.</br>
</br>
Pouring down gasoline every six hours was the only opportunity for the soldiers defending the wall to rest. Only massive fire would make the zombies feel fear and stop their march toward the survivor base.</br>
</br>
But when the flames vanished, the flood of zombies would continue their attack.</br>
</br>
As the leader of the Second Corps, Wang Zhaowu didn't get much shuteye during the night. He only took naps on the sofa when the zombies were being burned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took Sun Jiao back to the mansion at 12. Although Sun Jiao wanted to do everything she could to protect the base, Jiang Chen wouldn't allow her to fight in a fatigued state.</br>
</br>
But speaking of Sun Jiao, Jiang Chen originally thought that a single person couldn't have a large impact on the battlefield until he discovered that she made a huge difference. Her precise shooting meant that a lot of throwers were unable to attack before their heads were popped off by the sniper rifles.</br>
</br>
After six hours, over 200 throwers died by her gun! While the kills boosted the soldiers' morale, the pressure the east wall faced was also significantly alleviated because the east side was facing the city center.</br>
</br>
For now, the greatest threat posed to the soldiers on the wall was the throwers.</br>
</br>
The next morning, the zombie attack slowed down.</br>
</br>
Even during the mutant flood, the concentration of zombies wasn't uniform. After the conclusion of one wave, there would be a short or long dormant period. Until the next wave arrived, the base was safe.</br>
</br>
Standing on top of the wall, the scene on the outside was glorious.</br>
</br>
The wall was burnt to a crisp black. The coal and bone dust mixed together to form patches of black and white while a repulsive burned smell drifted through the air. The burning of gasoline created a 7-meter vacuum outside the wall, but further outside the wall was still a pile of corpses.</br>
</br>
</br>
The remains of zombies began to let out a disgusting smell. The previously unrotten skin tissue maintained by the x1 bacteria began to deteriorate. Mosquitos and flies began to circle the air; the plate-sized flies and human leg-long mosquitos sent a chill down everyone's spines just by their appearance.</br>
</br>
The occasional zombie that blankly wandered around the wall was quickly shot.</br>
</br>
"Is this it?" On top of the wall, Jiang Chen asked Sun Jiao beside him.</br>
</br>
"It's only the beginning." Sun Jiao, with an SK10 in front of her chest, sighed.</br>
</br>
[Just the beginning?] Jiang Chen gazed at the mosquitos and flies that were beginning to accumulate.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, the more mutants in the area, the fewer the zombies; the distribution of the two was inversely proportional. Now that the concentration of zombies decreasedâ€¦</br>
</br>
It wasn't a good sign.</br>
</br>
"How long will this mutant flood last?" Jiang Chen asked wryly.</br>
</br>
"Until Wanghai City can return to a state of balance." Sun Jiao shrugged.</br>
</br>
Any creatures, including the zombies, would have an instinct to create their own space for survival. Once the population exceeded the threshold, the city center could no longer contain all of them, so they had to expand outward and increase the radius of the city center.</br>
</br>
Waiting alone would not end the mutant flood - only killing all the zombies and mutants migrating outward would end this war.</br>
</br>
If not, they would have to give up their own territory and migrate further.</br>
</br>
On the wasteland, where anyone could become mutated, natural selection remained the law.</br>
</br>
A zombie in the distance moved in their direction, so Sun Jiao grabbed the laser rifle hanging in front of her chest, extended the barrel, narrowed her eyes, and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
A needle-thin blue ray flashed as a fist-sized hole was instantly burned onto the zombie's forehead. Black content began to flow out. It took a few more steps before collapsing to the ground.</br>
</br>
A few rays flashed, and a few zombies dropped dead.</br>
</br>
It didn't have the sound effect typically found in science fiction movies; real laser rifles were silent killers. Although they had troublesome maintenance, expensive parts, limited range, and weak defense against EMP, making them far less popular than durable explosive rifles, Sun Jiao seemed to be particularly fond of them.</br>
</br>
Straight trajectory, no recoil, high power in close range.</br>
</br>
"It's a pretty high-tech weapon," Jiang Chen said enviously while looking at the weapon in Sun Jiao's hands.</br>
</br>
He wanted to purchase a few of the laser weapons as part of his collection, but the Sixth Street weapon shop only sold the C-type battery used for laser rifles, not the laser rifles themselves. Because he never saw one while he was at the Sixth Street, he shoved the memory of it to the back of his head.</br>
</br>
The laser rifle was mostly used in space since no one dared to fire a standard rifle in gravity-free environments - firing just one shot might not hit anyone before the person who fired it would drift away.</br>
</br>
"This is considered high-tech?" Sun Jiao rolled her eyes and retracted the rifle. "Let's go down, it won't be safe on the wall in a bit."</br>
</br>
"The mutant mosquitos and the mutant flies?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes at the black cloud that began to form in the distance before turning around.</br>
</br>
Because of the appearance of flying mutants, Lu Huasheng immediately evacuated the survivors at the base and transferred them to the temporary emergency facility in the underground tunnel.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to brag about his foresight, but the temporary emergency facility he ordered to be built was useful. The flying mutants could easily fly over the wall of the base which would be a disaster to the normal survivors at the base.</br>
</br>
Hiding in the underground tunnel would protect them.</br>
</br>
After half a year of continual reinforcement, the primary transportation route between the Sixth Street and Fishbone base was fortified like an iron barrel. As long as both exits were secured, no mutants could attack them here.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao headed to the community center, they didn't encounter a lot of people along the way.</br>
</br>
After arriving at the command center, they saw the only remaining person in the community center â€“ Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
She had her arms crossed and was looking emotionlessly at the hologram map on the table.</br>
</br>
The red and blue dots intermingled together, marking the enemy and friendly forces. Just by the force distribution, the First Corps had gained the upper hand, but the expression on her face didn't indicate that at all.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation on the west line?" Jiang Chen immediately asked.</br>
</br>
"A bit problematic."</br>
</br>
Despite her an unchanging face, Han Junhua's voice betrayed a tone full of cautiousness.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
West line.</br>
</br>
The rural area of Jia, six kilometers away from Jia Sports Center, Cheng Weiguo established a temporary command post there.</br>
</br>
He was standing in front of the hologram map with a finger pointed fiercely at the major roadways on the map. Then he dragged out an attack red arrow and ordered his teams to push forward.</br>
</br>
"Attention Team 8, the mutated humans deployed a large amount of anti-air machine guns in the Sanshui Park. Your mission is to follow this line and penetrate the mutated humans' line of defense, and then take out the machine guns. Do you understand!"</br>
</br>
"Yes, Sir!"</br>
</br>
"Attention Team 5, attackâ€¦ Dammit." Cheng Weiguo looked up at the orange cloud that exploded in the air.</br>
</br>
Wide range electromagnetic interference bomb. It could disrupt any wireless signal in the area for up to an hour.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo cursed out as he smashed the radio filled with static noises onto the table and sat down on the chair. The electromagnetic interference was useful to both parties, without command, the troops in the front line would have to fight following their previous order.</br>
</br>
The boring trick could only waste time since both parties would be unable to strategize its force. But the mutated humans didn't need to strategize, as the defender, they only needed to defend.</br>
</br>
The mortar sounds in the distance never stopped. It made Cheng Weiguo feel flustered. The delaying tactic made him feel unsettled.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans surprisingly had some great tools, The Dusk Church was not an easy opponent.</br>
</br>
Soon after, a communication soldier ran in front of him.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo took a deep breath and spoke to him.</br>
</br>
"Notify Team 4 to push towards the intersection from Nanxi Road."</br>
</br>
Different from the terrain in Wanghai, Jia's complex river environment made it easy to defend and hard to attack. The command center of the mutated humans located in Jia Sports Center was between multiple rivers.</br>
</br>
In order to defend the attack of NAC's First Corps, the mutated humans were smarter this time. They destroyed all the bridges and held within the defense line. And these rivers caused a great deal of trouble to the NAC armor units.</br>
</br>
On the first day, the armored force of NAC was blocked at the highway entrance to the west of Jia. The bridge that stretched across the river were exploded into several segments. To allow the armored force to pass through, it took Wang Zhaowu some serious efforts.</br>
</br>
At first, they launched a round of artillery attacks at the mutated humans across the river, then the engineering soldiers built a floating bridge. Only after they conquered the bank across the river did the armored force finally pass through.</br>
</br>
Once the tanks crossed the river, the situation became a lot more positive. The armored force led the way with the infantries immediately following.</br>
</br>
</br>
They advanced rapidly for four kilometers as the mutated humans suffered constant defeat.</br>
</br>
But the situation quickly became grave again.</br>
</br>
After they entered the city center, the number of rivers increased which hindered the armored force's advancement.</br>
</br>
The catastrophic defeat in the Seventh Area made the mutated humans realize the power of NAC's armored units. Therefore they set up the defense line along the river and persisted on fighting the battle in the streets. The mutated humans stationed in Jia were a much tougher enemy.</br>
</br>
Other than the annoying anti-tank cannons and mortars, the mutated humans acquired a tactical nuke somehow. Two hundred infantries without armor protection instantly dropped down, and even a Tiger II stalled.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, most of the people who died were new recruits from the Seventh Area, Cheng Weiguo's eyebrows only twitched as he didn't feel too pained by the loss.</br>
</br>
But regardless, the battle turned into a stalemate. To defend against the possibility of another tactical nuke being dropped, Cheng Weiguo had to extend the battle line and gave up on the strategy of a group attack.</br>
</br>
These mutated humans were definitely commanded by humans!</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
There were around twenty thousand mutated humans stationed in Jia which was five times the First Corps' force. Although the First Corps was equipped with a significant amount of heavy weapons and armored units. Due to the complex river system, they were forced into a siege attack.</br>
</br>
"The lightning war strategy is being obstructed. The First Corps may not be able to conquer Jia in a short period of time." Han Junhua crossed her arms in front of her chest and said while studying the hologram map.</br>
</br>
"I already said, it's too crazy to fight two battles at the same time."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao scoffed and sat on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Did you not consider the possibility of the mutated humans blowing up the bridges?" Jiang Chen asked Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"A total of 217 bridges were destroyed. Based on PAC's road quality standard, destroying the supporting structure of a bridge would require at least 600 kilograms of explosives," Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
130.2 tons of explosives. The mutated humans had way too many supplies.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, how did these monsters acquire so many explosives," Sun Jiao cursed out in frustration.</br>
</br>
130 tons. Even if the entire Sixth Street were turned upside down, there wouldn't be that many explosives. Even if the Dusk Church had strong financial backing, they were a force migrated from the Northern Alliance Area. There was no reason they would possess so many supplies.</br>
</br>
"Maybe it is not explosives," Jiang Chen abruptly commented.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua and Sun Jiao both turned their attention to Jiang Chen. Suddenly, Sun Jiao seemed to have caught onto something.</br>
</br>
"Crystals!"</br>
</br>
"That's right. Sun Xairou said that her ability was induced through genetic engineering and not simply evolved from the genetic vaccines. Therefore, her ability is not unique within the Dusk," Jiang Chen said gravely.</br>
</br>
The ability to explode crystals.</br>
</br>
Mutated humans and humans were archenemies, only slavery and raid existed between the two with no possibility of trading. They acquired food through hunting the mutants, in the past ten something years, they must have accumulated a significant amount of unused crystals.</br>
</br>
Other people might not be able to afford it, but the mutated humans didn't care.</br>
</br>
"What are you saying?" Han Junhua looked at the two, puzzled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao exchanged eye contact before they told the story of Sun Xiaorou to her.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua lowered her head and deliberated for a moment.</br>
</br>
"I have a question I don't understand. Why is the Dusk Church able to establish a partnership with the mutated humans? Did you ask Sun Xiaorou this before?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao shook her head. She wouldn't make her sister recall the memory of her terrible past.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua then looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The mutated humans would require an improved FEV virus to obtain reproduction ability, and the Dusk needs the Garden of Eden technology in Fallout Shelter 005. The two parties have the same goal. The Dusk would leave the earth without leaving a trace behind, so it was not possible for them to have future conflicts," Jiang Chen organized the information he knew and explained.</br>
</br>
"The Project Garden of Eden? When I was the commander in the 71st Mechanical Division, I heard some people mention that a state research institute was responsible for this area of research. It was rumored that once the technology matured, the challenges in space colonization would be solved," Han Junhua put her finger on her chin and muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
"What if we provide the FEV virus to the mutated humans and let them fight amongst themselves?" Sun Jiao suggested.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible. If we did that, we wouldn't have a problem in the short term, but it will be extremely problematic in the long term," Jiang Chen said wryly.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the ugly mutated humans were better suited for this piece of land. The ability to devour the Death Claw's meat, more poisonous than rat poison, raw and munch on unprocessed mutated fruits would mean that once these things acquired the ability to reproduce, humans wouldn't have a place on this planet anymore.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Han Junhua raised her head and fixed her sight on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What if we change to a different perspective? We first find Fallout Shelter 005, then provide the project Garden of Eden to the Dusk Chuch which eliminates their motive to control Wanghai. The mutated humans that lost their external support along with their military production in the Seventy Area will lose inevitably."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 443: Destruction does not require Technology</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Release the Garden of Eden Technology to Dusk?</br>
</br>
From humanity's point of view, it was a choice with only pros.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, Jiang Chen was a selfish person. He didn't mind that while he lived a great life, he could make other people live a good life. But there was a condition. The "generosity" must be given by him.</br>
</br>
Perhaps one day he would agree to build the Garden of Eden, but it must be a NAC controlled Garden of Eden. As to releasing the project to other people, he would not consider the possibility at all.</br>
</br>
"If their ultimate plan is to leave earth by building a space colonization ship, then they don't have a conflict of interest with us." Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"That's unfortunate then, they won't be able to leave." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua sighed and then looked at the hologram map with her arms crossed.</br>
</br>
"Then war is the only option left. But from the ammo reserve left in Shenxiang, if we are unable to capture Jia in ten days, we will have to give up Seventh Area."</br>
</br>
Shenxiang was where the raw materials originated, and the majority of firearm productions were located in the Fishbone base and the Sixth Street. Although they obtained a large number of mutated humans' weapons and steel, they didn't manage to discover any firearm production lines.</br>
</br>
If they gave up on the Seventh Street and ordered the First Corp to retreat, that would mean that the crusade would be only half-completed. The mutated humans could recapture the Seventh Area and use the long, harsh winter to regain their strength.</br>
</br>
If NAC suffered heavy casualties in the mutants flood, then without a doubt the mutated humans would take advantage of this situation and declare war. If the mutants flood persisted till next year this timeâ€¦</br>
</br>
When the first mutants flood erupted, the entire Earth was in a nuclear winter, and it was significantly colder than the past years. Jiang Chen didn't think that the mutants would obediently go back underground during winter so he could not bet on the fact that the mutants flood would end by this year.</br>
</br>
"Is it because of our ammo reserve?" Jiang Chen's eyebrows twisted together.</br>
</br>
"It's mostly the mortar shells and the 5 kg and 10 kg bombs. we have ample in light weapon ammunition, but we can't conquer in exchange for lives." Han Junhua said without any emotional fluctuation.</br>
</br>
[So, we are missing heavy weapons.]</br>
</br>
Suddenly a smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"I have a solution, we just need more shells and bombs right?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked toward Jiang Chen,</br>
</br>
"Are we going to transport it from the Fishbone base with helicopters? Based on the reserve and production in the base, we don't have the capacity to support the First Division."</br>
</br>
The Fishbone unleashed 200 rounds of mortar shells, 300 rounds of 5 kg bombs per day, to sustain its consumption speed, ammunition production was already operating at full capacity.</br>
</br>
</br>
"No need to transport from the base, I can take care of it from elsewhere." Jiang Chen shook his head as an evil smirk appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked speechlessly at Jiang Chen. Somehow, the smirk reminded her of some unpleasant memories she never wants to recall again.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Due to the limitation of technology, the weapons from the 21st century were for inferior compared to the 22nd-century weapons. A simple example, who would win between the Wanderer tank from NAC's First Corp and UA's mechanical division?</br>
</br>
The question was more of how many units would be left in the mechanical division before the Wanderer tank ran out of fuel. How many units could the particle cannon and coaxial electromagnetic pulse cannon take out.</br>
</br>
Unless it was directly struck by a nuclear warhead, the modern day weapon could not pose any threat to the Wanderer's armor.</br>
</br>
But when the efficiency of killing the zombies are brought into the conversation, the UA mechanical division would be much more effective compared to the entire NAC First Division. Why? The reason was simple.</br>
</br>
Because when technology is not necessary, any technology would be excessive!</br>
</br>
For example, killing zombies. For example, launching an artillery rain of destruction.</br>
</br>
Accuracy was irrelevant. Other than the dangerous mutants with insane mobility and defense, how many mutants would survive in the explosion, let alone zombies.</br>
</br>
It was the same idea against the mutated humans. Their anti-tank cannon and rocket indeed posed a serious threat to the First Corp armor force. If an M2A1 tank were brought to the frontline, an anti-tank round would easily destroy it without any doubt.</br>
</br>
But what if there were thirty-something heavy artilleries or even rockets?</br>
</br>
Even if they possessed the rifles from the 22nd century, they were still made out of tissues!</br>
</br>
Walking out from the community center, Jiang Chen held Sun Jiao's hand and headed to the mansion. Bullets unleashed on the wall far away, soldiers in a heavy bulletproof suit with a fuel tank on the back ignited the nozzle they held.</br>
</br>
It was nothing technologically advanced, but if the mutant mosquitos dove down, they would become toasted mosquitos.</br>
</br>
"You are planning to transport weapons from that side?" Sun Jiao acutely captured Jiang Chen's thought.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen squeezed her hand and smiled proudly.</br>
</br>
"Is stuff from your side reliable?" Sun Jiao asked with skepticism.</br>
</br>
The skepticism was similar to a guerrilla hearing an ancient person had time traveled from the Ming Dynasty and said he would support the war with the weapons from his era.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen started to laugh and didn't explain. He promised, "You'll know once you actually see it."</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
After returning to the mansion, Jiang Chen immediately returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Due to the influence of UA weapons that appeared in the hands of Country F's anti-government militants, Robert was in a tight spot. It would be too inconsiderate to ask him for more weapons, especially given that he already retired.</br>
</br>
There was only one person Jiang Chen could ask.</br>
</br>
It was near dusk already, but still sometime before people got off work.</br>
</br>
He drove the Lamborghini out from the garage and headed straight to the newly opened Russian Embassy.</br>
</br>
Natasha was patrolling at the gate of the embassy feeling extremely bored. Although she was the head of security, there was only three security personnel in total, so she had to fill in the patrolling slot.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped the car in front of the embassy, rolled down the window, and teased her.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful miss, could I invite you to dinner?"</br>
</br>
Natasha looked at Jiang Chen in surprise as a grin appeared. "Of course."</br>
</br>
She walked to the other side of the car, yelled toward the embassy, "Karachev, come out and watch the door." Before she received a response, she sat in the car.</br>
</br>
After putting on the seatbelt, Natasha swayed her luscious hair and sunk into the comfortable seat.</br>
</br>
"I heard that a gentleman is supposed to open the door for a lady."</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to change out of your uniform?" Jiang Chen ignored her scoff and laughed.</br>
</br>
"No need," Natasha's lips curled up while crossing her legs, "Uniform roleplay is pretty fun isn't it?"</br>
</br>
[Face palm, what happened to her?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still remembered in Eastern Europe, when he tied her onto the chair, she suspected that he took her first time and stared at him with a look of death as if he had killed her father.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen coughed and started the car, "I won't be able to do business with you like this."</br>
</br>
"Business?" Natasha's eyes flashed as she put her leg down and sat up straight, "For example?"</br>
</br>
"My company needs some firearms used for self-defense. What do you want to eat?"</br>
</br>
"Barbeque and beer. I remember there is beach bar not far away from here and their Barbeque is great." Natasha smiled.</br>
</br>
She was familiar with the surrounding area already.</br>
</br>
"Okay, let's talk about the firearms then, I need-"</br>
</br>
"Don't you want to chat while eating?" Natasha interrupted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave an "as you wish" look before turning on the GPS.</br>
</br>
"Sit tight."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stepped on the gas.</br>
</br>
The vehicle transformed into a shadow and raced toward the beach.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 444: The Trade in the Distance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The apocalypse, the rural area east of Su City.</br>
</br>
The one hundred story skyscraper stood desolately among the ruins.</br>
</br>
Not far away, a sign engraved with , dangling on the side of the road, was replaced with the  written in red paint. It hung in the middle of the building. The original owner of the building had the "foresight" to use a large amount of expensive and durable material in the construction of the building. And the building did, in fact, manage to withstand the nuclear explosion five kilometers away twenty years ago.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, the radiation still burned him into dust. When the nuclear blast arrived, he was on the elevator, coming down from the top floor office, escaping to the basement. However, regrettably, he died on the 27th floor.</br>
</br>
The building exchanged hands multiple times before being occupied by the Dark Red Chamber of Commerce as their base. The hundred story height was a natural observation tower easily capable of scouting tens of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the building, Lin Chaoen sat on the edge with his feet hanging in the air without any fear of heights. His eyes narrowed as he looked to Wanghai's direction.</br>
</br>
He was unafraid of heights because it was an emotion that belonged only to creatures.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Wanghai's sky has changed."</br>
</br>
"Is this something predictable?" Two meters behind him, a man in a suit with a distant expression stood up straight with his hands behind his back. He was gazing in Wanghai's direction, but in the distance, only the skyline of Wanghai was barely visible. Other than a few faint columns of smoke rising, he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai, the current president of Dark Red.</br>
</br>
During the past winter, his father Cao Jinsong launched a coup in the Sixth Street and died after the failed attempt. After receiving the information, he decisively took the soldiers loyal to him and executed his cousin who planned to split Dark Red with him; it was his father's nephew, Cao Wei. Finally, he controlled all of the assets of Dark Red and prevented the massive empire from falling apart.</br>
</br>
It was after that he met Lin Chaoen and initiated a partnership with him.</br>
</br>
A few months ago, he listened to Lin Chaoen's advice and withdrew Dark Red's merchant fleet from doing business in Wanghai and sold the assets under an anonymous name. He was skeptical of what Lin Chaoen said in the beginning, but the robot's words became true.</br>
</br>
A mutants flood indeed erupted in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
"Of course, everything in this world has causations." Lin Chaoen sighed as he said leisurely, "For example, the economic crisis in 2150 meant the war would be inevitable. And that economic crisis was because ofâ€¦"</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai burst out laughing. "I'm not interested in listening to you talk about our history, I'm a businessman, I only care about now and-"</br>
</br>
</br>
"Shhhh!" Lin Chaoen suddenly interrupted him and put his finger in front of his lips.</br>
</br>
Then, he put his hand beside his ear and closed his eyes; it looked like he was listening to something.</br>
</br>
"Listen, they are talking again." Lin Chaoen leaned forward with a smile, "The poor bugs."</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai, standing on the side, twitched.</br>
</br>
He suddenly had the urge to kick the fool down.</br>
</br>
But thinking that there was no point in being angry at a robot, he restrained himself from this dangerous thought.</br>
</br>
"Pretending to be supernatural."</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai cursed out in a low voice and headed for the elevator.</br>
</br>
"Are you not curious about what I heard?" Lin Chaoen turned his head and said sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"I'm only curious what kind of mental state your designer had to bring you into this world." Cao Guangkai scoffed while taking a hidden shot at him.</br>
</br>
"Perhapsâ€¦ Mhmm, similar to father's mental state?" He didn't seem to understand the mockery in his words and shrugged. "Speaking of which, I have one thing I'm curious about. Can you answer it for me?"</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is there something you don't know?"</br>
</br>
"Don't you want to seek revenge on that person? He killed your father." Lin Chaoen smiled.</br>
</br>
He was referring to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Because of Fishbone's sudden intervention, the balance in favor of them smashed to the ground, and all the stakes were collected by that person. The mantis preying on the cicada while the bird waited to strike at the final moment.</br>
</br>
"There is no family in business. He failed his investment in Wanghai and lost all his stakes, that's all," Cao Guangkai said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"You have an open mind." Lin Chaoen laughed mischievously, turned his head, and continued to gaze into the sky in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Although the Dark Red originated from the Sixth Street, the base is in Su City with business in Hang City and the even further Luzhou. I never agreed with father's strategy of intervening with the local situation. Only when we abide by the identity of a merchant can we generate more profit."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Lin Chaoen said slowly.</br>
</br>
Just like Cao Guangkai was disinterested in what he said, he was not interested in the business he was talking about. In his eyes, the human's stance toward crystals was like monkeys playing with stones.</br>
</br>
They didn't understand what kind of powerful weapons he possessed.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Cao Guangkai nodded.</br>
</br>
Without responding, Lin Chaoen silently watched Wanghai in the distance. He seemed to want to say something interesting as a smile emerged from his lips.</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai stood silently behind him.</br>
</br>
Just then, his communication device started to buzz.</br>
</br>
He pressed the button on his collar and picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello? â€¦ Mhmm, I see."</br>
</br>
He quickly hung up the phone and looked at Lin Chaoen on the edge of the building.</br>
</br>
"The thing you need is ready."</br>
</br>
"Oh? That's great." The smile on Lin Chaoen's face grew bigger. He pressed his hands on the floor and propelled himself up.</br>
</br>
The move was nothing by itself, but to do it at the edge of a hundred story building...</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai thought he had a calm state of mind, but just by watching his action, he felt tense.</br>
</br>
"The recipe to the drug." Just as Lin Chaoen passed by him, he opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Oh, that." Lin Chaoen seemed to have remembered something as he took out a USB from his pocket with sluggishness. "Here you go, it's all inside."</br>
</br>
It was the recipe of Happy Times.</br>
</br>
It was the recipe of the hallucinating drug.</br>
</br>
Cao Guangkai held his breath while he took over the USB.</br>
</br>
He felt his fingers were trembling.</br>
</br>
He was not holding a USB, but a key to a crystal treasure.</br>
</br>
Only one tablet was enough to live in the happy times before the war.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen enjoyed the expression on his face for two seconds before he curled his lips into a smile that held deep meaning.</br>
</br>
The camera zoomed out.</br>
</br>
In the empty ground north of the Dark Red building stood a six-story-tall rocket.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Katyusha multiple rocket launcher, nicknamed "Hail", also known as "Stalin's Organ" in its early days was equipped by the Soviet as early as 1964 and had been in use ever since. Its presence was seen in Afghanistan war, Iran, and Iraq. Even in the modernized military today, this simple yet powerful weapon didn't leave history's spotlight.</br>
</br>
40 122mm caliber rocket launchers mounted on a small military truck, it possessed a relatively simple configuration compared to the different types of rocket.</br>
</br>
While the "small guy" didn't look fierce, its maximum firing capacity can reach an astounding 720 rockets with a total weight of 48 tons; it was more than the sum of all the UA Land Force conventional rockets being fired simultaneously!</br>
</br>
It was the nightmare shared by the enemy's infantries and the friendly logistics personnel.</br>
</br>
Its only weakness was accuracy.</br>
</br>
The two sat in the beach bar in a remote corner. They enjoyed the Brazilian Barbeque while they discussed the dangerous topic.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen brought up that he needed a type of weapon with strong "deterrence" and maximum coverage, the Russian girl with a couple of beers down immediately began to pitch him the "Stalin's Organ."</br>
</br>
"If you are only searching for simple yet destructive firepower, no other weapon can fit you better than the BM-21."</br>
</br>
With her face completely red, Jiang Chen mocked her, "Why do I think you are not using your talent effectively by being an agent? Why don't you become a salesperson for an arms company?"</br>
</br>
"Burp." She indecently let out a burp as she rolled her eyes and she authoritatively swung her blonde hair to her back. "Be a man, are you going to buy or not?"</br>
</br>
"Of course I will buy!"</br>
</br>
"How many?" Natasha's red lips changed to a pleased curvature.</br>
</br>
"Eight." Jiang Chen put down the skewer and said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Eight? Are you going to equip two companies?" Natasha with one hand holding onto her chin she tilted her head. "Should be okay, I remember the Eighty Division in the Ural Military Theatre is planning to equip new rockets. They are troubled by the fact that the junks have no buyer."</br>
</br>
[Face palm! Is it really good to describe your arms like this in front of the buyer?]</br>
</br>
[She is definitely drunk.]</br>
</br>
"What's the price?" Jiang Chen finished a skewer and asked.</br>
</br>
"I'm not sure, but by crude estimation, it shouldn't be too expensive, the most expensive part is the ammunition. Mhmmâ€¦ How many rockets do you need?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put up four fingers.</br>
</br>
"Four thousand?" Natasha yawned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen mysteriously smiled and chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Forty thousand!"</br>
</br>
The beer cup dropped onto the table, and the beer splashed all over the counter.</br>
</br>
But Natasha completely ignored her soaked shirt. Pressing on to the table, she stood up. She fixed her eyes on Jiang Chen with her half-sober pupils and spoke in a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Forâ€¦ Forty thousand?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, can you sell it?" Jiang Chen aggressively raised his chin and smirked.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure? It is not the mortar shell that costs a thousand Rubles." Natasha lost her voice.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure it is a good idea to be this loud in here?" Jiang Chen coughed and reminded her in a small voice.</br>
</br>
Natasha's face turned red, and she quickly glanced her surroundings.</br>
</br>
The people in the bar all peeked in their direction. A lot of people in conversation stopped talking and held their cup just in the air. There were plenty of big news on Coro Island recently. Everyone's gossip desire was at its peak. Her words today would become something like "there was an arms merchant that sold rockets to a gang at the beach bar last night" by tomorrow.</br>
</br>
It was better to keep the conversation about weapons low key.</br>
</br>
Natasha realizing her indecency pretended to be intoxicated and put her finger underJiang Chen's chin.</br>
</br>
"Then what are you waiting for, let me see if you're a mortar shell or a large rocket."</br>
</br>
She enunciated the word "large" with extra emphasis.</br>
</br>
All the male creatures at the bar raised their head out of natural instinct when they heard the dirty words come out of a hot beauty like her.</br>
</br>
Natasha covered her chest and walked out of the bar before disappearing from the eyes of the thirsty males.</br>
</br>
"Those legs." Leaning against the bar counter, a drunk holding onto a beer said while feeling heated.</br>
</br>
The other drunk beside him glanced at him contemptuously, "That's an amateur observation. After checking out girls for so many years, that curve is top notch. Burp-"</br>
</br>
His words turned into an undistinguishable burp.</br>
</br>
The drunk was embarrassed by his friend's comment as he argued back, "Stop just saying it! Don't you always brag about your toothpick? Why don't you go then?!"</br>
</br>
The old friend forced a laugh and immediately lost his confidence, "I can't afford it."</br>
</br>
Then, he pointed at the Lamborghini outside the window.</br>
</br>
It had nothing to do with "mortar shell" or "rocket," the key was the green Franklin.</br>
</br>
Regardless, the conversations in the bar were successfully changed by Natasha. The shell and rocket were referring to that! The thirsty males all looked at Jiang Chen with eyes filled with jealousy, jealousy, and jealousy.</br>
</br>
"Uniform roleplay?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the unfriendly sights and recollected what she said when she first got on the car. He then shook his head.</br>
</br>
The breast that was more massive than Liu Yao's; the perfect curvature of her butt; it made him feel an uncontrollable desire too.</br>
</br>
But those men were jealous for nothing, even Jiang Chen "didn't dare to do it".</br>
</br>
Having an engaged conversation with KGB was no different than diving into the web of a female spider. There would need to be some serious mental preparation required if they have an extra friendly relationship.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slapped a one hundred USD bill on the table and rushed straight out.</br>
</br>
He nobly opened the door for Natasha before getting into the car himself.</br>
</br>
"Is it okay to drink and drive?"</br>
</br>
Natasha's bright red lips filled the car with the smell of alcohol.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you realize you were the only person drinking?" Jiang Chen mocked and started the car, "Where do you live?"</br>
</br>
Natasha grinned at Jiang Chen without saying a word.</br>
</br>
Her eyes seemed to be saying "Isn't the most gentlemen thing to do now is invite me to your home to take a shower?"</br>
</br>
"Okay, I will send you to the embassy."</br>
</br>
"No!" Natasha immediately stopped him and gave Jiang Chen an angry stare.</br>
</br>
If she appeared in the embassy like this, how would she maintain her authority in front of her subordinates?</br>
</br>
"Your apartment?" Jiang Chen said concisely.</br>
</br>
She bit her lips and gave the GPS a hard poke as if she was throwing a tantrum.</br>
</br>
"Put your seatbelt on." Jiang Chen smiled at her clearly displeased look, opened the window, and stepped the gas.</br>
</br>
The sea wind blew away the intoxicating smell in the car.</br>
</br>
"You are scared?"</br>
</br>
"What am I scared about." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
It was true; he was never scared of anything.</br>
</br>
The wet shirt made the wind feel especially chilly. She drunkenly closed the window.</br>
</br>
"The KGB identity, or crossing the line with an agent?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't say anything and turned on the radio.</br>
</br>
Natasha rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen and pouted without making any more sound. Jiang Chen peeked at her through the mirror but only saw her drunken state. He didn't know what she was thinking through the half-closed eyes.</br>
</br>
They quickly arrived at her place.</br>
</br>
In a heavy breath, Natasha dragged off the seatbelt that made her chest loss its beautiful shape.</br>
</br>
"Time to get a new car, the glass is bulletproof, but the engine cover and fuel tank are only covered by aluminum alloy."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and then laughed.</br>
</br>
"You mean, someone wants to kill me?"</br>
</br>
"Do you really have to wait for someone to want to kill you before you are cautious of your own safety? Can't you just be a little more fearful of death?" Natasha rolled her eyes at him, then swayed her blonde hair while stepping out of the car.</br>
</br>
It made sense.</br>
</br>
[Once the mutants flood is over, I'll get a few experts in the Sixth Street to create a sick ride?]</br>
</br>
Natasha was already at the door to the house. Jiang Chen suddenly remembered that there were still important matters to be discussed as he shouted out.</br>
</br>
"I have a headache right now. Just send it to my phone. I'll contact them once I sleep for a few hours." She waved her hand out of annoyance and walked to her door holding her head.</br>
</br>
[Is she okay?]</br>
</br>
With her tumbling to her door, Jiang Chen was a bit concerned.</br>
</br>
Finally, when she made it through the door, Jiang Chen let out a sigh and drove home.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 446: Adapt Ancient Forms to serve the Present</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Around nine o'clock, Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The lighting shells had laminated the entire base to as bright as daylight, but the apartments in the base were pitch black.</br>
</br>
The appearances of mutants like mutant mosquitos and mutant flies meant that the base wall could not protect the safety of the survivors. Only combat personnel remained on the surface while the rest of the survivors all evacuated into the emergency facility in the underground tunnel.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mansion also looked dark from the outside, but the glimmer of light shining out from the edges of the curtain signified the people inside haven't left.</br>
</br>
There was no need.</br>
</br>
The mansion was the most secure place in the entire base. With Sun Jiao and Sun Xiaorou inside, there was no need to worry about mutants posing a threat.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn't need to be mentioned as no one in the base had combat abilities that could match her's. Her sister, Sun Xiaorou, was not weak either. While she usually looked timid, she was very agile. Before she recovered her memory, she sneaked into the base and fought head-to-head with her "brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed open the mansion door and discovered that Han Junhua was in the living room.</br>
</br>
"It is better for me to remain on the surface to better command the force. Don't worry about my safety. Weapon training is a necessary course for PAC military commanders."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, sitting across from Han Junhua, eagerly asked when she saw Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Did you solve it?"</br>
</br>
"I did, I only need to head to the west line after." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao wanted to say something, but she didn't say anything in the end. She knew why Jiang Chen had to make a personal trip; she was just concerned with his safety.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua frowned and stated what Sun Jiao wanted to say.</br>
</br>
"Allow me to be honest, I don't think your presence on the west line would bring much change to the situation, but rather it would increase the variables of the battle. Cheng Weiguo is more than enough to control the force."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I'm not there to lead the frontline. I'm thereâ€¦ to request help."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought about it for a long time before he managed to found the correct word.</br>
</br>
"Requesting for help?" Han Junhua frown only grew deeper.</br>
</br>
She didn't know Jiang Chen's ability, and before he was sure of her reaction, Jiang Chen didn't plan on telling her.</br>
</br>
Even if a "special" chip was in the back of her head.</br>
</br>
"That's right. I solved the lack of heavy ammunition on the west line. The only problem is that I must be there personally."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's ambiguous response didn't satisfy Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
But seeing Jiang Chen's eyes shine with sincerity, she stared into his eyes for half a minute in silence.</br>
</br>
</br>
"If you insist."</br>
</br>
Then she stood up and headed for the door.</br>
</br>
"Are we going to leave now? I still want to sleep," seeing that she was putting on her shoes, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course not now, but all the military movements must be planned." She loaded the laser pistol used for self-defense, "You'll leave tomorrow at eight with the helicopter. It is best you notify the people at the frontline now in case it interrupts their plan. I'll be back after going to the community center. You don't have to follow me."</br>
</br>
NAC only had two helicopters now, and both were deployed to Hunter Corps.</br>
</br>
The limited resources meant that even the general must make reservations before making a trip.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
The arms sale quickly received a response.</br>
</br>
The BM-21 was extremely cheap. The truck along with the rocket launchers only cost 200 thousand USD. Eight of them resulted in 1.6 million.</br>
</br>
The real expensive item was the rockets!</br>
</br>
The launchers were old, but the rockets just rolled off the production line. Since ammunition stored for too long may malfunction, it would ruin the brand. To the arms buyer with potential for a deeper relationship, the Russians were naturally unwilling to supply low-quality stuff. It would be the same as saying no to cash.</br>
</br>
The 122mm explosive rocket with twenty kilometers in range cost 2000 USD per round. Jiang Chen threw out 40 million USD and purchased 20 thousand rounds right away.</br>
</br>
The rocket with the same range was slightly more expensive with one round costing 2500 USD. Jiang Chen also purchased 20 thousand round of those without blinking an eye.</br>
</br>
The rockets were extremely effective against the zombies.</br>
</br>
[The mutants flood? I will burn half of the city!]</br>
</br>
Although Natasha felt troubled by Jiang Chen's request to purchase a sensitive weapon like napalm rockets, she still reported Jiang Chen's demand to her superior.</br>
</br>
After five minutes of silence on the other side of the phone, they agreed.</br>
</br>
It was a lucrative sale totaling close to 100 million USD, and the buyer purchased the easy to produce, non-guided rockets without the need to worry about a technology leak. To Russia that lacked in foreign currency, the arms business was like picking up money from the ground.</br>
</br>
Although selling petrol bombs were in the grey area of international law, to the five permanent members of the security council, who really cared? The Syrian anti-government force had plenty of UA weapons with some of the "restricted" items being sold by private military merchants.</br>
</br>
Since they agreed already, Russia didn't disappoint Jiang Chen. Meeting this request, they transported the batch of firearms by air.</br>
</br>
The next night, an AN-225 transport plane landed at New Moon Island's runway. The first batch of firearms that arrived was made up of the 8 BM-21 and 2000 rounds of rockets. The remaining 32000 rounds arrived in the following shipments.</br>
</br>
Barkary and Ivan all expressed their helpless stance to Jiang Chen purchasing so many rockets. But Jiang Chen didn't plan to explain to them as he ordered them to store the equipment in containers and haul them onto the sea platform along the dam into the vessel used to transport supplies for New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
When the vessel headed into the ocean, Jiang Chen ordered the captain to drop the anchor.</br>
</br>
The old captain was certainly smart. With his experience, he knew that Jiang Chen was planning to use a small boat to smuggle something prohibited through custom. Although he didn't know why Celestial Trade needed to be so discreet, he didn't ask more as he gathered all the crews inside the cabin for a meeting.</br>
</br>
Since they didn't want you to know, it was better to close your eyes yourself.</br>
</br>
Quickly, in just half an hour, Jiang Chen knocked on the conference room door to signal the captain that they could continue their journey.</br>
</br>
Once the frustrated looking crew left, Jiang Chen dragged the captain to the side and passed him a cigarette.</br>
</br>
The captain was astounded by the gesture as he smiled with his white teeth fully exposed.</br>
</br>
"I understand. I don't know anything."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded pleasingly, took out an envelope, and stuffed it into his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Other than controlling the boat, don't ask about anything else."</br>
</br>
Feeling the hefty weight in his pocket, the old captain revealed a bigger smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder before he left.</br>
</br>
With this, the people responsible for loading the vessel only knew that the arms went on the vessel, but were unaware of its destination. The crews responsible for transportation only knew that the containers went on board, but they didn't know what was inside.</br>
</br>
After docking in the harbor, customs followed their procedure and inspected the containers, but discovered they were all empty. When they saw Celestial Trade's logo, they didn't persist further on the issue.</br>
</br>
The reason why he was so careful was to prevent people with other intentions from keeping an eye on the batch of firearms.</br>
</br>
Country F was in a completely chaotic state as the MNLF equipped with a large amount of UA weapons left the government force in complete shamble with its intensive full-scale attack. The MLF that previously gave up on the movement to independence immediately sought an alliance with its old partner in crime after the situation took a drastic turn.</br>
</br>
With the current state, it was hard to ensure no other eyes were watching Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Since there were only two countries that had a negative relationship with Country F, Hua and Xin, if it were not caused by a religious force, the most suspicious perpetrator would be Hua. Following it would be Xin, the one behind the deterioration of F's current political stability.</br>
</br>
There must be other agents on the island, but Jiang Chen was confident that they would not know where the firearms went no matter how much they investigated.</br>
</br>
Even the Russians that sold the firearms themselves wouldn't know.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 447: Fire!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Black smoke saturated the air.</br>
</br>
It was hard to determine if it was the cloud, radiation dust, or smoke from the rockets.</br>
</br>
In a remote area east of Jia City, houses were scattered all around.</br>
</br>
Under the shadow of the smoke, a few mutant cockroaches swayed their one-meter long antennae while they searched for rotten food.</br>
</br>
To the ten-something people who walked by them, they didn't show any interest; only sour aromas could draw their interest. The starving cockroaches occasionally attacked the zombies, but they would often be scratched to death.</br>
</br>
If a zombie and a mutant cockroach moved together, without a doubt, it must be because of a mutant flood, because only in a mutant flood would the mutants forget their hunger and attack the survivors along with the zombies.</br>
</br>
Were there any other cities where a mutant flood was happening? No one knew. People mainly stuck to the places they knew best. Even merchant fleets that traveled far distances only managed to reach the Northern Alliance Area.</br>
</br>
The current mutant flood was limited to Wanghai CIty, so Jiang Chen, currently in the rural area of Jia City, thought the air there was extra fresh.</br>
</br>
"The battle is currently at a stalemate; we advanced 500 meters to the Jia Sports Center yesterday, but we were quickly fended off by their attack. The mutated humans obtained a large number of electromagnetic interference grenades and EMP grenades out of nowhere."</br>
</br>
"The snipers in the Hunter Corps provided great help, but following the battle pushing toward the city, there were more obstructions. The mutated humans' mortars and grenades also led to a high number of casualties to the Hunter Corps."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo looked as the cockroach on the road dashed into the shadows before he lowered the rifle.</br>
</br>
"That's terrible."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he led Cheng Weiguo and a group of soldiers in the direction opposite Jia City in a delighted mood.</br>
</br>
The general didn't feel frustrated by the stalemate of the battle which made Cheng Weiguo somewhat at ease.</br>
</br>
But with the frontline getting further and further away from them, he had a troubled look.</br>
</br>
"General, can I ask where we're going?"</br>
</br>
They walked ten kilometers already and they would almost be in the next town at this rate, but they still weren't at the place Jiang Chen mentioned.</br>
</br>
"We're here."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and smiled at the abandoned factory in front of him.</br>
</br>
Two days ago when the helicopter took him here, he randomly chose a spacious warehouse as a storage space for his arms. Because of the mutated humans, there were no survivors in the area. Thus there was no need to worry about their arms being stolen by scavengers; he only needed to place them further away from the frontlines to avoid being hit by stray shells.</br>
</br>
After he chose the location, he returned to the modern world to patiently wait for the Russians to deliver the arms.</br>
</br>
</br>
The perplexed Cheng Weiguo followed Jiang Chen into the warehouse.</br>
</br>
But when he saw the contents, his bewildered expression visibly transformed into shock. His widened eyes looked as if they were about to pop out.</br>
</br>
"This is-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to laugh as he savored Cheng Weiguo's shocked expression. He then returned to the door and shouted at the soldiers behind them.</br>
</br>
"Soldiers, prepare to get on the truck. We'll take the mutated humans to see Jesus!"</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Since fossil fuels had almost completely been replaced before the war, only the wealthy could afford to have a few internal combustion engine vehicles in their homes. Hence, cars that burned fuel were almost considered artifacts.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen ordered the soldiers onto the car, he was dumbfounded to realize that the soldiers didn't know how to drive. With no other choice, he had to step up and personally demonstrate how to maneuver the vehicles.</br>
</br>
With the general as the instructor, the soldiers focused all their attention on learning. While the principles behind internal combustion vehicles were drastically different from the electric vehicles common in the apocalypse, the driving style was similar. They spent an hour familiarizing themselves with the clutch before the soldiers finally figured out how to drive.</br>
</br>
As to the conversion between the firing distance and angle, it was written on a sheet. The soldier responsible for firing would only need to punch it into the calculator.</br>
</br>
The eight BM-21s rolled out of the warehouse one by one and dispersed under Jiang Chen's command. The stents on the side of the truck were released to stabilize the truck to finish the deployment. One hundred survivors from the Seventh Area transported rockets that filled the entire warehouse. Two people worked together to lift a 67 kilogram, 3-meter-long rocket and push it onto the launcher.</br>
</br>
Before loading the rockets, Jiang Chen instructed them to only load the white rockets - the red rockets were solid fuel rockets used against the zombies and mutants.</br>
</br>
The rockets were loaded in an orderly fashion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took Cheng Weiguo to the roof of a building two hundred meters out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked into the binoculars with eyes narrowed at Jia City 13 kilometers away. He grinned.</br>
</br>
"Take a few more looks; it'll be a different place in a moment."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo didn't pick up his binoculars. Instead, he looked at the hive-shaped rockets lined up with concern.</br>
</br>
"Do we really not need to move out the soldiers in the city?"</br>
</br>
Regarding the weapon that existed two centuries ago, he was afraid the rockets would drop on his men's heads.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, a one-kilometer distance is enough."</br>
</br>
Although Russian weapons weren't particularly precise, they wouldn't be off by more than one kilometer. Jiang Chen glared at Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
[You don't understand the intelligence of the "ancient."]</br>
</br>
"Generalâ€¦ Where did you get those artifacts?" Cheng Weiguo picked up the tablet used to control the rockets, asking the question troubling him.</br>
</br>
"The vehicles are from a military museum. The rockets are manufactured following blueprints." Jiang Chen didn't mind his blatant question as he answered nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't plan on elaborating further, Cheng Weiguo knew better than to probe. He was indeed loyal, but he had curiosity too.</br>
</br>
The helicopter arrived above Jia City and hovered just out of the mutated humans' air defense range.</br>
</br>
With the help of the radiation dust and cloud, it managed to disguise its presence and provided the aerial map for the battlefield. The wide range life signal detector opened and marked the locations of mutated humans on the control tablet.</br>
</br>
With the red dots reaching only ten thousand, the mutated humans probably had shielding devices to block their locations, but they must have a limited range and were only capable of disguising important targets.</br>
</br>
Based on human observation, they marked the unidentified areas. Cheng Weiguo nodded to Jiang Chen and handed over the tablet.</br>
</br>
The general would order the annihilation of the mutated humans!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the launcher vehicles locked and loaded two hundred meters out. He then took the tablet.</br>
</br>
The distance and target were clearly identified on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Listen to my order! Angle 220, distance 14.1 kilometers. Prepare to fire!"</br>
</br>
The hive-shaped rocket launchers gradually tilted up and all stopped at the same angle. When the blue flags rose up, one by one, signaling was ready. He took a deep breath and passed the tablet back to Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
He pressed his earpiece. Jiang Chen looked in Jia City's direction and shouted ferociously.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 448: 166 BMWs Flying in the Air</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen swore it was the most magnificent fireworks he'd ever seen.</br>
</br>
If the ones he saw in virtual reality didn't count.</br>
</br>
Rolling smoke instantly engulfed the vehicles.</br>
</br>
Missiles screeched out of the launchers one by one, firing into the distance like arrows. Within 20 short seconds, 320 rockets were launched. Jiang Chen gazed at the smoke trails fading into the distance and he exclaimed:</br>
</br>
"Too bad I couldn't see the explosion."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo handed the tablet back to Jiang Chen. He already executed the orders.</br>
</br>
"Oh, also, and this thing." Jiang Chen smiled, took over the tablet again, and looked at the screen.</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Beside the broken bridge.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans taking cover held onto their machine guns; they were on full alert against any possible NAC attacks. NAC attempted to build a floating bridge three times yesterday, but they were thwarted by grenades, machine guns, and recoilless cannons.</br>
</br>
The mortars and electromagnetic cannons caused trouble for the mutated humans, but in the end, those weapons were nothing. The mutated humans didn't suspect a thing; as long as they held their ground, the foolish humans would be the first ones to fall!</br>
</br>
"They can't last any longer! We have ammo. We're stronger! Once winter is here, it'll spell their deaths!"</br>
</br>
Standing in the back of their area of control, a mutated human captain wore a cape made out of the fur of a Death Claw. He waved the machine gun in his hand, shouting at his hiding comrades and boosting their morale.</br>
</br>
In the mutated human society, the clothing one wore represented power and status. Only a warrior who single-handedly defeated a Death Claw could wear its fur as a trophy.</br>
</br>
"What is that!?"</br>
</br>
Just then, a mutated human kneeling behind an anti-tank cannon roared out, pointing at the black dots in the sky.</br>
</br>
"Those are probably their small toys. Don't worry - we have anti-air machine guns and EMP."</br>
</br>
The captain mumbled as he pulled up the binoculars dangling in front of his chest.</br>
</br>
The toys he referred to were NAC's Hummingbird drones. Whenever an EMP grenade was launched, the drones fell to the ground like flies struck by electricity, hence no one was afraid of those small things anymore. Whenever they encountered drones, they would just detonate an EMP grenade. Although the EMP would render the red sight scope on their weapons useless, no one cared.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans didn't need to aim; the mutated humans only needed to unleash their firepower!</br>
</br>
His ugly`eyebrows were knotted together. The captain readjusted the zoom and set his eyes on the black dots in the distance.</br>
</br>
Clank.</br>
</br>
He dropped the binoculars onto the ground. Just as the mutated humans looked at him perplexedly, his ugly face began to twist.</br>
</br>
"Take cover!"</br>
</br>
</br>
He roared. Facing the mutated humans' puzzled looks, he dove into the pit nearby.</br>
</br>
But it was futileâ€¦</br>
</br>
Boom boom boom!</br>
</br>
The pouring rockets unleashed a deathly storm. The mutated humans taking cover and those inside the defense structure witnessed a scene only comparable to a living hell in horror. They looked at the dismembered limbs of their comrades and themselves.</br>
</br>
The explosion covered every inch of the soil as it bulldozed the mutated humans' zone of control. It left shattered weapons and burnt limbs all over the ground. The rockets exploded the ammo stored in the trenches and triggered a second round of explosions. The trenches soon turned red and gruesome.</br>
</br>
The first round of destruction was over!</br>
</br>
But the nightmare for the mutated humans had only started.</br>
</br>
With turbine engines igniting, the men in power armor crossed the river first. The engineering soldiers soon followed and placed a floating bridge that allowed the tank to pass. Immediately behind them were soldiers in kinetic skeletons and the destructive tanks.</br>
</br>
With steel armor hanging in front of their chests, a thousand mutated humans with machine guns stood up from the zone of control further away. They furiously raced to the river and fired while pushing forward in an attempt to regain control of the riverbank. Some mutated humans even lifted the mortars and shot like an RPG, and some raced forward with nuclear grenades strapped onto their bodies.</br>
</br>
The lead mutated humans with power warhammers were also there. Unless they were faced with the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon, their armor was invincible. They ignored the bullets and bombs and ran to NAC's zone of control in a thunderous roar.</br>
</br>
But they discovered in horror that before they could make it halfway, more rockets emerged in the distanceâ€¦</br>
</br>
The outline of the thick smoke in the distance decorated the barren island in shambles. It was like a fine pen drawing out the jagged curvatures.</br>
</br>
The rockets rose, came down, and brought destructive rain to the mutated humans in the distance.</br>
</br>
The shrapnel couldn't penetrate the armor of the mutated humans, but the force could explode their organs and brains. Despite the incredible power the mutated humans possessed, they couldn't escape the fact that they were creatures after all.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans were more cautious with NAC's rockets. They huddled together under cover while spreading out. They attempted to minimize the damage the NAC could cause. Two thoughts motivated them to remain strong.</br>
</br>
[We don't have a lot of rockets left!]</br>
</br>
[The attack is their last attempt to win!]</br>
</br>
But reality proved that it was only wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had plenty of rockets to the point where it was unimaginable.</br>
</br>
With the mutated humans scattering, Jiang Chen changed the music playing to "Stalin's Organ." He maintained the 40-rockets-per-minute launch speed as the BM-21 fired in rotations to cover the mutated humans' zone of control. At the same time, the First Corps stopped advancing forward under Jiang Chen's order while they enjoyed the symphony.</br>
</br>
Fires and explosions flashed nonstop on the tablet. The continuous strikes caused a lot of buildings due for repair to collapse and buried the mutated humans hiding inside. The landmark buildings such as Jia Sports Center remained standing, but it looked like it was on the brink of falling at any moment.</br>
</br>
The continuous bombing lasted for an hour as the entire city center of Jia looked like it was bulldozed over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt tired by the shaking screens. He shoved the tablet back into Cheng Weiguo's hand.</br>
</br>
Staring at the flames in the video, Cheng Weiguo was astonished.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't expect such an ancient weapon could demonstrate such a destructive force.</br>
</br>
"This is too astonishing." Ten minutes later, Cheng Weiguo put down the tablet.</br>
</br>
"How many did we launch already?"</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo scanned the empty boxes on the side and provided a rough estimate: "Around five thousand rounds."</br>
</br>
[Only five thousand rounds? Still fifteen thousand left.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the smoke rising fourteen kilometers away with his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
[Wait, five thousand rounds?]</br>
</br>
He then did the math - one rocket cost 2000 USD, and 30 rockets were 60 thousand USD, equivalent to a BMW.</br>
</br>
Five thousand launched out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt his heart ache.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't lack money but with 166 BMWs flying in the air, he was still pained by the sight!</br>
</br>
â€¦</br>
</br>
Inside Jia Sports Center.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu sat on a chair in a gloomy mood. The explosions in his ears made him especially flustered.</br>
</br>
Troy, the leader of the mutated humans, sat across him with the same gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
"What do we do?"</br>
</br>
The Dusk Church helped them blow up the bridges, provided them with a large number of firearms, and brought the information "there's a mutant flood in Wanghai City; these people won't last long."</br>
</br>
But the last one was clearly false.</br>
</br>
He didn't know if the mutant flood actually erupted in Wanghai or not, but the humans here clearly were committed to fighting the battle.</br>
</br>
"I said earlier that we should retreat to the west as these people aren't easy to deal with. The merchants in Hang City are easier to bully." Bo Yu closed his eyes and spoke lightly.</br>
</br>
"The mutated humans won't retreat; we won't compromise to inferior humans. We will rip them apart, stuff them into a meat grinder, and make them into sausages," Troy said deviously.</br>
</br>
[Is that so? The person sitting in front of you who helped you live for so long is a human? Do you really think by the simple fact that you have a head, it would equate to intelligence?]</br>
</br>
Bo Yu scoffed in his mind but didn't say anything out loud.</br>
</br>
He knew it was not the time for an internal feud. Especially since hours ago, he predicted that the mutated humans were in favor to win, or he wouldn't be sitting there.</br>
</br>
The NAC soldiers were on high alert, and the rockets were constantly striking the city. Retreating was no longer an option. If would be death if they retreated now; even without the rockets, two legs couldn't outrun the tanks. Abandoning their cover would mean that Dusk and the mutated humans were waiting to be slaughtered.</br>
</br>
[No other plans?]</br>
</br>
It wasn't the first time he'd experienced this.</br>
</br>
When he was surrounded by the military government in the Northern Alliance Area, he was in a similar situation.</br>
</br>
The only difference was this time, his back wasn't completely against the wall.</br>
</br>
Bo Yu looked at the ring on his finger.</br>
</br>
The blood crystal reflected a charming but dangerous eeriness under the light.</br>
</br>
"When will you send your people out?"</br>
</br>
His people were dying, but his ally had no response at all.</br>
</br>
Looking at the face reflected by the blood crystal, Bo Yu said gently.</br>
</br>
"Don't panic, very soon."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The mutated humans had a fatal weakness - they couldn't stuff their giant bodies into vehicles. Even if they always arrogantly referred to themselves as moving armor, they were just trying to make the best out of a bad situation.</br>
</br>
If it wasn't for the Dusk Church modifying trucks for them, they wouldn't even be able to operate vehicles.</br>
</br>
In the early days of warfare with Fishbone base, they learned how to install cannons onto their trucks. But faced with the Tiger II, their crude "high mobility anti-tank cannons" were a joke.</br>
</br>
The most common anti-tank cannon used on the wasteland was Type-99, produced by deconstructing the primary cannon used on the Type-99 light tank. The Type-99 shells couldn't penetrate the thick front armor of the Tiger II, however. At most, it could break the belt and destroy the observer hole, but one round of Tiger II's 5 kg bombs could break the cannon along with the truck into pieces.</br>
</br>
So the mutated humans learned the hard way to avoid sending out an armored force. Instead, they chose to take down the cannon and fire at them behind cover.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the First Corps didn't encounter any "armored force" resistance.</br>
</br>
The eight hours of battle ended as 20,000 rounds of rockets were unleashed onto 20,000 mutated humans. Scorching flames continued to burn inside the war zone and melted all the steel in the area, although Jia City hadn't directly been struck by a nuclear weapon. Paint and organic construction materials were all unconsumed, but they burned in the flames and emitted toxic fumes into the city.</br>
</br>
High temperatures and toxic gas. The city was in shambles.</br>
</br>
A lot of mutated humans didn't die from being buried alive or explosions but from the fires and asphyxiation that ensued.</br>
</br>
The soldiers who saw the General personally visiting the battlefield erupted into cheers.</br>
</br>
[How is authority built?]</br>
</br>
While everyone was wondering whether the fort was indestructible or not, you stood in front of all of us. Because of your presence, the indestructible fort collapsed.</br>
</br>
You are the hero.</br>
</br>
All the glory belongs to you.</br>
</br>
There's no need for words.</br>
</br>
It's not logic that brings worship but emotion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen faced the cheering soldiers as he signaled to them that the war wasn't over yet. He wanted them to stand firm on their positions and wait for the order to change.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a tour at the frontlines and met all the soldiers there. He and Cheng Weiguo stood in the middle of their area of control while they enjoyed watching the massive fire.</br>
</br>
This wasn't a war.</br>
</br>
With absolute firepower, it was more appropriate to describe this as a slaughter.</br>
</br>
"How long do you think the fire will burn for?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"If it doesn't rain, it'll burn until tomorrow," Cheng Weiguo said while looking up at the gloomy clouds in the air.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then get the soldiers to rest. They won't be fighting for a while." Jiang Chen made the order then headed to the command vehicle.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Cheng Weiguo saluted and began to make the order on the tablet.</br>
</br>
The flames were beginning to lose control, but the situation soon changed at midnight.</br>
</br>
Maybe the wailing of mutated humans received mercy from the heavens since a few raindrops began to fall down. With this change, Cheng Weiguo immediately woke the well-rested soldiers and prepared to launch the order to attack.</br>
</br>
Gradually, the rain began to pour down.</br>
</br>
The grain-size droplets descended from the sky, smothered the flames, hit the muddy groundâ€¦</br>
</br>
Rose from the burning steel and rolled down from the power armor's surface.</br>
</br>
"Charge!"</br>
</br>
A thunderous shout came from the radio channel as the First Corps battle line began to move forward.</br>
</br>
The electrostatic sound of the mortars began to screech in the air as ten lighting bombs rose into the air and lit up the sky near the Sports Center with their orange flames.</br>
</br>
The armored force crossed the river and the power armor's steel boots extinguished the faint footprints as they marched forward.</br>
</br>
The rain washed away the chaos on the ground and cooled off the burning corpses. The soldiers who walked by had to hold their breath - the pungent smell of burnt meat lingered even in the heavy rain.</br>
</br>
It wasn't only mutated humans who died under the rockets - thousands of Jia survivors also died as a result. But in the merciless apocalypse, even the previous Defender soldiers rescued from the Seventh Area didn't drop a single tear for the deceased.</br>
</br>
Death was the norm.</br>
</br>
3,000 soldiers surrounded the Sports Center that stood tall while they prepared to eliminate their last remaining enemies.</br>
</br>
1,000 engineering soldiers were handed rifles to rescue any human captives remaining among the shambles and kill off any undead mutated humans.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the mutated humans were tenacious.</br>
</br>
Even in this living hell, there were still a few who survived.</br>
</br>
On top of the Tiger II, wearing kinetic armor, Jiang Chen heard an angry roar in the distance.</br>
</br>
In the pouring rain, a mutated human with pitch-black skin shook off the debris on top of him, swung the power warhammer in his hand, and hit an engineering soldier into the sky like a golf ball.</br>
</br>
A lead mutated human!</br>
</br>
The three soldiers all raised their rifles in horror as they began to fire, but the deflected bullets clearly showed that all was futile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the figure in silence as the lead mutated human reminded him of an unpleasant memory from the past.</br>
</br>
He patted the cannon below him and the Tiger II immediately understood.</br>
</br>
The vehicle stopped and the cannon began to rotate.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen met eyes with the mutated human two hundred meters away, the cannon he was sitting on shook violently.</br>
</br>
An eerie blue arc ignited as the electromagnetic pulse bomb fired.</br>
</br>
The 5 kg bomb blasted through the raindrops and drew a white trail in the midst of the rain. When the white trail faded, the lead mutated human had already been turned into pieces of meat.</br>
</br>
The three soldiers sat up and waved at Jiang Chen to thank him for saving them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved back and signaled the Tiger II to continue.</br>
</br>
In the rain, the First Corps soldiers surrounded the Sports Center and engaged in battle on the street 300 meters away. When the Tiger II arrived near the frontlines, he jumped down from the tank.</br>
</br>
The power armors 20 meters in front of him were firing with their machine guns.</br>
</br>
The battle was at a point where it was one-sided. To be honest, Jiang Chen wanted to put on power armor himself to try the thrilling experience of combat. But when he saw a few enemy rockets smashing a power armor nearby, he quickly gave up on the idea.</br>
</br>
Since this wasn't the modern world, power armor wasn't invincible.</br>
</br>
A few soldiers ran out and dragged the power armor and the injured soldier out amongst enemy fire.</br>
</br>
When he walked to the command vehicle, Jiang Chen took off his helmet to dump out some water and spoke to Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation at the frontlines?"</br>
</br>
"We're just closing out. This feels fu*king great."</br>
</br>
He'd never fought a more exhilarating battle than this.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
[This is all my cash - forty million USD to buy the lives of 20,000 mutated humans. If this isn't exhilarating, I don't know what to say.]</br>
</br>
"Once you capture Jia City, leave 1,000 people to defend it - Hang's Merchant Alliance may send people to scout. But with this scene, I don't think they'll have any other ideas. Rest for the night and help Wanghai City tomorrow-"</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
The explosion in the distance suddenly interrupted Jiang Chen mid-sentence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped then immediately ran out while putting on his helmet.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 450: Or God</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There was a sudden explosion at the frontlines.</br>
</br>
A Tiger II was lifted to the sky by a dark green flash.</br>
</br>
20 soldiers hidden in the darkness suddenly snuck out as they launched a surprise attack on the northwest corner of the circle formed by NAC. They continued to push forward while they fired simultaneously. The raindrops exposed their outlines, but their outlines were still unclear in the darkness.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, two fist-sized crystals flew out from the darkness. They cast an eerie light before they exploded at the NAC infantry's backlines.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils contracted as he gazed at the explosions in the distance.</br>
</br>
He knew exactly what they were.</br>
</br>
The ability to explode crystals.</br>
</br>
These people belonged to the Dusk!</br>
</br>
The soldiers at the northwest corner immediately responded as they started firing at the unknown force.</br>
</br>
"It's an optical illusion! Bring out your EMPs!" A soldier shouted while ripping off his earpiece. He threw an EMP grenade.</br>
</br>
The soldiers nearby all followed as they targeted the area with EMP bombardment. The static noise began to diffuse to the surrounding area and revealed the soldiers in black standing in a triangular formation.</br>
</br>
Their black kinetic skeletons looked like full-body jumpers and their fluid rifles had a blue light. Judging by the quietness of their shooting, they were using Gauss rifles powered by electromagnetic acceleration.</br>
</br>
Just from the details, their equipment definitely wasn't from wasteland factories made with crude techniques; they were probably manufactured before the war!</br>
</br>
And they were the elites of the Dusk Church â€“ the Apostles!</br>
</br>
The bullets left waves and ripples on the energy shield. After being exposed, the Apostles didn't panic as they searched for cover and scattered around the destroyed Tiger II while engaging in battle with the First Corps soldiers.</br>
</br>
The EMP didn't affect their Gauss rifles as their working principle was based on high power currents accelerating metal projectiles; the effect of EMP on the flow of currents was almost negligible. The penetration power of the Gauss rifle posed a great threat to the soldiers even though the T-3 power armor was enough to defend against the projectiles of the Gauss rifleâ€¦</br>
</br>
But it was futile.</br>
</br>
Faced with the Wanderer Tank, everything was futile.</br>
</br>
While the Apostles pushed forward to the Sports Center, putting their lives on the line, the sound of an engine humming appeared from behind them.</br>
</br>
The concrete wall collapsed under the impact. The Wanderer tank previously leading the charge circled behind them.</br>
</br>
The particle cannon fired and a blue ball of light exploded in the middle of the Apostles' formation. The scattered high energy particles instantly penetrated through their energy shield. At the same time, the coaxial electrostatic cannon started to unleash its power.</br>
</br>
</br>
The 2 kg shells swept through at a rapid speed which caused a series of blasts in the rain. The cannon forced the Apostles to remain in their position before they were shredded. Faced with the Wanderer tank, their advantage of stealth was no longer existent.</br>
</br>
Their fate was determined. The mutated humans and the Dusk had no more fighting chances.</br>
</br>
The mutated soldiers at the Sports Center began to retreat while the NAC soldiers at the periphery of the building rushed in.</br>
</br>
But then, a green light sparkled and an explosion filled the battlefield again.</br>
</br>
The explosion was at the front of the Sports Center gate. The eight soldiers rushing in were blown a street away.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes to see the clouds of dust drifting apart as a figure walked out.</br>
</br>
Red dots locked onto that person's body.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, if he dared to make any moves, he would become a sieve in the next second.</br>
</br>
What made Jiang Chen uncertain was the still, calm look on his face.</br>
</br>
The rain dampened his clothes, the fur on his collar had been turned into a few muddled strands, and his hands were in his pockets.</br>
</br>
"I want to see your boss."</br>
</br>
It was the first thing he said.</br>
</br>
"Capture him." That was Cheng Weiguo's response.</br>
</br>
Two soldiers walked up with rifles in hand and pointed straight at his head while marching forward.</br>
</br>
"Kneel on the ground and put your hands above your head!"</br>
</br>
The person sighed.</br>
</br>
"Is this how you worship a god?"</br>
</br>
As the voice died, the scene suddenly took a turn.</br>
</br>
As if they were being directed by an invisible hand, two steel beams on the ground rose. Before the two soldiers could realize what happened, they were penetrated by the soaring beams.</br>
</br>
Even Jiang Chen was shocked by the scene.</br>
</br>
"Kill him!" Cheng Weiguo shouted.</br>
</br>
The shocked soldiers turned angry as they immediately pressed their triggers.</br>
</br>
Their bullets flew, but they all stopped in front of the stranger like flies stuck in a spider web. Like a scene from the Matrix, Jiang Chen's expression turned solemn.</br>
</br>
[What kind of technology is this?]</br>
</br>
Seeing as the bullets were useless, Cheng Weiguo waved his hand.</br>
</br>
With his command, the Tiger II rushed in and targeted the Type-50 electromagnetic cannon at the gate.</br>
</br>
The person smiled at the sight and opened his jacket.</br>
</br>
The shining gems dangling inside his jacket reflected an eerie dark red.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw this, his pupils instantly shrunk.</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo looked at Jiang Chen in shock as he didn't understand the decision.</br>
</br>
The person smiled with pleasure and raised the flashing red ring on his hand.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, I know you're here. Come out! Don't you want to chat with me?"</br>
</br>
Blood crystal was a substance with the same structure as crystal but possessed a thousand times the energy. Just a thumb-sized piece could create energy equivalent to one kilogram of tritium going through nuclear fusion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen heard Lin Lin say that Klein particles in the third dimension was only the tip of the iceberg in terms of its actual energy. Because of this, when Sun Xiaorou tried to assassinate him, just a few small crystals managed to create destructive power similar to a bomb.</br>
</br>
The ability to explode the crystals worked by releasing all the energy of the Klein particles. Therefore, once he blew up the blood crystal, the energy released would be far greater than the energy released through one kilogram of tritium in nuclear fusion.</br>
</br>
Therefore, for each of the blood crystals in his lap, each of them had power comparable to a hydrogen bomb.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen counted. Including the ring on his finger, he had a total of 121 blood crystals.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo saw Jiang Chen walking forward and immediately grabbed him.</br>
</br>
"General! You can't-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head, signaling Cheng Weiguo not to worry. He insisted on moving forward.</br>
</br>
Watching Jiang Chen walk to him, the person smiled joyfully.</br>
</br>
"Of course you know your stuff."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo watched Jiang Chen walking to the stranger without any protection. He gulped with uneasiness then signaled the sniper beside him. The sniper understood and raised his sniper rifle cautiously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at the bodies penetrated by the beams then looked at the person.</br>
</br>
"Introduce yourself."</br>
</br>
Seeing as Jiang Chen wasn't scared at all, the person's smile became brighter and brighter.</br>
</br>
"Bo Yu - Yu for space. Or you can call me pope or God."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

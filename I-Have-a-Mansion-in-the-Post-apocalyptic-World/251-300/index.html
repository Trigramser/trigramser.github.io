<div class="caption">Chapter 251: A Glean Hope</br>
</div></br>
It seemed like a long dream. In drowsiness, Xia Shiyu woke up from unconsciousness.</br>
</br>
"Do you know how to speak English?"</br>
</br>
With her thought returning to her, she sensed that she was in a mobile environment.</br>
</br>
On a car?</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Perfect, my Han is terrible." Caitlin chewed on her bubblegum and grinned.</br>
</br>
She tried to focus her vision, but her iris seemed to be covered by a thin layer of a veil which made her unable to see anything clearly.</br>
</br>
In haziness, she saw a figure.</br>
</br>
"Where is… this? What, what did you do to me?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu suddenly woke up from her drowsy state, and her body jerked in anger.</br>
</br>
The chair began to squeak, but her motions were ineffective. When she discovered her hands and legs were tightly tied to the chair, her face began to lose any sign of life as her vibrant red lips quivered.</br>
</br>
She remembered the instant before she lost her consciousness; she despairingly realized the severity of the situation.</br>
</br>
She was kidnapped.</br>
</br>
"We didn’t do anything to you, at least for now. You better pray that your boyfriend makes the right decision," Caitlin smiled, but her voice was cold.</br>
</br>
"How, how much money do you want?"</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, we don’t need money." Caitlin shrugged.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu desperately attempted to force his pupils to gaze onto the kidnapper’s face, but it was futile.</br>
</br>
She seemed to be surrounded by a thick fog, unable to render anything clearly.</br>
</br>
"To prevent you from seeing things you shouldn’t be seeing, we used medicine to obstruct your vision. Trust us, it is for your benefit," Caitlin seemed to have read Xia Shiyu’s mind as she said casually.</br>
</br>
Kaching-</br>
</br>
It was the sound of a gun being loaded.</br>
</br>
She wriggled backward with fear written all over her face.</br>
</br>
"Michael, it is not funny to scare the hostage," The black man playing with the radio device worked on the equipment while he spoke.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Perhaps it is because I spent too much time in Iraq." Michael shook the M9 in his hand as the Caucasian man grinned, "I heard Griss is here, I wonder where that guy is."</br>
</br>
"Team A, responsible for providing support. If we encounter the PLA, he might be up," Caitlin said emotionlessly, then looked at the driver in the front. "Adam, how much longer?"</br>
</br>
"Half an hour more."</br>
</br>
Before the police could set up blockades, they left Hucheng already. Since they were no ordinary kidnappers, if the local police could capture them, then they shouldn’t be agents anymore.</br>
</br>
Based on Zhang Youjie’s plan, Team B would be responsible for making the last attempt in convincing Jiang Chen. Team C would bring the hostage to location while waiting for Team B’s news to see if they should leave Jiangxi and head to Fujian on the coast. Once there, they would use a special channel to pass through the strait before leaving the border through Yizhou.</br>
</br>
</br>
If negotiation fails, Team B will execute Jiang Chen, Team C will also kill the hostage. If negotiation is successful, Team C would continue according to the plan and take Xia Shiyu out of the country. Team B will immediately follow and transfer Jiang Chen overseas.</br>
</br>
As to Team A, they were responsible for any of the agents or soldiers that would appear and cover for Team B’s retreat.</br>
</br>
Caitlin already memorized the mission brief in her mind, she just didn’t expect it to be so smooth.</br>
</br>
With eyes narrowed, she examined the frightened Xia Shiyu with a grin as she leaned the SCAR assault rifle on its side.</br>
</br>
"He is not my boyfriend…" Xia Shiyu said with a trembling voice in an attempt to convince the kidnappers to let her go.</br>
</br>
She had never seen anything like this living in the peaceful world.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then we’ll have to find out. But you better pray that he loves you, or we might kill you." Caitlin laughed and completely disregarded her words.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu felt her hands turn cold as a grave despair started to engulf her.</br>
</br>
Her lips trembled, her throat felt as if it was stuffed by a marshmallow, she couldn’t say anything.</br>
</br>
[Please, who could save me…]</br>
</br>
She closed her eyes in hopelessness.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen drove while Ayesha sat in the passenger seat. The two already left Hucheng on a small route. When they passed by the temporary inspection station, the police didn’t detain them. By the looks of it, Dagger was still not awake and didn’t report Jiang Chen missing to his superior.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's phone rung and he scanned the caller.</br>
</br>
&lt;Zhang Youjie&gt;</br>
</br>
A sneer surfaced on the corner of his lips.</br>
</br>
[Of course, it is him.]</br>
</br>
It was not a coincidence that he appeared at the Near Lake Restaurant.</br>
</br>
"Prepare the equipment and prepare to track his location," Jiang Chen without any emotion.</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded and took out the wireless tracking device and opened the map on the EP around her wrist.</br>
</br>
With the car parked on the side of the road, Jiang Chen pressed the pickup button.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang, what’s your decision?" Zhang Youjie said in a cheerful voice.</br>
</br>
"Where is Xia Shiyu?" Jiang Chen said distantly.</br>
</br>
"Who is Xia Shiyu? Sorry, I don’t understand what you’re saying, I’m only a consulate worker," Zhang Youjie spoke with a smile.</br>
</br>
"A consulate worker? Then why are you not in Wanghai City and here in Hucheng?" Jiang Chen scorned.</br>
</br>
"Of course here to deal with diplomatic affairs. Does your country have a law restricting consulate worker’s mobility?" Zhang Youjie pretended to be surprised.</br>
</br>
Ayesha displayed the EP on her wrist, the red dot stopped at the Wanghai City consulate.</br>
</br>
[When he left the restaurant, he returned to Wanghai City right away?]</br>
</br>
"I will ask again, where is Xia Shiyu?"</br>
</br>
Sensing Jiang Chen’s rage, Ayesha worriedly held his hand caringly.</br>
</br>
The cold touch on his hand calmed Jiang Chen slightly as he looked at Ayesha gratefully before taking a deep breath and recollecting his thoughts.</br>
</br>
In a moment like this, the more he panicked, the more likely a mistake would occur. He must have a clear mind to think of a solution.</br>
</br>
Just like when he was in Veit.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen calm down, Ayesha gently smiled and let his hand go.</br>
</br>
"I don’t understand what you’re saying. But if you are looking for someone, why don’t you provide me with your email? I have a particular location that might be of help?</br>
</br>
If he said anything he shouldn’t have said on the phone, it could be recorded as evidence, and he would face prosecution for espionage. He would never do something to dig his own grave.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen read out his email. Quickly, the phone beside his ear buzzed. The email; was already sent to his phone.</br>
</br>
"If anything happens to Xia Shiyu, trust me, I will make you regret it," Jiang Chen said calmly.</br>
</br>
"That’d be really scary then. Also, you better go alone. If I find out that the General Staff Department follows you, something bad may happen-"</br>
</br>
The phone went dead.</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie paused before he threw his phone on the desk and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Interesting."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 252: Who said I will go with you?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Outside of the Yangjiapin Textile Plant...</br>
</br>
A car was parked two hundred meters away from the gate on a small road.</br>
</br>
The car was not his Maybach S600, but it was, instead, a secondhand Sonata that he spent one hundred thousand acquiring. He didn’t want his ride to be ruined during the fire fight.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen got out of the car and scanned the surroundings before walking to the long-deserted textile plant.</br>
</br>
That was the destination they agreed on, 12 kilometers from Hucheng.</br>
</br>
Other than the weeds growing around the plant, it was barren farmland in the area with no one in sight.</br>
</br>
But just outside of the desolated plant, Jiang Chen saw four out-of-placed vans.</br>
</br>
There were two men with baseball caps standing by the door. Their jackets were stuffed with something hidden underneath, and their hands were in their pockets, as if they were holding onto something.</br>
</br>
The corners of Jiang Chen’s lip raised with interested as he walked up without fear.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen walking over, the two exchanged eye contact before one of them walked up.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang. Did you follow the agreement?" The man raised his right hand and smiled.</br>
</br>
He was referring to the agreement of coming alone.</br>
</br>
"Can’t you see with your own eyes?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored his extended hand and walked into the plant.</br>
</br>
An awkward expression surfaced on the person’s face while his hand remained extended. He glanced at his comrade on duty who was trying not to laugh as he shrugged and stuffed his hand back into his pocket.</br>
</br>
Ayesha didn’t follow along, Jiang Chen gave her another mission.</br>
</br>
Just like Zhang Youjie demanded, he came alone.</br>
</br>
Inside the plant, there were a few lights in the middle, with few figures visible from the window.</br>
</br>
He pushed opened the door to the plant and scanned around the numerous people inside before a smile surfaced.</br>
</br>
The camouflaged bulletproof vests, the metallic black assault rifles… to be able to transport these inside the country, they must have spent quite a lot of effort.</br>
</br>
The fifteen CIB agents were stationed around the corners of the warehouse, and five people were waiting for Jiang Chen at the door.</br>
</br>
The person in the front was giving off a dangerous vibe. Although Jiang Chen was unable to confirm his ability, just from instincts alone, this person was stronger than Robert’s bodyguard, Nick.</br>
</br>
He must be Griss—who Natasha referred to—also known as Wolf.</br>
</br>
Perfect, they are all here.</br>
</br>
"You’re Jiang Chen?" Seeing Jiang Chen walk in, a man in the middle stepped on a cigarette and took out a photo from his pocket with a grin.</br>
</br>
The wrinkles on his face twisted together, the green eyes were filled with a deadly eerie light as he examined Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"That’s right," Jiang Chen said distantly.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Since you’re here, you must have already made your decision," said Griss with a shrug.</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jiang Chen said calmly as he stared into Griss's eyes, "But before that, I need to call Xia Shiyu."</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry, you Asian monkey, the hostage is safe. We’re the CIB after all, not IS," the man scoffed.</br>
</br>
"Oh? I never really distinguished the two organizations."</br>
</br>
"You—"</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the mocking words from Jiang Chen, the man was immediately provoked and he stepped up.</br>
</br>
Griss glanced at his teammate and said indifferently, "Grim, shut up."</br>
</br>
"Yes…" The giant man immediately lowered his head and obediently backed down.</br>
</br>
In the face of this oppressive captain, he had no courage to rebuke.</br>
</br>
It was already against protocol to reveal the name of their organization, but seeing that the mission was about to be completed, Griss didn’t say anything.</br>
</br>
He tilted his head and spoke to the person beside him.</br>
</br>
"Give him the radio."</br>
</br>
"Okay, Captain." A soldier with a baseball hat took out a radio from his tactical vest, walked to Jiang Chen, and handed it to him.</br>
</br>
With an unidentifiable smile on his lip, Jiang Chen took the radio. The other hand in his pocket opened the wireless tracking device.</br>
</br>
He would have to leave that task to Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Xia Shiyu?!"</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen… Where are you?"</br>
</br>
With how feeble her voice sounded, Jiang Chen suppressed the anger in his mind. Taking a deep breath, he used the calmest voice he could muster:</br>
</br>
"How are you? Did they do anything to you?"</br>
</br>
"… Not yet. Who... who are they?" Her voice was filled with despair and helplessness, but it didn’t sound stiff, so she didn’t receive any cruel treatment.</br>
</br>
After confirming Xia Shiyu’s safety, Jiang Chen felt a little calmer.</br>
</br>
Just as he wanted to gain more time for Ayesha, the communication was cut off from the other side.</br>
</br>
"You had ten seconds to confirm the safety of the hostage," Griss grinned, taking out a lighter and lighting another cigarette for himself. "Now, your choice will determine the life or death of you and your girlfriend. You don’t have a lot of choices."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slowly dropped down the radio and looked at Griss in the eyes.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
[ I don’t think so .]</br>
</br>
He added a sentence in his mind. The hand in Jiang Chen’s pocket threw the wireless tracking device into the storage dimension, then he took out a paper-thin remote and pressed the switch.</br>
</br>
The broad-range signal jammer in the trunk of the Sonata parked outside of the warehouse instantly opened and blocked any signal within five kilometers radius.</br>
</br>
"Grim, check his equipment." Without concern for Jiang Chen, Griss turned his head and spoke to the comrade on the side.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Boss."</br>
</br>
Twisting his neck while making a loud crackling sound, Grim walked to Jiang Chen with a wicked smile. He already made up his mind to teach the arrogant guy a lesson.</br>
</br>
For example, accidentally breaking one of his nuts during the search…</br>
</br>
"Before we leave here, we need to check your equipment to prevent you from wearing any tracking device. Of course, if you resist, there might be some unfortunate things that may happen."</br>
</br>
Looking at Grim walking towards him, Jiang Chen suddenly started laughing.</br>
</br>
"Leave here? Who said I will go with you?"</br>
</br>
When they heard this, all five people surrounding Jiang Chen were shocked.</br>
</br>
Without giving them the opportunity to react, Jiang Chen immediately detonated the smoke grenade and EMP grenade in his pocket.</br>
</br>
Buzz—!</br>
</br>
The static buzzing noise echoed in the plant as the light bulb instantly blew out, leaving the entire plant into darkness. At the same time, smoke began to spread out from where Jiang Chen stood and hid his figure.</br>
</br>
"Kill him!"</br>
</br>
Griss roared out and instantly ordered the command to kill. At the same time, he raised his rifle and began to fire.</br>
</br>
Tatatata-!</br>
</br>
Fires splattered as the weaving bullets ripped through the smoke that hid Jiang Chen’s figure. The empty plant was filled with the sound of bullet explosion and the crispness of bullet shells hitting the ground.</br>
</br>
Because of the eye's inability to adjust to the sudden change in light, everyone’s vision was shrouded in darkness. However, the people here were all seasoned soldiers and, even with their eyes closed, they could work together to prevent the target from escaping with the web of bullets they wove.</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
The shooting stopped, and the smoke began to fade.</br>
</br>
The plant returned to silence.</br>
</br>
The thick smoke dispersed at a steady pace and gradually began to meld with the smoke risen from the rifles.</br>
</br>
The five CIB agents in the middle of the plant still maintained their shooting position and locked on to the smoke.</br>
</br>
Although the smoke had yet to disperse completely, no one questioned the ill fate of the Oriental man who didn’t recognize the situation.</br>
</br>
It would be absurd to have escaped from the rapid shooting.</br>
</br>
It was only protocol to maintain firing position.</br>
</br>
"Boss, he must have died," Grim said as he moved his joints.</br>
</br>
Griss stared into the middle of the smoke.</br>
</br>
The target must have died, but an unsettling feeling was growing in his mind.</br>
</br>
The smoke was like the egg of the devil, something was about to walk out from it.</br>
</br>
Was it an illusion?</br>
</br>
But then, his eerie green pupils suddenly contracted, the calmness that belonged to an elite soldier instantly faded!</br>
</br>
"God…" With hopelessness in his voice, Grim, who previously wanted to break Jiang Chen’s nuts, moved back shaking violently.</br>
</br>
The surface of the steel armor reflected five frightened faces.</br>
</br>
With the T3 power armor covering him, the revolving machine guns rotated rapidly as Jiang Chen unlocked the safety to the weapon module.</br>
</br>
"Let’s play a game."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 253: The Slaughter Armor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The slick steel surface looked like a futuristic warrior just walked out from a sci-fi film. The rapidly revolving machine gun cast out a fearsome vibe under the pristine moonlight.</br>
</br>
"Take cover—!"</br>
</br>
Griss roared as he rolled to the wall on the side.</br>
</br>
The instant his back made contact with the concrete wall, the storm of bullets blasted by.</br>
</br>
Grim, who was closest to Jiang Chen, had no opportunity to dodge. He maintained his frightened expression while being shredded to pieces by the bullets. The three CIB agents nearby also experienced a horrific death by the fierce bulletstorm.</br>
</br>
The sparks from the bullets lit up the surface of the power armor as the CIB agents, who were hidden around the plant, retreated while firing. However, the scattered bullets hitting on the T-3 C-type steel were as weak as scratches and only left a series of clanking sound—they couldn’t even leave a single dent on the surface of the armor.</br>
</br>
That was the difference in technology.</br>
</br>
Unless it was a heavy anti-armor sniper rifle or a machine gun, it could not pose any threat to the airdrop-type T-3 power armor that represented the highest level of technology before the war. If it was the land-type power armor, only the cannon on the M1 tank could pose a threat.</br>
</br>
Right when he threw down the EMP and smoke grenade, Jiang Chen traveled back to the apocalypse. Before going back, he first went to the armory in the apocalypse right beside the power armor, suited up, and he traveled back before returning to the modern world.</br>
</br>
The CIB could not see any of his actions under the cover of the smoke. In their eyes, the power armor seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. If not for that, they wouldn’t look like they just saw a ghost.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen in a power armor was like a devil stepping out of the abyss, completely destroying any of shred of their willpower with his firepower.</br>
</br>
"I’m hit! Medic!"</br>
</br>
"Tom is down! Dammit!"</br>
</br>
"What is this thing?! God, make him stop!" The voice sounded like he was about to cry.</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Concrete shattered as Griss leaned tightly against the wall, the thunderous machine gun noise causing him to almost lose his sense of hearing.</br>
</br>
"Smoke grenade!"</br>
</br>
With a roar, he pulled out a smoke grenade from his waist, jumped out from under cover while moving to his team’s zone of control, and squatted back down.</br>
</br>
"Change to thermal vision!"</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The nine CIB agents all replaced the scope on their assault rifle and peeked out from their cover while aiming right into the heart of the smoke.</br>
</br>
But then, they were completely stunned.</br>
</br>
There was only a white fume inside the haziness and they couldn’t see anything.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, in the middle of the smoke, grinned as a series of red dots appeared on his iris.</br>
</br>
"Fury!"</br>
</br>
</br>
The revolving machine gun was deactivated and he pulled out the tactical rifle from his waist.</br>
</br>
The agents who planned on firing back had no time to react before the bullets cracked open two people’s skull.</br>
</br>
With the loss of two lives, the CIB agents had to retreat back into cover while firing in a scattered formation.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, dropping the ball at the most critical situation, I’ll stuff your head into the toilet when I head back."</br>
</br>
Griss cursed at Zhang Youjie who was responsible for the logistics as Griss ripped off the thermal imaging scope with his teeth gritted.</br>
</br>
Fear permeated throughout his entire body as the muscle on Griss’s face twisted violently.</br>
</br>
He had not experienced this feeling for a long time, the sense of adrenaline overwhelming him.</br>
</br>
He ripped off the radio from the tactical vest and screamed inside, "The enemy’s firepower is too strong, Team A and B are under attack, mission failed! I repeat, mission failed!"</br>
</br>
But there was no response from the other side.</br>
</br>
Griss was stunned.</br>
</br>
Not just the thermal imaging, but even the radio were also not working. It was if an unknown power had destroyed all the electronic equipment.</br>
</br>
The comrades fired back while ducking out of cover, but he gradually couldn’t hear the bullets anymore.</br>
</br>
The concrete debris cut through his face while he took out the digitalized scope.</br>
</br>
There was no red dot on the screen, it also stopped working.</br>
</br>
An unknown fear suddenly overwhelmed him, his eyes popped out, blood-shotten.</br>
</br>
A one-sided slaughter.</br>
</br>
The impenetrable armor, the mysterious weapon that instantly destroyed all electronic equipment... who are they? They are definitely not the PLA! Hua would not have this type of military technology!</br>
</br>
From Afghanistan to Iraq, Wolf Griss was used to savoring the fear on the enemy’s face. Marking down coordinates while enjoying the sight of garbage fleeing under the rampage of the AC-130, Griss had scoffed at the scums who didn’t know what thermal vision was as they ran desperately to the bushes, trying to escape from the Grim Reaper’s feast…</br>
</br>
But he never thought that he'd one day become the prey.</br>
</br>
… No, it was no longer a battle, it was a massacre!</br>
</br>
At that moment, warm blood splattered all over his face and interrupted his pondering.</br>
</br>
He looked up. The comrade who shot back a second ago lost his head already.</br>
</br>
In two short minutes, the twenty CIB agents from Iraq were down to five.</br>
</br>
"Retreat! Retreat!" Griss, realizing the situation he is in, roared out as he attached the grenade launcher onto his assault rifle and fired it into the smoke.</br>
</br>
There was a loud explosion, but he didn’t care if it hit the target or not. He rushed to the back door of the plant with his head covered.</br>
</br>
The grenade exploded on the arm of the power armor as the fragmented shrapnel screeched against it. However, Jiang Chen only tumbled a little without being too affected.</br>
</br>
Allowing the bloodlust to overtake him, Jiang Chen fired with the tactical rifle while moving forward to CIB’s zone of control. His pupils contracted as he locked instantly on to a red dot. Just as the person peeked out, Jiang Chen pulled the trigger and killed him without any hesitation.</br>
</br>
Because they didn't think that they would encounter any armored forces, along with the secretive nature of this mission, the CIB agents didn’t bring any anti-tank rocket launchers with them this time.</br>
</br>
With just grenades that were meant to be used against infantries, it was incapable of dealing any damage to the power armor!</br>
</br>
"You want to run?" Jiang Chen grinned and scoffed at the four CIB agents retreating. He deactivated Fury and moved to the door slowly.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
From the moment the shots were fired inside the plant, the two people patrolling by the door realized the oddity of the situation as they took out their assault rifles hidden underneath their jacket and remained on high alert.</br>
</br>
With the loss of communication, they were completely oblivious to what was happening inside the plant.</br>
</br>
Upon seeing Griss run awkwardly in their direction, Brian, who was at the door, immediately went up to find out what was going on.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, captain, what happened inside?"</br>
</br>
"Dumb*ss, get in the car!"</br>
</br>
Griss immediately pulled on the fool that ran toward him and shoved him into the van.</br>
</br>
It was the first time Brian saw Griss being so desperate like this. Realizing the severity of the situation, Brian didn’t dare to speak any more and took the driver's seat.</br>
</br>
A few other agents also quickly got into the van.</br>
</br>
"The status of the communication system on the car?" Griss asked while breathing heavily.</br>
</br>
"All function— Sh*t! No signal!" The agent on the backseat smashed the car door.</br>
</br>
"F*ck!" Griss cursed as he glanced at the situation outside of the car. Seeing that the metal giant didn’t follow them out, he felt somewhat relieved.</br>
</br>
[ Maybe that metal giant has weaknesses too... like low mobility? ]</br>
</br>
With the car already started, he couldn’t care about anything else other than leaving the area and sending the shocking information back to the CIB headquarter.</br>
</br>
Compared to the source code of the drone and the metal giant, the mysterious weapon that could instantly paralyze a team electronic device was more shocking! If they were all from the organization behind Jiang Chen, then the CIB must reevaluate their strategy against the mysterious organization.</br>
</br>
Just as his strained nerves started to loosen up, the scream of the driver rang beside his ear.</br>
</br>
"What the f*ck! What is that!"</br>
</br>
Four flying discs flashed in front of the car window. Under each disc, a black machine gun hung there.</br>
</br>
With a cold sweat rolling down his forehead, the driver pressed on the gas, knowing full well that it was too late.</br>
</br>
Fire emerged as the Hummingbird drones began to unleash its power.</br>
</br>
Without any time to react, the CIB agents in the car were reaped of their lives by the merciless bullets.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Low mobility? That was Griss’s wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
The reason why he didn’t want to wear the power armor out of the warehouse was purely due to the concern for privacy. It was an unwise move to expose such a large target in public. Although it was just a barren farmland without anyone there, it was better to be safe.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse and left the power armor in the armory before he traveled back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
He scanned outside of the plant with the broad range life detection device and saw one red dot lit up. Jiang Chen grinned, took out the PK2000 from the storage dimension and strolled to the shattered van.</br>
</br>
Blood dripped out of the door and pooled to the ground. Red and white contents mixed together and were stuck everywhere.</br>
</br>
At the sight of the horrific scene inside the van, Jiang Chen was shocked; however, he didn’t feel any sympathy.</br>
</br>
He recalled the Hummingbird drones and then dragged Griss, who was shot multiple times and on the verge of dying, out of the van and onto the ground. He then took out the hemostasis spray and applied it to Griss's wounds.</br>
</br>
Griss was covered in blood, the calmness and ferociousness had already faded.</br>
</br>
Rather than Wolf, it was more appropriate to describe him as a dead dog.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him from the top, kicked his arm, and said with interest, "Can’t say anything anymore?"</br>
</br>
Griss stared into Jiang Chen’s eyes, with blood in his mouth, and said while stuttering, "I… won’t tell you where the hostage is. Just wait to recover the body of your little girlfriend."</br>
</br>
"Might not be the case," said Jiang Chen as he took out a voice recorder and threw it on Griss’s body.</br>
</br>
Just as Griss was confused by his action, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"I ask, you answer."</br>
</br>
In his hand was a truth-telling serum.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"… We lost Team B, negotiation failed. Execute plan II. I repeat, negotiation failed…"</br>
</br>
The message, mixed with static noises, came from the radio on the floor.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu horrifically glanced around, but she couldn’t see anything.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, she heard the sound of a window shattering, followed by something heavy dropping onto the ground. Then, the room returned to silence.</br>
</br>
The room was dark without any light. This left the already visually-impaired Xia Shiyu in darkness with just moonlight from the window scattering in.</br>
</br>
[ Negotiation failed... does this mean they are going to kill me? ]</br>
</br>
When she thought about it, the hopelessness inside her grew deeper. Her originally clean jeans were now covered in dust as she feebly jerked on the ground.</br>
</br>
The rope was like a python that restrained her tightly to the corner of the wall. No matter how hard she tried to break free, she could not move a single inch.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen…" A weak whimpering came out from her tape-covered mouth as Xia Shiyu closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
Would he just appear like that night and rescue her from her despair?</br>
</br>
"Save me…"</br>
</br>
Although there was a slim chance of it happening—and perhaps she may have her throat slit the next second and fall on the cold floor—she was still hoping for it to happen.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Target executed."</br>
</br>
An indifferent voice, mixed along with a mist of breath, came out of Ayesha's lips.</br>
</br>
Under the crosshair was a female body. The blonde hair was scattered on the ground with blood. The 12.76 mm bullet had pierced through her skull and the CIB agent had died under her sniping.</br>
</br>
"Did I make it…?"</br>
</br>
Her chest pumped furiously. The moment she received the coordinate from Jiang Chen, she floored the gas pedal and raced here. When she got off the car, using the fastest speed possible, she rushed to the highest point of a yet-to-be-completed building before lying on her current sniping position.</br>
</br>
It was a race with the Grim Reaper.</br>
</br>
If nothing else happened, the moment that the coordinate was sent over from Jiang Chen, the battle over there would have already started. Although he would definitely use a signal jammer to interfere with the enemy’s communication, without any contact for an extensive period of time, the enemy commander would become suspicious.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the location where they kept the hostage was not too far from the abandoned clothing factory. She made it there before the enemy found out what was truly happening.</br>
</br>
Ayesha moved the crosshair and observed Xia Shiyu’s status.</br>
</br>
The hostage appeared to be in a stable state… Without any reaction to gunshots, she must have her vision obstructed. It was better this way, for if the hostage were to scream because of the scene, it would make the situation worse.</br>
</br>
[ Is she the other wife of my husband? She looks pretty. ]</br>
</br>
</br>
While Ayesha was thinking this, she opened the life detection device beside her scope.</br>
</br>
The blue waves scanned across the field before a few red dots were quickly marked on the scope.</br>
</br>
She moved the crosshair of the Ghost sniper rifle and locked onto a patrol at the gate warming his hands.</br>
</br>
"The second one," she murmured as she pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The bullet shattered the person’s skull with blood and brain matter splashed all over the ground. With the patrol being shot, the enemy finally realized they were under sniper fire, and the two red dots behind the structure quickly moved into the building.</br>
</br>
Without any hints of being perturbed, to her, killing was as easy as breathing.</br>
</br>
All for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Target exposed. Next should be to control the hostage," Ayesha muttered to herself as she moved the crosshair back to the room where Xia Shiyu was, aiming the crosshair at the door.</br>
</br>
Indeed, the red dot moved onto the third floor beside the door.</br>
</br>
The enemy didn’t just rush inside. Even if they were to think with their butt, they would know that inside the room was under the killing range of the sniper.</br>
</br>
"Smoke grenade? Too bad it's useless on me." Ayesha ignored the door being slightly opened as she aimed at the concrete wall and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Dammit, its PLA’s sniper, someone betrayed us!" said Mike with a short breath as he tightly clenched onto the loaded pistol.</br>
</br>
"We might be surrounded, control the hostage first." The black man with an assault rifle was calmer as he took out a smoke grenade from his waist.</br>
</br>
There was only one place where one can find a sniper in Hua, and it was in the military. Snipers were like rats traversing under the foot of an elephant. If their trails were exposed, their only fate was to be stomped.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, this place wasn't Iraq. There was no aircraft carrier to provide covering fire while they retreated.</br>
</br>
Just as the black man was about to throw a smoke grenade inside the room, the concrete wall he was leaning against instantly shattered. A bullet penetrated through the ten-centimeter wall and ripped his head into pieces.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Mike immediately rushed for the stairs. He couldn't care about the hostage anymore. The enemy’s bullets seemed to have eyes growing on them. He only wanted to leave this god-forbidden place!</br>
</br>
Mike flipped out of the window and rolled to the back of the abandoned building. With his back against a thick wall, he regained a sense of security: It was normal for a bullet to penetrate through a wall, but it was impossible for it to pass through an entire building.</br>
</br>
He glanced at the empty ground twenty meters in the distance and debated for a few moment, but he had no courage to run across.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! What is the dumba*s Miller doing!" he cursed out, but he had no other solutions.</br>
</br>
Miller was the sniper responsible for supporting this mission, but there was no movement from him at all. Because he was operating alone, Miller was not in the communication channel with Team C. Only Captain Caitlin could reach him, but she was already dead.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Hidden?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha muttered as she put away the sniper rifle and headed downstairs.</br>
</br>
Due to the threat of the sniper, the enemy would not return to retrieve the hostage.</br>
</br>
She moved along the bunker at high speed as she closed the distance with the target building. Jumping over a wall, she took out the pistol around her waist and moved to the CIB agent hidden behind the building. Her steps were quiet—like a cat—not making any noise.</br>
</br>
A terrifying feeling suddenly overwhelmed Mike. The instant he turned his head, his eyes were met with the muzzle of Ayesha’s pistol.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
Ignoring the body crumpled on the ground, Ayesha moved to where Xia Shiyu was kept.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 255"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 255: That Bullet</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was easy to kill, but hard to take care of the aftermath.</br>
</br>
A total of 22 lives, all consisted of CIB elites. If the CIB knew Jiang Chen was the perpetrator behind this massacre, they would jump up like a cat with its tail being stepped on and launch a series of counterattacks.</br>
</br>
He could not take the responsibility for this incident.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had used the truth-telling serum and obtained all the mission details from Griss’s mouth. Team A and B had died in his hand, without any accidents, and Team C should be finished by Ayesha already.</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie had, additionally, requested a sniper to assist with the mission in case there were any potential problems, but with Ayesha’s ability and equipment, it shouldn’t be a big deal to take out the sniper.</br>
</br>
All counteractive measures were prepared for against the General Staff Department. Never in his wildest dream would Zhang Youjie believe that it only took two people to wipe out the entire CIB force.</br>
</br>
With a casualty of almost thirty people, this was the most significant loss suffered by the CIB.</br>
</br>
During the interrogation, Jiang Chen used the voice changing app on his phone to alter his voice so there was no need to worry about drawing any connections with him.</br>
</br>
He picked up the voice recorder from Griss’s clothes and stared at the black face without a word. Taking out a pistol, he aimed at Griss's head and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The pupils dilated and began to lose its color.</br>
</br>
Griss stopped breathing and his bloodstained life came to an end.</br>
</br>
Unlike the last time in Veit—because they saw his power armor—he couldn’t leave anyone alive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed, put away his pistol, and started to deal with the aftermath.</br>
</br>
Including Griss, Jiang Chen dragged the six people inside the van into the abandoned plant and lined them up together with the other bodies. It was a bit problematic dealing with Grim since he was shredded to pieces already.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had the rare sensation of his stomach feeling upset.</br>
</br>
The meat chunks were still warm…</br>
</br>
After he removed any of the sensitive document and communication devices, all the bodies were transported back to the apocalypse to be burned outside of the Fishbone base. Upon returning back to the modern world, Jiang Chen used the blood dissolver to clean up any remaining blood.</br>
</br>
Just like this, their existence in the modern world was wiped out.</br>
</br>
There were still signs of a battle, but the bodies were nowhere to be found.</br>
</br>
What Jiang Chen needed to do was to make the CIB believe that the agents on this mission were not dead, but—instead—all captured and imprisoned in a secret prison.</br>
</br>
Only the government was capable of imprisoning nearly thirty agents inside Hua; a person would not have the ability to do so.</br>
</br>
After all, imprisoning was incomparable to killing. Killing would only require a single bullet, but to capture people, it would require at least a prison as well as guards numbering no fewer than the prisoners. If there were any fewer, they may not be able to contain the elite agents.</br>
</br>
</br>
Without the agents’ bodies, the CIB would be unable to confirm their deaths and would suspect that it was the General Staff Department who captured them.</br>
</br>
In regard to prisoners, the UA’s typical response would be to save them. But Hua, who had never captured anyone, would not admit that they had imprisoned the agents. If Hua didn’t take the initiative to denounce UA for their espionage activities, UA's president could not step up to acknowledge the CIB’s operation in Hua. If they did, they would lose all their face as a country.</br>
</br>
With Hua not making the first move to denounce the UA, the UA would have no grounds to plead on behalf of the agents.</br>
</br>
Since it could not be solved diplomatically, they were only left with conducting secret missions.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the center of CIB’s activities in Hua must be focused on the captured agents within the next year and, hence, ignore the smaller character, Jiang Chen. Even if they could not find any results, they could only conclude that the missing agents were secretly executed by the General Staff Department, and they would likely not associate the death of their agents with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As for to how to deal with the General Staff Department, that would the next step.</br>
</br>
Now all Jiang Chen needed to do was to make the recorded message appear at the appropriate location.</br>
</br>
As he was thinking, Jiang Chen took out the satellite phone from his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Robert? I need your help…"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The ropes around her wrists and her legs were cut open. Xia Shiyu watched the girl fluidly inserting the dagger back around her wrist. She gulped and then spoke with a trembling voice, "Who, who are you?"</br>
</br>
Since her vision had yet to completely recover, she couldn't clearly make out the girl’s face. She could only determine from the graceful outline that the girl must be stunning.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha, Jiang Chen’s bodyguard."</br>
</br>
Since Ayesha thought they would be "working together" in the future, there was nothing to hide… So Ayesha only hesitated for half a second before giving her name out.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu would undoubtedly have a bewildered expression if she knew Ayesha’s thought.</br>
</br>
"Bodyguard?" Xia Shiyu never knew Jiang Chen had a bodyguard before, so she could not help but to feel puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. We met in Iraq," Ayesha answered concisely.</br>
</br>
Iraq?</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had some memory of Jiang Chen’s visit there. She was still perplexed to this day why he went there.</br>
</br>
[ Who are these kidnappers? They seemed to have kidnapped me with Jiang Chen as their intention… ]</br>
</br>
What was surprising was that even if she experienced such a horrific event purely because of Jiang Chen, in her heart, she didn’t blame him at all.</br>
</br>
[ In other people’s eyes, I’m already someone important to him… ] Xia Shiyu’s heart began to beat faster.</br>
</br>
The only thing that made her slightly disappointed was that Jiang Chen wasn't the one who showed up.</br>
</br>
But it made sense as she could not imagine Jiang Chen coming to her rescue with a gun.</br>
</br>
The people who kidnapped her were not ordinary thugs, but fully equipped soldiers. In her memory, Jiang Chen might be a good fighter, but he was nowhere strong enough to contend against elite agents.</br>
</br>
[ Why would foreign agents be interested in Jiang Chen anyways? Because of Future Technology? But Future Technology is only a private enterprise, why would the foreign agents be interested? ]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had no knowledge of Jiang Chen's involvement in Dragon II, so she thought it was reasonable. Although Zhongxin High Tech had negotiated with Future Technology, she didn’t know the specifics of the agreement since it was Jiang Chen who was responsible for the negotiation.</br>
</br>
However, she had a feeling it might have something to do with that project.</br>
</br>
"I will take you out of this place first, let’s talk in the car." Ayesha’s voice interrupted her thought.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen would be here to clean up the scene in a bit, so it was better to take Xia Shiyu out of the place first.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Xia Shiyu gulped and nodded.</br>
</br>
With how anxious she looked, Ayesha’s expressionless face turned into a smile. She comforted her gently:</br>
</br>
"Don’t panic, they are all dead."</br>
</br>
[ Eh, she is panicking more? ]</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head, perplexed, while she looked at the shaking Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
[ Whatever, let’s get out of this place first. ]</br>
</br>
Shaking her head, Ayesha extended her hand to Xia Shiyu on the ground with care.</br>
</br>
"If you can’t see, you can hold my hand."</br>
</br>
Although Xia Shiyu was still terrified, she took a deep breath as she did her best to control the fear in her mind. She extended her hand while shaking and held onto the small hand.</br>
</br>
But all of the sudden, Ayesha was alarmed and, almost instinctively, she shoved Xia Shiyu away.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
At that moment, a bullet penetrated through the window and struck her on the chest.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
Blood gushed out of Ayesha’s mouth as the impact felt like a truck had slammed into her head on. Her tiny body was thrown into the air and smashed against the concrete wall. If it wasn't for the kinetic skeleton, she would've been dead already.</br>
</br>
Blood dripped down through the corner of her lips. While enduring the sharp pain in her chest, Ayesha didn’t dare to hesitate and rolled away from the window.</br>
</br>
Almost instantly, another bullet arrived and struck where she was previously. The shattered concrete debris scratched her face, and the 12.76 mm bullet left a giant crater on the ground.</br>
</br>
After escaping from the area directly observable through the window, she then let out a sigh of relief and ripped off her jacket with teeth clenched.</br>
</br>
Even with the genetic vaccine, bullets still treated everyone equally.</br>
</br>
While the assault rifle of the modern world was inferior compared to those from the apocalypse, the power of a sniper rifle was not to be underestimated. From the damage done to the ground alone, the enemy must be using an anti-armor sniper rifle—the Barrett M82!</br>
</br>
Though the bullet was deflected, it still caved in the polyethylene bullet-proof vest. The massive kinetic energy from the shot had knocked the wind out of her.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, completely oblivious to what had just happened, remained terrified and lied there without moving.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha…"</br>
</br>
"Don’t move, stay down!" Seeing Xia Shiyu wanting to come help, Ayesha immediately stopped her.</br>
</br>
The caved-in part happened to be pressing against her ribcage, substantially interfering with her ability to breath.</br>
</br>
She swallowed the blood back down, gritted her teeth, and removed the polyethylene plate in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
Since it was one-time protection anyways, there was no point in leaving it in front of her chest after being shattered.</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, she calmly took out a smoke grenade and threw it near the window.</br>
</br>
Fearing that Xia Shiyu would stand up, Ayesha said, "Stay put. Try to stick to the floor if you have difficulty breathing."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu tightly pressed against the ground with the smoke hiding her terrified—but gorgeous—face.</br>
</br>
Forcing her body to move, Ayesha picked up the assault rifle and helmet belonging to Caitlin and returned to the window.</br>
</br>
Using a lighter, she heated up the helmet and then used the assault rifle to raise the helmet, slowly moving it to the window opening.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
With the "head" barely exposed, the helmet was blown away.</br>
</br>
[ Thermal vision? ]</br>
</br>
Ayesha’s eyebrows twisted together and looked at the door.</br>
</br>
The enemy must have headed to the sniping location she was previously at; therefore, the door must also be in the range of the sniper. Without the ability to move, they were completely suppressed inside this room.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was her first time encountering a situation like this in real life.</br>
</br>
[ What to do… ]</br>
</br>
Inhaling deeply, Ayesha clenched tightly onto the Ghost sniper rifle in her hands.</br>
</br>
She started to feel hazy from the acute chest pain. It was only through sheer willpower that she hadn't fallen unconscious yet.</br>
</br>
Her body temperature began to lower, and her consciousness also slowed.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a faint light flashed on the EP.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, noticing the abnormality on the EP, hesitated for a moment before opening it up.</br>
</br>
&lt;Hidden Genetic Code:&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Coldblooded: Decrease the surface body temperature to the extreme—like a dead creature—to achieve the state of being invisible to any non-optical detection device.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Side effect: Metabolism lowered to the extreme, interfering with any wounds healing. Prolonged usage may result in a coma.&gt;</br>
</br>
[ Hidden genetic code? Eliminate body heat? ]</br>
</br>
[ Could it really do that? ]</br>
</br>
[ … Whatever, I have to take the gamble. ]</br>
</br>
She took another deep breath as she felt her body heat decreasing to the extreme and her heart speed slowing down tremendously. Ayesha, with the sniper rifle, knelt at the window.</br>
</br>
Seeing that a bullet didn’t arrive, she had a smile on her face.</br>
</br>
Inside the smoke, without the help of thermal vision, the enemy couldn't see her.</br>
</br>
She activated the thermal vision on the scope and locked on to the bright spot a thousand yards away.</br>
</br>
"Goodbye."</br>
</br>
Ayesha pressed the trigger, and blood splattered in the scope.</br>
</br>
"Finished…" she muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
At the same time, her tightly tensed consciousness reached its limit.</br>
</br>
As the smoke began to fade, the sniper rifle rolled out of her hands, and she dropped to the ground.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha!"</br>
</br>
She faintly heard someone calling her name, but she couldn’t hear anything after.</br>
</br>
[ Tired .]</br>
</br>
[ I really want to sleep… ]</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Dagger struggled to get up from the ground after waking up from unconsciousness.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, this guy didn’t go easy on me."</br>
</br>
He touched his pocket; the pistol and phone were all there.</br>
</br>
"It’s going to be really problematic now."</br>
</br>
Dagger rubbed his bruised face as he sat down on the bench nearby. It was completely dark already. After lying on the concrete ground for so long, Jiang Chen must have been long gone.</br>
</br>
He took out the phone and dialed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The number you are calling is either out of service or has been shut down…"</br>
</br>
"Should I say it is expected?" Dagger let out a sigh as he hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
At the same time, his phone rang.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It’s me, Miao Jun," replied a feeble voice from the other side of the phone.</br>
</br>
"Little Jun?! Where are you now?!" Dagger was shocked.</br>
</br>
Although the tone sounded confounded, it was indeed Miao Jun’s voice. Dagger originally didn’t have any hope, but Miao Jun did manage to escape from the CIB! If he saw the face of that agent, it would definitely be a turning point in this stalemate!</br>
</br>
On the other hand, while he didn’t say anything, he was indeed worried about the safety of this immature student.</br>
</br>
"I’m in the rural area…"</br>
</br>
"Wait there! Tell me the address, I’ll be right there."</br>
</br>
After confirming the location, Dagger rushed into the car and raced to the rural area.</br>
</br>
While en route, Dagger reported to headquarter about losing Jiang Chen and of Miao Jun escaping.</br>
</br>
To the news of Jiang Chen defying the order, his superior, General Liu, was only silent and not angry. He then ordered Dagger to immediately rescue Miao Jun, who had escaped from the CIB. As for Jiang Chen, he had already sent other people to handle it.</br>
</br>
When the communication ended, he reached to where Miao Jun described.</br>
</br>
With the car parked on the road, Dagger took his pistol and rushed into the alley.</br>
</br>
Not long after, he saw Miao Jun covering his stomach while leaning against a wall.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun was covered in blood, with bruises all over his face.</br>
</br>
Seeing this scene, Dagger instantly became furious and he quickly rushed to the side of Miao Jun, putting an arm around his shoulders.</br>
</br>
Dagger started cursing when he saw that his student was tortured by the CIB.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, don’t let me catch them—"</br>
</br>
But he couldn’t finish the sentence, his voice froze halfway.</br>
</br>
Slowly, he looked down.</br>
</br>
"Why…"</br>
</br>
"No reason."</br>
</br>
The blood on Miao Jun was fake, and the feeble voice was also feigned.</br>
</br>
However, the blood flowing out of Dagger was real.</br>
</br>
"Because of money?"</br>
</br>
Dagger stared at the blade in his stomach, bitterness was the only impression left on his face.</br>
</br>
The pistol slid down from his hand, and Miao Jun kicked it away.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Miao Jun was embarrassed to answer such a question; he didn’t say anything as he made another stab at Dagger's stomach.</br>
</br>
"If you wanted to be rich, why did you become a soldier…"</br>
</br>
More blood flowed out, interrupting Dagger’s harsh words.</br>
</br>
In the unknown alley, the seasoned veteran stopped breathing.</br>
</br>
After killing the "master" he had spent half a month with, Miao Jun took a deep breath and suppressed the guilt in his mind. He took the phone and car key from Dagger's body and walked to the Sonata.</br>
</br>
One million USD, he could not make that much in his life.</br>
</br>
Just like what Zhang Youjie had said: since he was already planning on retiring, what difference does timing make?</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 257: CPR</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Her eyelashes trembled.</br>
</br>
While feeling drowsy, Ayesha felt something wet touch her lips.</br>
</br>
The pressure on the left of her chest caused an anguished moan to escape from her lips.</br>
</br>
This feeling was very weird, making her uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
Subconsciously wanting to escape, Ayesha's figure twitched.</br>
</br>
In response, "the weird feeling" seemed to be more excited. The compression on her left chest became harder and faster; the aggressive feeling on her lips was increasing…</br>
</br>
Gradually, Ayesha’s consciousness returned. She opened her eyes slowly, but was met with a pair of crystal pupils.</br>
</br>
She was stunned.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was also stunned—the panic on her face quickly turned into embarrassment.</br>
</br>
The reason for the awkwardness was naturally because of her intimate position.</br>
</br>
Because she had never done CPR before, half of her body was resting on Ayesha’s body. With one hand on her left chest and the other hand pressed against the ground, she had kissed Ayesha’s lips in an awkward position.</br>
</br>
The two fell silent.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha!" At the same time, the door was slammed open, with Jiang Chen rushing in.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had called him a moment ago explaining that Ayesha was in critical condition, so he had rushed over in a panic.</br>
</br>
But before he could take a few steps through the door, he froze in place.</br>
</br>
Uhh, how should he say this? Although Jiang Chen was pleased to see the two having a good relationship, he was not mentally prepared to see this…</br>
</br>
"Uh, when did you start…" Jiang Chen scratched his face and awkwardly looked away.</br>
</br>
"No, it’s not what you think!" Xia Shiyu’s face turned red and instantly jumped away from Ayesha’s body as she desperately tried to explain to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Compared to Ayesha, her face was a lot thinner.</br>
</br>
"This is… CPR?" Ayesha, still on the ground, tilted her head.</br>
</br>
While she was also embarrassed, she quickly collected herself together and realized that Xia Shiyu was performing CPR on her.</br>
</br>
It's just that the position was too awkward; generally, when performing CPR, it was not necessary to lean on the person’s body.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Xia Shiyu gently bit on her lips, blushing.</br>
</br>
Although she was terrified, when she saw Ayesha fall unconscious, she had gritted her teeth and dragged Ayesha away from the window.</br>
</br>
After doing all this, she had immediately called Jiang Chen and explained Ayesha’s condition. Right before she was about to call the police, Jiang Chen had stopped her and asked her to wait there before he hung up.</br>
</br>
[ Don’t call the police? ]</br>
</br>
Although Xia Shiyu didn’t understand why Jiang Chen would make this judgment, with a headless corpse beside her, she—who was already terrified—began to realize that the incident may not be normal. After an internal struggle, she had finally chose to trust Jiang Chen’s judgment and not call the police.</br>
</br>
</br>
She had tried hard to not look at the gruesome corpse and focused all her attention on the girl in front of her.</br>
</br>
The girl was beautiful.</br>
</br>
Her eyelashes were long, her facial structure was also delicate, and her fair skin was especially comparable to a porcelain doll, arousing jealousy from anyone looking at her.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu thought about this, she felt jealous.</br>
</br>
She had never known that Jiang Chen had such a beautiful bodyguard beside him. And with those looks, she may not even be 18 yet…</br>
</br>
But then, a hint of guilt appeared in her mind. Ayesha had just saved her, and she was now speculating about Ayesha's relationship with Jiang Chen... it was insulting. With Jiang Chen attitude and personality, he shouldn’t have done anything that would cross the line…</br>
</br>
Needless to say, she didn’t really understand Jiang Chen after all.</br>
</br>
Just as her mind drifted elsewhere, she had suddenly noticed that the girl’s chest was not moving.</br>
</br>
This had caused Xia Shiyu to start panicking, and she immediately put her finger on Ayesha's upper lip. There was no breathing!</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, although she had never done a CPR before, Xia Shiyu still stepped up, resulting in the intimate scene that had just occurred.\</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Ayesha smiled at Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"No need to thank me… Or rather, I should thank you." Xia Shiyu took a deep breath and sincerely bowed down.</br>
</br>
Ayesha didn’t say anything and accepted Xia Shiyu’s gesture.</br>
</br>
"You made me scared… What happened?" Jiang Chen was relieved as he walked beside Ayesha to help her up.</br>
</br>
"Sniper, I overlooked it," Ayesha said apologetically.</br>
</br>
Because she was too anxious to save the hostage, she only scanned for life signal at the target building and forgot to scan her surroundings, which resulted in the enemy gaining the upper hand.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this, he immediately started to check her body and rushed to question:</br>
</br>
"Are you injured?!"</br>
</br>
"No, the polyethylene plate blocked the bullet." With the concerned expression on Jiang Chen’s face, Ayesha only felt warmness in her heart.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was relieved after everything was okay. When Jiang Lin designed the K1 kinetic skeleton, he told Jiang Chen that the supra-molecular polyethylene ballast plate could only block some rifle bullets, but he didn’t know if it could block sniper bullets.</br>
</br>
However, when he gave a thought, it made sense.</br>
</br>
The assault rifle Jiang Lin had referred to was the PK2000 and the Reaper that was common in the apocalypse. Although the light armor could not defend against the sniper rifle in the apocalypse, the M82, known as the cannon in the modern world, could only shatter the plate.</br>
</br>
So the injury sustained by Ayesha was only due to the kinetic energy from the bullet.</br>
</br>
But the problem was if it was just the kinetic energy, why was she knocked out? Although the power of the anti-armor weapon was fierce, it was not strong enough to the point where it could knock Ayesha—who was injected with a genetic vaccine—unconscious.</br>
</br>
"Ahem." Xia Shiyu looked at the way Jiang Chen explored Ayesha’s body and turned aside. With a hint of jealousy in her voice, she said, "Although Ayesha is your bodyguard, she is a girl after all… Just be careful."</br>
</br>
"Ah. Sorry." Jiang Chen instinctively retracted his hand.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu. She seemed to have understood something as a smile surfaced.</br>
</br>
[ That kind of relationship? ]</br>
</br>
"Head to the car first with Ayesha, I will be right there." With the questions Xia Shiyu seemed to have, Jiang Chen paused and then added, "Once we’re on the car, I will explain to you everything."</br>
</br>
With the serious expression on Jiang Chen’s face, Xia Shiyu just nodded and Ayesha took her to the Maybach.</br>
</br>
After cleaning the battlefield, Jiang Chen returned to the car.</br>
</br>
The Sonata Jiang Chen bought was parked in a community nearby, abandoned.</br>
</br>
It was one in the morning and there was only one car on the empty road; it looked desolate.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat in the front seat as Xia Shiyu, in the back, seemed to be uncomfortable. Jiang Chen asked with care in his voice, "Do you feel uncomfortable?"</br>
</br>
"N… No."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu yawned, leaned against the car door, and muttered, "My first kiss… was given to a girl."</br>
</br>
Ayesha who was about to start the car paused before she began to giggle.</br>
</br>
"What are you laughing at?" With redness covering her face, Xia Shiyu pretended to be serious, but her voice wasn't confident at all.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also resisted the temptation to laugh as he said out loud, "CPR doesn’t count as the first kiss."</br>
</br>
"That makes sense…" Xia Shiyu looked away with a relieved expression.</br>
</br>
"Is there anyone you want to give your first kiss to?" A rare, cunning look appeared on Ayesha’s expressionless face.</br>
</br>
"Of course, someone I like."</br>
</br>
"Do you like Jiang Chen?" Ayesha was persistent.</br>
</br>
"Why, why do you suddenly ask this?" Xia Shiyu’s face immediately blushed as she spoke incoherently.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also awkwardly scratched his face as he said, feeling embarrassed, "Ahem, don’t—" But his sentence was cut short.</br>
</br>
Ayesha suddenly kissed him.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu just felt something shattered as she completely froze.</br>
</br>
"Your first kiss is now his."</br>
</br>
Ayesha turned around and smiled gently at the completely dumbfounded Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
The pristine blue eyes were filled with mischief.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Miao Jun parked the Sonata on the side of the road and walked to the agreed location with a perplexed feeling.</br>
</br>
It was one and a half hour past midnight, the road was empty. Leaning against the road lamp, he gazed into the distance and silently waited.</br>
</br>
Based on the agreement he made with Zhang Youjie, as long as he took care of Dagger and brought his phone to the agreed location, the task would be completed.</br>
</br>
"If you want to be rich… then why did you become a soldier…"</br>
</br>
The words left by Dagger lingered around his ears like a nightmare.</br>
</br>
"You think I really wanted to be a soldier?" Miao Jun swore out loud and stuffed his cold hands into his pocket.</br>
</br>
Betraying his country.</br>
</br>
He never thought this day would come.</br>
</br>
That thought alone gave him goosebumps.</br>
</br>
A car light eventually approached from the distance. When Miao Jun saw this, he clenched the pistol in his pocket. Right when he saw the face in the car, his tensed expression started to loosen.</br>
</br>
The car came and parked in front of him. A middle-aged man got out of the car and smiled at Miao Jun.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Miao, I trust that you must have completed the deal we made."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 258: Eternal Loyalty</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Team A and Team B lost communication. Team C and Sergeant Miller confirmed dead."</br>
</br>
Inside the consulate office with the report coming in from the phone, Zhang Youjie’s finger trembled.</br>
</br>
Five lives, 20 something people captured. The supposedly-flawless mission ended in an overwhelming defeat.</br>
</br>
Not to mention, it was the most severe loss suffered by the CIB.</br>
</br>
The other side of the phone fell silent. Li Zhongping, who was still in Hucheng, waited for an order.</br>
</br>
"Is it the work of the General Staff Department?"</br>
</br>
"Should be," Li Zhongping responded in a low voice.</br>
</br>
With a deep breath, Zhang Youjie deliberated before he ordered, "… Mission aborted, retreat."</br>
</br>
Although it was unfortunate, the mission did fail already. Without surprise, the UA embassy in Shangjing would receive a letter from the Han Congress, then the UA will be denounced by Hua in a news conference.</br>
</br>
The muscles on Zhang Youjie face twitched uncontrollably, his heart dripped blood.</br>
</br>
"What about the pawn left there?" asked Li Zhongping, referring to Miao Jun who had defected.</br>
</br>
His previous plan was if Hua put Jiang Chen under house arrest, they would use Miao Jun to take out Dagger and bring the imprisoned Jiang Chen out.</br>
</br>
But the plan never seemed to be in their control. Hua seemed to have used Jiang Chen as bait to take out Team A and B by using the PLA army stationed nearby. Right afterward, Team C that kidnapped the hostage was ambushed by a sniper.</br>
</br>
Was the mission leaked?</br>
</br>
The CIB, fooled by the General Staff Department.</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie inhaled deeply, trying hard to calm himself down.</br>
</br>
Since losing was inevitable, minimizing loss was what he needed to consider.</br>
</br>
"Take him out, he saw my face. Also, before taking him out, get him to take out Dagger."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie hung up the phone and rubbed his sore nose before he left the office.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Miao Jun had never thought that he would join the military. He had never thought that after graduation, he'd be a secret agent in the intelligence department and become a part of the General Staff Department.</br>
</br>
As for his dream, he wanted to become a businessman like his uncle. Or more simply, he wanted to be rich.</br>
</br>
But things didn’t go as planned.</br>
</br>
His original plan was to attend the business department at Wanghai University, and then start his own company after graduation.</br>
</br>
He worked hard and indeed achieved stellar results.</br>
</br>
He could vaguely recall the joy on his parents’ face when they were checking his score.</br>
</br>
However, when it came time to apply for schools, his parents were against it.</br>
</br>
He'd never imagined that his parents would plead with him, asking him to give up on his dream and to, instead, attend the Shangjing National Defense University.</br>
</br>
</br>
There was no reason other than a parents’ concern for their son’s future.</br>
</br>
"Your grandpa’s old comrade is now a General. With this connection, if you attended the National Defense University, you will have a glorious future in the army!"</br>
</br>
"Business? Do you know how difficult it was for your uncle? He couldn’t even afford to eat at times! Business is not as easy as you think?"</br>
</br>
"This is for you…"</br>
</br>
Finally, Miao Jun decided to become a soldier.</br>
</br>
What’s ironic was that with this route, the only way he could achieve his dream was to become a bodyguard for the rich after leaving the army.</br>
</br>
It was not impossible to be rich by staying in the army. There were plenty of money to be found in the logistics department, and a non-combat position in the recruiting office also had some opportunities; however, as a personnel from the intelligence department… it would be dangerous if he became wealthy.</br>
</br>
His parents' consideration made him step onto a path that he didn’t even like in the first place. He tried to make himself enjoy it, but he realized that despite how hard he tried or how many achievements he earned, everyone would attribute his success to his connection and would automatically ignore his hard work.</br>
</br>
Indeed, with the help of his connection, he was promoted quickly and managed to be part of the General Staff Department at the age of 24. But on the dinner table, his parents would only exclaim that his grandpa’s comrade was someone who changed his life, and they ignored the fact that he had almost died at the special training camp!</br>
</br>
"Having a rough time? Everything you do will be rough! That is a given."</br>
</br>
If Miao Jun wanted to complain, his father would definitely "comfort" him like this.</br>
</br>
No one mind having a rough time if it was a career that they were passionate about.</br>
</br>
However, he only felt dread.</br>
</br>
Reality has shown that no amount of forced love can substitute real love. The same is true for a career and country. Even though he had memorized to heart the idealogy of the army, even without truly accepting it, he still did not hesitate to speak the words he did not care about when he swore with everyone.</br>
</br>
One million USD? The money was attractive, but that was not what attracted him the most.</br>
</br>
A green card, a ticket to the free world… He was tempted.</br>
</br>
Freedom.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the concept of it held a fatal attraction. Even if he would curse it because he couldn’t obtain it, he would still comfort himself that he had lived a fine life without it.</br>
</br>
Even after dinner, he would always curse with his comrades about the despicable UA soldiers.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Miao, I trust that you have completed our agreement." Li Zhongping smiled.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun looked at the weed on the side of the road as his throat moved. "Dagger is dead."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then congratulations." Li Zhongping was relieved and drew out a pistol from his pocket.</br>
</br>
Because it was too sudden, Miao Jun didn’t manage to react.</br>
</br>
He gulped and utter out with difficulty, "Why?"</br>
</br>
"God will bring you eternal freedom. Okay, Mr. Miao, goodbye—"</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
A bullet penetrated Li Zhongping’s head, his blood splattering onto the car.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!" The CIB agents driving immediately pulled out his gun.</br>
</br>
"What are you waiting for!" A thunderous roar came from the distance.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun, surprised, unconsciously drew out his pistol.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
Before the driver could do anything, Miao Jun shot him.</br>
</br>
Breathing heavily, within the short few seconds, his entire back was drenched in cold sweat.</br>
</br>
At the end of the alley, a figure staggered forward.</br>
</br>
When Miao Jun saw the wrinkled face, he smiled wryly. He threw away his pistol and didn’t run. Instead, he raised both of his hands.</br>
</br>
It was Dagger.</br>
</br>
For some reason, seeing him still alive, Miao Jun felt relieved despite knowing that this meant that he'll be spending the rest of his life in prison.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I… plotted against you." Due to his guilt, Miao Jun didn’t dare to look at his master in the face.</br>
</br>
"You really think you could plot against me?" Dagger scorned while he covered his bleeding wound and sat on the engine cover.</br>
</br>
He paused before the dried lips spoke trembling.</br>
</br>
"I took the two daggers on purpose. If you really could escape, you wouldn’t have been caught in the first place. If you truly did escape, there was really one possibility…" The old face flashed with a cunning look fitting for his age as he gazed at the rookie for a long time.</br>
</br>
"I defected," Miao Jun said with a bitter expression.</br>
</br>
"Learn." Dagger smile with his left hand still covering his wound, the right hand pressed against the engine cover.</br>
</br>
"No need, there is no opportunity to use it even if I learn." Miao Jun sighed and took out Dagger’s phone to call General Liu.</br>
</br>
He was planning to confess.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, Dagger, with keen eyes, snatched the phone and hung up the phone yet to be dialed.</br>
</br>
With a perplexed expression on Miao Jun’s face, Dagger grinned and threw the phone away.</br>
</br>
"Dying due to a comrade’s defecting... even if you don’t think it is embarrassing, I still think it is. 'Dagger suffered an honorable death.' I’m more willing to have the last line written like this."</br>
</br>
[ Death?! ]</br>
</br>
Miao Jun was stunned as his eyes widened, "How is that possible, didn’t you purposely-"</br>
</br>
"Although it is on purpose, they still hit the sweet spots," Dagger laughed, but he started to cough while laughing.</br>
</br>
Blood stained Miao Jun’s clothes.</br>
</br>
"Let me call an ambulance for you—"</br>
</br>
"There is no need"—Dagger stopped Miao Jun—"I know my body."</br>
</br>
"I..." Miao Jun’s finger trembled and froze there not knowing what to do.</br>
</br>
The apology was stuck in between in throat, it could not be squeezed out.</br>
</br>
He knew that even if he apologized, it was useless.</br>
</br>
He had killed him.</br>
</br>
Disregarding Miao Jun’s expression, Dagger muttered to himself:</br>
</br>
"I’m old and can’t even beat the young guys. Five years, the organization brought me back to the country. I was supposed to retire that night. But Old Liu found me and wanted me to use my experience abroad to provide some guidance on anti-espionage activities and train a few more newcomers for the state… I agreed.</br>
</br>
"Five years, there were a total of 27 young men that trained under me. You should be the last one." Dagger looked at Miao Jun pleasingly and nodded, "You are the most talented I have seen—for a new recruit."</br>
</br>
"Sorry—"</br>
</br>
"Don’t apologize." Dagger shook his head.</br>
</br>
"27 people, only six stayed. My old superior wanted me to convince those talented to stay, but I never did that. The melon forcefully grown isn't sweet."</br>
</br>
His voice was filled with melancholy.</br>
</br>
"If you want to be rich, don’t be a soldier. If you are reluctant, problems will arise, sooner or later."</br>
</br>
Miao Jun lowered his head, his face covered in embarrassment.</br>
</br>
The voice turned more feeble and Dagger continued to mutter to himself:</br>
</br>
"I know that my country might not be the best… You guys can go on the internet, the things you see, I know too.</br>
</br>
"But even like this, I still firmly believe that it will become better.</br>
</br>
"Before that, please protect it for me, until that day is here.</br>
</br>
"But don’t force yourself."</br>
</br>
"Could… could I know your name?" Miao Jun asked while sobbing.</br>
</br>
"My name? Haha." Dagger grinned as if he had regained his life back, and his voice was again filled with energy.</br>
</br>
He took out the pistol that he had used for many years and threw it in Miao Jun’s hand while shaking.</br>
</br>
"Once you have enough authority, you can just flip through my document. If you retire, there is no need to know anymore.</br>
</br>
"Return this to Old Liu for me, I have fought for him for half of my life. Return this gun to its rightful owner."</br>
</br>
Then, Dagger slowly closed his dried eyelids.</br>
</br>
This time, he really stopped breathing.</br>
</br>
Just like an aging shepherd finally welcoming its eternal peace.</br>
</br>
"AHHHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
Under the streetlight, on the empty road, a man kneeled on the ground howling in tears.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 259: The Reaction across the Pacific</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A lot happened that night.</br>
</br>
The error in judgment of Jiang Chen’s ability made the CIB pay a heavy price.</br>
</br>
The error in judgment to Jiang Chen's reaction caused the General Staff Department to lose Jiang Chen’s whereabouts.</br>
</br>
Who would have thought an ordinary person would suddenly become a fully equipped "Ironman" like a superhero in the Hollywood movie? Who would have thought the "obedient" individual would suddenly express anger, "Sorry, I’m not your subordinate"?</br>
</br>
From God’s perspective, the focal point of the clues revolved around the man called Jiang Chen. But because of the blind spots of each party’s intelligence, as well as the context that the two sides would never sit around a table to exchange information, the CIB and the General Staff Department were both tricked in this one incident.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how anxious the General Staff Department was about Jiang Chen’s disappearance, a person across the Pacific was also in a state of anxiety.</br>
</br>
It was still midnight in Hua, daylight on the other side of the earth.</br>
</br>
It was the Rainbow Mansion of UA.</br>
</br>
Right now, John Brennan stood awkwardly in front of the President’s table, but his previous aggressive stance was long gone. Normally, he would not put aside his pride and just stand here in front of the president of the UA because CIB was independent of the intelligence system. Even the Congress had no rights to ask for specific details. From this point alone, he lived a much better life than the current president who constantly receives pressure from the Congress.</br>
</br>
Beside John, James Komi was gloating. Compared to the bald old man, the only 35 years old middle-aged man looked sharper. Nothing made him more delighted than his opposition suffering.</br>
</br>
That’s right, while they served the same government, the two organizations didn’t have the best relationship.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the past UA presidents had a love and hate relationship to the two hands that always fought each other.</br>
</br>
Right now, the president wanted to throw his shoe at John’s face.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, before we start the meeting, lets first listen to a voice message." James coughed and signaled the two to look in his direction. Then he raised his eyebrows at the old opposition John before he put the smartphone on the president’s desk.</br>
</br>
It was a recorded interrogation.</br>
</br>
The voice of the interrogator was low and slightly stiff. It was hard to make out the voice, but the person being interrogated was clear to distinguish.</br>
</br>
Griss, CIB’s elite agent. The president had personally awarded him an honorary emblem.</br>
</br>
But the super warrior that survived through the chaos in Iraq had no life in his voice. Rather than wry, it was more accurate to describe as completely hollow.</br>
</br>
What kind of torture did the General Staff Department use to force the tough man to confess the entire mission details in two short hours? Just be listening to the voice without any life in it, the three in the president office felt a horrific chill.</br>
</br>
</br>
The recording ended.</br>
</br>
John took a deep breath and loosened his tie in discomfort. The president’s face looked gloomy.</br>
</br>
Even though his legs remained on the desk, he did not say a single word.</br>
</br>
Seeing the two didn’t say anything, James smiled and spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Kidnapping and threaten a lawful businessman is despicable and unconstitutional. Disregarding the fact that your people took the constitution seriously, with the severity of this mission, could I consider this as the biggest mistake that occurred in your history?"</br>
</br>
"Please mind your words, Mr. James, I’m considering the interest of the nation," John argued back out of habit, but there was no confidence in his voice at all.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? But what about now? There are more odds in our diplomatic relationship with Han and they caught us with our pants down. We could have used a mild method to drag the Han businessman over to our side. Where do you think the CIB agent is conducting the mission, Syria? Iraq? God, that is Hua."</br>
</br>
John looked awkward, so he diverted the topic.</br>
</br>
"James, I don’t think it is appropriate for you to demonstrate your cheerful attitude in this setting."</br>
</br>
"No, who said I’m cheerful, I’m furious." James resisted the urge to laugh as he rubbed his upper lip.</br>
</br>
"No, you are laughing."</br>
</br>
"It is your illusion, Mr. John."</br>
</br>
"Both of you, shut up," The president suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
Like two chickens fighting, John looked at James aggressively, but James at an advantage only shrugged and looked at the president with a pleasant smile.</br>
</br>
"Now, let’s discuss how we are going to fix this thing," The president deeply inhaled and said gloomily.</br>
</br>
"First, we should think of a plan to rescue the twenty-something agents back. Since Griss was interrogated, then at least it meant that they didn’t die because of crossfire, but were rather captured," John tried his best to calm down and slowly explained the situation.</br>
</br>
"But till this moment, Hua didn’t comment on this incident. Should I call over and admit our mistake? And beg them to release the prisoner?" The President was instantly furious.</br>
</br>
John’s expression suddenly turned awkward again as he shrugged with thick skin.</br>
</br>
"Then write twenty-five copies of the honorary letters and send it to the family of the missing warriors."</br>
</br>
The president rubbed his weary forehead before he sat up from the chair.</br>
</br>
"James, where is the recording from?"</br>
</br>
"The email appeared two hours ago in one of my subordinates' mailbox. Realizing the severity of the situation, he immediately sent the file to me," James said delightfully.</br>
</br>
"What’s the validity of the file?"</br>
</br>
"We conducted voice analysis with Griss’ voice, it matched perfectly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." The President only nodded.</br>
</br>
"Let’s think how to take care of the aftermath. Since the conflict… already occurred," John rubbed his nose and said uncomfortably.</br>
</br>
With the way John looked, the president almost wanted to curse at him.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, you don’t tell me before you execute the mission, and now I have to wipe your butt when there is a problem.]</br>
</br>
But he only said it in his mind and not out loud.</br>
</br>
He deliberated for a while before the president spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Immediately stop the interference with Dragon II; the mission failed."</br>
</br>
John nodded. James who was primarily responsible for domestic intelligence shrugged as it didn’t concern him.</br>
</br>
"If Hua denounces us on this… we’ll send the delegation team. If Hua doesn't comment on this… we likely won’t get them out. If we can, just send some more agents. Remember, don’t get caught again," The President said while massaging his forehead.</br>
</br>
John was grateful for the fact that the President’s promised to visit Hua. He nodded again.</br>
</br>
A visit to Hua meant pleading. As long as they could save the twenty-something people, John would face significantly less pressure.</br>
</br>
As to the Han businessman, the President already forgot about him.</br>
</br>
Compared to just a businessman, it was more important to wipe the butt of the CIB.</br>
</br>
And it was just a Dragon II drone system, the talented UA didn’t need it at all.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 260: Escaping the Cage</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xiangjiang, the Peninsula.</br>
</br>
In the elegantly designed grand hall, a young man sat at the corner with a foreign girl. They appreciated the gracefulness of the sunshine while quietly enjoying the afternoon.</br>
</br>
The musicians played a melodious, but slow classical music. The server in British-style uniform courteously walked beside the two and put the three-story silver tray filled with desserts on the table, and then poured black tea for them.</br>
</br>
To be honest, the British dessert didn’t taste great. The taste of the chocolate ball and the cream puff didn’t differ much with the ones sold at the bakery. The only thing unique about the afternoon tea here was the exquisite atmosphere and rich history.</br>
</br>
The hotel started construction in 1922 before completed in 1926 and opened in 1928. It is one of the most renowned and luxurious hotels in Xiangjiang and the world.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen couldn’t taste the atmosphere and the history. The only reason he was here was due to curiosity. Ayesha also was uninterested in those things as she was intrigued by the soft pudding on her plate.</br>
</br>
Her slightly curled brown hair gently rested on her right shoulder. Her cute mouth and smooth skin bloomed into a beautiful image under the mild sunshine.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could clearly sense that a lot of men were looking enviously at him. But he didn’t mind at all as he just sluggishly looked onto the street outside of the window while enjoying the tranquil and warm rays.</br>
</br>
As to why he would appear 800 kilometers away, it started two days ago.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen who wiped out an entire force of CIB and engaged in a small conflict with the General Staff Department didn’t return to Hucheng. Instead, he drove all the way to Fujian.</br>
</br>
On the car, Jiang Chen told Xia Shiyu about the incident from start to finish, including the meeting with Wang Linhua that night and then the specifics of the agreement with Zhongxin High Tech.</br>
</br>
In the morning, he called his parents and told them that he had to return to Wanghai City because of a temporary business emergency and not to worry before he turned off his phone.</br>
</br>
With Robert’s connection and Mr. Chen’s help, Jiang Chen boarded a luxury cruise as a tourist between Xiangjiang and Egret Island before walking off on Xiangjiang.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu stayed on Egret Island for one day before she boarded a flight from there to Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
When she got on the plane, the General Staff Department naturally contacted Xia Shiyu inquiring about Jiang Chen’s current location.</br>
</br>
As part of Jiang Chen’s plan, Xia Shiyu transferred over the USB loaded with smart drone system 1.0, at the same time restating Jiang Chen’s original words. Jiang Chen’s wording was reserved, but if it were expressed in monotone, it would definitely sound harsh.</br>
</br>
"I’m extremely displeased with what occurred in Hucheng. I’m not your subordinate, I did my obligation by paying my tax, and even if I obliged to my duty, you asked to me think of the bigger picture. This is funny, so I left."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Even if I have left, this doesn’t mean that I abandoned the Han market, and it doesn’t mean that my overseas team abandoned the Han market. Except that because of the deterioration in the investment environment, we are forced to reevaluate the focus of our business. Future Technology will become a subsidiary and controlled by the newly formed Future International."</br>
</br>
"Of course, regarding the agreement on the smart drone system 1.0, our party has already completed its development. I sincerely hope that your party can honor the agreement and provide the advantageous policy to Future Technology."</br>
</br>
"Yes, Future Technology has nearly three hundred million domestic users. But don’t forget, we also have over four hundred million international users, as well as one billion in the undeveloped market."</br>
</br>
"We don’t just have one choice-"</br>
</br>
General Liu was silent for a long time when he heard Jiang Chen’s response, he didn’t say anything at the other end and just sent people to protect Xia Shiyu before he reported Jiang Chen’s response to the top.</br>
</br>
As to how to treat Future Technology, the top discussed and weighed the pros and cons before making the decision to maintain friendly relationships and canceling Jiang Chen’s restriction to leave the country… although he left the border already.</br>
</br>
A technical team capable of producing military technology meant that it indeed possessed the value to establish a friendly relationship. Jiang Chen really didn’t develop the software during this time, and from the time it would take to complete the development, the actual developer was indeed not Jiang Chen. The stipulation of Jiang Chen being the developer was indeed false.</br>
</br>
From that perspective, it was pointless if they controlled Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
There was another story that happened as a result of that. As the perpetrator that forced Future Technology away, the Wang family were heavily criticized by their political oppositions. The formation of Future International meant that the separation of the domestic and international market would cause the Wanghai City local government to give away five hundred million in foreign tax income.</br>
</br>
While other forces were eager to take a bite of the juicy meat, the Wang family was the first to make a move. Therefore, they were heavily scrutinized by the central authority.</br>
</br>
Of course, these were all after facts.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen left, at least he won’t be back for awhile.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The Xiangjiang businessman that took him on board was someone he met before. When Jiang Chen colluded with Robert to sell gold, it was him that transported the gold to international waters before Robert’s ship took it to South Africa.</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen, he meticulously arranged everything for him. Not only did he send people to pick Jiang Chen up at the port, he even booked a room at the famous Peninsula.</br>
</br>
To his friendly gesture, Jiang Chen gladly accepted and checked into the luxury sea view suite on the top floor with Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Precisely speaking, it was considered smuggling. But when Jiang Chen got off the cruise, Robert prepared the necessary documents for him, so he was able to check in. As to Ayesha, because she possessed a green card, she could stay in Xiangjiang for a short period of time without any documents.</br>
</br>
The program was transferred over, the General Staff Department no longer bothered him, and the CIB also had other issues to deal with.</br>
</br>
Now that Jiang Chen was alone, he was free.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, why did you suddenly kiss me," He asked nonchalantly while savoring the tea.</br>
</br>
Ayesha buried her head upon hearing Jiang Chen’s question and stopped fondling with the pudding in her hand. Then she whispered quite embarrassedly.</br>
</br>
"Because… I want to share with her, and not keep it hidden from her."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the naïve words, he really wanted to scoff that "If it is Xia Shiyu, she definitely can’t stand the existence of another woman," but it didn’t come out of his mouth in the end.</br>
</br>
She was too greedy, even if Ayesha won’t be jealous.</br>
</br>
Ayesha seemed to have seen through Jiang Chen’s thought and just smiled.</br>
</br>
Being gazed upon by the gentle blue pupils, not a word could come out of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
She gently put down the silvery fork in her hand and said.</br>
</br>
"If she really left you because of this, that means she only has affection for you, and not love. If she really loved you, she would never leave because of this. At least, she will attempt to fight for you to come back."</br>
</br>
[Fight for me? Not something that the thin-skinned Xia Shiyu would do.]</br>
</br>
"Uh, it feels complicated now." Jiang Chen sighed while scratching the back of his head.</br>
</br>
[Whatever, just follow the flow.]</br>
</br>
It was already January. The food supplies to the wasteland would need to be solved. Hence, the next step was to take care of Pannu Islands.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 261: The Interference from an Unknown Channel</br>
</div></br>
After the afternoon high tea, Jiang Chen took Ayesha to the renowned Disneyland in Xiangjiang. Although her childhood had no Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck, it didn’t interfere with being touched by the happy atmosphere.</br>
</br>
The mouth carved into a crescent moon was filled with joy and happiness.</br>
</br>
She didn’t have a lively childhood. The moment she was born, her country was in the midst of unrest. From the joy on her face, Jiang Chen felt as if his weariness was healed.</br>
</br>
Although the loving smile was also beautiful, Jiang Chen hoped she could smile more for herself. It was the reason why whenever he has the opportunity, he will take her everywhere.</br>
</br>
To make up for her.</br>
</br>
Taking photos, going on rides.</br>
</br>
By eight at night, the two stood in front of the castle of the sleeping beauty with their hands held and enjoying the colorful fireworks blossoming in the sky.</br>
</br>
The light reflected on her happy face was so charming. Jiang Chen was lost in the scene.</br>
</br>
The happiness gradually turned into shyness under his direct sight.</br>
</br>
She gently kissed his lips.</br>
</br>
Fireworks lit up the sky and scattered.</br>
</br>
Lips apart.</br>
</br>
Ayesha slightly lowered her head, her face only flashed an attractive vibrancy.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
The lips murmured a timid gratitude.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t say anything, but she could clearly sense the reason why Jiang Chen choose to come here. It was mostly for her.</br>
</br>
He didn’t reply and only smiled. Then he rubbed her soft hair.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel happy?"</br>
</br>
With a hand gently on top of Jiang Chen’s, Ayesha closed her eyes and softly said.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was already nine before they left Disneyland, but they didn’t immediately return to the hotel. Instead, they went to Taigu Square.</br>
</br>
After their last date in Veit, Ayesha became fascinated by all kinds of clothes. Within a short period, the two would not be able to return to Wanghai city, so the clothes in the mansion would have to stay there.</br>
</br>
Thus, only when they carried a handful of bags back to the Peninsula did their day's itinerary finally end.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen locked the door behind him. Just when he had a smirk of a big bad wolf on and waiting for the little sheep to change clothes, the doorbell rang.</br>
</br>
Surprising Jiang Chen, he wondered who would be visiting this late?</br>
</br>
Although he was disappointed, Jiang Chen still tidied up his rumpled clothes, watched Ayesha go into the bedroom before he opened the door.</br>
</br>
A heroic but beautiful face appeared in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hello, handsome." Natasha with one hand on the door looked at Jiang Chen half-smilingly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh as he was planning to close the door.</br>
</br>
Natasha’s eyebrows raised as she stepped one foot inside and dragged Jiang Chen by the collar and pressed him against the wall.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What are you planning to do?" Jiang Chen shrugged as he glanced at her arm, "If I remember correctly when we were in Veit, you tried my ability before."</br>
</br>
Natasha's expression froze for a moment as she suddenly recollected herself, remembering she was no match for him. The harmless looking man had an unbelievable amount of strength, one move and she would be on the ground.</br>
</br>
But even then, she had no signs of backing down either.</br>
</br>
She teasingly moved closer to Jiang Chen’s ear as she blew flirtatiously in his ear.</br>
</br>
"Did Mr. Jiang forget what you did to me that day in the darkroom?"</br>
</br>
"I only injected you with something…" Jiang Chen shrugged, but his expression looked awkward, "Speaking of this, you seemed to be opposed to the idea of sleeping with me that day?"</br>
</br>
"That was before, do you not have any naughty thoughts about me?" Natasha said seductively, her 36E breasts had drawn in Jiang Chen’s attention.</br>
</br>
But just as she finished, a cold solid item was pressed against the back of her head.</br>
</br>
She didn’t know when Ayesha appeared behind her.</br>
</br>
The particularly cold expression had a vibe to kill.</br>
</br>
The playful smile froze on her face, the corner of Natasha's lips twitched as she let go of Jiang Chen’s collar and raised both of her hands to surrender.</br>
</br>
"Your little beauty is still not friendly," Natasha ridiculed as she maintained her position with her hands held high. "Could you get her to put the gun down?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After seeing Jiang Chen nod did she obediently put the gun away, but the cautious look on her face did not fade away.</br>
</br>
"I have other intentions for finding you." Natasha put on a stern face.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I wouldn't think you would be here to hook up with me," Jiang Chen didn’t take her stern expression seriously as he said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Since you have left Hua, why don’t you come to Russia?"</br>
</br>
"Regarding this, I believe we have already discussed it."</br>
</br>
As if Natasha had guessed what he would say, she was not surprised and only let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Although I have expected this… Looks like I will go back empty handed."</br>
</br>
"That’s right." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I thought making a trip personally would move you enough." Natasha shrugged as she walked to the door. "If you ever change your mind one day, Russia’s door will always be open for you."</br>
</br>
"Thank you very much." Jiang Chen sent Natasha out the door.</br>
</br>
After closing the door, seeing that Ayesha was looking at him, Jiang Chen rubbed her hair smiling.</br>
</br>
"What are you thinking about?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked away in shyness as she murmured.</br>
</br>
"Are we… going to continue?"</br>
</br>
As she finished saying this, her face became red.</br>
</br>
Although they were interrupted, seeing Ayesha’s timid look, Jiang Chen felt his thirst return.</br>
</br>
"Of course." He softly spoke into her ear, "Do you want to shower first, or should I go?"</br>
</br>
"I’ll go."</br>
</br>
Then, with a blushed face, Ayesha dashed into the washroom.</br>
</br>
Not long, the glass blurred and water began to drip.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the sofa in the living room while waiting for the beauty to come out, Jiang Chen began to play with his EP.</br>
</br>
Due to boredom, Jiang Chen suddenly remembered Ayesha’ coldblooded ability. Using it for an extended period of time could cause her to go into a coma which is a serious consequence.</br>
</br>
When he first obtain his fury ability, he could only use medicine to control the activation and deactivation. With the help of medication, he could have been in an awkward position where he could activate but was unable to deactivate the ability.</br>
</br>
Although Lin Lin definitely would have fallen asleep by now, Jiang Chen didn’t feel guilty about waking her up.</br>
</br>
Indeed, Lin Lin with sleepy eyes appeared on the other side of the screen.</br>
</br>
"Pervert, why are you not asleep this late, what do you need me for?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I have something to ask you…" Jiang Chen explained Ayesha situation to Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Medicine for hidden genetic code? Although the coldblooded ability is uncommon, it probably could be purchased at the Sixth Street. Okay, I will tell Sun Jiao. Is that all?" Lin Lin yawned.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, sleep early." Seeing the drowsy Lin Lin in pajama, Jiang Chen couldn’t help but smile.</br>
</br>
"I slept already-"</br>
</br>
But then, the screen froze all the sudden.</br>
</br>
Gradually, the middle of the screen turned into whiteness.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was confused, he thought the EP or that chip was malfunctioning, so he knocked on the EP.</br>
</br>
No reaction at all.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was about to restart the EP, the screen suddenly turned black.</br>
</br>
Immediately, in the middle of the pitch black screen, a word appeared abruptly.</br>
</br>
&lt;Hello&gt;</br>
</br>
What surfaced after was a person with only an outline showing.</br>
</br>
He had a hollow smile on and waved at him rhythmically.</br>

</div></br>
The next morning, while lying in bed, Jiang Chen hugged the cat-like Ayesha curled up in front of him and turned on the TV.</br>
</br>
&lt;… Recently, the authority had cracked a major case of foreign espionage activity. Two suspects were shot died during the arrest phase when they fired back, based on the evidence collected at the scene, the investigation has arrested 11 suspects, which include seven Zhongxin High Tech researchers as well four government officials. They will face espionage, treason, as well as seven counts of other charges.</br>
</br>
Based on reliable information, the CIB may have been involved with this mission, suspect Zhang is currently hiding inside the UA consulate in Wanghai City and refusing to accept the trial by law. Right now, the investigation team has sent in a request to the UA embassy, hoping the UA consulate in Wanghai City can assist in the investigation. As to the specifics progress of the event, we’ll pass it on to our reporter in Wanghai City…&gt;</br>
</br>
[Suspect Zhang? Is that Zhang Youjie?] Jiang Chen yawned as he disinterestedly turned off the TV.</br>
</br>
He’ll leave the trouble for "professionals" to solve. To the CIB and General Staff Department, it was definitely not the end. But to him, he can turn to the next page.</br>
</br>
Even if everything started because of him.</br>
</br>
"Dagger is good. Zhang Youjie shouldn’t have left anything behind, but Dagger still found evidence?" After putting the remote on the nightstand, Jiang Chen touched Ayesha’s nose as he fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
Three teams and one sniper. All the evidence was taken away by him into the apocalypse. In this case, the General Staff Department should have no reason nor evidence to determine the CIB planned this mission.</br>
</br>
[Two agents shot, did a battle occur somewhere he didn’t know about?</br>
</br>
Whatever, there is no difference in conclusion.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he decided not to be troubled by this anymore.</br>
</br>
Compared to these things, what kept him up at night was the video he saw no his EP yesterday.</br>
</br>
After restarting it, the EP returned to normal. If it were not that every communication would be automatically written in the memory, Jiang Chen would have thought it was his illusion.</br>
</br>
Hello?</br>
</br>
Was it saying hello to me?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pondered for a moment as he scratched his chin, but he still didn’t reach any conclusions.</br>
</br>
"Whatever, I’ll go back to the apocalypse and gave the video to Lin Lin." He muttered to himself as he put it aside for now.</br>
</br>
After waking up, Jiang Chen called the front desk.</br>
</br>
Not long after, the server pushed a cart full of breakfast to the door.</br>
</br>
After paying plus tips, Jiang Chen put the tray with a sandwich and mocha on the counter. Seeing Ayesha curled up with her hands in front of her chest, he couldn’t help but smile as he leaned down to kiss her smooth forehead. As if she had sensed the warmness, her eyelashes shivered, and a subconscious smile appeared on her face. She seemed to be having a sweet dream.</br>
</br>
</br>
Because they slept really late last night, he didn’t want to disturb her peaceful sleep. So Jiang Chen left a message on the nightstand only the two of them would understand before initiating travel.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes, he was in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
He didn’t stay in the room for too long as he headed straight to the gym on the third floor.</br>
</br>
After quietly opening the door, Sun Jiao sensing the sound behind her and immediately turned around. When she saw it was Jiang Chen, surprised quickly spread across her face.</br>
</br>
"You are back?" Putting the pistol away, Sun Jiao walked to him.</br>
</br>
"Could you reaction be slower and let me give you a surprise?" Jiang Chen put his hand away from her waist as he said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Then why don’t you try again? I'll pretend I didn’t see you." Her beautiful pupils were filled with mischievousness.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I’ll pass. I have some important things to take care of this time."</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen had important tasks, Sun Jiao swiped away her naughty expression and waited for Jiang Chen to explain.</br>
</br>
"How’s the production of the kinetic skeleton?"</br>
</br>
Two months ago, Jiang Chen gave Jiang Lin the production goal of completing 50 kinetic skeletons a month, he was wondering what the progress was on this.</br>
</br>
"We exceeded the goal," Sun Jiao had a proud smile on her face, "We have 110 kinetic skeletons in the armory, based on your order, we have not equipped the forces yet."</br>
</br>
"110 sets?!" Jiang Chen shockingly looked at Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
Seeing the shocked Jiang Chen, Sun Jiao smiled as she began explaining.</br>
</br>
"Did you forget that the Sixth Street is our territory now? Based on the recommendation of your acting general Chu Nan, after taking consideration of Jiang Lin opinion, a portion of our parts requirement was outsourced to the Sixth Street to complete. We establish the standards, they are responsible for the production and improvement of the parts. In this case, not only could we decrease production cost, the production speed is also improved. Right now, the Fishbone base can produce up to 80 sets of kinetic skeletons a month which doubled our previous production!"</br>
</br>
"Great!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was ecstatic as he hugged Sun Jiao and gave her a passionate kiss.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
Although her mouth said no, her body was honest.</br>
</br>
After escaping Jiang Chen’s hug, Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at him, organized her slightly messy hair, and returned to her previous seriousness.</br>
</br>
Realizing the inappropriate timing of his action, Jiang Chen coughed and got back on track.</br>
</br>
"Set aside 100 kinetic skeletons, I have other uses. The rest will be prioritized to the force stationed at Zhufeng Highway, I have a sense this is not the end of the mutated humans."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao also looked concerned as she cautiously said.</br>
</br>
"I hold the same opinion. The mutated humans have not reacted which is abnormal. Once March comes, their advantage of cold resistance would no longer exist. Also, the Dusk Church has no reason to give up on &lt;Project Garden of Eden&gt;… And, Sun Xiaorou is still in our hands." When Sun Jiao mentioned her sister, she seemed to have deflated slightly.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's depressed mood made Jiang Chen feel a strong sense of guilt.</br>
</br>
"No, you don’t need to apologize, you didn’t make any mistakes. Or rather, the fact that you can forgive her being an assassin is already a way of repaying." After pecking on Jiang Chen’s lips, Sun Jiao said sternly while staring into his eyes.</br>
</br>
[Is this the logic of the apocalypse?] When Jiang Chen committed the action while enraged, he was unable to forgive himself.</br>
</br>
Since Sun Xiaorou was his sister-in-law.</br>
</br>
He didn’t know if the apocalypse had this type of ethical concept or not.</br>
</br>
"I will destroy the Dusk for you," Jiang Chen promised.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Sun Jiao smiled sincerely.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 263: Sixth Street Nuclear Nonproliferation</br>
</div></br>
For the past few months, the development of the apocalypse was stable and consistent.</br>
</br>
The streets of the Sixth Street no longer showed signs of the civil war. The radiation level in the Inner Circle also returned to normal. To prevent similar events from occurring, Chu Nan ordered the Sixth Street’s soldiers to confiscate all tactical nukes at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Most of the tactical nukes were dug out from the ruins. Even with the possession of advanced technology, in an ever-changing battlefield, the normally never dysfunctional technology may not be entirely reliable.</br>
</br>
While the World Alliance Organization did some recycling of these dangerous goods, a lot of nukes were still dispersed in the hands of ordinary survivors. Followed by the disbanding of the World Alliance Organization, this recycling plan was completely shut down.</br>
</br>
The dysfunctional nukes only required some small modifications to take out the nuclear material before it can be made into a simple nuclear bomb.</br>
</br>
Even in the ruins of the civilization caused by nukes, nuclear weapon remains an effective killing method.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, Chu Nan has his ways in politics. After the nuclear non-proliferation was enacted, the force with detector did a carpet search of the entire Sixth Street. It only took three days to confiscate all tactical nukes.</br>
</br>
For the people that handed in the weapon themselves, the Sixth Street military government compensated at them with a price equivalent to market value. For the people who went against the act, they were deported permanently.</br>
</br>
Not that there was no resistance, but since only a few held nuclear weapons, the military government that stabilized the situation put out a strong attitude from the beginning to maintain the suppressive regime. Those resisting voices didn’t manage to form into anything meaningful before they all vanished.</br>
</br>
In the option of dying together versus compromise, almost none chose the former one.</br>
</br>
On the other side, under the order of Jiang Chen, Fishbone base formed an aerospace department with Jiang Lin taking charge of development and enhancement of space technology. This gesture was to complete the promise Jiang Chen gave to Jiang Lin about investing in his space dream.</br>
</br>
Of course, a dream must consider reality. For now, the aerospace department’s primary task was not to design the who-knew-when-it-will-be-completed engine, but rather a missile capable of equipping nuclear material as a deterrence to the electromagnetic cannon of Liuding.</br>
</br>
According to what Sun Jiao said, Fishbone base has currently set up five missile launchers in Qingpu and also deployed five W-1 ballistic missiles with nuclear material. The nuclear material was confiscated, and Jiang Lin completed the design of the W-1 ballistic missile.</br>
</br>
The missile’s power parts used the booster of small civil rockets while the surface of the missile was covered with an anti-laser painting.</br>
</br>
</br>
From a technical perspective, compared to the Disaster-32 missile that represented the technology peak of the pre-war military industry, the W-1 designed and manufactured by the Fishbone base had quite a significant discrepancy in not only anti-interception and accuracy, but it was enough to deter Liuding town.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After listening to Sun Jiao’s report, Jiang Chen went to the community center in the base and found Wang Qin, he took out 100 sets of kinetic skeletons and four hundred rounds of reaper rifles using 7.62 bullets, as well hundreds of heat sensor grenades. He moved everything to the warehouse behind the mansion's garden.</br>
</br>
These firearms will be transported back to the modern world where it will be used in the near future.</br>
</br>
Other than these firearms, Jiang Chen also assigned Wang Qin the task to place an order to the Sixth Street military factory to manufacture 20 anti-tank RPGs as well as 500 more heat sensor grenades.</br>
</br>
With these military supplies, he was a mobile armory.</br>
</br>
After combining this with the 100 people mercenary base in Niger, without exaggeration, Jiang Chen was capable of starting a small scale modern warfare.</br>
</br>
After the war preparation was completed, Jiang Chen went to Lin Lin’s lab.</br>
</br>
He had a lot of questions about the weird video.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Oh, the pervert is back?" The door opened, and Lin Lin simply spoke out of habit.</br>
</br>
Silver hair, red and black pupil, and the odd fashion sense of white shirt with the white lab coat. The adorable face was always ruined by the unrestrained comments.</br>
</br>
Being used to her bad mouth, Jiang Chen ignored her greeting as she put the mango pudding on the table.</br>
</br>
Seeing her favorite pudding, Lin Lin subconsciously began to slurp her saliva as her eyes shone with excitement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn’t help but smile at Lin Lin who was easily satisfied by a few puddings.</br>
</br>
"Eat it later, I have something to ask you."</br>
</br>
After rubbing the pudding box on her chest, she wiped the drool from her mouth, and reluctantly put the pudding aside.</br>
</br>
"Speak your mind."</br>
</br>
"When we video chatted yesterday, did you see something weird?"</br>
</br>
"Something weird?" Lin Lin titled her head as she looked at Jiang Chen, puzzled, "I remember you hung up midway, then I went to sleep."</br>
</br>
"Is that so."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed the side of the EP as the memory chip popped out.</br>
</br>
"I didn’t hang up… How should I explain this? It was as if the television program had some weird news being played in the middle of it."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was lost, she took the chip from Jiang Chen’s hand.</br>
</br>
"That’s impossible? The fourth dimension messenger is based on the resonance of the Klein particles as the central design philosophy. Based on the theory, this type of special wave crossing the fourth dimension can only be passed along from the chip made out of the same crystal…"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin mumbled some strange theory as she inserted the chip into the full sensory computer.</br>
</br>
Light blue particles floated up as they instantly created a two-dimensional picture.</br>
</br>
"The video is two dimensional, the picture quality is three dimensional, and the size is only 52 kilobytes… Did it get compressed?" After pressing a few times on the hologram screen, Lin Lin replayed the video Jiang Chen saw last night.</br>
</br>
The hologram screen began to shake, and after a period of blurry whiteness, the strange figure appeared again.</br>
</br>
&lt;Hello&gt;</br>
</br>
For some reason, after seeing this "person" with only an outline, Jiang Chen felt an unnatural discomfort.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he realized where this feeling was coming from.</br>
</br>
"Uncanny valley effect." Seeing the hand waving rhythmically, Jiang Chen mustered to himself.</br>
</br>
Originated from the fear of death, humans would instinctively fear repulsive things similar to the human, but not the human.</br>
</br>
"Uncanny valley effect? 100% humans are a bothersome creature." Lin Lin’s digitalized eyes slightly contracted as she began to analyze the details of the video.</br>
</br>
But as she analyzed, her expression became more and more stern.</br>
</br>
Seeing Lin Lin repetitively playing the video, Jiang Chen was just about to ask why she was doing so, when Lin Lin closed the video.</br>
</br>
She let out a long sigh, wiped off the sweat from her forehead and looked at Jiang Chen with a very rare and serious expression.</br>
</br>
"I have finished analyzing the video… Before telling you the result, can I ask a question?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"When did your world’s history start to become weird?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 264"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 264: Communication with the Past</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was an odd question to ask.</br>
</br>
From Jiang Chen’s perspective, the history of this world was strange no matter how long he looked at it.</br>
</br>
Hua reached an agreement with the surrounding countries to form the Pan-Pacific Alliance that included 60% of the world’s population. The resulting alliance would compete head-to-head with NATO and CCCP.</br>
</br>
For someone like Jiang Chen who would occasionally read the news and keep an eye on current political events, it was a plausible scenario.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps it was the Soviet’s collapse?" Jiang Chen thought for a moment, "I remember it was in 1991. In our world, the Soviet was only less than 70 years old."</br>
</br>
Because of the short-lived two extreme opposites, it didn’t trigger the tension which caused the resulting Third World War. Jiang Chen was not a historian, it was his best guess of the situation.</br>
</br>
"The Soviet collapsed? That’s hard to imagine…" Lin Lin pressed her chin as she frowned.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, did we go off topic?" Jiang Chen coughed and said gently.</br>
</br>
"No," Lin Lin shook her head, "Do you know how the crystal is formed?"</br>
</br>
"The biological crystallization that formed in mutants and some zombies?" Jiang Chen didn’t know why her thought jumped to this common knowledge.</br>
</br>
"That’s right; the crystal is a form of biological crystallization," Lin Lin nodded, "Based on the theory proposed by Doctor Klein in 2132 through his experiment, every conscious, carbon-based creature possess Klein particles in their body. But normally speaking, the energy level is usually stable and in meager quantity."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard that every living creature possessed Klein particle, he subconsciously touched the back of his head.</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry, not every creature would grow those kinds of "tumors". Unless it was an uncontrolled mutation which forces the area that stores the Klein particles to change, then crystals will not form. The stable energy must be agitated to become unstable. Under normal circumstance, creatures with crystals would more easily survive through natural selection. Therefore the mutants that walked out of the nuclear craters would normally possess crystals," Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen’s action and mocked.</br>
</br>
"Based on dissection experiments, Klein particles would normally be stored in the brain."</br>
</br>
When she talked about this point, Lin Lin stopped and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Hypothetically… I am saying hypothetically if there is a person, the Klein particle concentration in the back of its head would be much higher than normal people. Although crystals had yet to form, the Klein particle concentration was infinitely approaching the threshold value that would create the crystal. Although the probability of this type of genetic mutation is extremely low, with the population base of billions, it could theoretically exist."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Through a kind of induction effect, just like magnets could magnetize metal, this would allow his brain to receive a signal from other timelines. He would be like an old antenna. Although he didn’t possess the ability to send out signals, he could passively receive signals from other broadcasting waves. Normally speaking, this signal could only come from the future!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s expression also became sterner, but then he quickly discovered something that didn’t add up.</br>
</br>
"Antenna? That’s not right… The brain is not a decoder after all. Even if there is an antenna in the brain, the brain could not decode the electromagnetic wave into a video message."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Theoretically it is possible. The area where the Klein particles are stored is part of the brain after all. If the person receiving the signal happened to be sleeping, this would allow the special wave of Klein particles to be translated into a dream which would allow the person receiving the signal to 'see'."</br>
</br>
"The broadcasting of high energy special waves to the past in the fourth dimension was something that was done in the past, but because it was impossible to pinpoint the fourth-dimensional coordinates, the broadcasting was meaningless…There was no point in sending the signal billions of years back. In the end, with the consideration of the butterfly effect that could cause an uncontrollable effect on the "present" the experiment was halted. The more advanced the technology, the more likely human play themselves to death."</br>
</br>
When she spoke of this point, Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen who was speechlessness.</br>
</br>
"But by the looks now, the concern was extraneous."</br>
</br>
The "ancient" Jiang Chen was standing in front her. The interfered "past" would not cause any effect on the "present" now, it was just from the time point where history interfered that a parallel timeline to the "present" evolved.</br>
</br>
"Time travel, excluding you as an exception I can’t explain, without the help of wormhole, even with the entire effort of a civilization, it would still not be possible to send a single particle of sand from the present to the past."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin took out the memory chip from the full sensory computer.</br>
</br>
"The cost of sending tangible mass to another point on the timeline is too expensive. Also, what if intangible material without mass was being sent? The signal with only 52kb of information could have been done with the technology from before the war. Plus, there's also the trouble of pinpointing where the signal will be sent…"</br>
</br>
As she spoke, Lin Lin put the EP chip back into Jiang Chen’s hand. She looked at him with a serious expression.</br>
</br>
"What if, someone received the information from the "future", what would he do with it?"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
What would someone do if they received the signal from the future?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left Lin Lin’s room, he had been thinking about this question.</br>
</br>
But as to what someone would do, it would depend on the information sent from the future?</br>
</br>
If it were the winning lottery number for the next day, then that person would obviously buy the lottery. But the people from the future would not be bored enough to remember the winning lottery of the particular date to send the information back with such a tremendous cost.</br>
</br>
"Change the future?" Jiang Chen mustered to himself as he went to his bedroom and lied down on the bed.</br>
</br>
If CCCP and PAC didn’t exist, could they have avoided the Third World War that occurred in 2171?</br>
</br>
But from the looks of it now, the person that sent the signal back was doing futile work.</br>
</br>
This world didn’t change.</br>
</br>
What changed was a parallel universe.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen thought about this, he initiated interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
The scenery in front of his eyes changed. The sunshine outside of the window instantly became graceful.</br>
</br>
It was noon already, Ayesha had already got up at this time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed open the bedroom door and walked into the living room.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen walk over, Ayesha who was flipping through fashion magazines on the sofa got up and greeted him.</br>
</br>
"Someone came to find you."</br>
</br>
"Someone came to find me? Who?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said while he stretched his body.</br>
</br>
"He referred to himself as Mr. Chen. He called our room from the front desk."</br>
</br>
Mr. Chen?</br>
</br>
Seemed to be Robert’s business partner at Los Santos with some influence in Xiangjiang. On the way to Xiangjiang, Mr. Chen had helped him a lot.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen certainly had great impressions of him.</br>
</br>
"What about now? Where is he?"</br>
</br>
"I told him you were still sleeping. He asked to notify you after you woke up that he is waiting for you at the first-floor restaurant," Ayesha said gently.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 265: Mr. Chen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had temporarily put aside the questions regarding the mysterious video. Regardless if the external circumstances, caused the history of his world to diverge from the wasteland’s, the fact is, it already happened and had nothing to do with him.</br>
</br>
Or rather, from his perspective, the history of the wasteland was more peculiar.</br>
</br>
He walked out of the room alone and headed downstairs.</br>
</br>
It was already noon. Most of the customers at the hotel were enjoying lunch at the Felix restaurant on the 28th floor. Before the three o’clock afternoon tea began, the first-floor hall was empty.</br>
</br>
When he came to the grand hall, he immediately saw Mr. Chen, who was sitting at the restaurant.</br>
</br>
Chen Wei, a renowned businessman of Xiangjiang, had a focus on the entertainment and real estate market. He was the majority shareholder of Nanfeng Real Estate and Nanfeng Entertainment companies, with a personal net worth of over ten billion.</br>
</br>
In a black suit with a kind face, he had a slight dogmatic vibe, similar to that of a ruthless leader. Although he was well into his midlife, his dark hair had no signs of balding.</br>
</br>
Just from his appearance, Mr. Chen looked like a decent businessman. But Jiang Chen knew too well that anyone who did business with Robert was nowhere in being decent.</br>
</br>
Standing behind him was a bodyguard also in a suit with a pair of shades over his eyes.</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen walking over, Mr. Chen stood up courteously and greeted him with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I have long heard Mr. Jiang’s name. Now that I finally have the chance to meet you, Mr. Jiang is indeed a stellar individual."</br>
</br>
"Mr. Chen is flattering me. Regarding the boat, I have to thank you for that," Jiang Chen humbly replied.</br>
</br>
"Haha, that is nothing at all. Please sit down…"</br>
</br>
After some brief small talk, Jiang Chen sat down with Chen Wei’s warm welcome.</br>
</br>
"Why did Mr. Chen want to see me?" Jiang Chen smiled at Mr. Chen as he comfortably sat on the chair.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Mr. Jiang is certainly a businessman. Decisive and clear in your actions." Chen Wei leaned against his chair and laughed. "Then I will be straightforward as well. I heard that Mr. Jiang’s Future Technology had some small conflicts with Wanghai City’s local government?"</br>
</br>
When he asked this question, Jiang Chen clearly sensed that Chen Wei was testing him.</br>
</br>
"Future Technology is only a normal tech company, how would we have conflicts with the local government," Jiang Chen replied without much emotion.</br>
</br>
If word spreads on the streets, it certainly would negatively impact its reputations.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I sometimes don’t think before I speak," Chen Wei realized that he was too direct and apologized while laughing.</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
"I heard rumors that Future Technology plans to relocate its headquarter. Did Mr. Jiang ever considered Xiangjiang as a destination?" Chen Wei asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
Relocate to Xiangjiang?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was somewhat skeptical. He looked at Chen Wei.</br>
</br>
Although he certainly considered establishing Future Technology’s Greater Hua headquarter in Xiangjiang before, he didn’t understand why Chen Wei would bring this up.</br>
</br>
As if he had understood the confusion apparent on Jiang Chen’s face, Chen Wei smiled and waved his hand at his bodyguard/assistant. He took a piece of a document from his hands.</br>
</br>
"Because of my relationship with the director of economic development bureau, Su Changyin, the reason for my disturbance this time is at the request of my old friend."</br>
</br>
As Chen Wei spoke, he handed the document to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen briefly scanned the document as an interested expression surfaced on his face.</br>
</br>
One year tax-free, three years tax of only half taxable. The generous offer was countless times better than the policy given by Wanghai City’s local government. With the current profitability of Future Technology, the policy of one-year tax-free would save Jiang Chen four billion RMB in tax.</br>
</br>
Also, with the consideration of the headquarter relocation, some of the employees would also need to be relocated. Xiangjiang government also provided a generous employee immigration policy to Future Technology. They provided one hundred allocations of mainland residency to convert to Xiangjiang residency to ease Future Technology’s employee's relocation.</br>
</br>
Seeing the interest on Jiang Chen’s face, Chen Wei also had a smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Is the policy given by my old friend enough to please Mr. Jiang?"</br>
</br>
"Extremely pleased. I just don’t know if the Xiangjiang government would maintain fair and just in policymaking?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly as he flipped through the document in his hands.</br>
</br>
Chen Wei first paused for a moment as he heard the words before he started to laugh.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, you are worrying too much. I can’t promise anything else. But on the point of being fair and just, that I can guarantee. Xiangjiang is not as complicated as Wanghai City. Everything must follow the law here."</br>
</br>
Fair and just? The law?</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen's expression did not change, he had a differing opinion.</br>
</br>
The world knew about Xiangjiang’s renowned gang presence. Chen Wei himself was probably not a law-abiding citizen. How many decent businessmen could open an entertainment company in Xiangjiang.</br>
</br>
But even so, Jiang Chen was extremely pleased with Xiangjiang government’s attitude.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? That’s perfect then." Jiang Chen grinned as he put the document on the table, "Regarding this investment plan, I am pleased. If all the terms in the plan can be followed through, I can say with confidence that Future Technology’s Greater Hua headquarters will be located in Xiangjiang."</br>
</br>
A trace of joy flashed across Chen Wei’s face as he congratulated, "Haha, then on behalf of my old friend, I here welcome Mr. Jiang’s presence in Xiangjiang."</br>
</br>
To Chen Wei’s words, Jiang Chen accepted with humility.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, to relocate to Xiangjiang, does Mr. Jiang have any plans regarding the location of the new headquarter of Future Technology?"</br>
</br>
When he recalled Chen Wei’s identity, Jiang Chen finally understood the intention behind his visit.</br>
</br>
"Currently no, does Mr. Chen have any good recommendations?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Haha, then I will be straightforward." Chen Wei didn’t hide his intention as he had seen from Jiang Chen’s expression that he already guessed the reason for his visit. He took another document from his bodyguard’s hands.</br>
</br>
"Nanfeng Real Estate has a recently developed office building. It is located in Kowloon near the metro station and a comprehensive set of amenities are included. Is Mr. Jiang interested?" Chen Wei smiled.</br>
</br>
He took over the document from Chen Wei’s hand as he flipped through the specifications.</br>
</br>
All in all, he was pleased. Compared to the building in Wanghai, Nanfeng Real Estate’s building was better in both appearance and amenities.</br>
</br>
"What’s the price?"</br>
</br>
"Two billion HKD, or equivalent to 1.65 billion RMB," Chen Wei said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave it a thought before nodding.</br>
</br>
"This is a reasonable price and I am pleased with the building. As to the acquisition process, I will leave it to the professionals in the company to take care of."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen nod, Chen Wei felt relieved as he had a trace of gratitude in his expression.</br>
</br>
"Thank you very much."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The Xiangjiang real estate market was not too hot right now. Although the price remained elevated, the number of sales was gradually decreasing and has recently hit a new low of 17 per month. What made it even worse was that Li Jiacheng, who had single-handedly pushed the Xiangjiang real estate market to its peak, had begun to sell his real estate assets for cash.</br>
</br>
The perpetrator of this has already smelled a dangerous signal. How would the other real estate developers not sense it?</br>
</br>
Once the interest rate returns to normal, the Xiangjiang real estate market would face immense pressure, the possibility of the "freefall" in 1997 was not out of the realm of possibility.</br>
</br>
The bubble created by the insane construction of buildings put the cash flow of all real estate developers in an extremely tight situation, Nanfeng real estate was no exception.</br>
</br>
The office building located in Kowloon had a cost of 1.2 billion HKD, typically speaking, a fair price would be three billion. But for Chen Wei who needed the money to alleviate the pressure on cash flow, he could not wait any longer.</br>
</br>
Granted, he was not a decent businessman, but with the legal system and its implementation becoming perfected by the day, most of his businesses have been transformed into legal ones.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen buying this building definitely gave him some breathing room.</br>
</br>
With the deal being successful, Chen Wei was naturally ecstatic as he warmly invited Jiang Chen for lunch.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t reject the proposal as they went along to the Felix restaurant on the 28th floor.</br>
</br>
On the dinner table, the two chatted and joked about their encounters around the world.</br>
</br>
"How is Robert doing?" As they chatted, the conversation turned to Robert.</br>
</br>
"The same old. He has transitioned his business already. The way he described it was playing with Hollywood girls. Did he not tell you?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I left the industry earlier than him and became legal five years ago. I didn’t imagine that the lunatic that dared to sell anything also left the game," Chen Wei exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Lunatic? Haha, a fitting name for that guy. Five months ago, he was caught by the IS in Iraq and almost had his head chopped off.</br>
</br>
"Iraq. He certainly has the guts. Speaking of this, how did you two meet?" Chen Wei asked curiously.</br>
</br>
Regardless of which perspective, Jiang Chen was a law-abiding businessman, he shouldn’t have the opportunity to meet the smuggling middlemen.</br>
</br>
"We met in Iraq, I saved his life." Because there was nothing to hide, Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
Chen Wei was confused at first before he started laughing and raised his wine glass.</br>
</br>
"How disrespectable of me. I thought Mr. Jiang was a law-abiding businessman, but Mr. Jiang has a secretive side too. Cheers."</br>
</br>
To be able to save someone from the hands of the IS, he must have had some connections with the hidden international mercenary groups. The security companies on the surface would usually not take any tasks that would endanger their own lives.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he thought about this, Chen Wei couldn’t help but exclaim in his mind, he underestimated this guy.</br>
</br>
But he still underestimated Jiang Chen. He couldn’t fathom that it was not the mercenaries that saved Robert, but Jiang Chen alone.</br>
</br>
"You are over complimenting me," Jiang Chen said humbly.</br>
</br>
"Did he stop because of the IS?"</br>
</br>
"Not exactly. Mostly because the FBA had an eye on him. He was rather unlucky because it was the FBA’s ploy that led to him being captured by the IS."</br>
</br>
"FBA… True, if the government decided to intervene, then he must exit the industry," Chen Wei exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Chen’s transition also the result of the government?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. But it was not the FBA. It was because of the mainland's General Staff Department." Chen Wei grinned.</br>
</br>
General Staff Department? Jiang Chen’s expression was rather odd.</br>
</br>
"Could the General Staff Department extend its influence here?’ Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No, as long as you are not too overzealous. However, I was in Guangzhou at that time." Chen Wei paused and looked at Jiang Chen. "Speaking of this, you had some conflicts with the Wang family in Wanghai City?"</br>
</br>
"It is not wrong to say that." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
When Chen Wei heard this, he nodded.</br>
</br>
"It is fine to get into conflict with the Wang family as most of their influence remains in Wanghai City. But definitely don’t offend anyone above them, unless you plan to completely abandon your assets in Hua." In the last sentence, Chen Wei’s tone began to sound melancholic.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was something he personally experienced, or experienced by his friends who didn't have the cleanest history.</br>
</br>
To his words of advice, Jiang Chen only nodded and didn’t say anything else.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The two days of relaxing were over. Even Jiang Chen, who hasn't been involved with the company for awhile, began dealing with tasks related to the company.</br>
</br>
Although with the help of Xia Shiyu, his workload was lighter. But there were quite a few things that he still must personally do.</br>
</br>
First, Future International incorporated in New Zealand with Jiang Chen as the sole shareholder.</br>
</br>
The advantage of an offshore company in New Zealand was that as long as the profit is not generated locally, the only fee that must be paid per year was the annual fee. It was legal to submit zero tax without the need for an audit, and the subsequent steps were much more manageable. The only downside being the registration fee was a bit higher compared to registering in Xiangjiang, but the annual fee was similar for both areas.</br>
</br>
As the parent company, Future International quickly gained control of 99% of the shares of Future Technology. From now on, Future Technology became a subsidiary of Future International with CEO Xia Shiyu leading the company.</br>
</br>
At the same time, with Xia Shiyu’s recommendation, Future Technology divided its market geographically to Greater Hua, Southeast Asia, Russia, European Union, Arabic, North UA and South UA. A subsidiary was formed in each of the geographical areas to operate in each business market.</br>
</br>
Of course, this business transition created a massive workload that caused a shortage of talent at Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s solution was simple, it was to buy with money.</br>
</br>
High salary, great benefits, and hiring headhunters to search for talent all over the world and create a company of talent with money. With Future Technology’s low cost and high profits, the investment was negligible to the company.</br>
</br>
To the technical talents, working at Future Technology was an attractive option to begin with. The talent acquisition was completed without much hindrance.</br>
</br>
After this was completed, Future Technology’s Greater Hua headquarters was relocated to Xiangjiang under the direction of Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
From this point on, Future Technology’s tax revenue of no less than two billion per year would say goodbye to Wanghai City’s local government.</br>
</br>
Although Wang Dehai had personally called Jiang Chen to reservedly but sincerely express his apology in the hopes of him staying, Jiang Chen’s attitude didn’t change at all.</br>
</br>
The proverb goes, you only realize what’s valuable when it's gone.</br>
</br>
The moment that the Wang family no longer viewed Future Technology as a partner but rather a piece of juicy meat, he should have considered that this day would come.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 267: The Angry Wang Dehai</br>
</div></br>
In Wanghai City hundreds of kilometers away, Wang Dehai sat behind the office table with a grave expression on his face.</br>
</br>
There were two English newspapers on the table. One was a &lt;New York Post&gt;, the other was the &lt;Time Digest&gt;.</br>
</br>
The two newspapers were both flipped to the business section. Although the two newspapers were completely different, the headlines printed almost identical information.</br>
</br>
Future International Incorporated, the secret that led to its departure from Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen had purposely avoided the reporters who swarmed him like flies with their cameras raised high during his time in Xiangjiang, nothing is kept hidden forever as major presses dug out leads from different channels to find the secret behind Future Technology’s relocation.</br>
</br>
Linhua Group attempted to use the local government’s relationship, with the stake of suppressing its business in Hua, to forcefully acquire a controlling stake in Future Technology. Future Technology earned the central government’s support because of an undisclosed reason, but Jiang Chen who was already divided from the Wang family chose to leave because of the lack of trust in the Wanghai City local government.</br>
</br>
The domestic presses were okay as their mouths were naturally shut due to the company's influence. Although the policy of official relatives not permitted to be in business was only limited to spouse and children, it would still reveal a negative image if the news were to be published.</br>
</br>
While the domestic media could be controlled, Wang Dehai couldn’t do anything to the international press.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, it was hard to listen to the buzz outside anyways.</br>
</br>
Since it has almost become "politically correct" for western media to criticize the country's policy on certain issues, to the fact that Future Technology’s investment value had always drawn the craving of the Wall Street capitals, all the major international press conducted an extensive investigation on this event.</br>
</br>
Particularly &lt;New York Post&gt;, the satire between the lines was especially evident. The lines of English almost gave the enraged Wang Dehai a heart attack.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua stood in front of his office, the old fox’s expression looked awkward.</br>
</br>
A month ago, Wang Linhua had promised his brother Wang Dehai that as long as he pressured Jiang Chen, Jiang Chen without any background would immediately recognize the situation and obediently give up Future Technology’s share, allowing the Wang family's assets to successfully leave the real estate market.</br>
</br>
But by the looks of it now, the promise fell through.</br>
</br>
"How many times did I tell you, don’t corner him to the wall. Now that he has left, what did you get out of it?" Wang Dehai’s finger pressed forcefully on the newspapers as his lips trembled in anger.</br>
</br>
</br>
Seeing that his brother was so furious, Wang Linhua’s expression remained awkward.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, Dehai, it was not me that pressured him too hard, that guy did not recognize the situation at all. He didn’t understand that a shared interest would create a better business. To be honest, a market cap of ten billion, five billion for 50% of the shares was a generous offer. How many tech companies would kill to acquire venture capitals and equity infusions-"</br>
</br>
"Bullsh*t!"</br>
</br>
Perhaps because Wang Dehai had received pressured from the central government on this incident, Wang Dehai had lost his cool and he cursed at his younger brother.</br>
</br>
"Market cap of ten billion? Future Technology’s profit is above ten billion, with a P/E ratio of 20 times, calculate the market cap for me? Do you know what the old guy from the Liu family told me? I will gift these words to you, those embarrassing actions will be the end of us!"</br>
</br>
It indeed didn’t sound eloquent at all. Wang Dehai’s emotion was also enraged when he said it as it made his chest pump violently.</br>
</br>
"I am being considerate of the Wang family's assets. Especially since the tech company’s market cap can’t be calculated this way. Future Technology is highly profitable now, but they only managed to do so because they formed a monopoly. With the rapid pace of technological transformations, once a similar artificial intelligence system exists, or phone enhancement programs are introduced, it would be impossible to maintain their current profitability levels," Wang Linhua argued for his own perspective.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua’s perspective was certainly not without reason. People were willing to spend 10 RMB a month to upgrade to VIP1, which was for the phone enhancement function as well as a battery saver. Once a free replacement is introduced, even if the functionality was weaker compared to Future 1.0, it was not hard to believe some users would choose the free app.</br>
</br>
With the rapidly changing landscape of technology, in his view, it was entirely possible.</br>
</br>
But what he didn’t know as an outsider to the industry was that all the major tech companies had lost countless brain cells trying to crack the encryption technology of Future 1.0 and could not break a single function of Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the investors were very interested in Future Technology.</br>
</br>
To Wang Linhua’s explanation, Wang Dehai was clearly not pleased. But since he already yelled at him, he let out some of his anger. And based on the consideration that Wang Linhua was not wholly to be blamed as he was the person who agreed to this, Wang Dehai took a deep breath and put that aside for now.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Wang Dehai’s expression became more relaxed, Wang Linhua also felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Wang Dehai picked up the teacup from the table as he soothed his throat. "Let’s not talk about this, for now. You mentioned the transitioning of Linhua Group, how is that going?"</br>
</br>
Since the conflict had already occurred, it was pointless to be angry about it. Compared to Future Technology, Wang Dehai was more worried about the Wang family’s assets. As the general secretary of Wanghai City, he certainly knew the dire circumstance Linhua Group was in.</br>
</br>
It was fair to say, the reason that Linhua Group could acquire bank loans was partially attributable to Wang Dehai’s reputation.</br>
</br>
When he heard Wang Dehai ask about Linhua Group, a proud expression appeared.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I was about to bring some good news. We recently received a ten billion USD construction contract."</br>
</br>
"Ten billion?!" Even to Wang Dehai who had seen the ups and downs of life, he still exclaimed out of shock.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, and it is a contract from overseas!" With an ecstatic expression, Wang Linhua continued, "The contract has been signed with an expected direct profit of over five billion! The 110 square kilometers of land on the main island as well as the 70 square kilometers on a nearby island used as payment for part of the contract, could double in value in five years based on the potential of Pannu Islands! Without exaggeration, once we finish the deal, Linhua Group’s value could break one hundred billion RMB!"</br>
</br>
Wang Dehai finally nodded his head, pleased.</br>
</br>
Misfortune may be an actual blessing.</br>
</br>
Although the ten billion market cap of Future Technology had left Wanghai City, it created a Linhua Group with a one hundred billion market cup.</br>
</br>
The expansion into the international market had solved the dire situation the Wang family's assets had faced.</br>
</br>
Wang Dehai’s mood became a lot lighter.</br>
</br>
The only issue was if he could still laugh so brightly in a few months time.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 268: New Zealand Trip</br>
</div></br>
Beach, waves, bright sunshine, palm trees.</br>
</br>
And of course, the most important one, bikinis.</br>
</br>
Lying on the recliner with a pair of shades over his eyes, Jiang Chen gazed at the lively figures along the sea coast from afar with a smile on his face.</br>
</br>
When the saline wind breezed by, he felt all his weariness get blown away.</br>
</br>
Just as he relaxingly gazed into the horizon, his face felt a cold sensation.</br>
</br>
He turned his head as he saw a pair of crystal-like eyes staring at him cheerfully. Liu Yao stood beside him as she leaned forward and naughtily shook the cold orange juice in her hands.</br>
</br>
"Are you checking out hot girls again?" Liu Yao passed the chilled orange juice to Jiang Chen as she coyly pouted her lips.</br>
</br>
"I am checking one out right now." Jiang Chen laughed as he looked at Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
In a light yellow bikini, her pale skin was decorated with droplets of water as it shined in the sunlight.</br>
</br>
Blushing, the corners of her lips curled up as she said joyfully.</br>
</br>
"That’s better."</br>
</br>
Even if she knew they were flattering words, which woman actually disliked compliments?</br>
</br>
She put her own orange juice on the table and combed the hair in front of her forehead that was previously disturbed by the sea wind. Then in graceful steps, she lied on the recliner beside Jiang Chen. Consciously and subconsciously, she showed off her body, at which Jiang Chen couldn't help but laugh.</br>
</br>
However, speaking of this, Jiang Chen liked her for this very point.</br>
</br>
Jealous but never drilled on one thing. It wouldn’t make people feel annoyed, but rather fulfill the vanity of men. There are a lot of intelligent women in the modern world, but Jiang Chen had never met anyone else like her, someone intelligent but knew her own boundaries.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the orange juice and took a sip with the straw.</br>
</br>
The cold sensation in his throat instantly made the scorching heat fade away.</br>
</br>
As to why it was summer?</br>
</br>
The reason was simple. It was because they were in New Zealand in the southern hemisphere. New Zealand’s winter was between July and August, and right now it was the middle of January, the hottest time in New Zealand.</br>
</br>
The reason why he was here? Because one, he needed to register the offshore company, and two, the tasks at Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
Because Xia Shiyu had already arrived in Xiangjiang, the General Staff Department was obviously no longer responsible for her safety. Therefore, Jiang Chen had sent Ayesha to act as her bodyguard. Although no one should be plotting against him now, it was better to be safe.</br>
</br>
Because Ayesha couldn’t be with him, it was too lonely to travel abroad by himself. Therefore, Jiang Chen suddenly remembered that he still owed Liu Yao a vacation to Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
As to why he brought Liu Yao, it was to fulfill the promise of taking her on a vacation.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"How's the movie going?" Simultaneously enjoying the cold and delicious juice and her graceful figure, he asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"It’s going well, the filming will be done by March this year. Then it will be in production before it is sent in for review. If without exception, you can see me in theatres by August this year." Liu Yao turned her head as she laughed playfully.</br>
</br>
Like the movie &lt;That Year&gt; she stared in before, in this &lt;Ma Dongmei’s Trouble&gt;, she again played the role of the prom queen and the supporting actress. However, because Jiang Chen was the principal investor of the newest movie, the director forced the screenwriter to change the script to give her more screen time as the supporting actress but at the condition that it will not interfere with the movie's plot.</br>
</br>
She didn’t say anything about this, but she was grateful for what Jiang Chen had done for her. He could clearly feel it from the intimate and passionate re-encounter last night at the hotel.</br>
</br>
With a celebrity as a mistress, it was a dream come true.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Didn’t you play spoiler with me last night?" With Liu Yao impish look, Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
Last time during their intimate moment, Liu Yao perfected her role of "prom queen." While with just words she "denounced" Jiang Chen’s "invasion", and whispered her lines from the movie into Jiang Chen’s ear.</br>
</br>
All in all, the conquering feeling of a pure and innocent prom queen under him boosted his ego.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao blushed at Jiang Chen’s tease while she rolled her eyes at him.</br>
</br>
"It is a movie you invested in after all, are you not concerned about the box office?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to laugh as he put the orange juice aside and lied down sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"It is only one hundred million, I pay more than that a month in tax."</br>
</br>
An investment of one hundred million. Even with one billion at the box office, after paying for the 5% specialty movie fund, 3.3% in tax, and 5% cut to other channels, and splitting the rest between the investors and the movie theatres, Jiang Chen would only be left with three hundred to four hundred million.</br>
</br>
On top of that, it was rare for a domestic film to reach one billion at the box office.</br>
</br>
Compared to the profitability of Future Technology, that profit was nothing at all. Jiang Chen considered this investment as one purely for his enjoyment.</br>
</br>
Even if she knew Jiang Chen’s net worth, Liu Yao still couldn’t help but be shocked as she stuck out her tongue.</br>
</br>
"What do you think the box office is going to be?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I think… at least two hundred million or above? Since Chen Yanxi is the lead actress in the film, she has quite a number of followers." Liu Yao put her finger on her chin as she gave a conservative response.</br>
</br>
To one hundred million of investment, two hundred million of box office return was an acceptable result. Although Liu Yao had put her heart into shooting the film, and she certainly went through a lot of hardships to achieve her dream, the market doesn’t believe in sweat and tears.</br>
</br>
"Are you not confident?"</br>
</br>
"What, two hundred million is a great result." Liu Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
"I am not talking about the box office," Jiang Chen shook his head, smiled, and continued, "I am saying that are you not confident that you will overshadow the lead actress?"</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen’s words, Liu Yao’s face turned red. She picked up the orange juice on the table and took a sip with her red lips as she mumbled while biting her straw.</br>
</br>
"It is hard. With movies, fans have a lot to do with it."</br>
</br>
Although for someone like Jiang Chen who didn’t have an idea who played in the movies until the end credits, he had to admit with comedy films, the fans certainly have a significant impact on the box office.</br>
</br>
"That’s only part of the reason. Promotions also can achieve the same result." Jiang Chen shook his finger.</br>
</br>
With Future Technology’s user base, a simple promotion would instantly make her famous. As long as channels exist, fame was not a big problem at all.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao’s eyes instantly lit up.</br>
</br>
She turned around on her belly, with her hand pressed against her chin, and coyly looked at Jiang Chen with watery eyes.</br>
</br>
Her deep cleavage and beautiful curves, even if a battle had occurred last night, made Jiang Chen’s stomach feel heated.</br>
</br>
"Of course, it is a film I invested in after all," Jiang Chen looked away as he spoke.</br>
</br>
He was in swimming trunk, it would be awkward if he went hard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s reaction didn’t manage to escape Liu Yao’s sight. The little devil's lips proudly curled up as she maintained her position in the recliner and seductively untied her bikini from the back. Then with a sweet voice, "Honey~ I want to bathe under the sun, help me put on sunscreen."</br>
</br>
This little devil!</br>
</br>
As he cursed in his mind, Jiang Chen walked over with his body reacting honestly.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 269: Meeting the Oppositions</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xiangjiang. Shangyuan apartment building No. 5, on the 12th floor. This was Xia Shiyu’s new home.</br>
</br>
Because Future Technology's headquarters was relocated to Xiangjiang, after she had taken care of the relocation, she naturally followed as the CEO. For someone that always rented, it was convenient for her to move.</br>
</br>
It was eight at night.</br>
</br>
Just like her usual routine, Xia Shiyu sat on the sofa watching TV, but her expression looked uncomfortable. Usually, she didn’t like to wear a whole lot when she was home alone.</br>
</br>
But now, she was swearing as she had to wear her dress shirt and bothersome jeans.</br>
</br>
As to the reason, it was because she was not home alone.</br>
</br>
For Xia Shiyu’s safety, Jiang Chen had sent Ayesha to be her bodyguard.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had mixed emotions about Ayesha.</br>
</br>
That night, when Ayesha suddenly kissed Jiang Chen, Xia Shiyu felt her mind turn blank.</br>
</br>
Angry? Hard to say so because he was not her boyfriend. There was no reason for her to be angry. Frightened? Perhaps some. Jealous? Perhaps all the above.</br>
</br>
She knew he was outstanding, outstanding men never lacked pursuers. As someone who was slow with relationships, she had consistently tried to avoid the problem and continuously ignored the emotion she felt in her heart and left it for another day to deal with.</br>
</br>
But to the "enemy" Ayesha, she couldn’t hate her.</br>
</br>
Since she did save her and also suffered an injury as the result of it.</br>
</br>
Because of all the factors above, to the person that was living with her, she felt very conflicted.</br>
</br>
But on the contrary, Ayesha was somewhat more relaxed.</br>
</br>
Because the air conditioner was on, she wore a thin white shirt and her nicely shaped legs jogged on the treadmill.</br>
</br>
[My presence… She doesn’t mind it at all?]</br>
</br>
The picture on the TV began to blur as Xia Shiyu’s mind began to drift elsewhere.</br>
</br>
[To her, I should be considered competition. If she didn’t come to save me or had purposely been late for a few minutes…]</br>
</br>
While she maintained her expressionless face, Xia Shiyu unnaturally shivered.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel cold?" Ayesha looked over.</br>
</br>
"No, no," The sudden conversation had made Xia Shiyu jump as she hastily replied.</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded before she looked away.</br>
</br>
There was no more exchange of words between the two.</br>
</br>
Perhaps this is what it felt like when two people without a lot to say lived together. Ayesha would only speak more when she was alone with Jiang Chen, and Xia Shiyu would only communicate when it was necessary due to work.</br>
</br>
[I wonder how Jiang Chen is doing on that side…] As her eyes blankly stared at the TV, Xia Shiyu muttered in her mind.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
With a beautiful girl accompanying him, Jiang Chen had a relaxing two days.</br>
</br>
Although Liu Yao was not the best choice as a wife, she was impeccable as a mistress.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, although they were having fun, he didn’t forget the task he needed to complete. While he toured New Zealand with Liu Yao, he was also waiting for someone.</br>
</br>
Without incidence, that person should have already arrived in New Zealand and would contact him very soon.</br>
</br>
After they returned to hotel from the beach, Jiang Chen, who was teased for the entire day by Liu Yao couldn’t wait to lock the door behind him. Liu Yao immediately leaned her body against his and kissed him…</br>
</br>
The action lasted from nine at night till midnight before Jiang Chen finally spared the "pleading Liu Yao" who fell asleep with her body in his arms.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen woke up from a dream,</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the Old John coffee shop at the corner of a street in Auckland.</br>
</br>
The old wooden interior filled the place with a historic vibe. However, the decor evidently did not bring about good business. Compared to the Starbucks on the next street, this place was desolated.</br>
</br>
But because of the quietness, Jiang Chen chose here as the meeting place.</br>
</br>
The waitress at the front desk looked like an international student from the nearby university. Her looks were average, but her voice was sweet. When she saw her fellow countrymen Jiang Chen, she didn’t seem too surprised. There was a lot of Han citizens in Auckland, especially immigrants or tourists.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ordered two mochas from her before he went to the deep corner of the coffee shop and began to play with his phone to kill time.</br>
</br>
Not long after, a man wearing a simple T-shirt sat in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Sorry for making you wait so long," the man who sat across him said with an apologetic tone.</br>
</br>
"It’s okay, it is not easy for you." Jiang Chen put away his phone as he looked up at the man in front of him. He examined him from head to toe, "Han?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. Zhang Yapin. I am meeting you as a representative of the Pannu Freedom Party." Zhang Yapin nodded and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands’ native only accounted for a small percentage of its population. The rest was made up by the initial European immigrants and the subsequent Asian immigrants. There was certainly some Han among the mix. With the consideration for Jiang Chen’s identity, after an internal discussion, they sent Zhang Yapin. A person with Han heritage to discuss business with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen. Although you already know my name." Jiang Chen shook his hand and smiled.</br>
</br>
The Liberal party was the most significant opposing party of the Pannu Islands. Although they were considered the most significant opposing party, their actual situation was not too great, the primary reason was due to their lack of funding.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands was an impoverished nation. There was no oil in the surrounding central area. The economy was isolated with an outdated infrastructure, and the high cost of development meant that the small country, without a vote in the United Nations, was forgotten in the international society.</br>
</br>
No one had any interest in it. Even if the Liberal party’s political ideology was more pro-western than the Syrian opposition party, the UA clearly does not pay enough attention to the "poor little guy."</br>
</br>
Only when the country meets UA's national interest would they intervene in other people’s politics. This point alone was demonstrated through the double standard with its policy in Syria and Veit.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin nodded as he looked earnestly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is supportive of our cause right?"</br>
</br>
"That’s right. In my perspective, any form of dictatorship is disdained. Whether it is a presidential dictatorship or corporate dictatorship, or a combination of the two," Jiang Chen simply improvised.</br>
</br>
He was a person with the least credentials to say such things. He was the biggest dictator at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was ecstatic when he heard Jiang Chen’s attitude.</br>
</br>
With the help of a businessman, it was much easier for the cause they support to come to fruition.</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Jiang willing to support our cause then?"</br>
</br>
"Support?" Jiang Chen dubiously took a sip of the coffee.</br>
</br>
"Of course, this is not without benefits. After our cause is successful, we’ll provide you with enough benefits," Zhang Yapin rushed to add.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 270: Military Resistance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There was no reason to wake up early unless there were benefits involved.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin knew that without enough benefits, even if Jiang Chen recognized their cause, it would be more of a verbal support rather than financial aid.</br>
</br>
Compared with the idealists within the organization, Zhang Yapin was a firm believer in the concept of there is no free lunch in the world.</br>
</br>
Only with enough potential gain could they tie the businessman onto their ship.</br>
</br>
Only if he knew that Johnny International was funded by Jiang Chen and a puppet created by Robert.</br>
</br>
"Benefits? For example?" Jiang Chen pretended to be interested. He put the coffee down and waited for Zhang Yapin to continue.</br>
</br>
"I heard that Mr. Jiang has 7000 square meters of warehouses on Pannu Islands, as well as an export company right?" Zhang Yapin took a deep breath as his fingers crossed. He spoke quite calmly and collectedly.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, it is not a secret." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
After he had acquired Xinlong Food Processing Plant, he urged Zheng Hongjie to acquire the rights for export and import. Then Jiang Chen created a shell company with only five employees at Pannu Islands and purchased warehouses totaling 7000 square meters to store goods.</br>
</br>
By moving goods from his left hand to his right hand, the company massively purchased canned food from Xinlong. At the same time ordering dairy and grain products from the farms in New Zealand and Australia. Parts of these goods were sold locally while other items were stored waiting for Jiang Chen to transport them back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
In Pannu Islands, Jiang Chen owned around one million USD in assets.</br>
</br>
"Since Mr. Jiang has invested in Pannu Islands, then it must mean you have confidence in Pannu Islands’ future, am I right?" Zhang Yapin gradually advanced his narrative.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. Perhaps you can get to your point," Jiang Chen leaned on his chair and said.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin scanned the coffee shop. When he saw that other than the two of them, there was only the waitress at the front desk playing with her phone, he proceeded with a mysterious tone.</br>
</br>
"We need around one million USD in support. This amount of money will be returned in the form of land to you after we successfully fulfill our political cause."</br>
</br>
"How big is the land?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"One square kilometer of land located on the Coro main island," Zhang Yapin said in pain.</br>
</br>
One square kilometer of land with a cost of one million? It was the equivalent of one dollar per square meter. It was beyond cheap. Almost to the point of being a form of reparation payment.</br>
</br>
But to this suggestion, Jiang Chen was still not pleased.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, although I feel sympathetic to the Pannu people’s situation, I am not interested in your proposal." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What! One dollar per square kilometer, this price is not-" Zhang Yapin stood up with his eyes widened.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand and quietly pointed to the front desk.</br>
</br>
The waitress at the front desk already stopped playing with her phone as she looked in their direction curiously.</br>
</br>
Realizing he was too emotional, Zhang Yapin immediately closed his mouth, took a deep breath and sat back down in his chair.</br>
</br>
Although they were in New Zealand, and not Pannu, it was better to keep sensitive political movements quiet.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Zhang Yapin had calmed down, Jiang Chen nodded, rather pleased.</br>
</br>
While the Liberal party was probably an organization formed by a few university students fighting passionately for the citizens, it was considered an amateur group both in size and professionalism. However, it indeed possessed investment value.</br>
</br>
Being young was okay. The founding father of Hua, Sun Zhongshan, was also young and he still managed to accomplish greater deeds before it benefited Yuan Shikai.</br>
</br>
"What is Mr. Jiang not pleased about? We can discuss," Zhang Yapin said sincerely.</br>
</br>
The waitress not far away saw that there was no more drama to watch, so she looked back down at the table and began to play with her phone again out of boredom.</br>
</br>
"First, my total investment value in Pannu Islands is only one million USD, and I am only prepared to invest this amount." Jiang Chen leaned in his chair as he smiled. "If Johnny International completes the development of Pannu Islands, the value of land would exponentially raise. Therefore, I don’t mind the profitability of my assets. I don’t know if you have noticed or not, but all my assets in Pannu Islands are operating at a loss."</br>
</br>
The average income of Pannu Islands was low. Therefore, buying power was limited. While they have a wealth of tourism, it would be an endless pit to develop all those resources.</br>
</br>
"That UA citizen is a scumbag. He is the bloodsucker riding on top of the Pannu people," Zhang Yapin cursed in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, but regardless if he is a scumbag or not, he is indeed rich, and spending for Pannu Islands." Jiang Chen smiled at Zhang Yapin and then paused before he continued, " Have you considered one problem?"</br>
</br>
"What problem?"</br>
</br>
"If Johnny International didn’t spend money investing in basic infrastructure and developing tourist resources, do you think the 7000 square meters of land has any upsides?" Jiang Chen said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was shocked as his face began to sour.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen was waiting for his land to appreciate, there was no reason for him to fund them to get rid of that UA citizen.</br>
</br>
From the start, Jiang Chen only said that he was compassionate of their cause, but he never suggested he would fund them for their cause.</br>
</br>
There was a difference between ideology and reality. Jiang Chen was only an outsider, he had no reason to pay the bills for Pannu’s suffering.</br>
</br>
"Then… we don’t have anything we can talk about." Zhang Yapin struggled to say. The smile on his face was bitter.</br>
</br>
The trip to New Zealand was futile.</br>
</br>
But just as he felt disappointed with the uncertain future, Jiang Chen lit up another lamp named hope in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
"It is the complete opposite." Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled. "I think we have a lot more we can talk about."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin’s eyes widened as he looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"But didn’t you say-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a sip of the already cooled coffee and said.</br>
</br>
"I am only saying your plan is not enough to attract me, but I never rejected the possibility of a partnership between us. For example, you can tell me, if you had one million in support, what would you do with it?"</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen ask about the specific plan of the Freedom party, Zhang Yapin realized that there may still be a turning point for this as he immediately raised his chest and spoke with confidence.</br>
</br>
"We will use this one million to develop members in the Pannu army. At the same time, we will organize citizens unjustly treated as well as farmers with their lands taken away from them to launch a strike and protest to force the current regime to compromise, punish the corrupted officials, and drive away the reckless Johnny International…" To the last bit, Zhang Yapin awkwardly stopped.</br>
</br>
If they drove away Johnny International, it didn’t seem to fit Jiang Chen’s interest.</br>
</br>
"If you get rid of Johnny International, then what?" Jiang Chen laughed. "Continue to live the poor life? Wait to find a new investor?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin shifted his gaze before he promised, "We can transfer Johnny International’s interest to you."</br>
</br>
When he heard the naïve response, Jiang Chen laughed and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Who do you think you are? The current regime? One million USD? Johnny International probably bribed the president more than just that amount! And you are thinking of buying the army? Stop dreaming. Your promise is only an empty promise, it can never be fulfilled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was cut throat.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin held his breath.</br>
</br>
He lowered his head as he slowly said.</br>
</br>
"Then in your opinion, what kind of partnership would you be satisfied with?"</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on Jiang Chen’s face. He was waiting for this sentence.</br>
</br>
"Strike? Protest? Those things won’t solve any problems, only the elected government would be fearful of public opinion. I can say with confidence that if the Freedom party still holds the unrealistic thought of solving problems politically, then only cruel suppression awaits you!"</br>
</br>
"Our president is elected," Zhang Yapin tried to rebuke.</br>
</br>
"But he has been corrupted!" Jiang Chen stared into his eyes as he used a manipulative tone.</br>
</br>
"He is not the president you elected from before."</br>
</br>
"If he, the scum called Edward, is in an election now, would you vote for him?"</br>
</br>
"Or, do you think he is willing to give up the interest in his hand now and participate in an election?"</br>
</br>
"Presidential republic? Face reality, it is a dictatorship right now!"</br>
</br>
"Vote, protest, those won’t save you. The only thing that will save you are bullets!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s words were like hammers as it swung directly into Zhang Yapin’s heart and shattered any remaining hope for the current regime. Before he joined the Liberal party, he was a top student who graduated from New Zealand’s Auckland University, the few that were educated on the Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
When he saw that the current regime had compromised with the foreign capital and worked together to suppress his fellow countrymen, he was furious.</br>
</br>
With passion, a few young people with different education backgrounds but the same ideology formed together to create the Pannu Liberal party. The goal was to protect the rights and interests of the citizen and eliminate the current situation where the government and the foreign capital worked together.</br>
</br>
It was difficult to fight for their cause, but a lot of Pannu people stood by their side. Because of this, he saw the hope of resolving the problem peacefully.</br>
</br>
But as Jiang Chen said, this route was unsuccessful to begin with.</br>
</br>
"Military uprising?" Zhang Yapin mustered to himself as another kind of flame lit up in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, the only solution to change the current circumstance is military resistance. From the opposing party to the anti-government force," Jiang Chen continued to spread this dangerous thought to the young man.</br>
</br>
"But, this is unconstitutional-"</br>
</br>
"Your president is unconstitutional, don’t tell me accepting bribes is within the constitution of Pannu."</br>
</br>
"But, people will die in a civil war," Zhang Yapin gulped as he said with difficulty.</br>
</br>
"There is no revolution without bleeding; there is no peace without sacrifice," Jiang Chen stared straight into his eyes as he said decisively.</br>
</br>
"But-"</br>
</br>
"There is not but," Jiang Chen interrupted him.</br>
</br>
"You only have one choice. Blood in exchange for freedom, or bleed dry in compromise."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was impossible to say he didn’t feel guilty.</br>
</br>
The reckless UA citizen named Johnny in Pannu Islands was a puppet placed by Jiang Chen at the cost of two hundred million USD.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn’t regret anything.</br>
</br>
The secrets in his hands meant that he could not cooperate with any country or organization. If he wants to expand and grow freely, controlling a small state as his base was the only option.</br>
</br>
As to the people that may lose their lives because of this, Jiang Chen could regrettably say that he will treat their decedents nicely. He is confident under his reign, Pannu Islands would be much wealthier than now.</br>
</br>
To acquire Pannu islands as a base, Jiang Chen had bet everything.</br>
</br>
Since Pannu is a country part of the United Nations, it was not as simple as sending one hundred well-equipped infantries to wipe out the military force on the island. If Jiang Chen used this simple yet brute force to take over Pannu Islands, it won’t be long before the United Nation Peacekeeping force lands on Pannu Islands and then search the entire world for him for his crime against humanity.</br>
</br>
The 21st century was not like the Victorian era. Sovereignty was not a joke. The regime established through illegally occupying a country could not be considered a country. They were pirates or terrorists. Only when the shift of power was completed under the boundary of international law could the regime be considered legal.</br>
</br>
When outsiders with guns enter one’s yard, it’s invasion, but when people inside raise their weapons in protest, it is only considered a civil war! Based on the consideration that the Liberal's ideology is similar to the UA's, the UA wouldn’t intervene in their civil war.</br>
</br>
Since the Liberal party raised the flag of democracy to end the evil reign of the corrupted presidential dictatorship, it was almost a replica of what happened in Syria. If the UA doesn’t recognize the legality of the Pannu Liberal party, they would be contradicting themselves.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin didn’t give a direct response, but he said he would immediately return to Pannu Islands and exchange opinions with other Freedom party members before he provides Jiang Chen with a clear answer.</br>
</br>
For this, Jiang Chen expressed his understanding. But he only gave them a week's time to consider. An indecisive government was not worthy of an investment.</br>
</br>
Before he left, Zhang Yapin asked Jiang Chen a question.</br>
</br>
"If we end up in charge, we will still prosecute Johnny for the crimes he committed in Pannu and get rid of the evil bloodsucker, Johnny International. With such a result, do you still have anything to gain from it?"</br>
</br>
To be able to ask this question, Zhang Yapin was certainly thinking.</br>
</br>
But for Jiang Chen who came prepared from the beginning, he was still too naïve.</br>
</br>
"Pannu’s current regime is too corrupt and therefore the cost of investment is too low. But if a rather calm government is in place, I think Pannu Islands has a higher investment value." Although he had prepared this reason beforehand, Jiang Chen didn’t lie.</br>
</br>
</br>
If Pannu Islands became his backyard, he would naturally spend money to take care of it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s response made Zhang Yapin ecstatic.</br>
</br>
He suppressed the joy on his face and bowed to Jiang Chen before hastily leaving.</br>
</br>
He was previously worried about the severe effect on the economy once Johnny International left. But with Jiang Chen’s promise, he felt more assured.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, feeling pleased, smiled, and left the coffee shop.</br>
</br>
Now that the stage was set, it was time for the actors to debut.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
On Coro Island, a few hundred kilometers away from New Zealand, the sun was also bright.</br>
</br>
Coro City was here. The capital of Pannu Republic.</br>
</br>
Although it was the capital, other than the beautifully constructed mansion, there was not a single luxury building in the vicinity.</br>
</br>
The European style architecture, the green vegetation, the swimming pool the size of fifteen hundred square meters. Everything stood out of the place in the not-so-prosperous city center… Just like a millionaire in the slum.</br>
</br>
Johnny lied on the recliner on the balcony of the mansion as he enjoyed the subtropical climate and the beauty who was giving him a massage. A few fishing boats drifted in the sea not far away. Although one sentence from him could get rid of those poor suckers from his private territory, he decided not to.</br>
</br>
He enjoyed this kind of feeling. The feeling of being on top, the feeling of looking at the poor people below him.</br>
</br>
A few months ago, he was only a poor guy in the Los Santos ghetto. He and a few Irish guys wandered in dark bars and sold weed they bought from the Mexicans. Because of turf disputes, they would shoot the thugs from the Crips gang, and then die one day in a dark alley… If without this surprising opportunity, his life was supposed to end like that.</br>
</br>
But life is always filled with surprises.</br>
</br>
He still remembers the day his life changed.</br>
</br>
That day, he was arrested for armed robbery. Just as he was prepared to rot in jail, a man named Robert bailed him out and "genuinely" invited him to be in a Hollywood movie.</br>
</br>
In the underworld of Los Santos, Robert was quite renowned, or else he wouldn’t have made the FBA list. Although he had exited the industry and became a director, Johnny still heard about his "reputation".</br>
</br>
Johnny remembered he was confused at the time as he didn’t even know he had the talent to act. But since there was a fool willing to pay for his terrible life, he accepted Robert’s arrangement.</br>
</br>
Now that he thought about, he was glad he made the decision.</br>
</br>
The life of a millionaire, the life here was like heaven. However, he was still confused about the purpose behind everything Robert has done as he didn’t see a single camera for the movie.</br>
</br>
Instinct told him that the old fox Robert didn’t just plan a movie.</br>
</br>
The iPad on the table suddenly flashed and interrupted his thoughts.</br>
</br>
"Boss, someone is looking for you." A full-bearded face wearing a pair of shades appeared on the screen.</br>
</br>
Aubrey, previously part of the Australian special forces, now the head of security for Johnny.</br>
</br>
Since he has a lot more assets now, Johnny had to consider his own safety. The natives always looked at him with eyes of hatred. If it were not for the fully equipped bodyguards, it would be hard for him to sleep at night.</br>
</br>
"Who is it?"</br>
</br>
"Wang Tianfeng, Han."</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng. Eyes narrowed, Johnny thought for a moment before he remembered the name.</br>
</br>
Seemed to the representative sent by Linhua Group that Robert had contacted.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Johnny no longer listened to Robert’s commands anymore. He was the president of Johnny International, the sole shareholder with two hundred million USD in hand. There was no need to listen to Robert.</br>
</br>
He was the king of Pannu Islands, a noble at least. President Edward had recently passed a policy to permit him to maintain a private force of fewer than fifteen people to protect his safety. Any trespassers could be shot without repercussion.</br>
</br>
It was a ridiculous order, but in front of money, any ridiculousness would become within the boundary of law.</br>
</br>
Ten billion USD construction project, Johnny International didn’t have the money at all. But Robert told him not to worry about it, he said that two gold mines in South Africa could be used as collateral, there was no need to worry about the money.</br>
</br>
Since he didn’t need to worry about the money, Johnny didn’t ask any more questions.</br>
</br>
He didn’t spend money following Robert’s orders anymore, although Robert rarely ordered him as he gave him free reign to do anything. Since someone was willing to improve the basic infrastructure of Pannu, why would he reject?</br>
</br>
If this place becomes prosperous, his assets would become more valuable. By that time, he could be independent financially and utterly break free from Robert’s manipulation.</br>
</br>
"Let him in." As Johnny said this, he signaled the bikini beauty to go back into the room.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Aubrey nodded and opened the metal gates to the mansion.</br>

</br>
After ending the meeting with Zhang Yapin, Jiang Chen didn’t stay any longer. He left the coffee shop and returned to the Sheraton Hotel in Auckland.</br>
</br>
When he returned to the hotel, it was almost noon.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao had woken up already as she swung her smooth legs and lied relaxingly on the bed scrolling through her Weibo.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen return, Liu Yao smiled and said coyly.</br>
</br>
"You are finally back! I am so hungry."</br>
</br>
"Just call the front desk to order room service." As Jiang Chen sat relaxingly beside the bed, he smiled at the sluggish Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
Her slightly blushed face still had a hint of the intimate battle that happened last night.</br>
</br>
She combed her slightly messy hair as she sat up and seductively stretched out her body.</br>
</br>
"Did something good happen?"</br>
</br>
"That’s right, how did you know?" Jiang Chen was rather surprised.</br>
</br>
"Haha, it is written all over your face." She playfully winked as she jumped off the bed.</br>
</br>
Her feet stepped onto the cold wooden floor as she grabbed the white shirt on the hanger and covered her attractive figure.</br>
</br>
She knew how she attracted people, and she was great at displaying her charm, a mix of purity and flirtation.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then guess. What good thing happened?" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Do I get a reward if I am right?" Liu Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
"Ummm…" With a finger on her bottom lip, Liu Yao’s eyes turned before she nodded affirmatively, "You must have signed a big deal?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, that’s right! How did you guess that?"</br>
</br>
He walked beside Liu Yao as he put his hands around her slim waist.</br>
</br>
"Last time in Sanya, when you were with me, you also made a deal." Liu Yao giggled.</br>
</br>
"So you really are my lucky star," Jiang Chen, pretending to be serious, said.</br>
</br>
"How are you planning to reward me?" Liu Yao said sweetly.</br>
</br>
"Is a kiss enough?" Jiang Chen with a smirk grabbed her waist.</br>
</br>
"Screw you!"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Because it was lunchtime already, the two got dressed up before heading to the restaurant inside the hotel.</br>
</br>
The portions were not big, but it was surprisingly delicious.</br>
</br>
There were oysters produced locally and Boston lobsters air-shipped and covered in ice. Other than specialty seafood on the menu, there was also spiced lamb and Australian steak.</br>
</br>
The thing that left the deepest impression on Jiang Chen was the traditional Maoi stone barbeque.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had never seen such a unique way of eating. The chef would first heat up the thin stone before wrapping it in food. Then, it would be put in a heated hole in the ground before it is smoked ready. With the way it was cooked, it was similar to the hobo chicken in Hua. But one is covered in aluminum foil and stone while the other is covered with lotus leaves and mud.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost bit his own tongue as this was the first time he ate such delicacies.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was more delicate when she ate. She only tried all the dishes before stopping. Now that she was a somewhat famous celebrity, without the genetic vaccine to maintain her figure, she would need to control her diet.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen need not be bothered. Other than the delicacies, he ate two steaks before he was full.</br>
</br>
The waitress looked at the empty plates on the table in shock. She then caringly left a box of stomach medicine.</br>
</br>
With how Liu Yao giggled, Jiang Chen rubbed his head out of awkwardness.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, five-star hotels indeed offered exceptional service as they took care of everything for you. But sometimes, it can be too much that it causes some minor awkwardness. Jiang Chen stuffed the stomach medicine in his pocket as he asked for the bill.</br>
</br>
"Are you not afraid of becoming fat." Liu Yao mocked as she looked at the pile of stacked plates.</br>
</br>
"Not afraid at all. It is not bad for a man to have a belly," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
Although that’s what he said, he was still far away from being fat.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao glanced at Jiang Chen’s flat stomach and exclaimed in bewilderment.</br>
</br>
"How do you do it?"</br>
</br>
"Do you want to know?" Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao nodded, as her eyes filled with excitement.</br>
</br>
To be able to maintain his figure without the need to diet. To the women that always debated if they should eat cake or not, the temptation was lethal. With how excited Liu Yao looked, Jiang Chen daydreamed in his mind. If Lin Lin managed to create a weight control pill, the wallet of the 3.5 billion women around the world would open for him.</br>
</br>
He almost wanted to return to the apocalypse immediately.</br>
</br>
"I will tell you later." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The waitress with blonde hair and blue eyes passed the bill and machine to him, smiled, and courteously looked away.</br>
</br>
The tipping culture in New Zealand was not as popular as in the UA, but it certainly exists. However, what differs is that the waitress would not directly ask you for tips and would look away when customer typed in the tip amount as to make it less awkward for the customers unwilling to pay the tip and press that zero button.</br>
</br>
Because he was in a great mood, Jiang Chen didn’t let the beautiful waitress’ expectation down as he typed in 100% in the tip option and then swiped his card.</br>
</br>
When the receipt was printed, the waitress opened her mouth in shock as he looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
It was her first time seeing such a generous customer. If it were not for the stunning beauty who sat across him, she would have suspected that the young eastern man was interested in her.</br>
</br>
Including tips, the meal cost 500 USD. It was almost half the price for a day in their presidential suite.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao pouted her mouth as she watched the waitress leave. She stared at the table as she moped in jealousy.</br>
</br>
"Are you interested in her?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
He was not a human hookup machine, he didn’t think of doing things every day.</br>
</br>
"Haha, good." Liu Yao smiled as she said happily, "Where should we go next?"</br>
</br>
Women who are always jealousy would push men away, but women who are not jealous at all wouldn’t make men aware of their presence. Jealous but never persistent on one issue. Against this type of intelligence, Xia Shiyu and Ayesha added together were no competition for Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
And because of this, Jiang Chen wanted Liu Yao to be his mistress.</br>
</br>
She knew this point and she didn’t demand more. Because even as a mistress, Jiang Chen gave her, her respect.</br>
</br>
A title is only a title after all.</br>
</br>
"I heard scuba diving is quite fun here, do you want to go check it out?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Yes! Also, I want to head out into the sea!" Liu Yao said energetically.</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stretched, held onto her hand, and strolled out of the hotel.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 273: The Renting Fiascal</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand. It is comprised of over fifty varying-sized islands. Half of the city was built on land and half was built on the sea. It was like a garden on an ocean.</br>
</br>
Other than the beautiful scenery, the other unique trait of Auckland was the ease of transportation.</br>
</br>
Within half an hour, you could arrive anywhere. Whether it was taking a boat to the islands, or a hike through the rainforest, or having a picnic by the volcano, or surfing in the ocean.</br>
</br>
Moments later, Jiang Chen and Liu Yao got off at the port.</br>
</br>
The port called fisherman’s wharf was a place he saw on their local website. The owner was a British man named John with a friendly attitude towards tourists. Because of this, the place was extremely popular with a lot of people coming to this port and renting a boat to head out to the sea.</br>
</br>
Based on other people's comments, he served in the Australian army before and was a master in diving.</br>
</br>
There was a full line of amenities at the port and the cost to rent was not high.</br>
</br>
Holding onto Liu Yao’s hand, Jiang Chen walked to the office of the port and began to ask about renting a boat and diving.</br>
</br>
The British guy with a red nose was delighted that Jiang Chen asked about diving as he started to introduce all the scuba diving gear he has collected and carefully explained the cautionary notes in diving.</br>
</br>
"… It is critical to be aware of the depth. For beginners, I recommend a depth no more than six meters."</br>
</br>
"Six meters, what’s the fun in that?" Jiang Chen had to ask.</br>
</br>
"Within shallow sea, six meters would allow you to see beautiful scenery under the sea. If you plan to scuba dive, I don’t recommend you rent a boat that goes too far away. When you enter deep water, you might not see anything even after twenty meters, there is also the danger of encountering sharks." Although John was talking about dangerous things, there was a hint of humor in his tone.</br>
</br>
"Sh…Sharks?" Liu Yao shivered as she looked at Jiang Chen, frightened. "Let’s not dive anymore."</br>
</br>
Although her English was mediocre at best, Liu Yao still made out the word shark.</br>
</br>
When he saw the tourist shiver in fear, John smiled assuringly and began to explain using his hands.</br>
</br>
"There is no need to worry too much. Most of the sharks don’t attack people. More people are being killed by coconuts landing on their heads than being attacked by sharks. Only Great White Sharks or Tiger Sharks would attack people. In some places, they organize scuba divers to feed the sharks."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not that afraid of sharks.</br>
</br>
Since he fought head to head with the fearsome Death Claw, there was no way he would be afraid of something that only used its teeth.</br>
</br>
"This is the first time I met a merchant that tells its customers not to buy its service." With how serious John looked, Jiang Chen shrugged with an expression he couldn’t be helped.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I have to be responsible for the safety of the tourists." John shrugged, "Only when safely protected could one enjoy the beauty of the sea."</br>
</br>
"Looks like you have your own perspective on the beauty of the sea." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I love scuba diving." John grinned as a set of white teeth appeared from his thick beard.</br>
</br>
"But I still want to the rent a boat, as well as a set of diving gear. I will worry about my own safety." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
John still wanted to persuade Jiang Chen, but an unharmonious voice came from behind them.</br>
</br>
"Could the people in the front hurry up? If you can’t afford it stop wasting time." A man in sunglasses complained out of annoyance, and a girl in light clothes stood beside him as she intimately wrapped her hands around his arm.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Dai Zhengming was absolutely annoyed by his fellow countrymen who traveled to New Zealand. Every December, New Zealand’s fresh and free atmosphere would be mixed with gloom. The garbage on the streets would also increase. The situation would only be alleviated by late January because, by that time, his fellow countrymen would head home for New Year.</br>
</br>
No need to suspect. Although he has yellow skin, he had a heart that shined with whiteness. After working at Microsoft for a few years, with his excellent track record, he finally gained an opportunity to immigrate. Although he personally preferred Australia more, New Zealand was not a bad choice.</br>
</br>
Just like a monkey who leaped onto a tree branch, he thirstily breathed the air of the free world as he looked at the envious people watching him. Arrogance often sprouted from other people’s adoration, and bias is infinitely magnified by arrogance.</br>
</br>
He had perfectly settled into his role of a "local" as he disdained foreigners more than the actual locals.</br>
</br>
As if all of the actions of his fellow countrymen lacked courtesy and manner.</br>
</br>
Because he spoke Han, John didn’t understand what he said. As he thought that Jiang Chen met his fellow countrymen, he shrugged and left them alone.</br>
</br>
[I can’t afford it?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s expression was peculiar as he didn’t know what to say. Liu Yao covered her mouth, she tried hard to not laugh and turned her face to scan the man in sunglasses.</br>
</br>
When he saw Liu Yao’s face, Dai Zhengming held his breath.</br>
</br>
[Damn, what a hottie.]</br>
</br>
Although he had seen a lot of beautiful girls before, it was his first time seeing one this stunning. Especially when she turned her head and smiled, it almost made his heart pause.</br>
</br>
Of course, perhaps it was because of the shades, he didn’t manage to read the mockery in Liu Yao’s eyes.</br>
</br>
"Zhengming, they might not know English, why don’t you go help them." The girl holding onto his arm blinked her bright eyes as she coyly shook his arm.</br>
</br>
She looked above average. Based on her looks, she should be in university, most likely an international student in Auckland? The man was in his mid-thirties, although not old, but definitely not as young as Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You are right." Dai Zhengming let out a sigh and walked towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Although he looked down on him, he must maintain his gentlemen appearance in front of the beauty.</br>
</br>
"I am Dai Zhengming."</br>
</br>
"I am Jiang… Jianguo." He was going to say his own name, but from the way Dai Zhengming looked, he seemed to have something to say and therefore Jiang Chen gave his dad’s name in the last second instead.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao tried hard not to laugh as she charmingly rolled her eyes at the naughty Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"In New Zealand, it is extremely uncourteous to occupy public resources for a long time. I don’t know if people taught you this in Hua, but overseas, it is better to save some face for your own country."</br>
</br>
"Rather than 'occupying public resources', I like to refer to my actions as asking about the services available, especially since it has been less than three minutes-" With how serious he looked, Jiang Chen "argued" and couldn’t help but laugh.</br>
</br>
Dai Zhengming "courteously" interrupted Jiang Chen’s words and spoke to him with an educating tone.</br>
</br>
"And people are lining up behind you, right? Let me give you a simple example. An event that left a deep impression on me living in New Zealand all these years. I saw a Han grandma and her grandson ordering at the St. Heliers coffee shop. They spent so long at the register before ordering a mocha with a sandwich and a kids meal."</br>
</br>
[Uhh, is he implying something?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen purposely looked behind him, other than them, there was no one waiting in line.</br>
</br>
"Is that a problem?" Jiang Chen was lost.</br>
</br>
"It’s courtesy." Dai Zhengming looked seriously at Jiang Chen’s eyes as he said with a straight face.</br>
</br>
"So you are saying… that grandma and grandson wasted time of all the people waiting in line?" Jiang Chen had a peculiar expression on his face.</br>
</br>
[Wow, you remember such a minuscule event, and it left a deep impression on you? You’re quite a special snowflake.]</br>
</br>
"That’s right. If you want to order, please think about what you want to order before lining up, or don’t occupy the space at the register, that would bring trouble to the people waiting to order."</br>
</br>
"Okay… I agree it is rude to occupy the stall and not take a sh*t." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"And you are doing exactly this right now," Dai Zhengming said sternly. "And watch your language. It represents the image of the country behind you, please don’t use the word sh*t. if this is the UA, you may face lawsuits for using offensive language to strangers."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s expression couldn’t be more peculiar.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, he knew a UA citizen who used the word sh*t every day. (Robert in the far away Los Santos sneezed and woke up the Hollywood girl that slept beside him.)</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen didn’t say anything, he thought Jiang Chen was so embarrassed that he was speechless, so he continued.</br>
</br>
"Even if you have some money, please don’t bring your uncourteous habits out of the country."</br>
</br>
"Let me clarify, I don’t have some money," Jiang Chen corrected him feeling rather awkward.</br>
</br>
"Then you have to be more aware of your manners, or people will consider you as both uncourteous and poor." His eyes were flashing with a trace of contempt as he educated.</br>
</br>
As he finished, he nobly turned to Liu Yao as he took out a business card from his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful lady, this is my business card. I currently have a house in Auckland and I am working in the Microsoft division here as the chief engineer. I am pretty familiar with the area. So if you are interested, you can find me at the address on the business card, I am happy to take you around to enjoy the beauty of New Zealand.</br>
</br>
Then, Dai Zhengming ignored Liu Yao’s reaction and left with a smile he considered charming and a "cool" retreating silhouette.</br>
</br>
He walked around Jiang Chen, used a British accent more standard than British people, and spoke with Johnny before he swiped his card.</br>
</br>
Then, he triumphantly walked towards the boats with the girl that held onto his arm with her face full of idolization. Jiang Chen was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"Honey, you’re being looked down upon," Liu Yao walked beside Jiang Chen with a grin, held onto his arm, and said coyly.</br>
</br>
"Seems like that's the case," Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to help you to seek revenge?" Liu Yao’s eyes flashed as her red lips curled up.</br>
</br>
"It’s okay, he already said let’s not lose face in front of foreigners," Jiang Chen mocked,</br>
</br>
Liu Yao burst out laughing as she closed her mouth.</br>
</br>
"I didn’t know you liked cold humor." She threw the business card into the garbage can.</br>
</br>
"No, I am serious." Although that was what he said, Jiang Chen didn’t look serious at all.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about it, that guy seemed to have cut him in line. But Jiang Chen wasn't interested in being bothered by him. He could give up a few minutes of his life.</br>
</br>
"What were you talking about?" John didn’t mind that Jiang Chen just left him hanging and asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Not much… Just talked about some hometown stuff."</br>
</br>
"Great then, to meet a fellow countryman overseas, it is important to chat for a moment. But in Auckland, you will have plenty of opportunities to see them," John said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Is that so… Speaking of this, what do you think about the Han in Auckland?" After he swiped his card, Jiang Chen signed the receipt and asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"They make delicious cuisine. I really enjoy Han food, just that it’s a bit expensive." John laughed.</br>
</br>
"Anything else?"</br>
</br>
"That’s all." John shrugged.</br>
</br>
Because of Jiang Chen’s insistence, John didn’t try to talk him out of it as he just urged him to be extra safe and that he must dive with the captain accompanying him.</br>
</br>
It was not cheap to rent a boat, the cheapest one cost two thousand NZD a day, which was equivalent to eight thousand RMB. Therefore, it was more economical to rent by the hour, but other than the small boats, the boats that you could live on were not available for hourly rental.</br>
</br>
Because it was a rare opportunity, it was not thrilling enough to just rent a small boat. Jiang Chen rented a ten something meter long medium-sized luxury boat with a spacious living space and gladly paid eight thousand NZD per day for it.</br>
</br>
"Also, do New Zealanders just straight up pay for their boat when they rent here?" After he signed the agreement, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
John paused for a moment as he didn’t know why Jiang Chen would ask such a question. He shook his head and said, "Other than the customers who often come, the new customers without knowledge of the price and the type of boat would have to ask."</br>
</br>
"You are right." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Su Wen stood on the dock beside the boat and asked Dai Zhengming curiously.</br>
</br>
"What did you say to that girl? I saw you give her something."</br>
</br>
"Nothing, it is only a business card. In the outside world, it is a habit to hand out a business card as it represents courtesy." Dai Zhengming made up a lie out of embarrassment.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen and Liu Yao walked in their direction.</br>
</br>
When he saw the beauty was still sweetly holding onto Jiang Chen’s hand, Dai Zhengming’s eyebrows jumped but he didn’t react any further.</br>
</br>
When he passed by Dai Zhengming, Jiang Chen seemed to have suddenly remembered something and stopped.</br>
</br>
"Oh, I heard that there is a custom of returning business cards, then I will give you a business card as well." Jiang Chen took out his business card and purposely hesitated for a moment before he passed it to his female companion. "I don’t travel abroad a lot and haven't learned as much about the western culture as you, so I will learn from you."</br>
</br>
When saw Jiang Chen hand his girlfriend, Su Wen, his business card, he frowned unnaturally. But then he realized that Jiang Chen seemed to have ignored him and passed the business card to the beauty beside him, he swallowed the criticism.</br>
</br>
"Wenwen, accept it for me."</br>
</br>
"Oh."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stuffed the business card into the girl’s hands as he laughed like he just pulled off a prank and continued to walk without turning his head.</br>
</br>
"It is ready. Should we depart now?"</br>
</br>
The captain working in the small boat raised his head and smiled at Dai Zhengming.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, let’s leave now. Wenwen, let’ go… Wenwen?" When Dai Zhengming saw that Su Wen didn’t react, he slightly frowned and turned his head.</br>
</br>
Su Wen, holding onto the gold gilded business card, had her eyes wide open and was utterly astonished.</br>
</br>
"What’s going on?" Dai Zhengming asked confusedly.</br>
</br>
Su Wen seemed to have recollected her thoughts as she looked at her boyfriend in excitement.</br>
</br>
"It’s... It’s Jiang Chen!"</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen? Which Jiang-" Suddenly, Dai Zhengming stopped.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen? President of Future Technology? But isn’t his name Jiang Jianguo?"</br>
</br>
He grabbed the card from his girlfriend’s hand as he widened his eyes in disbelief. Then he looked up into the not so far distance.</br>
</br>
The man stating "he didn’t have some money" was on top of a luxury boat and smiling at him.</br>
</br>
But the bright smile, in Dai Zhengming’s eyes, looked piercing.</br>
</br>
Mockery.</br>
</br>
When he remembered that he lectured him, the humiliation immediately overwhelmed him. His bloated face turned red as he wanted to dig a hole for himself.</br>
</br>
Especially when he saw his girlfriend looking enviously at the luxury boat, his expression looked like he just ate a fly.</br>
</br>
"Are you guys going on the boat or not? Can I start timing?"</br>
</br>
The captain on the boat saw that the two had no reaction and yawned as he complained.</br>
</br>
When he heard the captain complain, Dai Zhengming immediately recollected his thought as he apologized to the captain. Then he dragged the still envious girlfriend onto the boat.</br>
</br>
On the top deck of the boat, Jiang Chen looked at the dock disappearing with a grin.</br>
</br>
"You are not a nice person. But that person is hideous, it makes me feel good to see him suffer like this." Liu Yao held onto his arm as she giggled.</br>
</br>
"I only smiled at him, but he would think I am mocking him. Saves me my own expression," Jiang Chen shrugged and mocked.</br>
</br>
After they left the small incident behind, Jiang Chen looked into the distance.</br>
</br>
He gazed at the waves at the point where the sky and the ocean met. As he experienced the ocean wind breeze by his face, he felt all his annoyances quietly settle down.</br>
</br>
Just as he was zoning out, the EP on his arm undetectably flashed.</br>
</br>
As if it foretold something unexpected was about to occur.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The captain of the boat was John's daughter. Her name was Bernie.</br>
</br>
Just like her father, she was also someone that loved the sea. Because of this, while she had blonde hair unique to Caucasian people, her skin was tanned.</br>
</br>
The boat was moving quickly, at 50 knots, in the Hauraki Bay towards the Great Barrier Island.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen looked back, the outline of the port had already disappeared from the sea, only a few black dots soaring on the horizon could be seen.</br>
</br>
"Woah-!"</br>
</br>
Intoxicated by the fresh air, Liu Yao excitedly took off her white shirt as she stood on the edge of the deck and shouted into the distance.</br>
</br>
Of course, she changed into a bikini when she was at the hotel.</br>
</br>
"Careful don't fall off." Jiang Chen looked at her liveliness and smiled.</br>
</br>
"If I fall off, will you save me?" Liu Yao asked playfully.</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jiang Chen had a smirk on his face, "But I heard there are sharks in this area, how much I can save would be questionable."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao shivered exaggeratedly as she jumped from the edge of the deck and rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"There are typically no sharks in the Hauraki Bay, but there are actually quite a few dolphins here. If we are lucky we might be able to see whales. If we head north of the Lesser Barrier Island, that will change," Bernie who sat in the captain's room heard their conversation and explained.</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, this foreigner, Bernie, spoke Han. Although not fluently, it was enough to maintain a conversation.</br>
</br>
As if Bernie had read the question in Jiang Chen's eyes, she explained with a smile, "My boyfriend is Han, he taught me the language. There are a lot of Han tourists here. Usually, if Han tourists head out to the sea, I will be their captain and guide."</br>
</br>
"Where are we now?" Liu Yao extended her neck. With one hand covering the sunlight, she watched the distance in excitement.</br>
</br>
"We have arrived Northwest of the Jackson port already, around 16 nautical miles from the Great Barrier Island. It is a good place to view the undersea corals."</br>
</br>
"How much longer?" Liu Yao couldn't wait any longer.</br>
</br>
"With our current speed, around 20 minutes." Bernie smiled.</br>
</br>
"I am really looking forward to it," Liu Yao looked afar before grabbing onto Jiang Chen's arm, she said coyly, "Could you take photos for me? I want pictures with the clownfish."</br>
</br>
"Of course." He felt the softness of her 36D and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Honey you are the best, muaa." Liu Yao naughtily winked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was just about to tease her when he felt the arm of his other hand vibrate.</br>
</br>
The vibration came from his EP.</br>
</br>
Communication? Did something urgent happen in the apocalypse?</br>
</br>
"What is this?" Liu Yao looked curiously at Jiang Chen's arm.</br>
</br>
"A special kind of electronic watch... I need to go to the washroom," Jiang Chen gave a brief explanation before he walked inside.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although still confused, Liu Yao didn't ask more as she stayed outside.</br>
</br>
After going inside, Jiang Chen immediately opened the EP and started the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"Strange," Looking at the static white screen, Jiang Chen muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
It was not from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The fourth-dimensional messenger received Klein particle waves, but the wave could not be decoded into a video message.</br>
</br>
"Could it be because of the poor signal?"</br>
</br>
The signal began to fade.</br>
</br>
Looking at the blurry whiteness that began to fade, Jiang Chen suddenly realized something as he rushed out the door.</br>
</br>
"Bernie, stop the boat, quickly," Jiang Chen pushed open the control room as he hastily said.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" His rushed voice made Bernie sitting in the control room jump as she slowed the boat down out of instinct.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Seeing Jiang Chen panic, Liu Yao who stood outside also stared at Jiang Chen in confusion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't explain anything, he looked at the screen with the GPS tracker and glanced at the route they passed through.</br>
</br>
"First, go back around one nautical mile."</br>
</br>
"Go back?" Bernie puzzledly looked at Jiang Chen, "But there is nothing there."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately calmed down when he heard her question.</br>
</br>
He was certain that something was hidden inside the sea. Although he didn't know what it was, it had to do with Klein particles.</br>
</br>
Crystals? But how would this world have that?</br>
</br>
Regardless of what was hidden, he could not let anyone know.</br>
</br>
When he thought about this, Jiang Chen glanced at the screen with the GPS coordinates again as he memorized the approximate location. Then, he changed into a casual voice.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I just saw a dolphin, but he must have swum away already by now."</br>
</br>
"A dolphin?" When Bernie heard Jiang Chen's' words, she paused for a moment before she let out a breath of relief. "Once we reach the Great Barrier Island, you'll see a lot of cute little ones in the area."</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen rush into the control room, she thought there was a problem with the boat.</br>
</br>
But it was only a dolphin.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? I am looking forward to it then." Jiang Chen also smiled as he left the control room.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen come out, Liu Yao walked towards him worriedly and caringly asked.</br>
</br>
"What happened? I, I saw you were really rushed..."</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I only saw a few dolphins."</br>
</br>
Although she acutely sensed that Jiang Chen wasn't telling the truth, she didn't persist on the topic any further.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen were willing to tell her, then he would do so. If he was unwilling, then persisting would only make him feel annoyed.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then that's disappointing, I wanted to take a photo with the dolphins." After hugging onto Jiang Chen right arm, Liu Yao playfully pouted her mouth.</br>
</br>
The 16 nautical miles quickly came to an end.</br>
</br>
The waves splashed white, at the apex where the sea and sky connected, a beautiful outline gradually appeared.</br>
</br>
When she saw the thick green vegetation, as well as the soaring seagulls, Liu Yao cheered again in excitement.</br>
</br>
The two spent the entire afternoon diving in the water near the Great Barrier Island and taking pictures with the cute dolphins, fishing for fishes, teasing the clownfish hidden amongst the sea anemone, and chasing each other between the beautiful corals.</br>
</br>
Time flew by quickly as if it had instantly turned to dusk.</br>
</br>
After watching the sunset on the deck, Jiang Chen told Bernie to return to port.</br>
</br>
Although he still wanted to stay a bit longer by the sea, because of his unsettled mind, he didn't choose to stay longer but rather asked Bernie to send them back to the hotel.</br>
</br>
With the help of the hotel workers, Bernie docked the boat.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to stay a bit longer? You rented the boat for a day. It is a great experience to stay on the boat overnight," Looking at the two people saying goodbye, Bernie asked them.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I remembered I have something to take care of," Jiang Chen declined her proposal as Jiang Chen held Liu Yao's hand and they went back to the hotel.</br>
</br>
He desperately wanted to know, when they passed by the water northwest of Jackson port, what was actually hidden there.</br>
</br>
He had a premonition that that thing might have something to do with the video.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After returning to his room, Jiang Chen closed the door.</br>
</br>
Graceful hands circled his waist.</br>
</br>
When he felt the coolness, Jiang Chen smiled and gently squeezed Liu Yao's hand.</br>
</br>
"Don't want to do it?"</br>
</br>
"Can you withstand it?" Looking at her bright eyes, Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
When she recollected her desperate pleading last night, Liu Yao's face turned red, but she acted calmly.</br>
</br>
"I can withstand-"</br>
</br>
"But rather than withstanding it, I enjoy it more when you are also enjoying it."</br>
</br>
A glimpse of emotion appeared and quickly faded on her face. She lowered her head and pouted her mouth.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"Rest early tonight, it has been a long day." Jiang Chen combed the hair in front of Liu Yao's forehead with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Her eyes turned teary for a second and she nodded.</br>
</br>
Half because of his money, half because of his character. Regardless, she loved him. Although she knew Jiang Chen would only treat her as a mistress, she didn't mind.</br>
</br>
She knew, him accepting her perhaps had nothing to do with love, or maybe even as a reminiscence to what didn't happen in the past, a recollection of his time. By the lake at Wanghai University, when she wore that white dress and appeared in front of him like a student. His lost eyes made her read the meaning behind them.</br>
</br>
But none of those things mattered. Even if she was just a mistress, she could still feel his gentleness.</br>
</br>
The only thing that made her afraid was, at the bottom of her heart, she wondered if she was just a tool to unleash his desire.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, he is not like that...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After a shower, the two slept.</br>
</br>
It was around midnight when Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
The breathing beside his ear was rhythmic. Due to spending too much energy during the day, Liu Yao was sleeping deeply.</br>
</br>
After sneaking out of bed, Jiang Chen put on his shirt, went into the washroom, and locked the door before commencing interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
It was quiet in the mansion. Sun Jiao should already be sleeping.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't go wake them up as he took a thick winter suit and covered himself up. He stood beside the living room, getting used to the drastic change in temperature. Then he opened the door of the mansion and walked into the snowy night.</br>
</br>
Although it was already late into the night, the base still remained bright and noisy.</br>
</br>
The heavy snow could not cover the orange flame shining from the factory window. The roaring sound inside the building diffused around the base. With the outdated production equipment, they could only make up the lack of speed through labor. The lack of sophisticated equipment meant that they had to operate through an around the clock shift schedule to reach the necessary volume.</br>
</br>
But no one complained because this place was the wasteland. Being full and warm with the opportunity to work was almost a luxury.</br>
</br>
</br>
The unmanned highly sophisticated factories from before the war had almost all turned into shambles during the nuclear explosions. Although Jiang Chen had thought about sending people to the ruins to dig through some "garbage", given that it was around ten something years into the apocalypse, he gave up on the thought.</br>
</br>
Anything good was probably raided.</br>
</br>
The snow removing vehicle modified out of a truck would occasionally drive by. The fully equipped soldiers patrolled the base.</br>
</br>
When they saw Jiang Chen, the leading patrol immediately stood straight and saluted to the general.</br>
</br>
"Don't mind me, you guys continue to patrol." Looking at the young man with a red nose, Jiang Chen smile.</br>
</br>
"Yes, sir!" The young man raised his head with rosy cheeks and saluted again before telling the soldiers behind him to walk forward.</br>
</br>
At the young man's chest, Jiang Chen saw a golden emblem.</br>
</br>
He just remembered that he seemed to have canonized two hundred something knights at the base. These knights were absolutely loyal to him and were the first batch of slaves he bought from the Sixth Street. They were the pioneers that dug the first shovel among the ruins. Now, these pioneers all have been promoted as the central force of the base, acting as management or mid to high-level military leaders.</br>
</br>
The person following the young knight was an upper citizen. Although he was not implanted with the slavery chip, Jiang Chen still saw deep respect and worship from his eyes.</br>
</br>
"The size of the base is beginning to grow?" Standing in the snow, Jiang Chen scanned the territory he ruled and a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
With the Fishbone base gradually growing in size, with the base as the core foundation, it began to expand into its fourth newly plotted area. New residential area meant that they could intake new immigrants. Combined with the survivors from Shenxiang town, Fishbone base had over 1000 in population.</br>
</br>
But the growth on this side was stagnating. The materials gathered by the scavenger team could not satisfy the appetite of this industrial monster. Only if he managed to obtain his own land in the modern world could he move tons of aluminum, steel, or even rare earth metals to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
After staying a bit longer, Jiang Chen began to walk to the aerospace laboratory at the corner of the base.</br>
</br>
He pressed the doorbell as he put his face closer to the camera and said concisely.</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
Shortly after, the lock made a "clang" sound.</br>
</br>
Pushing open the door, he carried with him the chilly wind and snowflakes. But the snowflakes on the carpet were soon melted into droplets of water by the heat inside.</br>
</br>
He closed the door behind him and put his winter suit on the hook by the door before he walked inside.</br>
</br>
"So late. I almost thought the kinetic skeleton production line had an accident." Jiang Lin in pajamas yawned as he came to the door with messy hair.</br>
</br>
Parts were thrown everywhere, making the first-floor living room challenging to find a place to place one's feet. But the still sleepy guy managed to quickly walk through the pile of spare parts and didn't step on a single bolt.</br>
</br>
By this alone, this guy spent too much time inside.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Jiang Chen pointed at the parts and diagrams on the ground feeling puzzled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin grabbed a chair for Jiang Chen and then sat on the other one before he replied, "You asked to research the K1-b type kinetic skeleton... For real, is this thing really necessary?"</br>
</br>
K1-b kinetic skeleton is the amphibious version of the K1 model. Maintaining the current defense ability, it adds a resistant layer against water pressure, while modifying the back to allow for water booster and an air storage cylinder.</br>
</br>
Of course, this model would not be used in the apocalypse, but Jiang Chen didn't want to explain to him as he started to ask about the research progress.</br>
</br>
"Is this thing functional?"</br>
</br>
"Probably not. Considering that most waters possess a radiation level exceeding normal levels. I still need to add a layer of heavy organic metal within the pressure resistant layer-" Jiang Lin was prepared to explain to Jiang Chen the technicals, but Jiang Chen who didn't understand at all interrupted him mercilessly.</br>
</br>
"Let's put the radiation problem aside for now. Other than that, what else is needed? Is this thing done?" The water in the modern world has no radiation, it would be useless to add anti-radiation material.</br>
</br>
"The design is complete. Sample parts have been created, it only needs to be assembled together before it can be used." After hesitating for a moment, Jiang Lin nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then assemble a sample for me, that shouldn't be a problem right?"</br>
</br>
"There is no problem, but the performance data has yet to be collected, it may not be good to use it right away-"</br>
</br>
"Battle is the best way to test the equipment." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Jiang Lin didn't try to convince Jiang Chen. He shrugged before he walked towards the workbench.</br>
</br>
The K1-b type kinetic skeleton was much heavier compared to the original K1 model. Considering that the amphibious equipment would mostly be used underwater, the removable polyethylene board was sealed shut to avoid water leakage.</br>
</br>
Other than that, Jiang Lin also designed a full helmet for this kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
Just from the appearance alone, this kinetic skeleton covered every single part of the body with the pressure resistant material. Other than the fact that it didn't have a turbine engine, steel armor, nerve connected computer, as well as other high tech equipment, this set of armor was similar to the power armor. On the other hand, it could be classified as something between "light infantry armor" to "heavy knight armor". The cost was three times more than the original K1 model.</br>
</br>
"The booster equipment is in the back. The air storage can be charged by allowing the opening to come into contact with air. It takes around an hour to charge to full and can be used up to three hours." Jiang Lin pushed up his glasses as he began to explain to Jiang Chen the equipment he designed.</br>
</br>
[Automatically replenishing oxygen, what, how insane is that?]</br>
</br>
As he listened to Jiang Lin, Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
"When engaging in a crossfire, avoid getting the breathing apparatus in the back of the neck damaged... Of course, that would not be much different than if you were shot in the head."</br>
</br>
"The helmet is not bulletproof?" Jiang Chen knocked on the helmet as he felt the special organic material.</br>
</br>
"It is underwater equipment. I have to control the overall density, the majority of the bulletproof ability is focused on the front chest and stomach area. Of course, the helmet can defend against one or two bullets, but I don't recommend you try it. With the kinetic power of the reaper assault rifle, even if the helmet could deflect a shot, most people's neck would not be able to withstand that kind of force. This is not the power armor after all." Jiang Lin shrugged.</br>
</br>
"What about this? Pistol?" Jiang Chen picked up an odd-looking weapon.</br>
</br>
"That's alright. But it can't be used in water."</br>
</br>
"Is the Type-11 pistol not good? I remember the power of that thing is pretty high." Jiang Chen held onto the gun as he played with it, the feeling couldn't be more strange.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin paused for a second as he looked at Jiang Chen strangely.</br>
</br>
"The bullet with a higher initial velocity would travel a shorter distance in the water. Even if the bullet in the base has a steel core, while it would not be crushed by the water pressure, it will begin to roll in a few meters."</br>
</br>
The higher the velocity, the shorter the distance? How is that possible?!</br>
</br>
"But I saw in movies-" Jiang Chen said dumbfoundedly.</br>
</br>
In his memory, the images of machines guns weaving a net made by bullets were common in war movies.</br>
</br>
"It is a movie after all." Jiang Lin laughed as he put a box of elongated bullets into Jiang Chen's hand, "If you use Type-11, you are better off using a laser weapon. Although the optical density of laser beams also degrade quickly in water, it will still shoot further than conventional weapons."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 276: Below the Ocean</br>
</div></br>
After taking the equipment from Jiang Lin, Jiang Chen returned to the mansion. He snuck into his own bedroom before traveling back.</br>
</br>
When he looked at the time coming out of the washroom, it was already two in the morning.</br>
</br>
After quietly getting into bed again, Jiang Chen looked at the tranquil face and rhythmically pumping chest before lying down beside her and closing his eyes.</br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
Although he slept late last night, when the first ray of sunshine cast into the room, He was the first one up.</br>
</br>
As he got out of bed, he didn't wake Liu Yao up as he only left a message on the table before putting on a shirt and leaving.</br>
</br>
After taking a taxi to the rural area east of Auckland, Jiang Chen walked along the coast before he found the fishing farm on the map.</br>
</br>
He dragged the owner of the fish farm out and without wasting a single word he directly pointed at the boat parked on the dock and asked for the price.</br>
</br>
Although the New Zealander first insisted that he was not willing to sell, when he heard Jiang Chen raise the price to ten thousand NZD and pretended to leave, the brown-skinned old fisherman dragged onto him signaling it was a deal.</br>
</br>
Ten thousand NZD was enough for two boats, especially since his boat has already been used for over a year.</br>
</br>
After completing the transaction, that guy gave all the documents and keys to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As to if Jiang Chen had the proper license, he didn't ask. He only taught Jiang Chen for 30 minutes on how to drive.</br>
</br>
It was simple to maneuver the boat. Under the directions of the old fisherman, they took a ride into the nearby sea as Jiang Chen learned how to drive.</br>
</br>
However, when the old fisherman got out, his eyes were full of concern. But Jiang Chen was unbothered. He opened the GPS, pushed the speed of the boat to its maximum and headed for the waters northwest of Jackson Port.</br>
</br>
The Hauraki Bay today was still pleasant.</br>
</br>
Because he didn't encounter any big waves, with Jiang Chen's brute way of pressing on the gas, he managed to arrive without flipping the boat.</br>
</br>
When the boat passed through the same area as yesterday, without any surprise, the EP with the fourth-dimensional messenger received the same mysterious signal.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, Jiang Chen immediately slowed down. With one hand firmly on the wheel, he stared at the changing signal intensity on the EP.</br>
</br>
After wandering nearby for a while, Jiang Chen finally chose three points with the same signal and drew it on the map.</br>
</br>
What happened next was much more straightforward.</br>
</br>
Through triangulation, Jiang Chen quickly confirmed the approximate coordinates of the signal's source.</br>
</br>
"Done!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wiped the sweat from his forehead, threw the pencil to the side as he memorized the coordinates.</br>
</br>
"H?" Jiang Chen stared at the EP screen as he barely made out a blurred out word.</br>
</br>
</br>
But because it was too blurred out, he could only recognize the initial letter.</br>
</br>
"Is it that hello?"</br>
</br>
As he muttered to himself, Jiang Chen shut off the gas.</br>
</br>
He took out the K1-b kinetic skeleton from the storage dimension and put it on.</br>
</br>
&lt;Oxygen: 100%</br>
</br>
Structural damage: None</br>
</br>
Airtight: Normal&gt;</br>
</br>
He glanced at the panel on his right arm. After confirming all stats were normal, he walked to the edge of the boat.</br>
</br>
"I hope there is no wind."</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath and dove into the water.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Pooch.</br>
</br>
Followed by the rising air bubbles, Jiang Chen gradually descended to the deep sea.</br>
</br>
It was the first time he attempted diving away from the shore. When they were scuba diving near the Great Barrier Island, they saw the corals on the seabed two to three meters down. But now, the only thing below him was vast darkness.</br>
</br>
The light and sound surrounding him began to fade. The deepness and silence, only unique to below the sea, gradually spread around him.</br>
</br>
&lt;Current elevation: -20m</br>
</br>
Distance from the sea floor: 71m&gt;</br>
</br>
"So fu*king deep." Jiang Chen looked at the panel and cursed.</br>
</br>
To push away the claustrophobic sense swirling around him, he tapped the screen on his right arm as he opened the detection light on his helmet and feet.</br>
</br>
The sudden appearance of light made the little things peacefully swimming by him flee away.</br>
</br>
Only after two minutes of descending did Jiang Chen finally approach the sea floor.</br>
</br>
The colorful coral reefs and fishes, as well as the water plants swaying with the flow of the sea, were magnificent under the ray of light.</br>
</br>
But because he had already observed the beautiful feast underneath the sea, Jiang Chen didn't stop and observe the stunning scenery. He pressed the screen on his arm some more as he initiated the data transfer between the EP and kinetic skeleton computer.</br>
</br>
The static whiteness appeared again, but the hidden letters were much more clear compared to what he saw on the surface of the sea.</br>
</br>
"H...Help? Is the signal asking for help?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows as he scanned around.</br>
</br>
Since there were no irregular items, clearly there was an error in triangulation. That was to be expected. Jiang Chen didn't have a measurement device, it was a crude calculation with pencil and paper.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved the flaps under his feet as he tilted his body downward. He circled around the area before he followed the direction in which the signal was gradually increasing.</br>
</br>
The bottom of the sea was not smooth. Twenty meters into his journey, a pitch black valley appeared in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He shined the light in but couldn't see the bottom.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the deep abyss as he glanced at the screen on his arm.</br>
</br>
&lt;Current elevation: -101m</br>
</br>
Distance from seafloor: unknown&gt;</br>
</br>
210m</br>
</br>
243m</br>
</br>
332m</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It could not detect the bottom anymore? Or could the bottom be molten lava which would scatter the laser causing the information not to be relayed back?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows. Whatever it may be, it was not a good thing.</br>
</br>
Based on what Jiang Lin had said, the K1-b was designed for amphibious battle, not for deep sea diving. So a safe depth to go was only 150 meters.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hesitated for a moment. Then he took a deep breath of air as he swam into the trench with an unknown depth.</br>
</br>
Just like he expected, with his continuous descend, the signal from the EP was getting stronger and stronger.</br>
</br>
210m.</br>
</br>
243m.</br>
</br>
332m, the world record for scuba diving has been broken by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
As he felt the immense pressure from all sides, Jiang Chen clenched his teeth as he struggled to breathe in the air being pressured to the limit.</br>
</br>
The good thing was that the compressed air in the cylinder was helium-oxygen. If it were nitrogen oxygen, once the nitrogen dissolved into his body, it would render him unconscious.</br>
</br>
420m!</br>
</br>
Finally, the signal began to decrease.</br>
</br>
A delightedness flashed across Jiang Chen's eyes as he swam up two to three meters, and then began to search along the dark rock surface.</br>
</br>
If it were not for his genetic vaccine, an ordinary person would begin to bleed due to the water pressure.</br>
</br>
Finally, beside a jagged rock pillar, Jiang Chen saw something peculiar protruding out.</br>
</br>
He suppressed the excitement in his head and sped up the paddling of his feet as he moved towards that pillar.</br>
</br>
As his finger touched the cold pillar, he slightly used some force against it. With the momentum, Jiang Chen drifted behind the pillar.</br>
</br>
Light shed onto the black metal that hasn't seen sunlight for ages.</br>
</br>
Sea plants swayed as if the light had disturbed its peace.</br>
</br>
"My God..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dumbfoundedly looked at the scenery in front of his eyes as he almost forgot the breath.</br>
</br>
Just like a breeze of wind carrying Klein particles, it swept by the hidden history.</br>
</br>
The truth gradually revealed itself.</br>
</br>
The buried secret will once again see the light of day.</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 277: U-235</br>
</div></br>
"U-235?"</br>
</br>
It was a submarine.</br>
</br>
Around 90 meters long, he couldn't tell how much it weighed, but it must be above a thousand tons.</br>
</br>
Just like a needle, it pierced right into the jagged rocky cliff.</br>
</br>
The majority of its surface was covered by unknown algae. The remaining cracks were filled by the remains of mollusks. Rust stained the entire metal surface, but it didn't fade away the white paint that revealed its identity.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen extended his hand and touched the cold metal surface with his glove.</br>
</br>
He gently swayed along with the soft and silky seaweed and muttered the grave symbols.</br>
</br>
"U-235?"</br>
</br>
If he remembered correctly, a submarine with U as the initial letter, there was only one type in the entire world - the German U boat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not a military fanatic as his understanding of this came entirely from a British World War Two documentary as well as a few Hollywood movies.</br>
</br>
They were like ghosts below the sea surface, lingering around the allies' minds like nightmares. They disturbed the commercial fleets and transportation boats across the Atlantic Ocean. They ripped the supply line from the free world to the British Isles and cornered the allies' military power.</br>
</br>
It was not until 1945, when the Germans surrendered, did these submarines sunk.</br>
</br>
"The heritage of the Third Reich? Is the signal from inside here?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed on the surface of the submarine as he used the opposing force to gain a bit of distance. With the light on his head, he examined the full view of the intact submarine.</br>
</br>
Since it has been in the water for so many years, the rust on the surface of the submarine was severe. But fortunately, the main structure of the submarine remained intact as it didn't look like it would disassemble during internal exploration.</br>
</br>
When it crashed into the trenches, the submarine must have experienced strong impact. Just from the surface, a few dents and cracks were visible.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed along the outskirts of the submarine as he swam onto the deck.</br>
</br>
The 88mm cannon was twisted and bent from impact. Inside the cannon resided creatures similar to shrimps.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't disturb those small things as he circled around the rusted cannon and headed into the exit.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, the iron door was welded shut.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen without any welding equipment had to give up on the door and search for another entrance.</br>
</br>
Lady luck once again was on his side. Five meters away from the torpedo launcher, Jiang Chen managed to find a crack fitting of a person.</br>
</br>
He looked at the pitch black interior and gulped. He threw a luminescent water bomb from his waistband inside.</br>
</br>
The orange light brightened the interior of the submarine. After confirming there was no dangerous creature inside, Jiang Chen finally swam in.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What are these things?" Jiang Chen looked at the pitch black containers while speaking to himself.</br>
</br>
Instinct told him that there must be something unusual inside.</br>
</br>
Other than the containers with unknown content, Jiang Chen also saw a few skeletons in the Nazi uniform. These skeletons lied quietly at the corner of the ship cabin. Their body had withered away and the hollowness of the skeletons was filled with seaweed. It looked gross.</br>
</br>
Due to safety consideration, Jiang Chen didn't immediately open the containers, but instead searched for the signal and explored further into the cabin</br>
</br>
Fortunately, when the submarine sunk, the cabin doors were not shut. If they rusted, it would be difficult to open them again.</br>
</br>
"It's in the front?"</br>
</br>
The image on his screen was clear. Jiang Chen locked his sight on the signal strength indicator and used the small signal differences to ensure that he was moving towards the source of the signal.</br>
</br>
"What is this submarine exactly used for? For transportation?" Jiang Chen scanned the containers placed along the way as he asked himself.</br>
</br>
Just then, his left arm began to shake; it was from the EP underneath the kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pressed on the screen outside of the kinetic skeleton as the interface shifted to the EP.</br>
</br>
&lt;Radiation level: 5&gt;</br>
</br>
Radiation? Where did the radiation come from?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen brows furrowed, but he wasn't too bothered by it. Even if this kinetic skeleton did not have anti-radiation material, the iodine stored in the EP was more than enough to withstand this level of radiation. Especially compared to the radiation level of the apocalypse, this type of low radiation could be categorized as almost nothing.</br>
</br>
But what confused him was, why would he detect radiation on the German U boat.</br>
</br>
He passed through one more open cabin door as this must be the room where the signal was from.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took another luminescent bomb out and threw in the middle of the room. The entire room turned to an orange-red color.</br>
</br>
There were two wooden boxes in the room. The surface of the boxes had withered away already, and one of them was even wide open.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen decreased the light on his helmet as he approached it.</br>
</br>
Inside the wooden box lied five-cylinders made out of unknown materials. They were also labeled with "Japanese Army". Behind the wooden box, there were transparent eggs attached to it. They looked like octopus' eggs, but something looked odd from its shape and size. Though it must have been affected by the minor radiation.</br>
</br>
"Enriched uranium? No... German in history didn't manage to create the nuclear bomb. In this case, it should just be uranium? Or maybe uranium yet to reach the purity of weapon-grade?" Jiang Chen floated beside the cylinder and muttered.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave a bit more thought before he threw the cylinders into his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
With rough estimation, these nuclear materials weighed at least five hundred kilograms. Since it possessed radiation, then it must have been enriched to a certain extent already. Although he didn't know the market price of these things, on the black market, it would not be too far-fetched to sell for a few hundred million USD.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen would not sell these things.</br>
</br>
After destroying the mutated octopus eggs, Jiang Chen continued to search the room.</br>
</br>
At the corner, he finally found the source of the signal.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, a black shadow appeared on the wall in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As he was suddenly alerted, Jiang Chen immediately activated the booster device on his back.</br>
</br>
The high-pressure gas instantly burst out, with a strong thrust produced by tiny bubbles, he dashed into the other corner of the room.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Like a hammer, a tentacle fiercely slammed into the cabin wall as it left a daunting dent on the metal surface.</br>
</br>
It was a giant octopus!</br>
</br>
It's massive body squeezed into the door as it blocked the exit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finally realized why this creature was so furious. He remembered he destroyed those octopus eggs.</br>
</br>
The mutated octopus must be the mother of those weird eggs.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cursed and immediately pulled out the underwater pistol.</br>
</br>
But before he could shoot, four tentacles swam to him like pythons and locked in his limbs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face was bloated red as he used his muscles to try and escape, but the thick tentacles didn't budge one bit. While being strangled by a living creature, he was afraid to take the risk of interdimensional travel. As the size of the octopus was much bigger than the lead mutated human. It would take an immense amount of energy to destroy all its cells. He didn't want to take the risk of the interdimensional bracelet overheating again by using such a risky move.</br>
</br>
The poisonous ink splashed out, but it did nothing to Jiang Chen who didn't breath through his fins.</br>
</br>
Fury!</br>
</br>
Menacing light flashed out of Jiang Chen's eyes; his body was tightened to the limit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen clenched the gun as he managed to outpower the tentacles. Just as the octopus was about to put its razor-sharp mouth on him, he pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
Following the dampened gunshot was a series of small air bubbles.</br>
</br>
The special bullets pierced through the head of the octopus.</br>
</br>
Blue blood began to flow out. Under the orange light, it turned a shade of purple.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't in the most pleasant mood while viewing this scene. He pressed the trigger to express the desire to kill in his heart.</br>
</br>
The tentacles tightly clamped onto his limbs slowly began to lose its grasp.</br>
</br>
It took almost an entire clip of bullets before the fearsome creature finally stopped moving.</br>

</div></br>
"Uranium? Where did you get it from?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin scanned the barrel thrown to the corner by Jiang Chen with disdain. It looked as if she had seen something gross.</br>
</br>
When he was "arm wrestling" with that mutated octopus, the kinetic system of the kinetic skeleton received minor damage when Jiang Chen activated fury. To avoid the possibility of the entire skeleton breaking down during his return to the surface, after taking care of the mutated octopus, he brought the briefcase back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
After throwing the equipment for Jiang Lin to fix, Jiang Chen went to find Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Although the technology on our side is outdated, we still have things like the atomic bomb."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Your technology's progression is surprisingly quick, already in the atomic era." Lin Lin swayed her silver-white hair and sat on the chair. "And then? Why did you bring this thing to my lab?"</br>
</br>
"I want to ask, with five hundred kilograms of Uranium, how many nuclear bombs can you create?"</br>
</br>
When Lin Lin heard Jiang Chen's words, she paused for a moment, touched her chin, and replied after contemplating.</br>
</br>
"Nuclear bombs? It will depend on the type. If it is Uranium 235, it can only be used to create the most primal fissure bomb. Also, it has to depend on the enrichment level of the Uranium 235. If hypothetically this batch can extract one hundred kilograms of enriched Uranium. Then with the technology level before the war, twelve nuclear bombs with ten thousand ton TNT can be created. If you're using technology from the early atomic era, out of 50 kilograms of enriched uranium, about 1 kilogram can complete the chain reaction, so approximately two bombs can be made."</br>
</br>
"I see." Jiang Chen nodded his head as he continued to think.</br>
</br>
"Do you want me to create nuclear bombs for you?"</br>
</br>
"I have such a plan. Can you do it?"</br>
</br>
The tactical nukes confiscated from the Sixth Street had been deployed to the corners of Qingpu on the W-1 ballistic missile. On the wasteland where resources were scarce, every time a nuclear weapon was used, it means there will be less and less of them on the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
"One hundred lemon flavored puddings!" Lin Lin said without any hesitation.</br>
</br>
"Deal," Jiang Chen said delightedly.</br>
</br>
[That's cheap.]</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, when Lin Lin heard Jiang Chen's promise, she didn't have her usual cheerful expression, but instead, she stared at Jiang Chen for a long time.</br>
</br>
"I have to say something, this thing is poisonous."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and then was silent.</br>
</br>
After a brief moment, he said.</br>
</br>
"I will be cautious with this."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, that's good." Lin Lin nodded. The porcelain doll-like face displayed a smile. "If possible, I want to keep eating the pudding you bring."</br>
</br>
The unnatural light passing through the window for some reason made her gorgeous face carry a hint of poignancy.</br>
</br>
</br>
This world was destroyed by nuclear weapons.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked away. He took out the black briefcase from the storage dimension and changed topics.</br>
</br>
"Could you look at this for me?"</br>
</br>
"This is?" Lin Lin looked at the briefcase on the table as she had a curious expression on her face.</br>
</br>
"I found it on the German U boat... During the Second World War, the submarine from the axis countries, a unique piece of artifact."</br>
</br>
"Oh? The Second World War? That's far back in history." Lin Lin took over the briefcase, her digitalized eyes slightly contracted as it scanned and examined the surface. She then asked, "What's unique about it?"</br>
</br>
"It can send out Klein particle waves."</br>
</br>
"That's impossible," Lin Lin immediately negated him as she opened the fourth-dimensional messenger on the table, "People in the atomic era can't even observe that dimension, how would they realize the existence of Klein particle-"</br>
</br>
But before she could finish, her voice stopped.</br>
</br>
No voice, just four letters.</br>
</br>
[Help]</br>
</br>
&lt;Help&gt;</br>
</br>
"This, this is impossible... Wait, it is a half-finished product. No, even if it is a half-finished product, it is impossible for the technological level in the atomic era to achieve this," Lin Lin's eyes widened as she said in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Looking at the shocked Lin Lin, Jiang Chen looked puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Half-finished product? Could you explain it to me?"</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen's question, Lin Lin glanced at him.</br>
</br>
"Think carefully, when you use the fourth-dimensional messenger to communicate with me, would the strength of the signal change with location?"</br>
</br>
"I don't think so."</br>
</br>
"This is the problem." Lin Lin pointed at the briefcase, "The Klein particle transmitting in the fourth dimension would not have its signal changed because of the shift in three-dimensional coordinates. Or rather, it doesn't possess the physics properties such as energy or speed. It is only a hypothetical wave. It would receive a certain signal at a certain time, it is that simple."</br>
</br>
"Could it be received in any corner of the universe?" Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
"It can. So it is also referred to as communication particle in the intergalactic era. Since with electromagnetic wave, there is a delay of one second from earth to the moon, it would take over half a year to get to the Oort cloud at the edge of the solar system. Without the restriction of the third dimension, as long as it is broadcasted to the same time coordinate, the signal can be received in any corner of the universe. And even before the war, it was a project at the frontier of science. However, even for me now, I could only do this with two crystals with the same origin and communicate in the form of resonance," Lin Lin said.</br>
</br>
Because it was too magical. Compared to the Klein particles, the electromagnetic wave was more similar to sending a message on a pigeon.</br>
</br>
"Then why would the signal from this thing decrease with increasing distance?" Jiang Chen asked, confused.</br>
</br>
"This is why it is a half-finished product. Or rather, the person producing it never understood the principle behind it. The person probably only followed a diagram to create something similar."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin sighed, paused, and provided a rather simple analogy.</br>
</br>
"For example, I have a phone, and I passed the phone back to the stone age and told him he can use this to call me. He never saw this before as they always used messenger pigeons to communicate and have no concept of communicating with a phone. So he used a dumb method, that is carving the letters onto the phone, and then relaying the message to me by tieing the phone to the messenger pigeon."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a funny expression on his face, but he suddenly realized something.</br>
</br>
"Could it be the message from the future sent the diagram to create the fourth-dimensional messenger back. Someone used the diagram to create the communication device but didn't how to "call," so the person used electromagnetic waves to send it and broadcasted Klein particle waves into the third dimension.</br>
</br>
"That's a possibility." Lin Lin didn't disagree with Jiang Chen's perspective. "Let's hypothetically say the video you showed me last time was a mature phase of the Klein particle communication technology. The friendly hello was the greeting from the people in the "future" or the "primal." At the same time of the greeting, it also brought you advanced technology. Along with the message would include the manufacturing method to create a Klein particle communication device."</br>
</br>
"Those incredible technologies?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recollected the incredible technology the Third Reich brought out during the Second World war as Jiang Chen had a strange expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Lin Lin nodded. "Do you remember what I told you last night? Some people can interpret these signals in the form of dream with this special wave effect. But, these special brains could only passively receive information. Just like a deaf person on the phone, you would not know if the other side is listening to you speak. To be able to confirm if the people in the past received the information or not, what you need to do is simple, it is to send the method of communication as well as coordinate along with it."</br>
</br>
"Then did this "help" ever get heard by the people in the future?"</br>
</br>
"Obviously not." Lin Lin sighed, she closed the fourth-dimensional messenger. "That person clearly overestimated the "primitive" ability to understand. Even the strongest pigeon would not fly through the distance of time."</br>
</br>
Until its collapse, the Third Reich didn't manage to communicate with the voice in the future.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't say anything as he quietly looked at the briefcase thinking about something else.</br>
</br>
"Can I open this briefcase?" Lin Lin pointed at it.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but I didn't manage to find the key to open it, so I am not sure if there is a trap mine inside." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"That is simple." Lin Lin had a prideful smile emerge on her face as she put the briefcase on her experiment table. "I am not that dumb to be tricked by the primal's trap."</br>
</br>
There was no mine inside, it was easily opened.</br>
</br>
A black metallic ball slightly bigger than a baseball along with a notebook was inside.</br>
</br>
"This is..." Jiang Chen picked up the black ball and carefully observed its surface.</br>
</br>
There was no opening on it as it didn't look like it could be opened. Jiang Chen managed to find a neat line of small letters on it.</br>
</br>
"German?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was troubled as he knew only one foreign language.</br>
</br>
"Use this." Lin Lin threw a translucent carbon graphene card into Jiang Chen's hand, "As long as the writing is not too messy, this thing can easily translate it into any common language."</br>
</br>
"Woah, this is amazing!" Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen's shocked expression, a glimpse of proudness appeared on the tip of Lin Lin's lips.</br>
</br>
She enjoyed viewing his "primal" reaction. It made her feel like a God, any "offering" would gain the worship of her "believers."</br>
</br>
However, she didn't make it as it was the scavenger team who managed to pick it up. She only fixed it up.</br>
</br>
Usually, things like this would be thrown into the extraction tank and recycled for useful material, since the apocalypse didn't require translation. But the reason why she fixed it was due to Yao Yao's request since as a digitalized human, Lin Lin herself didn't need it.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple?" After attaching the translation card to the line of small writing, Jiang Chen read out loud.</br>
</br>
It was a pure black metallic ball, why would it be called the Golden Apple?</br>
</br>
"Let me look at it, you can go read that notebook." Lin Lin took the golden apple from Jiang Chen's hand as she couldn't wait to work on an experimental apparatus.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood why she couldn't wait another second.</br>
</br>
This feeling was as if a cell phone was found in a grave dated back to the Han dynasty.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the notebook and opened the cover.</br>
</br>
A diary.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the secret is hidden inside his diary.</br>

</div></br>
April 13, 1945, rain.</br>
</br>
It was raining in Berlin.</br>
</br>
The expression on everyone's face was gloomy, just like the clouds above the Berlin sky.</br>
</br>
There was tragic news from afar. After a few days of intense battle on the streets, Vienna had finally fallen to the hands of the Soviets. At the same time, Koenigsberg had also fallen, those polar bears have finally achieved the dream they didn't manage to accomplish for a few centuries - claim the capital of East Prussia.</br>
</br>
There has been no good news from the east line for a long time. The same was happening to the west line.</br>
</br>
Anyone knew it was the end of the Reich.</br>
</br>
As a soldier, excuse me for making too many comments on the fate of the Reich, but from a husband, a father perspective, I would rather the UA citizens arrive in Berlin first.</br>
</br>
God, what am I even saying?</br>
</br>
-</br>
</br>
April 14, fog.</br>
</br>
It was foggy. Perhaps it is going to turn sunny soon.</br>
</br>
There was good news. Whether the east line or the west line, they didn't send back any worse news.</br>
</br>
There was no better news than this. But everyone knew, this was the quietness before the storm.</br>
</br>
In the morning, I received an order for a position change.</br>
</br>
Should I say the moment finally came? Even though I took on an office role, this is the moment I have to carry a rifle and shed my last blood for the Reich?</br>
</br>
Things didn't go as I had planned, you would never guess who I saw.</br>
</br>
In the Berlin presidential building's basement, I saw the glorious leader!</br>
</br>
I could not describe the excitement in my heart. I haven't heard his inspiring speech for a long time. A lot of people said that he ran away with his mistress, but at that moment, all the rumors were wrong. He was still in Berlin! He still stood with us.</br>
</br>
Although his face looked wrier compared to the last time he appeared in public, his voice still remained inspiring.</br>
</br>
He chatted with me for half an hour and asked me a lot of things. It was hard to believe a nobody like me deserved a meeting with him. I sat face to face with the magnificent him and talked about the history of Berlin.</br>
</br>
When the topic came to an end, he asked me about my loyalty.</br>
</br>
I said, "If you need me, I can carry my gun to fight for you to the death now. Whether it is the east side or the west side."</br>
</br>
He said, "Rather than death, I have a more important mission to give you."</br>
</br>
Hard to believe, the great leader personally granted me the iron cross emblem.</br>
</br>
I was anxious. I didn't achieve anything in the army, and I am not even a soldier in the frontline. What do I have in me to receive such an honor?</br>
</br>
But his words eliminated all of my concerns.</br>
</br>
"If you can complete the mission I am about to give you, your contribution to the Third Reich will be deserving of this emblem."</br>
</br>
</br>
I took the locked briefcase he gave to me.</br>
</br>
Then, I was taken out of the basement.</br>
</br>
I didn't even get to see my wife and daughter for the last time. I got on the Me262B booster jet and flew to Norway.</br>
</br>
To be honest, I didn't want to see them for the last time. Because I already have the feeling that this might be a one-way trip.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
April 15, sunny.</br>
</br>
Perhaps, this will be my last time recording the weather in this diary, at least in the upcoming few months.</br>
</br>
We headed out from the depth of the sea along with the U-234 in different directions while aiming for the same destination - far east, Japan.</br>
</br>
The moment when I boarded the submarine, I realized the critical nature of the circumstance.</br>
</br>
There were 14 people including me. All of them were important people, with the lowest level being a Sargent. If it was not for the iron cross emblem, I don't even know if they would even look at me as a person. But funny enough, no one paid attention to the emblem in front of me, but instead seemed to be more interested in the briefcase in my hand.</br>
</br>
Based on etiquette, everyone introduced themselves. Air force commander, land force colonel, vessel cannon specialist... I was just a communication soldier.</br>
</br>
God, they are the elites of the Reich, why would they be here? Sitting with a nobody like me, taking the U boat to execute a mission to send a "message"?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
April 20.</br>
</br>
Based on what the captain said, we are navigating in the north Atlantic ocean heading to the south Atlantic ocean.</br>
</br>
Because we were in the sea, someone finally stood up to describe the mission details.</br>
</br>
This submarine contained the peek of the Third Reich military technology, such as the diagrams and parts of the V2 rockets, "Junke " jet engine, Tiger tank drawings, Me-262 fighter's all parts and design prints.</br>
</br>
These military technologies and weapon samples will be taken to Tokyo.</br>
</br>
As to the ten barrels, the captain didn't really know either. He just categorized them as a raw material used for some kind of weapon.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the submarine was silent. People whispered amongst each other, or rather spend the time sleeping to decrease the time awake. The only person willing to speak to me was a nuclear physicist named Fabian. Although I didn't understand what nuclear physics exactly is, it didn't interfere with our friendship.</br>
</br>
He said, in this environment, only when people chat with people could they maintain a healthy mind. I agree with his perspective. When I am not writing in the diary, we will talk about other things.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
April 22.</br>
</br>
Today we talked about nuclear physics, although I have absolutely no idea what it is.</br>
</br>
U-235. Based on what Fabian said, it is an ominous set of letter and numbers. It was the code for this U boat, as well as the shortened form of Uranium 235.</br>
</br>
I didn't know what Uranium 235 stood for, and I only heard him say it. This thing can be used to create a powerful bomb. He told me mysteriously if we could bring this ten barrels of uranium to Japan, we can change history.</br>
</br>
I scoffed at the comment, even without going on the battlefield, I knew that a few bombs would not change the victor of the battle. If it could, we already would have done it. We sent at least ten thousand rounds of shells to London.</br>
</br>
"But this bomb is different compared to the other ones."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? What about the V2 rocket?"</br>
</br>
Fabian laughed contemptuously.</br>
</br>
"It is comparable to the combined total of all V1, and V2 rockets launched to London."</br>
</br>
Okay, I think he is a little insane now.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
May 4.</br>
</br>
The situation is becoming worse.</br>
</br>
The Goliath signal station responsible for providing direction for us suddenly lost communication. Immediately, the main navy signal station in Berlin Nahn had also lost contact.</br>
</br>
With the intermittent reception of telegrams, the most worrisome thing we feared still happened.</br>
</br>
Germany already announced its surrendering, the Reich's navy commander Dunnitz had ordered all U boats to immediately surface, put out the white flag and surrender to the Ally force.</br>
</br>
Everyone was silent.</br>
</br>
Someone suggested this may be a conspiracy set up by the allies' intelligence department. But someone pointed out, it may be the cause, since the moment when they boarded the submarine, Berlin was already in a dire situation.</br>
</br>
The co-captain suggested opening radio silence to confirm the validity of the information. But the captain didn't accept his proposal as he ordered to continue.</br>
</br>
U-235 is not part of the force as it directly listened to the order of the leader, there was no need to listen to Dunnitz. The destination is Tokyo.</br>
</br>
Regardless, the submarine continued to cruise. But I could clearly sense, not everyone was pleased with the order, including the captain himself.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
May 10.</br>
</br>
We just sailed by Argentina as we entered the Pacific ocean from the most southern tip of South UA.</br>
</br>
By now, we should finally escape the allies fleet chasing us.</br>
</br>
But no one feels happy about this good news.</br>
</br>
Germany already surrendered, but we are the soldiers of Germany, is there a point for us to continue fighting?</br>
</br>
Perhaps we should surrender to the nearby ally force, as long as we are careful not to meet the British, the UA citizens should let us go home. Since we didn't commit any crimes, the U boat since its departure didn't even fire a single torpedo.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
May 11.</br>
</br>
Another unfortunate thing happened, but it was not from outside the submarine, it was from inside the submarine.</br>
</br>
Someone died. It was Lieutenant Colonel Bertrand. He overdosed on sleeping pills. It was a suicide.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
May 14.</br>
</br>
When I was writing this diary, Fabian had gone insane. He was muttering something repeatedly</br>
</br>
I didn't understand his insane words. "This is not physics. We made a mistake since the start." "It is not a particle, no, it is not even tangible." "It is not that the current technology can't detect it, it doesn't exist in the first place."</br>
</br>
He found me and confessed to me that he is the owner of the key, he pleaded me to take out that briefcase.</br>
</br>
I rejected him, the leader's mission for me is to take it to Tokyo, before that, no one can open this briefcase.</br>
</br>
Seeing my firm attitude, he didn't insist.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
June 1.</br>
</br>
We should have arrived in Okinawa ten days ago, and then on route to Tokyo in safe territory</br>
</br>
But an accident occurred.</br>
</br>
When we arrived in South Pacific ocean, we opened radio silence, but what welcome us was not the Japanese navy, but rather the fault of the UA citizens.</br>
</br>
The side of the submarine was hit, but fortunately, we escaped.</br>
</br>
It looks like Japan lost to the UA in the Pacific war. Pessistimicly, Okinawa may have shifted hands already.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
June 2.</br>
</br>
The captain found Fabian.</br>
</br>
"If we can send this 520 kilograms of Uranium to Tokyo, would it change the outcome of the war?"</br>
</br>
Fabian didn't answer directly.</br>
</br>
"Even if the UA lost New York in a month, would that change the outcome of the war?"</br>
</br>
The captain was silent. Anyone knew that by this point in the war, the conclusion could not be changed by a city.</br>
</br>
"What about that briefcase?"</br>
</br>
Fabian shook his head.</br>
</br>
"It is too late."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
June 4.</br>
</br>
To avoid the search of anti-submarine reconnaissance aircrafts, we had to change course to New Zealand.</br>
</br>
Someone said there are ample amount of supplies on the boat. Perhaps we should find a small island to spend the rest of our lives.</br>
</br>
But someone rebutted that point. Not everyone committed war crimes, a lot of people still have family desperately wanting to know about their safety.</br>
</br>
Finally, the Allied forces made a decision for us.</br>
</br>
At the Small Barrier Island, we were surrounded by three vessels.</br>
</br>
Should we surrender or fight to the death?</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, the captain asked for my opinion, he didn't talk to me since I boarded the submarine.</br>
</br>
To be honest, I have a beautiful wife and an adorable daughter. I don't want to die, I felt ashamed to the iron cross emblem in front of me, but I chose to surrender.</br>
</br>
When he heard my thoughts, the captain let out a breath of relief.</br>
</br>
As if the heavy weight on his shoulders had finally been lifted, he even said thank you to me.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
June 5.</br>
</br>
An unsuspected rebellion.</br>
</br>
The captain died, due to a gunshot.</br>
</br>
Fabian died, he killed himself.</br>
</br>
Only seven people remained on the boat. Other than me, all of them are war criminals. Someone suggested to execute me because I betrayed the will of the leader. But someone suggested, no need to execute me, I only needed to be locked up.</br>
</br>
The people against the surrendering suggested driving the submarine into the Hauraki Bay, going the opposite way to escape the search.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, we found a trench near the Jackson port. As long as we hide there, no one will find us.</br>
</br>
The supplies are enough to hide until the end of the year, once the period of time has passed, we'll land in Australia and spend the rest our life in anonymous.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
That was the end of the diary.</br>
</br>
On the last page, there was a sketch of the iron cross emblem drawn in pencil, the final note on the diary was neatly written in cursive, which was primarily used at the time. With the help of the translator, Jiang Chen read the final line of the journey.</br>
</br>
&lt;In honor of my past country - Elias&gt;</br>
</br>
The U-235 that contained the lost hope of the Third Reich ended up sinking in the trench for eternity, the diary didn't record the reason why the submarine sank. But what Jiang Chen knew was, the person named Elias definitely opened the briefcase.</br>
</br>
Or else this diary wouldn't have appeared in this briefcase.</br>
</br>
Based on the content of the diary, Jiang Chen could have guessed that perhaps he knew it was the end of him. Hitler put all the hope to the uncooperative ally in the far east. He threw the peak of German military technologies into the submarine and even the briefcase that could "communicate with aliens".</br>
</br>
But this U-235 didn't manage to turn the wheel of history.</br>
</br>
Two months later, the UA ended the war with two nuclear bombs.</br>
</br>
"Do you know what this ball is?" Lin Lin let out a long breath as she finished analyzing the metallic ball inside the briefcase.</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen could sense that this thing probably has something to do with the incredible technology the German has introduced.</br>
</br>
And that "help," probably was the plead for help to the people from the "future."</br>
</br>
"A Klein particle messenger." Lin Lin pointed at the small words engraved on the ball, "Although it was crudely made, it could send out Klein particle waves, but it is doing futile work by broadcasting it into space."</br>
</br>
"What's special about it?"</br>
</br>
"Did you remember what I told you before? Every carbon-based creature possesses trace amount of Klein particle and it is usually stored in the back of its head."</br>
</br>
"Therefore?" Jiang Chen seemed to have realized something as his body began to feel cold.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin inhaled..</br>
</br>
"An entire metallic ball worth of brain extract, this is an artificially created crystal... using ten thousand people's brains."</br>
</br>
Ten thousand people...</br>
</br>
To only send out the "help" that will never be heard.</br>
</br>
"This is insane."</br>
</br>
"And what shocked me the most is not the ten thousand lives." Lin Lin paused. "The destination coordinate for the message is from the void."</br>
</br>
"What is the void?"</br>
</br>
"To put it simply, it is a place behind the wormhole, where space, time, and all physic principles are non-existent."</br>
</br>
"Therefore?"</br>
</br>
"Do you remember the story I told you about the six space colonization ships? Three of them headed into the wormhole."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 280"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 280: Whoever begs is a puppy</br>
</div></br>
Behind the wormhole is the void, and the void has no concept of time. Regardless how long the three space colonization ships have been lost for, as long as they can finally escape, then to the outside world, from the moment they entered to their escape was only a glimpse.</br>
</br>
But what was sent to Jiang Chen's world was only a message, not three space colonization ships from the future.</br>
</br>
Based on that fact, Lin Lin only had one hypothesis.</br>
</br>
The three space colonization ships have been trapped in the void for eternity, they have become relative to the wormhole outside the universe, the quantum state of the general existence - not alive, nor died.</br>
</br>
As to the messages sent, it would be easy to understand sending the technology from the future back.</br>
</br>
The purpose was to change the history after World War Two to avoid the Third World War from happening.</br>
</br>
Based on what Lin Lin has said, in the history of the apocalypse, they entered the atomic era after the Second World War. The UA citizens ended the war, not because of the two nuclear bombs, but rather executing "Mission Olympics" they landed on Japan's southernmost island of Kyushu, and then pushed to the main island.</br>
</br>
It was an amphibious landing that was even larger than the Normandy Landing. With 15 Army divisions and 63 Air Force brigades from the European theater, in addition to the Pacific theater forces. With the air and ocean advantage, the Allied force indeed bulldozed through Japan.</br>
</br>
However, in Japan's crazy "local decisive battle" strategy, the Western countries paid a heavy price. It laid the foundation for the Soviet Union's vitality and the rise of the Pan-Asian Cooperation (PAC).</br>
</br>
But in Jiang Chen's world history, that battle never occurred.</br>
</br>
Regardless, that message did change history.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, this world didn't change the slightest. The effort of the three space colonization ships has all been based on the premise of MWi theory (parallel cosmic theory) which is not valid.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, Jiang Chen's existence happened to provide evidence for the validity of the MWi theory.</br>
</br>
The three space colonization ships exiled to the wormhole only changed the history of another parallel timeline.</br>
</br>
The two worlds were two never intercepting parallels.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen didn't appear here, the people in this world (Lin Lin) wouldn't even have known someone attempted to change history.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The golden apple was temporarily kept by Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Although it was a crude form of work, it was the technology from the void. Although the "primitive" could not understand the intricacy of the technology, Lin Lin could.</br>
</br>
This Golden Apple was like an advanced blueprint engraved on a stone wall. If Lin Lin could absorb the technology here, she would make great progress in the field of Klein particle.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed Lin Lin's command to bring the uranium to the basement of the mansion. The uranium will be used to create nuclear bombs, manufactured into ballistic missiles by Jiang Lin, then taken by Jiang Chen to the modern world and deployed in Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
After taking care of the uranium, Jiang Chen went back to Jiang Lin's lab as he picked up the fixed kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
Putting on the suit, Jiang Chen lied on the bed and started to travel.</br>
</br>
The immense pressure of the deep sea returned.</br>
</br>
After he resisted the initial discomfort, he gradually got used to the feeling.</br>
</br>
He pushed away the giant octopus body floating in water, he passed through the cabin door and swam towards the direction of the exit. The containers along the way must be the parts of the booster jet and V2 rocket. In the Second World War era, the technologies were deserving of the recognition as incredible. But now, they could only be considered artifacts.</br>
</br>
And artifacts that could bring trouble.</br>
</br>
Based on this layer of consideration, Jiang Chen didn't bring these artifacts. He had a feeling there were a lot of people still searching for the lost Golden Apple. Only the Third Reich received the information from the future.</br>
</br>
It was better for these things to stay here eternally.</br>
</br>
At the crack of the submarine, Jiang Chen saw the skeleton again.</br>
</br>
In front of the uniform hanged an iron cross emblem.</br>
</br>
He must be the Elias, the Third Reich communication soldier given the last mission.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, Jiang Chen took off the already rusted emblem.</br>
</br>
"Rest in peace."</br>
</br>
He muttered to himself before he turned around.</br>
</br>
After swimming out of the submarine, Jiang Chen adjusted his body position, pressed the button on his right arm, and activated the booster on his back.</br>
</br>
A large quantity of small but dense bubbles burst out. With the high-pressure thrust, Jiang Chen's elevation quickly increased as he headed for the surface.</br>
</br>
The pressure surrounding him began to decrease before finally disappearing.</br>
</br>
"Phew!"</br>
</br>
After returning to the sea surface, Jiang Chen opened his helmet as he breathed the fresh air with his mouth wide open.</br>
</br>
It was already approaching dusk.</br>
</br>
Without noticing, he spent almost an entire day under the sea.</br>
</br>
After looking around, Jiang Chen had a bitter smile on his face.</br>
</br>
The boat he just bought this morning was nowhere to be seen.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was not a wise decision to head to the sea by himself. Without anyone watching the boat, the boat would be pushed away by the waves in no time.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, he was not too far away from the Jackson port.</br>
</br>
He maintained a depth of two meters and opened the booster before he swimming to the nearest land.</br>
</br>
Before it was dark, Jiang Chen landed on a quiet beach.</br>
</br>
After putting the kinetic skeleton into the storage dimension and changing into dry clothes, Jiang Chen took out his phone to confirm his location. Then he walked to the direction of Jackson bay.</br>
</br>
He took a ferry back to Auckland.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived at the Sheraton hotel, it was already seven at night.</br>
</br>
"Why are you back so late? I had spent the entire day in the hotel, so boring," Seeing Jiang Chen return, Liu Yao on the bed pouted her mouth and said coyly.</br>
</br>
"I was dealing with something, but I am done. You can't have spent the entire day staying inside the hotel scrolling through Weibo right?" Jiang Chen sat down by the bed as he slapped her curvy butt.</br>
</br>
"No, I also played some &lt;New Era&gt;." Liu Yao shook the phone screen while giggling. "I only just wanted to try, but it is actually entertaining. How did you think of such a fun game?"</br>
</br>
"The intelligence of a team," Jiang Chen laughed and answered ambiguously.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao laughed and covered her mouth, but she pouted again.</br>
</br>
She sluggishly adjusted to a different position. Her luscious black hair had spread out on the bed from her shoulder. Then she put her face beside Jiang Chen's.</br>
</br>
"So annoying, I have to go back tomorrow. I want to spend more time with you."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then stay here." Jiang Chen laughed nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"What about the movie?" Liu Yao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen cutely.</br>
</br>
"Skip it."</br>
</br>
With a blushing face, Liu Yao was tempted for one moment before she shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Nah, I'll go back. If I stay, I feel like I might delay your important tasks."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused, he looked at the moonlight in her crystal clear eyes.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said softly into Liu Yao's ear.</br>
</br>
"No need to thank me." Liu Yao naughtily bit Jiang Chen's ear, "Compensate me."</br>
</br>
The warm air that breezed by his ear lit up an intimate fire.</br>
</br>
A smirk appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Compensate? Can your body handle it?" While he said that, his hand slipped down to her waist.</br>
</br>
"What would you know without trying?" Liu Yao glanced at Jiang Chen seductively as she pouted.</br>
</br>
"If you beg, you are a puppy," Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
"Fine..." Liu Yao said in defense.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Two hours later.</br>
</br>
The "bark bark" sound mixed with embarrassment and intimacy diffused through the bedroom. The melodious and sweet voice lingered.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen sent Liu Yao on the plane.</br>
</br>
Along the way, other than when they were in the taxi, Liu Yao held onto Jiang Chen’s arm with her body almost dangling onto his.</br>
</br>
Their "intimate" stance made all those passing by, glance at them.</br>
</br>
The reason why Liu Yao was this clingy was not due to some impure reason, but because Jiang Chen made her too tired last night.</br>
</br>
Till now, her legs were still quivering.</br>
</br>
"Didn’t we agree that if I barked, I surrender?" Liu Yao almost tripped as she pinched Jiang Chen’s waist out of embarrassment.</br>
</br>
Whenever she remembered she had to pretend to be a puppy and bark, she felt flustered and ashamed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, sorry, that voice was too attractive." Jiang Chen let the hand pinch freely around his waist as he smirked, "Also, did I say even if you surrender, I will let you go?"</br>
</br>
"Pervert." Liu Yao rolled her eyes at the grinning Jiang Chen as she stopped in front of the boarding gate.</br>
</br>
She combed her hair to the side, used all the power in her body to stand up straight, tipped her toe, and pecked on Jiang Chen’s lips.</br>
</br>
"Remember to miss me."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
It was not a long goodbye; there was no need for words.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao picked up her small luggage. She left, but her heart remained.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the flight depart; he smiled at the clouds in the distance before the smile gradually returned to calmness.</br>
</br>
"Now that the vacation is over, time to work."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he left the airport.</br>
</br>
He didn’t return to the hotel but took a taxi to the rural area.</br>
</br>
In a park, Jiang Chen spotted Zhang Yapin in a black tee, looking around on the bench.</br>
</br>
"Why did you choose to meet in the park? I rather sit in a coffee shop and chat slowly with a cup of coffee." Sitting on the other side of the bench, Jiang Chen sat nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Because of privacy," Zhang Yapin’s expression looked tense, but his voice was calm.</br>
</br>
"You are overthinking things. This is New Zealand, not Pannu." Looking at his anxiousness, Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
He originally thought the Pannu opposing party would take a week to give him a response, but from the looks of it, they couldn’t wait anymore.</br>
</br>
"It is always better to be careful."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged without denying. Then he dove right into the topic.</br>
</br>
"Since you are here, then your response must be yes. Am I correct?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, we don’t have any other choices," Zhang Yapin nodded as he squeezed those words out with difficulty.</br>
</br>
"Before we discuss the support agreement. Can I know what caused you to decide so quickly?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen’s words, Zhang Yapin fell into silence.</br>
</br>
"It is blood."</br>
</br>
He slowly told Jiang Chen the story.</br>
</br>
Two days ago, just when he returned to the Pannu Island, the political situation began to deteriorate.</br>
</br>
</br>
Everything was because of a Han's arrival.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng, Linhua Group. The business representative stationed on Pannu Islands. This Han businessman seemed to have a great conversation with Johnny as they appeared in multiple important occasions standing side by side while investigating the investment environment, and finally signed an agreement known as the fuse.</br>
</br>
President Edward sold the area along the sea of Coro Island as well as the majority of the island on the second biggest island Edgar Island at a price of 5 USD per square meter to Johnny International. Linhua Group will be responsible for building the tourism area and necessary infrastructure. The one hundred million USD in land sales, only half of it flowed into the treasury, while the other fifty million USD flowed into Edward’s account in New Zealand.</br>
</br>
The confiscation of land caused a large number of farmers and fishers to lose their homes. The compensation of 2 USD per square meter was not enough to cover their loss.</br>
</br>
The dissatisfaction caused unrest, and the war hawk of the Liberal party saw this as an opportunity as they stood up in such a dangerous moment. They called for the farmers and fishers who lost their land to protest in front of the presidential palace.</br>
</br>
But would Edward care? In the position where there was no hope. His status being lower than a city official in New Zealand, he still managed to gain almost one hundred million. It was worth it for him.</br>
</br>
God, the GDP of Pannu Island was barely one hundred million USD a year; the tax income was less than one hundred million.</br>
</br>
With the amount of money he has received, he could easily go to any corner of the world and become a wealthy man after the end of his term. He wanted to go to Britain. Although he had an English heritage, he has never been there before.</br>
</br>
Just as he pretended to persuade the public to remain calm, an unlucky young man threw a soggy banana at his face.</br>
</br>
Edward was enraged.</br>
</br>
Especially when listening to those "natives'" outrageous laughter while they worshipped the young man like a warrior.</br>
</br>
The next second that young man was lying in a pool of blood.</br>
</br>
Seeing the smoke coming from the muzzle of the soldier beside the president, everyone was shocked.</br>
</br>
No one expected a peaceful protest would turn into violence.</br>
</br>
The flat-headed "chief" military tank was a gift given by Britain to the Pannu Island government, the only heavy military equipment on the island. During the eighties, Britain finally remembered the fallen behind little brother as they engaged in negotiations for them to join the British Commonwealth. The talk happened to occur when the British army was replacing its arms. Thus the challenger I replaced the "chief" from the sixties, so the scrapped tank was given as a gift to the Pannu Island government.</br>
</br>
Although the talk to join the British Commonwealth ultimately failed.</br>
</br>
The Pannu Island people didn’t think that the enraged Edward would use violence against the protestors.</br>
</br>
Blood stained the street.</br>
</br>
Guns and cannons drove the protestors away.</br>
</br>
15 died, 57 were injured. As the leader of the protest Pannu Liberal Party also experienced bloody suppression and arrest.</br>
</br>
As to the promised compensation, Edward didn’t pay a single cent.</br>
</br>
"He is a devil." Zhang Yapin was shaking from anger.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as he thought with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
"What’s your plan?"</br>
</br>
"We need five million USD to buy rifles, anti-tank weapons, and ammunition." Zhang Yapin took a deep breath as the words slowly came out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"No problem. Do you have the channels to purchase the weapons?" Jiang Chen asked in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"We contacted a UA citizen; his name is Robert-"</br>
</br>
"No no no. It is better for you not to disclose these names, including mine. I don’t want to see you telling everyone that "Jiang Chen funded us, the president of Future Technology", Jiang Chen immediately interrupted Zhang Yapin’s words.</br>
</br>
After pausing for a moment, he nodded in realization as he said apologetically.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I didn’t consider things properly. I hope you…"</br>
</br>
"I will keep this a secret, when do you plan to start?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Everything was within his control.</br>
</br>
"Once the fund is in place," Zhang Yapin said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Do you have a plan?" Jiang Chen asked in a light voice.</br>
</br>
"We organized 400 civil soldiers. Once we are equipped with weapons, we will attack the military camp on Coro Island. Once we capture the armory, we will use the equipment in the armory to equip more citizens. That bastard Edward must face the anger of the Pannu people!" Zhang Yapin said gritting his teeth.</br>
</br>
It was obvious it was the first time for him to rebel. Who would so easily disclose their plan?</br>
</br>
Even with the investor.</br>
</br>
After listening to his plan, Jiang Chen nodded. Then he took out his phone.</br>
</br>
"The money has arrived, you can start."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was shocked, he didn’t think Jiang Chen would be so decisive.</br>
</br>
"Is there no need to sign a contract-"</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen shook his head. "You can discuss things with me after you win. I believe you will keep your promise. For the freedom of humanity, go, young man."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin looked graciously at Jiang Chen as he nodded sincerely.</br>
</br>
"I will keep my promise. Pannu’s new government will not forget the people that helped them."</br>
</br>
"That’s enough, go on." Jiang Chen waved his hand.</br>
</br>
Agreement? To a government still in its infancy, it was no different than a verbal agreement. Especially since Jiang Chen didn’t care for the benefits the new Pannu government would bring him, but rather the benefits he would gain from the civil war.</br>
</br>
Once Zhang Yapin’s taxi was far enough, Jiang Chen stood up from the bench.</br>
</br>
He didn’t put the phone way. Instead, he called Robert.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After calling Robert and notifying him to begin the next steps, Jiang Chen called the mercenary base in Niger and asked Ivan to take a few of his comrades to meet him in Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
After finishing the two calls, Jiang Chen returned to the hotel and booked a plane ticket to Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
Before the Liberal Party's official uprise, he still had some preparations to do.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Pannu Islands airport was still as empty as usual. Although a deepwater port had recently been built, which brought some noise to the island far away from international affairs, the outdated infrastructure, as well as the small population, made it hard to see unfamiliar faces on the island.</br>
</br>
Especially since the political situation had deteriorated as of late, the investment prospect for this place had significantly decreased.</br>
</br>
Although the ten billion USD development plan drew the attention of many capitalists, the project had just begun. Additionally, if the political unrest resulting from the confiscation of land could be solved through peaceful measures was still unknown.</br>
</br>
If they followed the investment, once the protest escalated to military conflict, not only would the project go down the drain, the agreement they signed with the old political regime would also become scrap paper.</br>
</br>
Before the situation clears up, the cunning international capitals would not make a rushed decision. Only when the opposing party or current regime was at an advantageous position would it be the best opportunity to bet.</br>
</br>
Despite all the negative influences, there were still a few people in the airport.</br>
</br>
They were mostly reporters from the "Free World." Although they have never heard of this secluded island, it didn't stop them from commenting on the human rights and corruption problem on the island.</br>
</br>
But something was odd inside the airport today.</br>
</br>
Approximately fifteen strange faces with luggage walked through the empty airport terminal. They stood up among the rest of the people.</br>
</br>
Their muscular bodies, sharp steps, grimacing vibe, from these points alone, their identity were not ordinary.</br>
</br>
Future Security was their identity. The person leading was the chief trainer Ivan, the other fourteen were "outstanding" employees.</br>
</br>
To the not-so-friendly looking group, the staff at the airport began to focus their attention on them. However, none of them went up to question the group. After checking their documents procedurally, the staff let them pass through customs.</br>
</br>
The only two security guards at the airport were given pistols to keep peace on the streets. Regardless of the intentions of these people, the country's situation couldn't get worse.</br>
</br>
In front of the airport parked five Senators.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands' transportation was terrible. No metro, no public transit, there weren't even taxis. To exaggerate, it was hard to see a single car on the road.</br>
</br>
</br>
After seeing the oriental face leaning against the car, Ivan's aged face smiled.</br>
</br>
"Buddy, we meet again." Jiang Chen extended his right hand and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see, boss. Haha." The Slavic soldier shook Jiang Chen's hand furiously as he grinned.</br>
</br>
In only four months, he was a shade darker. His entire body smelled of sand.</br>
</br>
As well as chaos.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk on the car." Jiang Chen waved his hand and signaled the soldiers behind him to head to the cars.</br>
</br>
Precisely speaking, they were all guards from Future Security.</br>
</br>
Because of the deterioration of the Pannu Islands' current regime, Jiang Chen used this excuse and submitted a request to hire foreign securities to the Pannu government to prevent damage to his asset. The reason was not relevant. They used the usual routine of stuffing a bag full of money before the visa was approved in the same afternoon.</br>
</br>
16 people; five cars. Although it was a bit tight, everyone still managed to fit.</br>
</br>
Behind Jiang Chen's car, the others cars lined up together and headed towards Jiang Chen's import and export company in Coro Island.</br>
</br>
"How was your stay in Niger?" Jiang Chen held on the steering wheel as he asked Ivan, the head trainer.</br>
</br>
"Not bad. Those little guys finally had their claws sharpened. I remember when they first came, they couldn't even hold their gun steady. But now, they have learned how to kill people." With proudness on his face, Ivan lowered the car window as he lit up a cigarette.</br>
</br>
"Did they head onto the battlefield?" Jiang Chen asked in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, we engaged in battle with the guerrillas." Ivan blew out the smoke ring as he grinned, "Do you still remember the Tuareg Clan?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, Robert and I had a friendly visit with them." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
AK, camels, and the disgusting camel milk. It was the only impressions Jiang Chen had to that poor and outdated clan.</br>
</br>
"But they are not friendly." Ivan dusted the cigarette outside the window as he continued, "A month ago, they were asking us for money, fresh water, and bullets, but I rejected them. That night, the guerrillas pretended to be Al Queda raiding us."</br>
</br>
"And then?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"They left twenty bodies." Jiang Chen cracked a smile. "I have to say, boss, the rifle you provided is great. Even if it was in a sandstorm, it didn't malfunction once, and the penetration power was insane."</br>
</br>
"Of course, it is a customized weapon." Jiang Chen said. He also added in his mind, it is the rifle from the future after all.</br>
</br>
Ivan shrugged as he didn't continue the conversation about the weapon. He knew his boss has a mysterious background, so he didn't ask more.</br>
</br>
"What about the Niger side? Did they express anything?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing. Their soldiers are a bunch of cowards and are afraid to bother the uneducated citizens in the deserts. The Barkary guy you hired reported to the minister of commerce about this, but the Niger government suggested that they restrain their military force within their jurisdiction. They ended up not taking a side as they sent a representative in an attempt to negotiate peace. Offending us would be saying no to the dollar, offending that uncivilized tribe would be going against the security of the country." Ivan narrowed his eyes as he looked at the subtropical sceneary outside the window.</br>
</br>
"In the end? Did the Tuareg natives compromise?"</br>
</br>
"Obviously not." Ivan burst out laughing, "But they were smarter. They knew they couldn't win alone, so they dragged the terrorists in with an extremely ambiguous relationship. RPG, Toyota pickup truck, machine guns... But their attempts were useless. In firepower, we wouldn't lose to them.</br>
</br>
"Were there casualties?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." As Ivan said this, he eyes remained squinted into the distance.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't expect casualties to occur.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at him but didn't blame this on him.</br>
</br>
Although people died, a group of warriors who have been through the flames of war came out of it, it was the fortunate situation out of the unfortunate event.</br>
</br>
"What about the family of the casualties?" Jiang Chen asked lightly.</br>
</br>
"In the base. Since they just lost their husband, if we force them away-" Hearing Jiang Chen ask about the families, Ivan was afraid that Jiang Chen would be displeased with his treatment as he rushed to explain.</br>
</br>
"No, you did a great job," Jiang Chen interrupted his words.</br>
</br>
Ivan let out a breath of relief when he heard Jiang Chen say that.</br>
</br>
Although he looked down on the refugees that always complained about everything they did, after months of training, it would be unfair to say he didn't develop a relationship with them. Especially when they were attacked by the guerrillas, they fought together.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I was worried that you would kick them out from the base. Since from a company's point of view, they are extraneous." Ivan smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"Don't be mistaken, Ivan. I never said Future Security is a company." Jiang Chen smiled, he looked at Ivan and said seriously, "We are an army."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 283: Celestial Trade</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Coro Island was the main island located on the southernmost tip of the Pannu Islands. Northwest of the island was Country F, and southwest of it was Australia and New Guinea. Finally, to the direct south was New Zealand.</br>
</br>
The only airport in the country was situated on Coro Island. On the southernmost tip of this island was also the only deep water harbor of the country- built by Johnny International at the cost of over a million USD.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, these massive deepwater harbors would have a ring of factories surrounding it. But with the pillar industries of Pannu Islands being fishery and farming, the commonality didn't seem to apply.</br>
</br>
Beside the deepwater harbor was only three warehouses.</br>
</br>
A brown-skinned local was chewing on a sugarcane as he sat outside the outermost warehouse, guarding the door.</br>
</br>
His name is Cassan, a native of the Pannu Islands. He wasn't well educated, but he could do the job of a security guard very well. His daily task was to sit in front of the warehouse, guard the phone, help when goods need to be offloaded, and chew on sugarcane when there was nothing to do.</br>
</br>
When the five Senatas stopped in front of the gate, the young man glanced enviously at the cars a few times before throwing away the sugarcane in his mouth and walking towards them.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade, this is my company here," Jiang Chen introduced to Ivan as they got off the car.</br>
</br>
Though it was only a shell company with a security guard. All the business was outsourced to elsewhere.</br>
</br>
"Celestial? That's a weird name," Looking at the letters on the giant warehouse, Ivan exclaimed.</br>
</br>
As they chit-chatted, the security guard Cassan walked in front of them and smiled at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Boss, why are you here?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen arrived in the Pannu Islands two days ago but he had been busy with other things, so it was his first time here. Seeing the boss here personally, Cassan was very surprised.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, just open the door for me."</br>
</br>
"Which one?"</br>
</br>
"Warehouse three."</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay!" Cassan nodded as he immediately took out the key and ran to open the metal gate.</br>
</br>
After sending Cassan outside, Jiang Chen signaled Ivan and the crew to walk into the warehouse and stand in front of a container.</br>
</br>
After dragging the container open, there was a row of automatic rifles inside.</br>
</br>
It was not the reaper rifles he brought back from the apocalypse, they were the standard M series assault rifles common on the black market, and also the civilian type.</br>
</br>
"Mission?" Ivan immediately put on a serious expression.</br>
</br>
The 14 people behind him also lined up waiting for Jiang Chen's order.</br>
</br>
"Don't be anxious, there is still some time before the show really starts. This mission is only a warm-up." Jiang Chen signaled them not to be too tense.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cleared his throat and pointed at the weapons in the container.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Considering the deterioration of the Pannu Islands' political situation, for the time being, the security of these warehouses will depend on you. There are 15 gun licenses in the container. I requested it through a special channel from the current regime. You can use them once you write your name on the licenses. To people attempting to break into the warehouses, first time fire a warning shot, second time shooting is permitted.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Ivan answered affirmatively.</br>
</br>
As to Jiang Chen's mission, he had no other questions, as was the same for the soldiers behind him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. He was delighted by the veteran's attitude.</br>
</br>
"There are materials here to construct a temporary camp. All in all, the security here will be up to you."</br>
</br>
"Leave it to us." Ivan smiled.</br>
</br>
He then cleanly turned around, looked at his comrades, and shouted at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
"Did you understand the mission!"</br>
</br>
"Understood!" 14 uniform responses roared thunderously.</br>
</br>
"Get moving!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! Sir!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After seeing Jiang Chen come out, Cassan strolled over in fearful steps.</br>
</br>
"Boss, who are they?"</br>
</br>
He heard all the noise inside the warehouse.</br>
</br>
"The security company I hired. You don't need to mind them, just do your usual routine. Don't peek at things you shouldn't peek at and don't say things you shouldn't say. Just remember these two points and you are good to go."</br>
</br>
Cassan gulped and fiercely nodded. Then he replied with unease.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
He only wanted to find a comfortable job; he didn't want any trouble. He could receive a wage of 10 USD per day by being bored and chewing on sugarcane while sitting in front of the warehouse's door, it was like a dream come true.</br>
</br>
Knowing that the young man wouldn't find trouble for himself, Jiang Chen didn't say too much about confidentiality.</br>
</br>
"Give me the spare key to the warehouse."</br>
</br>
Cassan immediately took off a set of keys from his waist and handed them to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You can go home early today." Jiang Chen took the key as he patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Cassan nodded as he was smart enough to not ask about anything more. He picked up the sugarcane he didn't finish before heading home.</br>
</br>
Seeing Cassan walk away, Jiang Chen walked to warehouse one.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dragged open the metal door and looked at the goods inside. A smile surfaced on his face.</br>
</br>
Five hundred square meters of space was stuffed by all kinds of containers.</br>
</br>
There were dairy products from Australia, airtight-sealed meat, and canned food manufactured by Xinlong Food Processing Plant. Pork, lamb, and other kinds of fresh meat were stuffed in ten giant freezers. The bags of rice piled into a small mountain.</br>
</br>
"Woah, with the average height being two meters, this is at least over one thousand tons of food." Jiang Chen looked at the mountain-high pile of food and was shocked.</br>
</br>
Estimating one pound of food a day, one thousand tons of food could last half a million people for one month. Compared to the population on Sixth Street of less than fifty thousand, Fishbone base could barely break the one thousand mark even with the increase in population.</br>
</br>
Not only would the daily consumption for over half a year be solved, but this quantity would also be enough to supply their trading needs.</br>
</br>
The good thing was Jiang Chen is overseas. If this batch of food disappeared in Hua, there would definitely be some problems.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't immediately start transporting. Instead, he went out and opened warehouse two.</br>
</br>
Warehouse two stored the equally scarce salt on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
The salt need for Wanghai City mostly depended on the survival camps such as Liuding Town near the coast, but the production quantity was low. Because of the limitation in production, the quality of salt was also not high. It was against the law to store salt on a large scale, but on the volatile Pannu Islands, it was not a big deal.</br>
</br>
Other than containers full of salt, there were beers, fruits, and fish produced locally.</br>
</br>
These products were custom made. There was no package on them at all.</br>
</br>
These products would be hard to pass through customs in other countries, but it was not an issue in Pannu. Jiang Chen just stuffed a few hundred dollar bills to solve the problem that was not even a problem.</br>
</br>
After verifying the goods, all there was left to do was making round trips to move the supplies.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen looked the piles of supplies, he had a troubled smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"How long would moving these take..."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was night time already when Jiang Chen finished moving the two warehouses of stuff.</br>
</br>
The good thing was the size of the storage dimension had been expanded to twenty-something cubic meters. If the storage dimension remained one cubic meter big, he would die of exhaustion before transporting the thousand tons of supplies.</br>
</br>
"My god, did you rob the granary?" After seeing the supplies piled mountain high in the backyard, Sun Jiao was utterly shocked.</br>
</br>
Although the base never lacked food, it was the first time she saw so much food.</br>
</br>
"Do I need to rob such a little amount of food? On our side, this whole pile only costs seven hundred thousand USD." Looking at Sun Jiao's expression, a smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face as he used a slightly proud tone.</br>
</br>
Out of the seven hundred thousand USD, a decent portion was spent on transportation. Pannu Islands were surrounded by agricultural powerhouses, it was cheap to export from Australia and New Zealand.</br>
</br>
"But this is too much..." Looking at the small mountain, Sun Jiao's mouth remained wide open as she said blankly.</br>
</br>
Watching the rare expression on Sun Jiao's face, Jiang Chen smiled joyfully as he patted on her waist.</br>
</br>
"Okay, stop staring at it so blankly. Get people to move it to the warehouse."</br>
</br>
With a red face, Sun Jiao seemed to have realized her gaffe. She gave him a dirty look before running to the community center to find Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched Sun Jiao ran out before he turned to gaze into the dark night sky.</br>
</br>
It was already February. After this month passes, the snow will stop.</br>
</br>
On the wasteland, spring was hunting season.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the mutants who just finished hibernating or the bandits that stayed dormant for an entire winter, they were all hungrily waiting for the snow to melt, waiting for the two legged or four legged preys to come from under the shambles.</br>
</br>
"A lot of things happened this winter." Jiang Chen shook his head, tightened his coat, and walked inside the mansion.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
1302 tons of supplies. Counting and recording of each item didn't finish until noon of the next day. Additionally, everything had to be stored properly.</br>
</br>
300 tons of food was left in the base as supplies and for daily consumption. The other 1002 tons were transported to the Sixth Street warehouses using the underground sewerage. Half of them would be sold locally while the other half would be transported to the nearby Su City and Hang City with the transport fleet formed by the Zhao Corporation in exchange for crystals and other limited supplies.</br>
</br>
Although they didn't know how the food was transported to the base, it didn't prevent the survivors in the base from smiling at the filled warehouse. Although not everyone could eat in the cafeteria, as long as they continued to work hard, one day they will become an upper citizen and enjoy the unlimited amount of food.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was New Year.</br>
</br>
Because of Jiang Chen's sudden thought, the survivors put up a row of tents on the square in front of the community center for the "New Year Dinner".</br>
</br>
Just this one night, regardless of status or position, as long as one is interested, anyone could request for a tent to cook their favorite food and share their food with other people.</br>
</br>
The food in the warehouse would not be limited, the base's administration would provide food and fuel for all tents.</br>
</br>
The only strict rule that must be followed was no waste! Any waste of food would be strictly punished.</br>
</br>
But the facts soon proved Jiang Chen was worrying too much.</br>
</br>
These people who never saw this much food would never waste food! They all ate till their stomachs were about the blow-up. They only regretted they were not born with two mouths.</br>
</br>
Considering the base had no stomach medicine, after some thought, Jiang Chen had to add in an additional rule - "No vomiting in the next 24 hours or you have to eat everything you puke out!"</br>
</br>
This rule was to ensure people were more rationale when it came to enjoying the food.</br>
</br>
Of course, food was not the only thing. The survivors started a bonfire in the middle of the square as people began to perform.</br>
</br>
They might not sing great sounding songs and the dances might not be the most elegant, but it was cheerful indeed.</br>
</br>
People held their steamy bowls and circled around the square. They drank soup while eating barbequed meat. It was a great time.</br>
</br>
Although the radiation dust in the sky was still depressing, and the ashen white snowflake was still cold, but the flames above the bonfire burned away the gloom in people's heart.</br>
</br>
Standing on the top of the community center with Sun Jiao by his side was Jiang Chen smiling as he watched the joyful and happy faces.</br>
</br>
"Are you happy?" Sun Jiao looked at the side of Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Half a year ago, this place was a mansion area half in shambles. While there were no people here, zombies visited this place.</br>
</br>
Who would have thought that just in half a year, this place would be transformed into such prosperity?</br>
</br>
Looking at the smile on Jiang Chen's face, Sun Jiao blushed as she also smiled.</br>
</br>
Not because of the base's growth, but because of the person she loves' growth.</br>
</br>
Half a year ago, she wouldn't have thought that he who couldn't even beat a chicken would grow to achieve many feats.</br>
</br>
"How much food would we consume today?" Although she complained, she didn't show any signs of bitterness on her face. It was a loving banter between couples.</br>
</br>
"Now that we have met their basic needs, it is also important to meet their spiritual needs. Spending energy on outdoor activity is better than drinking and doing drugs." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"That's true." Starring at the cheerful atmosphere on the square, Sun Jiao had a reminiscent expression on her face.</br>
</br>
"What are you thinking about?"</br>
</br>
"Something far away."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao used a reminiscent tone. "During my days in the fallout shelter, although I wouldn't feel the temperature difference in the weather, during this special occasion every year, people would gather together to celebrate. I still faintly remember the day my father would tell us stories about what happened on the ground above. He said it would snow up there and people had firecrackers, enjoying the delicious New Year dinner... Although when the fallout shelter opened did I realize everything was false, everything was just a fairytale.</br>
</br>
During the period of lockdown in the fallout shelter, it was like a secluded island. While it isolated the radiation, it also isolated any electromagnetic waves. No external messages could come in.</br>
</br>
But people still firmly believed that the moment the metal gates opened, everything would be beautiful. Since the image left in these people's eyes were the flash before the nuclear explosion and not the cruelty of the shockwave sweeping through the crowd.</br>
</br>
"Do you think... your father lied to you?" Jiang Chen asked gently.</br>
</br>
"I thought that way before, but then I grew to understand." Sun Jiao shook her head. A perplexed expression appeared on her face as she gazed at the bonfire in the distance. "Human is a fragile creature, without hope, we will not survive."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Even if they knew that the moment the doors opened, only shambles awaited them, if they didn't optimistically believe in the 1% possibility, then they may not even have the courage to wait till the doors opened.</br>
</br>
"It's New Year, let's not talk about something so depressing," Jiang Chen hugged her around the waist and said gently.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Sun Jiao buried her head embarrassedly to cover her blushed face as the sternness in her eyes were washed away.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, what would you do during New Year on your side?" To get rid of the somber atmosphere, she forcibly changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"I would usually spend it with my parents." When Jiang Chen said that, he felt melancholic.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, he didn't know what kind of identity he would use when he heads home now. At least this New Year, he probably wouldn't have the opportunity to visit them.</br>
</br>
"Do you miss home?" Sun Jiao detected the strangeness in Jiang Chen's eyes as she asked caringly.</br>
</br>
"I went back just not long ago. I wouldn't say I miss it too much. My parents' health is good and they are living a happy life. As long as they are happy, I don't have much to worry about."</br>
</br>
"I see... Your family are all there, that's good," Sun Jiao murmured to herself.</br>
</br>
"What about your sister?" Jiang Chen felt awkward when he talked about Sun Xiaorou, but he still pushed the words out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Her...body is not doing too well."</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen hastily asked.</br>
</br>
"Lin Lin... Although Tingting destroyed the chip that blocked her memory in the hippocampus, it still affected the nerve in her lower body. Now, she can only sit in a wheelchair." Sun Jiao was feeling down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt perplexed. A part of him was glad that he wasn't the one that made Sun Xiaorou sit in the wheelchair, the other part was feeling sympathetic for her sister.</br>
</br>
"A rare opportunity. You should take her around."</br>
</br>
"Eh? But-" Sun Jiao looked shockingly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Although the base knew that an assassin attempted to assassinate me, they don't know who the assassin was, and no one saw her face. It is better to spend New Year with the family if you still have a family."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused. He had a comforting smile on his face as he continued, "Maybe if you take her around this cheerful atmosphere, the trauma in her mind will be healed. Go now."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm..." Sun Jiao hid her reddened face before heading downstairs.</br>
</br>
Watching Sun Jiao leave, Jiang Chen looked back at the square again.</br>
</br>
People shouted, chatted.</br>
</br>
A young man was strumming a guitar made out of wood as he played an unknown but peaceful melody.</br>
</br>
"Family," Jiang Chen muttered to himself as he suddenly thought of a cute girl.</br>
</br>
She doesn't have a family anymore.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Without surprise, Yao Yao still stayed in her room.</br>
</br>
</br>
She didn't play with her computer or other electronic devices as usual. Right now, she was sitting in front of the table while dangling her feet, unable to touch the ground. Her hands were placed against her chin as she zoned out.</br>
</br>
In the years before, people would play electronic fireworks to celebrate New Year's Eve. But after she woke up, everything changed, if she didn't meet her big brother...</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was too afraid to think what would have happened.</br>
</br>
She really liked this place. No need to face the cold winter; no need to face the repressing radiation dust.</br>
</br>
Just, a bit too lonely.</br>
</br>
"What are you thinking about?" Jiang Chen put his hand on her shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Wa-" The voice from behind her scared her a little.</br>
</br>
After Yao Yao realized it was Jiang Chen, she let out a sigh of relief. She pouted her mouth as she threw a small tantrum.</br>
</br>
"It is not fun bullying a small animal."</br>
</br>
"Then what's fun?" Jiang Chen rubbed her soft hair as he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Wo-, just like this." Yao Yao enjoyably raised her head as she had an expression similar to a cat being petted.</br>
</br>
"Do you not need me to take you out?" Jiang Chen said gently as he felt the temperature mixed with the sweet scent of the girl.</br>
</br>
"Take me out?" Yao Yao tilted her head as she responded, slightly confused.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, they are celebrating New Year outside. People are performing and cooking. Do you not want to see? You will feel too stuffy staying in your room for too long."</br>
</br>
"But...But... Do you not need to stay with sister Sun Jiao?"</br>
</br>
"Eh?" Jiang Chen was confused as he didn't know Yao Yao would suddenly ask this.</br>
</br>
"Everytime brother Jiang Chen comes back, you will always go play with sister Sun Jiao." She blew her cheeks up as she looked away throwing a tantrum. "Although boys like ... bigger boobs, but, but I..."</br>
</br>
She mumbled, but because it was too embarrassing, Yao Yao couldn't finish the next sentence.</br>
</br>
But just as she was about to throw away her humiliation and force all her thoughts out, her tiny lips were blocked.</br>
</br>
Her eyes trembled, then opened wide before closing peacefully.</br>
</br>
Those lips were soft as marshmallows, sweet as honey.</br>
</br>
Long after, Jiang Chen moved his lips away with longing and guilt.</br>
</br>
The silver wire made the pure but misty kiss carry a hint of seduction.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao..."</br>
</br>
She seemed to have sensed Jiang Chen's emotion as a soft smile blossomed on her face.</br>
</br>
"You can."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The legs covered in white stockings stopped shaking as it anxiously closed and rubbed against itself.</br>
</br>
Feeling the intimate moment, Yao Yao closed her adorable, large eyes again, waiting for the moment she has been longing for.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't control himself anymore.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to throw away all sense of guilt and become an animal again, his EP began to ring at an untimely moment again.</br>
</br>
The intimate atmosphere instantly faded.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's face changed to a dark red as she was so flustered that she wanted to dig a hole in the ground and hide inside...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the door of the base, Cheng Weiguo was in a jacket standing with an odd person wearing a blue onesie.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen walk over, his eyes light up as he immediately went up to greet him.</br>
</br>
"Boss, you are finally here." But when he saw the unfriendly expression on Jiang Chen's face, he was confused.</br>
</br>
"Uh, did I do something wrong..."</br>
</br>
"No, you did a great job," Jiang Chen said with a straight face.</br>
</br>
If it was not for the call, he might have been doing some animalistic acts.</br>
</br>
Even Liu Yao couldn't withstand it, let alone Yao Yao who has never been injected with the genetic vaccine. The growth of her body was suppressed.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Cheng Weiguo's phone was too timely.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, Jiang Chen still didn't feel too hot!</br>
</br>
"But you-"</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, let's talk about the important things."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Cheng Weiguo nodded his head and then led Jiang Chen to the weird person in a blue onesie.</br>
</br>
He seemed to be wearing the uniform from a fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"This is the fallout shelter-" Cheng Weiguo cleared his throat as he introduced.</br>
</br>
"Hello, leader of the Fishbone base. Nice to meet you." The person cleared his throat and extended his right hand. "My name is Shi Yongtian. For your outstanding contribution in rebuilding the apocalypse, the PAC government would like to recognize you for your outstanding work."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
[Recognize? Did you get kicked in the head by a donkey?]</br>
</br>
"Who is he?" Jiang Chen ignored the Shi Yongtian guy, but rather glanced at Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
"From his description, he is from Fallout Shelter 027, he seems to be an officer from before the war." Cheng Weiguo let out a sigh as a hint of mockery appeared on his face. "Every once in a while, there will be fallout shelters that open and then a bunch people who have no clue what is going on would return to the surface. They are quite fortunate it is winter right now."</br>
</br>
During the winter, the bandits and raiders were mostly dormant. If the fallout shelter opened in the spring, there would be a higher probability that either fully equipped bandits or slave merchants were waiting for them.</br>
</br>
"Did you say anything to him?"</br>
</br>
"No." Cheng Weiguo shook his head and used a voice the middle-aged Shi Yongtian couldn't hear, "You haven't given out any directions regarding survivors from fallout shelters, so I immediately reported this to you."</br>
</br>
After he listened to Cheng Weiguo's explanation, Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Good, you did a great job."</br>
</br>
When he heard the leader's praise, Cheng Weiguo humbly smiled.</br>
</br>
"Also, what was the Sixth Street's policy on survivors from fallout shelters?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Nothing too different... People that received nutrient supplies would be sent to the ghetto. People with a clearer head would find a job in mercenaries or hunting teams, usually live a nice life."</br>
</br>
At the same time, Cheng Weiguo's expression was slightly awkward. It made him think of the time he was in a fallout shelter. He happened to be one of the slower ones and ended up dragging his wife into receiving nutrient supplies and hence lost their freedom forever.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, showing he understood. Then he turned around to look at the Shi Yongtian he neglected.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's neglect made Shi Yongtian furious, but it only lasted for a moment before he remembered that he had favors to ask. Therefore, he waited patiently for the two peasants to finish talking.</br>
</br>
"I am Jiang Chen, the leader of Fishbone base, the general of the Sixth Street military government, and the governor of the Shenxiang town colony."</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's words, Shi Yongtian raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Excuse me for my straightforwardness, but there is and will only be one government on this land, and it is the great and glorious Pan-Asia Corporation."</br>
</br>
"But they were sent into the sky already," Cheng Weiguo interrupted with a mocking voice, but Shi Yongtian ignored him as he just looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Therefore?" Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"This kind of private enclosure similar to a king's practice is stupid and illegal," Shi Yongtian said with a righteous tone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised, but before he said anything more, Cheng Weiguo had his gun pointed at the fool's head and spoke in a deadly tone.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Apologize, or perhaps I should make a hole in your head first."</br>
</br>
The sudden turn of events made Shi Yongtian unable to react.</br>
</br>
His lips shivered. Perhaps due to anger or because of fear. Regardless, he couldn't say a word.</br>
</br>
"I said apologize, blue skin."</br>
</br>
A soldier standing on the side wearing the knight emblem sneered as he smashed the gun barrel and shot the guy in the back of his leg, causing him to drop to the ground.</br>
</br>
Humiliating the leader in front of him, it was like asking for his own death.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't stop this soldiers' action nor did he say anything, he only dubiously looked at Shi Yongtian's frightened eyes.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a voice was heard through the speakers not too far away from the base.</br>
</br>
"Mob, immediately stop your illegal activity, or we will shoot."</br>
</br>
Wearing a blue uniform with PAC printed on the chest of a standard body armor, covered by a carbon nano-explosion-proof helmet, and carrying a PK2000 rifle. About twenty people were crouched in the bunker, their guns pointed at the gate of the base.</br>
</br>
"Enemy attack!"</br>
</br>
Follow by the siren ringing, all the soldiers on patrol returned to battle position.</br>
</br>
The heavy machine guns on the concrete high wall turned simultaneously, followed by two remote sentient cannons.</br>
</br>
Soldiers in kinetic skeletons with reaper rifles leaned against the wall with their guns ready. The power armors stepped out of cover as they directly faced their enemy. Their revolving machines gun was spinning.</br>
</br>
What was more frightening was the swarm of hummingbird drones. Hundreds of machineguns hovered in the air, the sight alone sent shivers down people's spines.</br>
</br>
Absolute power.</br>
</br>
The twenty soldiers in light weapon was instantly overpowered by the intense firepower of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
The PAC leading the charge had a drop of cold sweat roll across his forehead. Although he had considered the interference of "illegal personnel", he never thought they would have strong firepower.</br>
</br>
Standing behind the power armor, Jiang Chen looked at the 20 PAC soldiers behind the bunch expressionlessly, he already guessed that people were waiting outside.</br>
</br>
From looks alone, he knew Shi Yongtian was a useless pile of meat that only knew how to talk. Although winter was relatively safe, it was not safe to the point where a persuasive speaker can safely walk through the wasteland. At least the zombies would not be frozen to death, when they see living creatures at night, they would still leap at them while howling.</br>
</br>
Therefore, there was only one possibility. He was being protected.</br>
</br>
He just didn't know what kind of arrogance he had to knock on the door alone.</br>
</br>
"You are talking about legality to me?" Jiang Chen looked at the Shi Yongtian kneeling on the ground as he slowly opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
Shi Yongtian shut his mouth, he was too afraid to speak.</br>
</br>
He originally wanted to threaten Jiang Chen with "this place is surrounded by twenty fully equipped PAC security forces, so you better put down your weapons and receive a lighter punishment".</br>
</br>
But when he saw the fearsome power armors with loaded machineguns step out of the door, he didn't have that attitude anymore.</br>
</br>
"Here, I am the law." Jiang Chen signaled Cheng Weiguo to let Shi Yongtian go. He then took out his pistol from his pocket. "Unfortunately, your words don't really work here."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed the gun against his forehead.</br>
</br>
"Don't, don't kill me!... I, I apologize," With pupils contracted, Shi Yongtian shivered as he said listlessly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't look at him anymore, but rather at the soldiers in the far away bunker.</br>
</br>
Silence ensued at the entrance of the base for a few seconds. The leading PAC soldier finally dropped his weapon and put his hands above his heads and walked to the base.</br>
</br>
He knew they were no match for the "mob". To save the captured officer, the team captain had to compromise.</br>
</br>
"We have no intention to start a conflict, please let Officier Shi go."</br>
</br>
"We also have no intention to start a conflict, it is just your people were being disrespectful." Jiang Chen shrugged as he put away his pistol, and concurrently signaled Cheng Weiguo to put their weapons down.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's action, the captain with his hands above his head let out a breath of relief. He signaled the soldiers behind him to put their weapons down as well.</br>
</br>
The tense situation was resolved after each party took a step back.</br>
</br>
After being searched, the captain walked in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Looking at the anxious Shi Yongtian on the ground, that captain let out a sigh and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"I am Tian Feng, a PAC army captain."</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen." He gave out his name again. Jiang Chen held that person's hand before letting go quickly.</br>
</br>
"We are from Fallout Shelter 027. Officer Shi should have discussed the details with you. We don't mean harm, we just arrived on the surface... and are unfamiliar with the place," Tian Feng used a calm voice to speak with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Now you should have seen, PAC no longer exists, neither does CCCP or NATO."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Tian Feng let out a sigh as he accepted Jiang Chen's words.</br>
</br>
But Shi Yongtian on the ground had a pale white, face. He seemed to be unable to accept the cruel reality.</br>
</br>
The PAC no longer existing meant that his title of an officer had no meaning.</br>
</br>
He couldn't accept the status difference.</br>
</br>
"Although it is hard to believe... but your weapons are convincing." Tian Feng said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
If PAC still existed, they would not like a force with such a strong military presence remain in their jurisdiction.</br>
</br>
Before they returned to the surface, they have guessed countless possibilities. Such as NATO or CCCP have captured the entire PAC region, or PAC came out of the war as the eventual victor, or nuclear weapons had rendered the surface as a no man's land...</br>
</br>
The current situation, it was not that they didn't consider it, they just didn't believe it was actually true.</br>
</br>
"I am glad you recognize the reality." Jiang Chen shrugged. "You should feel lucky that you met us, and not a raider group, or the not so clean mercenaries. What's next? What do you plan to do?"</br>
</br>
"We need your help," Tian Feng said sincerely.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 287: Nuclear Fusion Core</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Help? We are not a welfare society. If you're interested in a trade, that can be discussed." Looking at the sincere Tian Feng, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
To the survivors that just peeked their heads out of the fallout shelter, they had no clue about the rules of the wasteland, but they possessed a large number of pre-war supplies.</br>
</br>
Needless to say help, it would be considered sympathetic if one could resist the urge to rob these "rookies".</br>
</br>
Tian Feng was stunned for a moment, he didn' expect Jiang Chen to be so direct.</br>
</br>
After a brief paused, the captain spoke.</br>
</br>
"Our resources are also limited or else the fallout shelter wouldn't be unlocked. Although we can't give you anything in return right now, I promise, if you support our case, when we rebuild order on the shambles, we definitely won't forget the help you provided us."</br>
</br>
"What cause?" Jiang Chen was lost.</br>
</br>
"Of course rebuilding the great PAC, and shine the glorious light of the Pan-Asia Corporation again." As if he had regained his youth, Shi Yongtian on the ground climbed up and said passionately.</br>
</br>
"That's exactly it." After glancing at officer Shi, Tian Feng nodded at Jiang Chen. "Before the fallout shelter door was locked shut, the last mission we received was once the fallout shelter opens, rebuild the civilization on the ruins. If PAC didn't exist anymore, then we'll reform its former glory!"</br>
</br>
"These 'blue skins' would typically say such things when they climb out of the ground." Cheng Weiguo shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Blue skins?" Tian Feng frowned.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, only a name," another soldier mocked.</br>
</br>
A nickname was given by the experienced to the rookies.</br>
</br>
They didn't stay further on the topic as Tian Feng continued to look at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Our interest should be the same. Once we rebuild order, you can go back to the harmonious and stable life."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a dubious expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"So your recommendation is?"</br>
</br>
"We previous thought you could just support us with some extra nuclear fusion core, but seeing your excellent ability, I have changed my mind. I sincerely welcome you to join our cause," Tian Feng said seriously.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"So you are saying, we should create a new owner who will sit on top of us?"</br>
</br>
"How could you say it like that," Shi Yongtian worked up his courage and rebutted, " a hundred years ago, when we stood up from the suppression of NATO and CCCP, joined the forces, and walked to the great corporation. Do you remember the former prosperity? Do you long to stay in these shambles filled with chaos? Only we can lead the greater Asia to prosperity-"</br>
</br>
Listening to the nonsense of this guy, the soldiers holding their rifles began to laugh. Cheng Weiguo touched his nose and didn't laugh since he came out from a fallout shelter. But from the curled up the tip of his mouth, he couldn't hold out for much longer.</br>
</br>
</br>
Shi Yongtian's face was bloated. The sights of untrust and mockery made him furious. If this were before the war, he promised he would use his power in hand to teach these peasants a lesson. But unfortunately, the pain from the bruise on his leg reminded him that he must restrain himself.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng was silent, but he still remained hopeful as he stared at Jiang Chen. Although the majority are "ignorant", as the leader of this group of people, he trusted that Jiang Chen must have enough "foresight."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slowly said, "House, weapon, wall... We laid every single brick here. With or without you, we can do great things."</br>
</br>
"But under our leadership, you can do better-"</br>
</br>
"Bullsh*t."</br>
</br>
Looking at the stern-faced Tian Feng, Jiang Chen said bluntly.</br>
</br>
"Once you adjust your attitude and bring enough sincerity, then talk about trading with us. Or, you can try your luck with other survival bases?"</br>
</br>
Tian Feng took a deep breath as he scanned the pitch black power armors.</br>
</br>
"I will bring back your response."</br>
</br>
"Don't pretend you are a big deal, blue skin," Ma Zhongchen who was patrolling mocked.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng glanced at him, didn't say anything else, and dragged Shi Yongtian away.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Alarm deactivated. The fuss at the gate didn't stop the celebration inside the base from continuing.</br>
</br>
Only during shift change did the soldiers with empty stomachs tell their comrades with a belly about to burst the funny things that happened at the front gate before rushing to the busy square.</br>
</br>
"Boss, why do you need to waste your words on them. We can easily wipe them out and take over the good things in the fallout shelter."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo followed Jiang Chen to the office in the community center and while standing in front of the table, he asked Jiang Chen puzzledly.</br>
</br>
"Oh? So you support me in occupying Fallout Shelter 027?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Even if it were a lawful mercenary, they wouldn't let this opportunity slip away," Cheng Weiguo answered.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he didn't say anything and looked at the map on the table.</br>
</br>
The paper map was taken from a survival guide from before the war. Although it didn't list out the 00x series as well as special fallout shelters not open to the public, all the normal fallout shelters were listed on the map.</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 027, located in the Songjiang area. It is not far from our base. With the capacity of 1000 people. The set lockdown period is 50 years, but it seemed to have been opened earlier than that," Jiang Chen found the symbol on the map as he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"From their words, they seemed to be really lacking nuclear fusion core. What is that?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo didn't know why Jiang Chen would ask that and looked at his boss, confused.</br>
</br>
"it is a type of nuclear reaction battery. 100mm in diameter, it is stable and safe. A lot of industrial machines used it as the power source, including power armors. I remember the Sixth Street used it for a period of time, but like the food on the supermarket shelves, it quickly depleted, and not a lot was recycled. All in all, after consuming the nuclear fusion core batteries, the Sixth Street power armors were modified to use crystals as its power source."</br>
</br>
Compared to the difficult to obtain nuclear fusion core, crystals were much easier to obtain.</br>
</br>
"I see... Normally speaking, what goods are inside the fallout shelters?" Jiang Chen continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"Good things manufactured before the war, obedient labor, technicians, and scientists." Cheng Weiguo knocked on the EP on his arm. "For example, these EPs were mostly distributed out from the fallout shelters. Also some limited medicine, or even manufacturing equipment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Last time, from Fallout Shelter 005, he obtained a batch of experiment apparatus, a quantum computer that can be used as the server for virtual reality games, as well as a production line for the Hummingbird drone.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, for the survivors that wandered on the wasteland picking up garbage for survival, these fallout shelters unaffected by radiation were like treasures.</br>
</br>
"Other than those, there is also food," after a brief pause, Cheng Weiguo added.</br>
</br>
"Food?" Jiang Chen was slightly shocked.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Cheng Weiguo nodded. "Other than those frozen fallout shelters, quite a lot of fallout shelter with living humans would be equipped with breeding and planting facilities. Since all food has an expiry date, even if it were stored in ultra-low temperature in a vacuum, it would still be difficult to preserve for over 50 years."</br>
</br>
Without being affected by nuclear and biological weapons, the technology was also more advanced. The fallout shelters were the best place to grow food on this land.</br>
</br>
The multiple plantation towers, soilless cultivation plants (both bankrupted) at the Sixth Streets could produce a small amount of produce, but the quantity, as well as survivability, were both limited. Since the filter equipment, the survivors who used recycled garbage as the base material could not be compared to the sophisticated equipment created before the war.</br>
</br>
"Wait," Jiang Chen frowned, "Logically speaking, after so many years, there are quite a few of fallout shelters that opened in Wanghai City. But until half a year ago, the Sixth Street market still hasn't seen a trace of food."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo had a bitter smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Mostly had to do with the raiders. Most fallout shelters would not escape the fate of being raided by raiders. But those bandits only know how to rob and kill, lacking the concept of foresight. While they completely raided the food, most of the people inside the fallout shelters were killed. Without knowing how to operate the equipment, it was usually sold as scrap. The lack of filtration device meant that the environment in the fallout shelter would be similar to the external world not long after.</br>
</br>
"How many people would it take to attack the fallout shelter?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo thought for a moment and replied, "It will depend on the security force inside the fallout shelter. Normally speaking, only thirty-something soldiers would be enough to completely block the people in the fallout shelters."</br>
</br>
"Block?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, even nuclear weapons can't do anything to the fallout shelter. In theory, as long as the fallout shelter door is locked, the people on the outside have no way of going in." Cheng Weiguo said feeling rather helpless, "There is only one reason the fallout shelter would open before the locked date expired. That is, all the energy or resources have been depleted. As long as we block them in, they will be the first ones to give up."</br>
</br>
Just like a turtle.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he had a brief understanding of the fallout shelters on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"I see, now go do your own things."</br>
</br>
"Yes !" Cheng Weiguo saluted before he left the office.</br>
</br>
Seated in front of the table, Jiang Chen leaned against the chair and fell into deep thought with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 027?"</br>
</br>
Food? Jiang Chen was not interested. The only thing he didn't lack was food.</br>
</br>
The thing that interested him the most were the scientists and technicians inside the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
He faced two choices.</br>
</br>
Raid? Or trade?</br>
</br>

</br>
The New Year celebration continued till three in the morning. People who couldn't keep their eyes open finally returned to their beds and fell asleep with a joyful smile.</br>
</br>
It was the first time, in many years, there was so much happiness on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
The bonfire was extinguished and the smell of the barbeque lingered on the square.</br>
</br>
With the help of the participants, the logistics department collected and put the utensils and cooking equipment back into the kitchen and transported any uneaten food back into the storage space and recorded the amount of food consumed that night.</br>
</br>
As the proposer of the celebration, Jiang Chen, unfortunately, didn't get to join in on the celebration.</br>
</br>
As when he finished talking to Cheng Weiguo, he returned straight to the mansion.</br>
</br>
It was still three hours before the celebration ended.</br>
</br>
When he went back the mansion, Yao Yao was still not asleep.</br>
</br>
The adorable girl sat in front of the window, counting down on New Year and thinking about her own things with her hands against her chin.</br>
</br>
Counting down on New Year. Only a few people remembered this tradition.</br>
</br>
Being with family was a luxury on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Everything was so sudden. From the light of the nuclear bomb to the airdrop soldiers from the sky. People were still working; students were still in class. But the "Holy Shield" only left ten minutes for people to prepare.</br>
</br>
After rushing to the nearest fallout shelter, squeezing into temporary nuclear bunkers, or being wiped out by the shockwaves.</br>
</br>
The hibernation chamber was like a wormhole.</br>
</br>
For the people that hid inside, when the door closed to when it opened again, everything felt like it happened instantaneously. But outside of the chamber, twenty years have passed by.</br>
</br>
A tear rolled down her face and as her tender fingers gently moved towards it, a warm hand wiped off the droplet at the corner of her eyes before she did.</br>
</br>
"Do you miss home?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao slammed her head into Jiang Chen's chest as her small head tightly pressed against his shoulder, she quietly sobbed.</br>
</br>
"I, I am strong." Her voice was muffled by her repressed sobbing, but Jiang Chen could still hear the frail strength in her voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, Yao Yao is strong."</br>
</br>
"I, I am not crying."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lightly patted her soft back as he scanned the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
The hands of the clock happened to pass 12 o'clock.</br>
</br>
At at the same time, the breathing on his shoulder became more rhythmic.</br>
</br>
The entire night, he stayed with Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't do anything.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The transport elevator slowly descended into the fallout shelter below the earth's surface.</br>
</br>
Around twenty-something soldiers in PAC security force uniform stood on top, everyone's expression was down and flustered.</br>
</br>
</br>
A lot of people carried gun wounds; the bulletproof vests were covered with spiderweb-like cracks which signified the intensity of the battle.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, they didn't lose anyone.</br>
</br>
Shi Yongtian curled up in the corner of the elevator; his sight was unfocused as if something had provoked him, he seemed like he lost his spirit.</br>
</br>
The captain of the team, Tian Feng, was blankly staring at the lead cylinder in his hand covered in blood - nuclear fusion core.</br>
</br>
As to where this came from, the story began three hours ago.</br>
</br>
After being rejected by Jiang Chen, Tian Feng didn't give up, but instead, he decided to try his luck elsewhere.</br>
</br>
The snow on the surface was thick and cold; it froze the remaining liquid inside the withered bodies of the zombies. They were fortunate, if it were not for the snow, those furious zombies would rip all of them into pieces.</br>
</br>
Even the Death Claw would be scared of the zombies at night.</br>
</br>
Factory, shop, hospital.</br>
</br>
With the group of twenty as well as an officer responsible for "comforting the affected," Tian Feng almost searched every possible place the nuclear fusion core would exist.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, he didn't manage to find any.</br>
</br>
Within the twenty years, the survivors have cleanly scavenged anything useful. This would obviously include the nuclear fusion cores used in generators. Before crystals were replaced as the energy alternative, nuclear fusion cores were the primary source of energy the survivors used.</br>
</br>
But in the end, Tian Feng obtained one.</br>
</br>
In a half-collapsed building, he found the light of a flame. Twenty-something survivors covered in winter suits and unknown fur circled around a bonfire. They had poorly made rifles on their backs as they were cutting meat for a strange creature.</br>
</br>
In terms of firepower, this group was much weaker than the previous survivors.</br>
</br>
Out of safe consideration, Tian Feng didn't hastily approach them, but rather he used the loudspeaker.</br>
</br>
Because of their caution, they saved themselves.</br>
</br>
The loudspeaker was used for less than a minute before the bullets began to rain down. A lot of PAC soldiers, who weren't sure of the situation, were left entirely dumbfounded. They had to take cover nearby.</br>
</br>
They didn't know why these "refugees" would fire at them. They didn't know if they should fire back.</br>
</br>
Currently, in their minds, they were still the soldiers of the "country," these were "refugees" that lost their rationality.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Tian Feng as the captain had a quick reaction. Recognizing the situation, he immediately ordered to fire back and fired the first shot.</br>
</br>
Those survivors' pieces of equipment weren't as outdated as they looked. The moment they started firing, two light machineguns appeared out of the window.</br>
</br>
Although they were part of the security force, none of them went onto the battlefield before. However, since they did receive professional training, whether it was shooting or knowledge, Tian Feng and the group were more superior that this "mob."</br>
</br>
Shooters quickly eliminated the firing points, and the soldiers with rifles taking cover behind the concrete fired back alternatively. Although they lacked in firepower, their effective strategy easily took care of the mob.</br>
</br>
The mob with weapons were consecutively killed. Tian Feng led his troops to push forward and force them to surrender.</br>
</br>
But to their surprise, until they were down to the last person, the group had no intention of surrendering.</br>
</br>
But when Tian Feng led his troops into the base of the mob, he saw a disgusting scene.</br>
</br>
Blood, meat chunks.</br>
</br>
It was not the carcass of an animal... No, precisely speaking, the human is also an animal.</br>
</br>
They were not mobs, they were devils! The devils that chewed on human meat like there was nothing wrong.</br>
</br>
"This is insane."</br>
</br>
After seeing this scaring scene, Shi Yongtian's mouth twitched and he continuously repeated that same sentence.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng didn't say anything, but his resolute eyes began to shake. It was not hard to see the shock he felt in his heart.</br>
</br>
No one threw up.</br>
</br>
Because of the scarce resources in the fallout shelter, they drank nutrient supplies before they left. They had nothing in their stomach to throw up.</br>
</br>
If it was a lone traveler that saw this scene or merchants that often traveled by, they would say without being bothered, "Oh, it's the cannibals" before they start collecting loots.</br>
</br>
Watching the fellow with his limbs chopped off, but couldn't die because of the hemostatic agent, Tian Feng didn't say anything. He quietly raised his gun and ended his misery.</br>
</br>
Under the body, he found a nuclear fusion core covered in blood.</br>
</br>
The nuclear fusion core was adhered to an aluminum heat agent. It looked like this group of people made it into a simple nuclear grenade. But before they could use it, the person had to have his head blown off.</br>
</br>
Regardless, they finally acquired the nuclear fusion core; their mission was complete. The shortage of power in the fallout shelter has been solved and was something worth celebrating.</br>
</br>
But currently, no one had a hint of happiness.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng gazed at the blood stains on the nuclear fusion core without saying a word.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 289: Burden of Survival</br>
</div></br>
</br>
One thousand meters under the surface, a cave the size of two basketball courts was buried deep inside.</br>
</br>
With the elevator descending, the light along the corner of the cave opened consecutively as it illuminated the underground space.</br>
</br>
Around the area was soil packed tightly and rocky surfaces. Facing the elevator was the door to Fallout Shelter 027.</br>
</br>
It is an inconquerable base.</br>
</br>
The only entrance was blocked by a gear-shaped door 10 meters thick. The 8m thick compressive alloy steel and the 2m thick lead sandwich was enough to withstand a million tons TNT equivalent nuclear strike!</br>
</br>
Tian Feng walked to the door of the fallout shelter, inputted his fingerprint, and opened the steel cover attached to the door. He then took a cable covered in soft lead material and attached it to his EP.</br>
</br>
The door, even impenetrable by Gamma radiation, naturally would not let any electromagnetic waves pass through. The information exchanged between the fallout shelter and the outside world was purely done through this cable.</br>
</br>
The EP screen flashed as a woman's face quickly surfaced.</br>
</br>
Although she looked young, the three stars on her shoulder made it impossible to underestimate her ability.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua, age 24, PAC colonel. Unfrozen three years ago and has taken over the leadership position as the previous head of Fallout Shelter 027 passed away.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation?"</br>
</br>
Tian Feng saluted as he responded in a firm tone.</br>
</br>
"Mission completed."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, come inside." Han Junhua nodded and signaled the staff to open the fallout shelter door.</br>
</br>
The gear shaped door gradually opened and exposed the narrow tunnel inside. A metal bridge suspended there, with the guidance of the mechanical arm, it formed a road inside the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
After they passed through the bridge, the twenty soldiers put their rifles and ammo on the weapon rack and walked into the sanitization room. The staff standing on the side pushed the weapon rack into the sanitation room to be sanitized.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng didn't immediately go inside the sanitization room, he walked in front of Han Junhua and handed her the nuclear fusion core.</br>
</br>
"Blood?"</br>
</br>
"It's blood."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua had a serious expression when she saw the bullet marks on his bulletproof vest.</br>
</br>
"The war is still not over?"</br>
</br>
She subconsciously thought that he was attacked by NATO soldiers.</br>
</br>
When he heard her words, the resolute face had a forced smile.</br>
</br>
"It is over, but you will never believe what I saw outside."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua scanned the blood on the nuclear fusion core as she seemed to have understood something.</br>
</br>
"Half an hour later, come to the conference room."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Tian Feng saluted the girl twenty years younger than him as he watched her leave.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
</br>
The light in the conference room was on, but the mood felt repressive.</br>
</br>
After pushing open the door, four pairs of eyes landed on him. Tian Feng gulped as he walked to the conference table and sat in a chair.</br>
</br>
Fallout shelter leader Han Junhua, citizen representative Wu Yaguo, PAC Federal Research Institute Academician Qin Xuehai, Fallout Shelter Technology senior engineer Feng Hui, and the still trembling Shi Yongtian.</br>
</br>
On top of the conference table was the nuclear fusion core stained with blood.</br>
</br>
"Briefly explain what you saw outside, or we can't continue on the topic," Academician Qin with white hair gently smiled as he said to Tian Feng.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng looked at Han Junhua and after seeing her nod, he began.</br>
</br>
"This is what happened..."</br>
</br>
At the request of Academician Qin, Tian Feng outlined everything that he had been seen since leaving the fallout shelter. Including the nuclear winter on the surface, the zombies, the Fishbone base's powerful firepower and apathy to the PAC regime, including the exchange of fire with those cannibals.</br>
</br>
When Tian Feng finished explaining his encounters, the meeting table once again became silent.</br>
</br>
After a long time, as the leader, Han Junhua broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Feng Hui, how long can this nuclear fusion core last?"</br>
</br>
"To maintain the existing power usage, it is enough to support us for six months." Feng Hui gave a conservative estimate.</br>
</br>
"The acquired power can last us for half a year? That is simply impossible!" Wu Yaguo immediately protested.</br>
</br>
All the equipment of the fallout shelter relied on electricity, whether it was food production or the operation of the water purification device. To maintain their existing power usage, it means that each person can only be allocated 600ml of drinking water every day, 1 hour of ultraviolet radiation, and three meals of nutrient supply in reserve.</br>
</br>
This means they couldn't take a bath, couldn't be full, lack energy, and survive a full six months in the sub-health state.</br>
</br>
"During extreme times, there is nothing that is impossible," Han Junhua briefly said, and then look to Feng Hui, "Maintain existing power usage. You can go now."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Hesitating for a moment, Feng Hui got up. While holding the nuclear fusion core, he left the conference room.</br>
</br>
"You can not ignore the public opinion." Wu Yaguo stared at Han Junhua. "I do not know what the damn procedure is, but the old leader had everything taken care everything until you woke up. Now everything has changed! "</br>
</br>
For Wu Yaguo's accusations, Han Junhua was indifferent.</br>
</br>
"You can not blame Xiaohua, she has done very well," Academician Qin with a gentle tone tried to persuade in an attempt to keep Wu Yaguo calm.</br>
</br>
"Very well?" Wu Yaguo scorned, "It has only been three years, and since you have succeeded, everything has changed. First, the farming output has been reduced, the nutrient supply is mixed with organic food, then the cut in water supply, and finally the cut in existing power? All of this is pure nonsense! "</br>
</br>
"I am just making the most realistic choice with the current supply status." Han Junhua's voice was cold, without the slightest feelings.</br>
</br>
"The most realistic choice? I am only aware that this fallout shelter is designed for 50 years! It is 50 years calculated from the supercomputer! However, how many years have passed now? Less than 20 years, the fallout shelter is forced to open. I do not know what you have done in the past three years as the leader," Wu Yaguo said in anger.</br>
</br>
Quietly waiting for Wu Yaguo to vent his anger, Han Junhua slowly opened her mouth.</br>
</br>
"1000 people, for 50 years.You tell me how many people are in the shelter now?"</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo was speechless, his angry expression froze on his face.</br>
</br>
"I'll tell you, a total of 1743 people."</br>
</br>
Seeing Wu Yaguo's silence, Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
"The first thing I did when I woke up from the hibernation chamber was look at the work log from the previous leader, but guess what I read?"</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"The first line, in 2171, I can't refuse a mother's request, I took her baby from her hands.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong with that?" Wu Yaguo did not think it was a big deal.</br>
</br>
"That baby was the 1001 resident of the shelter."</br>
</br>
"Is it because of this baby, Fallout Shelter 027 will be opened nearly 30 years in advance?" Wu Yaguo laughed. "Or is it that you really can not find an excuse and have to use an innocent baby to hide your own incompetence?</br>
</br>
"That's just the beginning," Han Junhua said expressionlessly. "I hosted a wedding for a couple in 2172. I knew it was not right, but I still blessed them with happiness.</br>
</br>
"There is nothing wrong with that! Don't you think that in this environment filled with despair, a wedding is inspiring."</br>
</br>
"So, in this 16 years, you held more than 400 weddings?" Han Junhua's sight swept across the four people at the meeting.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng who couldn't interrupt stared at his EP in a daze. Shi Yongtian was still shaking while sitting at the table. Han Junhua's explanation didn't satisfy Wu Yaguo as he still remained indifferent. Academician Qin let out a sigh and lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"There is no energy-saving plan, no family planning. The supercomputer can calculate the energy consumption as accurate as ten points after the decimal, it can calculate the near-perfect population structure and growth curve, but it still can't calculate your IQ!</br>
</br>
In the end, her calm voice finally was inflicted with a trace of anger. The volume was not high, but it stung the eardrums of all that was present.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin opened his mouth. He wanted to say something to ease the tense atmosphere on the conference table, but ultimately he didn't say anything and just quietly watched Han Junhua. Wu Yaguo's face turned red from anger, but he couldn't find any reasons to refute.</br>
</br>
"Including me waking up earlier, I was shocked," Han Junhua said. "With the plan, I was supposed to be dormant for 25 years before taking over the leadership position. But what did the old man do? He committed suicide in fear of the crime he committed!</br>
</br>
"Old Zhang died of myocardial infarction." Wu Yaguo trying to retort, but his tone lacked decisiveness...</br>
</br>
"Myocardial infarction? With the medical capability of the fallout shelter, do you think a myocardial infarction could kill someone? He concealed the condition and gave up on treatment, that is suicide!" Looking directly at Wu Yaguo's eyes, Han Junhua said firmly.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo lips moved, but he couldn't say a word.</br>
</br>
"If it is you, what would you do?" Academician Qin abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"In 2171, I would refuse to accept the baby. Before 2180, there will be no newborns. After 2180, following the supercomputer' analysis of the population growth curve, strictly control the number of newborns," Han Junhua said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
"But do you know? Leader Zhang didn't just face a baby, but also human nature," Qin academician whispered, "I witnessed the day at the door when the tragedy happened. People outside the door begged, hoping that little Zhang would leave one side of the net open (to give the wrongdoer a way out). According to the discipline, the fallout shelter can only accommodate a thousand people, little Zhang also abided by that discipline."</br>
</br>
"He did not." Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
Listening to the words of the little girl, Academician Qin just kindly smiled and recalled.</br>
</br>
"People kneeled down, someone insulted him, and people even tried to force themselves back into the shelter. I remember little Zhang shot the gun. You can't imagine the scene. A husband attempted to take his son to the door to meet his wife... It was little Zhang that shot."</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo closed his eyes, he seemed to recall a distant event. Tian Feng was still staring at his shoelaces, but he clearly remembered that day it was him at the door on duty.</br>
</br>
However, Han Junhua was still unmoved, she said emotionlessly,</br>
</br>
"Why could he refuse a group, but not a child?"</br>
</br>
"Perhaps, that is because of human nature." Academician Qin sighed.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, foolish things were committed from the beginning." Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
"Without experiencing it, what happened that the day is just a passage to you. The ideas you have are indeed not wrong," for her indifference, Academician Qin just sighed and said compassionately.</br>
</br>
"You, do you still have a hint of human nature left?" Wu Yaguo said in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't look at Wu Yaguo as she said with an apathetic tone.</br>
</br>
"Human nature? It is just a burden of survival."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 290: The Choice</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The argument continued until morning.</br>
</br>
But that didn’t matter as there was no concept of day and night in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
The topic of discussion evolved from "the fault of the fallout shelter leader" to "what to do next". It was a great step forward.</br>
</br>
Energy. Without energy, they can’t survive. The water purifier will stop working, the organic farm will be shut down, the UV lamp will go out, and even the air filter of the ventilators will stop functioning. From the complete power outage to the collapse of the fallout shelter, it would only take 10 minutes!</br>
</br>
Perhaps irritated by the quarrels at the meeting today, Shi Yongtian who had curled up on in his seat shivering, suddenly stood up and smashed the table angrily.</br>
</br>
"War, only war can solve all the problems! We should declare war on the natives on the surface! Don’t they have the nuclear fusion cores? We can just rob it from their hands. They not only illegally occupied territories but are also illegally armed. We should teach them a lesson and teach them the etiquette and reserve of a civilized man! The glory of PAC is immortal! "</br>
</br>
The angry roar overshadowed all the voices on the conference table.</br>
</br>
The interrupted Wu Yaguo looked over, shocked. The expressionless Han Junhua just glanced at him, and Tian Feng, who was staring at the ground, also raised his head and looked at him strangely.</br>
</br>
Shi Yongtian's lips moved, and his hand on the table jittered like he had epilepsy.</br>
</br>
After a moment, he sat back down stiffly.</br>
</br>
"Ahem." Wu Yaguo gently coughed, "Shi Yongtian, why don’t you go back and rest."</br>
</br>
Shi Yongtian looked at him gratefully, got up stiffly, and limped out of the conference room.</br>
</br>
Seeing the door close, Wu Yaguo slowly opened his mouth, this time his tone was calmer without an intention to fight in his tone.</br>
</br>
"This angry... inhabitant, though it was only an emotional expression, it provided an idea for our future development right? We can wager war against the external world to solve the energy crisis."</br>
</br>
"There is no way we will win." Tian Feng suddenly raised his head. As he had personally witnessed the strength of that group of people, he felt the need to remind the decision-makers, "Heavy machine guns, drones, sentry guns, and even power armors. The security force is made up of policemen, not the front force facing NATO. We are not equipped with heavy weaponry at all."</br>
</br>
"Hell, you used the taxpayer's money to train, and you can’t even suppress a group of mobs?" Wu Yaguo could not help but curse.</br>
</br>
"However, the group of mobs is not just simply mobs. Moreover, training cannot fill the gap of equipment," Tian Feng said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"What about the group of beasts that ate a human? Didn’t you guys win?" Wu Yaguo questioned.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng smiled, but that smile was somewhat bitter.</br>
</br>
</br>
For a warrior, the most painful thing was to explain the war to those who have not participated in the war.</br>
</br>
"The size of the surface armed force differs. Some are as strong as the Fishbone base while some are stragglers, they are fighting for themselves."</br>
</br>
"Then pick the group that you can beat!" Wu Yaguo impatiently said.</br>
</br>
"It is not legal to plunder from the victims… or the survivors."</br>
</br>
"Legal? Ha! All those are guilty violators, they have committed murder, robbery, insulting corpses! Are you not a security force? Do you think they should not die?"</br>
</br>
Tian Feng did not speak. His mind was a complete mess.</br>
</br>
He certainly thought those devils should be condemned; they should be punished with the most severe punishment. But they are only wartime policemen, not judges; they have no right to make decisions on the property owners of the offender. When he picked up the nuclear fusion core from the body and then used it for the fallout shelter, it was already a severe violation of discipline.</br>
</br>
The robber robbing a robber. In jurisprudence, he was also a robber.</br>
</br>
But he did not refute Wu Yaguo's point of view.</br>
</br>
If the PAC has ceased to exist, what is the meaning of holding to PAC's law? Including the rank of his collar, what is the point?</br>
</br>
"What do you think of it? As the leader of the fallout shelter, are you not going to do anything?" Wu Yaguo looked to Han Junhua</br>
</br>
She glanced at Wu Yaguo as Han Junhua slowly opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Foolish."</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo's face turned livid, with teeth clenched, he was so angry that he started to laugh "Foolish? Is not doing anything stupid to you, or as a resident representative, putting myself in the shoes of the entire fallout shelter foolish of me?"</br>
</br>
"Of course it is you."</br>
</br>
"You -!" Wu Yaguo pressed on the table as he stood up in rage.</br>
</br>
However, Han Junhua was not done humiliating him.</br>
</br>
"I don’t know what the old leader was thinking, making a foolish decision to elect a resident representative from the inhabitants. Listening to the public opinion? This is a fallout shelter, not a resort."</br>
</br>
"That’s enough, Little Hua. Calm down. Since there are ideas, why not elaborate?" Academician Qin sighed.</br>
</br>
"Because there is no need for that, the eyes of the masses are shortsighted."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua heard the argument. Qin Academician smile and turn to see Wu Yaguo.</br>
</br>
"Can I tell you a story?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead." Although anger filled his heart, to the old man, he still very much respected him.</br>
</br>
"A poor man lived with a wealthy man. Because there was a policeman that kept things in order, the two men live in peace. One day, the order that has always existed suddenly disappeared overnight.</br>
</br>
What will happen next?</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo gulped. He began to realize the seriousness of the problem.</br>
</br>
"Now we should consider who should we rob the nuclear fusion core from, but how to ensure that the survivors on the surface will not plunder us. There is not only one problem facing the fallout shelter." Academician Qin sighed.</br>
</br>
"This information spreading among the ordinary residents would only add unnecessary panic." Han Junhua glanced at Academician Qin.</br>
</br>
"But if you do not say anything, the residents will also panic." Academician Qin kindly smiled.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua no longer said anything as she fell into silence.</br>
</br>
Eyes shaking, Wu Yaguo said with difficulty, "Then take advantage of the fact that they haven’t made a move yet. Raid enough nuclear fusion cores and then close the door of the fallout shelter. As long as we do not open the door -"</br>
</br>
"We can’t hide here forever."</br>
</br>
He paused, Academician Qin continued to speak.</br>
</br>
"There is no fundamental difference between the closure of 20 years to the closure of 50 years. It will only make the gap between the survivors of the surface and us greater."</br>
</br>
"What do you say we should do?" Wu Yaguo shouted as he was having a mental breakdown.</br>
</br>
"Since the fallout shelter has opened in advance, the environment on the surface is not bad to the extent that we can’t survive. We should return to the surface, establish contact with the surface survivors, and rebuild our home-"</br>
</br>
"Surface? What is there? There is only a group of primitive people who want to drink blood. Even if they know how to use gunpowder, possess advanced technology, they are still primitive people! Dirty environment, suffocating radiation dust, disgusting mutated creatures, I don’t agree we should leave the fallout shelter! There are warm beds, clean water, fresh food here, we don’t need to leave, "Wu Yaguo retorted.</br>
</br>
Ignoring Wu Yaguo, Han Junhua looked at Academician Qin.</br>
</br>
"The Fishbone base knows about our energy shortage. If there is no surprise, they should be discussing how to plot against us. Any good ideas?"</br>
</br>
It was the first time she used an asking tone, seeking advice.</br>
</br>
"Then establish communication with them or trade."</br>
</br>
"Trades are only possible if both sides are equal. They already knew our weakness, if they can easily force us to surrender, they have no reason to choose to trade," Han Junhua said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Just let the weaknesses no longer exist." Academician Qin lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"Is that so ..." Han Junhua also fell into the same thought.</br>
</br>
"What are you talking about?" Looking at the two people guessing the same riddle, Wu Yaguo asked.</br>
</br>
But no one responded.</br>
</br>
Because some things spreading would only add unnecessary panic…</br>
</br>
Silence ensued for a long time, then Han Junhua abruptly declared, "The conference is over."</br>
</br>
Relieved, Tian Feng who couldn’t sit any longer was the first to leave the conference room. Wu Yaguo’s mouth twitched. He wanted to say something, but eventually, nothing came out, so he turned away.</br>
</br>
Standing up shakenly, when Academician Qin passed by Han Junhua, he stopped. Sighing, he said.</br>
</br>
"Have you made your decision?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
When he heard the affirmative answer, Academician Qin nodded his head and left the conference room.</br>
</br>
In a glimpse, the original noisy conference room suddenly quieted down, leaving only Han Junhua there.</br>
</br>
"Human nature?"</br>
</br>
She slowly repeated those unknown words.</br>
</br>
As she repeatedly chewed on the words, Han Junhua shook her head, got up, and walked out the door.</br>
</br>

</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
The sun shining through the window, sprinkling light on her soft and smooth cheeks, made her look adorable.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the quietly sleeping Yao Yao for a while before he looked out the window.</br>
</br>
The snow had stopped.</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, there have been more sunny days.</br>
</br>
After staying in bed for a bit longer, Jiang Chen slowly got up.</br>
</br>
As if she felt Jiang Chen get up, Yao Yao tightened the hand around his neck, her whole body pressing against his.</br>
</br>
Although the house temperature was warm, due to anemia, Yao Yao's morning body temperature was still very low. For the heat source next to her, her body naturally hugged it.</br>
</br>
It took a while for Jiang Chen to finally move the arm that was wrapped around him without waking her up. Then he snuck out of bed.</br>
</br>
He tucked the little girl in, leaned over her smooth forehead, and gave her a kiss. Then he turned away.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Last night, Sun Jiao pushed the wheelchair and took Sun Xiaorou around the square.</br>
</br>
Perhaps moved by the lively and joyful atmosphere on the square, it made her remember her time in fallout shelter 071 when her sister and parents lived together.</br>
</br>
A long-awaited word Sun Jiao was waiting to hear appeared in a light whisper - "Sister."</br>
</br>
The memory of the past began to flashback.</br>
</br>
Crying with Sun Xiaorou in her arms, tears burst out from Sun Jiao’s eyes.</br>
</br>
That "sister" made the suffering of more than a decade all worth it.</br>
</br>
The sisters hugged together as Sun Jiao finally slept in for once.</br>
</br>
What woke her up in the morning was the sound of knocking.</br>
</br>
Rubbing her sleepy eyes, she got up from her bed yawning and went to open the door.</br>
</br>
"Good morning."</br>
</br>
"Good ..." Seeing Sun Jiao's exposed pajamas, Jiang Chen felt his nose began to feel hot as he looked away, "I didn’t see you work out this morning."</br>
</br>
"I am being lazy." Sun Jiao sluggishly stretched her waist, the thin as veil shirt was being pulled to its fullness.</br>
</br>
Satisfied to hear his gulping, Sun Jiao proudly carved up the tip of her mouth.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn’t tease Jiang Chen longer, but she put on an emotional expression.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for yesterday."</br>
</br>
"I didn’t do anything, did she get better?"</br>
</br>
"Yesterday, she called me 'sister'. At night, we talked about a lot of things that happened when we were young... Thank you, I really am grateful." Because of her excitement, Sun Jiao was becoming incoherent with her words.</br>
</br>
Sisters that finally recognize each other, Jiang Chen sincerely felt happy for her.</br>
</br>
The sequelae left behind by the memory blockage has been resolved. The next step was to solve her lower body paralysis.</br>
</br>
Although the Fishbones base and the Sixth Street’s medical condition was yet enough to complete brain tissue repair surgery, Jiang Chen believed that within the buried ruins, the technology will gradually be uncovered. Sun Xiaorou one day will leave her wheelchair.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Do not thank me, it is her that woke up the memory in her heart -"</br>
</br>
Before he could finish, his lips were blocked by a soft redness.</br>
</br>
Lips apart.</br>
</br>
Crystals hung in her eyes and her pupils were covered by a fine mist. Sun Jiao smiled and jumped back into her bedroom with a hand on the doorframe.</br>
</br>
"I'll go and get changed, let’s eat breakfast together."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen didn’t have breakfast with Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
On the table, he left a "go to the community center office to find me" before he hurriedly left the mansion and went to the cafeteria.</br>
</br>
He ordered a bowl of millet rice porridge and two meat buns. Jiang Chen sat with the survivors as they chatted about yesterday evening's celebration while working on his breakfast.</br>
</br>
While he was happy that Sun Xiaoruo finally found her real personality, he did not know how to face her yet, or what kind of expression should he use to meet her.</br>
</br>
After all, in the basement, he did that kind of thing to her.</br>
</br>
After putting the dishes away, Jiang Chen came straight to his office in the community center. Sun Jiao had been waiting.</br>
</br>
"Why didn’t you eat with me? I wanted to formally introduce you to my sister." Sun Jiao combed her long hair behind her ear as he covered her mouth, laughing.</br>
</br>
"... I, I don’t know how to face her," Jiang Chen said feeling embarrassed.</br>
</br>
"Do you plan to hide from her all your life? She is my sister." One hand on her hip, Sun Jiao closed the distance between her and Jiang Chen as she said audaciously.</br>
</br>
"Don’t be like this. I… let’s talk about the important task at hand." Jiang Chen coughed as he looked to the side.</br>
</br>
With a perplexed look, Sun Jiao nibbled on her lower lips as she wanted to say something, but eventually sighed and did not say another word.</br>
</br>
Seeing Sun Jiao didn’t continue to persist on the issue, Jiang Chen felt relieved. Sorting out his thoughts, he spoke about the incident that happened at the base gate yesterday.</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's words, Sun Jiao paused for a moment as she fell into silence.</br>
</br>
"What do you plan to do?" After a long moment, Sun Jiao abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"If the fallout shelter fell into the hands of raiders or unlawful mercenaries, it would be a waste of a god-sent gift," at the same time he spoke, Jiang Chen looked to Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen look at her, she knew that he was concerned about her own feeling. Sun Jiao put on a thoughtful smile as she said softly.</br>
</br>
"You don’t have to explain it to me. Indeed, the reason why I separated from my family was that the fallout shelter suffered a culprit attack. But after being on the wasteland for so many years, I have long understood that raiding is normal behavior. "</br>
</br>
It was based on this idea that in the first meeting with Jiang Chen, she made a move to tie him on the chair. Even in the Wanghai area, she has been considered one of the more decent lone travelers.</br>
</br>
He paused, the audacious face surfaced a hint of gentleness.</br>
</br>
"Moreover, I believe in you. If it is you, even if you occupied the fallout shelter, you would definitely make a different choice than those bandits."</br>
</br>
Hearing Sun Jiao’s words of trust, Jiang Chen had a rare embarrassed look and he looked away.</br>
</br>
"Yesterday, I talked with Cheng Weiguo. It was impossible to get into the fallout shelter by forcing our way inside. I would like to hear your opinion."</br>
</br>
The time cost of the siege was too expensive. If it were only around ten days to a half months, it would be okay. But if it was over a year, needless to say, Jiang Chen wouldn’t have the patience to wait as the unclear situation west of Zhufeng Highway meant that the Fishbone base could not use the force in the Songjiang area to surround fallout shelter 027.</br>
</br>
"Generally speaking, surrounding it would be the best choice. Since the fallout shelter opened ahead of schedule, it means that they are facing a problem due to lack of supplies. They would be the first ones to forfeit in such a situation," Sun Jiao said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
"But it is too time-consuming that way. Is there a possibility of opening the door from the outside?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao shook her head.</br>
</br>
"I see ..." Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows, troubled.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something as he looked towards Sun Jiao. He considered for a while before he said.</br>
</br>
"The fallout shelter you lived in before is called Fallout Shelter 071 right?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, what's the problem?" Sun Jiao asked.</br>
</br>
"If you would excuse me, do you remember how the fallout shelter fell to the raiders?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao paused.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, if I made you remember bad things, just forget about it."</br>
</br>
"No, it’s okay." Seeing Jiang Chen’s deep concern, Sun Jiao smiled and waved her hand. "Because at the time I was less than 10 years old, my memory is somewhat blurred. I’ll try to remember."</br>
</br>
"Please." Jiang Chen solemnly nodded.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao took a deep breath and looked out the window as if she was immersed in her memory.</br>
</br>
"Fallout Shelter 071 ..."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 292: Determination</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Steel feet crushed the snow. The steel surface of two T-3 power armors reflected the piercing sunlight.</br>
</br>
Immediately following the power armors were twenty "knights" in kinetic skeletons, as well as one hundred "citizens" in carbon nano bulletproof vests. Everyone held a Reaper rifle and marched in a scattered square formation.</br>
</br>
At the end of the line was a Tiger. The fearsome electromagnetic pulse cannon attached to the back of the pickup truck cast a menacing vibe under the cold winter light.</br>
</br>
He gazed into the distance. The streets along the highway were dead silent. There were no signs of mutants at all.</br>
</br>
The dumb zombies had their feet trapped in snow as they lingered in front of the destroyed stores. The drool coming out of their mouths were frozen into icicles. There would be occasional zombies walking into the middle of the road, but a gunshot from a soldier would easily put them down.</br>
</br>
Winter was safe in Wanghai City, although winter was about to pass.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wore a power armor and led the march. As he walked, he recollected the conversation he had with Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"It's deception."</br>
</br>
"Deception?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"When the fallout shelter opened, the leader organized us to establish temporary tents on the surface and ordered the technicians to sample for air quality, soil quality, as well as sent out a scout team to examine the area surrounding the fallout shelter. If the surface were suitable for living, we would end the asylum plan ahead of schedule and start rebuilding on the ruins. If the situation were terrible, once we collected enough nuclear fusion cores, we would return to the fallout shelter and wait for the situation to become better."</br>
</br>
"It was the third day since the fallout shelter opened. A hobo, poorly covered, came to the camp on the surface. I remembered everyone was happy because there were still survivors on the surface.</br>
</br>
"From him, we learned a lot of useful information. For example, the World Alliance Organization was dissolved, the space colonization ships were sent into space... Although the news was depressing, it didn't make people despair."</br>
</br>
"Gradually, he gained our trust. One day, he suddenly said to us, the nuclear fusion core we were collecting could be exchanged for food at the survival camps nearby."</br>
</br>
"It was happy news for the fallout shelter. Since the fallout shelter could easily produce food as long as there was enough energy."</br>
</br>
"The leader gave him five bags of rice and ordered two PAC soldiers to follow him.</br>
</br>
"But no one expected that when he returned, a group of bandits with rifles followed him. The two PAC soldiers were gone, but the blue security force uniforms were worn by two bandits."</br>
</br>
"The entire camp was in dismay, and no one was prepared. The leader led the security force and hastily fire back, but whether it was the number of people or firepower, we were at a disadvantage. A fire began to spread in the camp. It seemed to be caused by the ignition bottles thrown by the bandits."</br>
</br>
</br>
"At that time, my family and I lost each other. I ran far away, ran out of the camp, ran out of that street..."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn't continue.</br>
</br>
She already told him the story before. She was afraid to go home as she mindlessly wandered among the shambles until she met a female warrior who said she was part of PLA, and then she wandered alone...</br>
</br>
Deception?</br>
</br>
But he thought the real reason why the fallout shelter collapsed was due to the modesty of human nature by the people who never experienced hardship.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen continued to recall, he could slowly make out the outline of the square.</br>
</br>
The electric barriers had scattered across the street. Fallout shelter 027 was written on the concrete ground. The menacing human bones along with the concrete debris were piled on the road as it was barely visible under the snow.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the square was a transport elevator connected to the underground space. On top of the elevator, a figure stood.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he stopped moving. He lifted his hand to signal for the rest of the team to stop.</br>
</br>
PAC uniform, ponytail swaying along with the wind. From afar, Jiang Chen could only see these things.</br>
</br>
The person seemed to have noticed Jiang Chen and began to walk in his direction in firm strides.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo who stood beside Jiang Chen was also equipped with a power armor. Seeing the person walk over, he lifted the gun in his hand.</br>
</br>
The person's footstep paused for a second, but didn't stop moving forward.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put his hand on Cheng Weiguo's gun as he shook his head.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo understood as he put down his weapon.</br>
</br>
It was a woman. But her bold face held a hint of masculinity. Her ponytail swayed in the wind. As she closed her apathetic looking eyes, she exuded a vibe similar to Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
The only difference was, from her, Jiang Chen couldn't see any emotion of fear.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dubiously grinned. He didn't know where she found the confidence to come alone.</br>
</br>
Unless she was like officer Shi Yongtian and had no idea about the condition on the surface?</br>
</br>
At about two meters away from Jiang Chen, the woman stopped.</br>
</br>
"Colonel, Han Junhua."</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, although you probably know already." His voice diffused from the metallic armor as a damped sounding echo lingered.</br>
</br>
It was a basic friendly gesture to open the helmet of the power armor when in conversation, but Jiang Chen didn't as he was not there to make friends.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"You are standing here waiting for me?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Then you must know my intention of coming here." Jiang Chen glanced at Han Junhua below him as he laughed.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Do you only know how to say yes?" Jiang Chen couldn't help but comment.</br>
</br>
"Is that the Type 50 electromagnetic pulse cannon?" Scanning the truck behind Jiang Chen, Han Junhua abruptly asked an irrelevant question.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen didn't know why she would ask that, it was nothing worth hiding, so he nodded his head honestly.</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
"A three-axle truck with a load of 40 tons to carry the 50 type electromagnetic cannon, sacrificing armor to increase firepower."</br>
</br>
"That's right, what do you think? Do you think you can win?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
Even if she knew her odds of winning, she still did not look fearful. Her calm expression made Jiang Chen unable to see through her.</br>
</br>
"Your technological capability is all over the place. While you inherited some of the pre-war technology in some fields, you don't have a research system at all, am I right?" Han Junhua directly pointed out the weakness of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
"Is that a problem?" Jiang Chen said lightly.</br>
</br>
"We possess advanced technology and a comprehensive research system, the things you are currently lacking," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
"So we are here," Jiang Chen didn't retort Han Junhua's words as he said harshly.</br>
</br>
"We can do a trade," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
"Trade is built on the two parties being equal in force." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"No, precisely speaking, it is built in the case where both parties have concerns." Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Do you think I have concerns?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't say anything, she only reached into her pocket and took out a pistol.</br>
</br>
The pistol alone would not pose any threat to Jiang Chen in the power armor, but the soldiers behind him still raised their weapons and pointed their rifles at her. If she dared to point the gun at their leader, they would press the trigger and shred her to pieces.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't say anything, nor did he stop the soldiers' action. He only narrowed his eyes and gazed into her eyes.</br>
</br>
In her eyes, he didn't see any wavering.</br>
</br>
She raised the gun and pointed it at her own head.</br>
</br>
Everyone was stunned, including Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Before I left the fallout shelter, as the leader of the fallout shelter, I used my authority to execute a final order to the fallout shelter terminal."</br>
</br>
"After 24 hours, if the fallout shelter cannot detect my life signal, the doors will be locked shut and will be locked for another 50 years.</br>
</br>
"At the same time, the door between the resident's area and the functional area will be temporarily locked. The main control system will use the ventilation system to inject excessive gas to execute 925 residents."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils contracted as he stared at the crazy woman in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't react to Jiang Chen's disbelief as she continued speaking. As if she was just reading a passage from a prayer, her calm tone had no emotional fluctuations at all.</br>
</br>
"The bodies of 925 residents will enter the organic converter to be converted into organics, water, and energy."</br>
</br>
"With the most minimum requirement to maintain life activity, the fallout shelter will take the remaining 828 people to fifty years later. If you are willing to wait, see you in fifty years."</br>
</br>
"You are mad."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen locked his sight on Han Junhua's eyes, and he attempted to see any fear of death from her pupils.</br>
</br>
But other than the apathy to life, he didn't see anything else.</br>
</br>
"This is the worst choice." Han Junhua opened the safety.</br>
</br>
"Even if you surrender to me, I won't do anything to you. You will live a great life. You don't have to make this choice!"</br>
</br>
He was telling the truth, he didn't torture anyone. Even the slaves in the Fishbone base lived with dignity.</br>
</br>
"But no one can ensure this point. One minute later, I will press the trigger." Han Junhua closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere between them was frozen.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for half a minute.</br>
</br>
In the last few seconds, his helmet finally opened.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh and looked at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"...Okay, let's talk about the trade."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
On the spacious transport elevator stood ten figures.</br>
</br>
"What is this?" Han Junhua squeezed the tiny green crystal as she asked.</br>
</br>
"A crystal. Combined with the special energy extraction device, it can replace the nuclear fusion core." Jiang Chen stared at the wall rapidly descending outside the elevator and answered nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"It is hard to believe how much energy can store in this tiny piece," Han Junhua gazed at the reflection on the green crystal as she muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her and didn't respond.</br>
</br>
Behind him were eight soldiers in kinetic skeletons. They were all on alert for any possible dangers.</br>
</br>
In contrast, Jiang Chen looked rather relaxed.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes ago, he and Han Junhua reached an agreement.</br>
</br>
He previous thought a girl that completely lacked human nature would demand a lot of benefits, but the after fact proved him wrong.</br>
</br>
Although she had proposed this agreement, it was much more beneficial to the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
The agreement was as follows:</br>
</br>
The door of the fallout shelter will remain permanently open. By name, they surrender to the Fishbone base. Fallout shelter 027 only maintains their existing security force and will no longer expand its military size. Fishbone base will stop invading and maintain a safe distance with fallout shelter 027.</br>
</br>
The two parties will engage in trade. The Fishbone base will be responsible for providing energy as well as other supplies necessary for the fallout shelter to function while the fallout shelter will become a research facility, providing technical support to the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Fishbone base will build a camp above the fallout shelter, used to accommodate the excess residents in the fallout shelter. The fallout shelter will maintain its high degree of autonomy to the camp. The Fishbone Base will be responsible for the camp's security.</br>
</br>
Also, Jiang Chen will send a representative and several workers to be stationed in fallout shelter 027. They will be responsible for communication and recording necessary supplies.</br>
</br>
Fallout shelter 027 will also send a representative to Fishbone base and conduct a long-term assessment of the human rights rules in Fishbone base. After enough trust is built, fallout shelter 027 will gradually become part of Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
Although the formality of the situation was no longer important, since an agreement has been reached, fallout shelter 027 became a subsidiary of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
A subsidary that maintained a safe distance away.</br>
</br>
A slight feeling of falling came from under his feet as the elevator reached the ground.</br>
</br>
"I don't understand. This agreement seems to be disadvantageous for you?" Jiang Chen looked at the light gradually appearing as he asked.</br>
</br>
It practically meant they became part of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
</br>
The only difference other than being occupied was, Fishbone base's soldiers were not permitted to enter the fallout shelter. But since they controlled everything, there was no difference between going inside or not.</br>
</br>
"The purpose of establishing the fallout shelter is to maintain and preserve the flame of civilization. Once conditions turn back to normal, re-establish the colony on top of the ruins. The purpose was not to return to the surface and establish dominance on the victims."</br>
</br>
If the Fishbone base could replace fallout shelter 027 and execute its mission, and they do have more ability to complete the mission, there is nothing wrong with fallout shelter 027 becoming part of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
Of course, it is on the premises that they can maintain their promise and ensure the freedom and safety of all residents in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
But this trust could only be established with time.</br>
</br>
"Your explanation is rather unique. That's not what Shi Yongtian told me." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"It was my mistake to send him to the surface," Han Junhua admitted honestly.</br>
</br>
If the PAC image has already collapsed in the hearts of the survivors, it was comical to send a PAC officer to persuade the survivors. But she was not to be blamed. Who would have guessed this was how the war ended?</br>
</br>
Once elevator became stationary, Jiang Chen signaled the soldiers to stay there as Han Junhua and him walked to the gear-shaped door.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua pulled off a cable from the door and connected it to her EP.</br>
</br>
"How was the negotiation?" Tian Feng asked anxiously.</br>
</br>
"Successful, open the door."</br>
</br>
When he heard Han Junhua's instruction, Tian Feng felt relieved as he signaled the worker in the control room to open the fallout shelter door.</br>
</br>
Dust flew as the gear-shaped door gradually rolled open, exposing the tunnel behind it.</br>
</br>
The suspended bridge with the guidance of the mechanical arm formed a road, connecting the entrance to its interior space.</br>
</br>
"It is hard to believe that 1000 meters under the surface is a space like this."</br>
</br>
"Do you want to come inside?" Han Junhua asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Although he was interested in a tour, Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"That's okay, just here is fine."</br>
</br>
Funny. If I went in, how would I know if you would take me hostage or not?</br>
</br>
"Your concern is exactly our concern."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Explain?" Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua, quite interested in her thought.</br>
</br>
"You are afraid of coming in, just like we are afraid of letting you in. Isn't that correct?" Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a second before he started laughing.</br>
</br>
The soldiers behind him were lost as they didn't know why their leader was suddenly laughing.</br>
</br>
The PAC soldiers felt highly alerted in the fallout shelter and were also confused as they cautiously looked at Jiang Chen standing beside Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"You are an interesting person." Jiang Chen shrugged and grinned.</br>
</br>
"That's surprising. Even I consider myself a boring person." She forced her the muscles around her mouth to move and left this one sentence before walking inside the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't wait long at the door.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua took out the drafted agreement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only scanned it before signing on both agreements. Both parties each hold a copy. The agreement was effective immediately.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed when signing this "surrender agreement", a middle-aged man stood behind Han Junhua as he looked at him with suspicion and hatred.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't express anything as he smiled indifferently. Then he put away the agreement that belonged to him.</br>
</br>
Before entering the elevator back to the surface, Jiang Chen turned around to look at the Han Junhua, who was sending him to the elevator.</br>
</br>
"The Fishbone base representative will arrive tomorrow. The first batch of supplies will be here by the day after tomorrow. I hope you won't close the door after taking the crystals, or I might be angry and blow the cave up." Jiang Chen used a joking tone.</br>
</br>
"We will fulfill our promise. Please don't use threatening jokes to test our already weak trust," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
"Haha, don't think about it too much, it is only a joke. Of course, I trust that you will fulfill your promise." While Jiang Chen laughed, he got on the elevator and pressed the start button.</br>
</br>
"See you later."</br>
</br>
"See you."</br>
</br>
She watched the elevator ascend before going back into the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
On the way back to her office, she could feel eyes filled with suspicion and mistrust looking at her.</br>
</br>
There was nothing wrong with there gazes. Since a few minutes ago, she "sold" the fallout shelter to someone called Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
She sat on the chair as she looked at the lonely room and suddenly let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
From today on, all the residents in the fallout shelter could return to the surface and enjoy an unlimited amount of ultraviolet radiation and breath in the free air.</br>
</br>
Except for her.</br>
</br>
She chose to use herself as the deterrence, therefore giving up the opportunity to return to the surface.</br>
</br>
At least before enough trust is established.</br>
</br>
She suddenly felt really tired.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua slowly put her head down on the table as she took a rare nap.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 294: Camp 027</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The tag of Fallout Shelter 027 had been taken away and was replaced by a camp 27 road sign.</br>
</br>
The people in blue fallout shelter uniforms returned to the surface through the elevator.</br>
</br>
When they saw the thin rays of sunshine, they cheered, cried, ran on the street, and kissed the ground.</br>
</br>
And the Fishbone soldiers stood in small circles as they chitchatted to kill time while comically examining those lunatics.</br>
</br>
"Are these guys crazy?" Jiang Chen shockingly raised his eyebrows as he looked the blues skins cheering.</br>
</br>
"They waited for too long." Cheng Weiguo had a cigarette in his mouth as he grinned.</br>
</br>
After the initial excitement, the residents quickly calmed down.</br>
</br>
Under the instructions of the manager sent by Fallout Shelter 027, the one hundred residents gathered in the middle of the square and began to unload their construction material.</br>
</br>
It was a metallic board. That thing was magical as it seemed to be a memory metal.</br>
</br>
A blue skin drove a small construction car with the fifty square meter board. He then dropped the metal board onto the ground and waited for the blue skin on the side to rip off the plastic on the outside. After being in contact with the air for a moment, Jiang Chen saw a few cracks appear in the middle of the fifty square meter metal board. It began to move like a transformer as it automatically assembled into a metal house with doors and windows.</br>
</br>
It almost made Jiang Chen's eyes pop out.</br>
</br>
It was magical!</br>
</br>
Seeing the lack of shock on Cheng Weiguo's face, he thought it must not be a rarity before the war. But even if they were not shocked, they were definitely envious.</br>
</br>
No wonder the raiders favored these blue skins, they have too many good things.</br>
</br>
Although it was not at the point where they would rob them, Jiang Chen still dragged the manager in charge of camp construction and asked him how many of this things were left in the fallout shelter. The manager understood Jiang Chen's intention as he had a helpless expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"There is not a lot of this in the fallout shelter, only one hundred set."</br>
</br>
"Only one hundred set?" Jiang Chen was unwilling to give up, "What about production technique? You must have the blueprints?"</br>
</br>
There was nothing to hide, the manager nodded. "We do have it, but it is troublesome to produce. Without exaggeration, to produce a mobile home like this before the war, the cost was enough to build four houses with far better conditions. The only advantage of this is the lack of space it occupies. If it was not for placing inside the fallout shelter, there was no need to manufacture these things."</br>
</br>
Since the cost of building a fallout shelter was at a daunting one million per square meter, in the space-constrained fallout shelter, it would cost more to store construction materials.</br>
</br>
When he heard about this, Jiang Chen didn't bother with it anymore.</br>
</br>
</br>
But he still remembered it in the back of his mind.</br>
</br>
Although it might not be useful now, who knows if it will be useful in the future? For example in aerospace, this thing should have a wide range of applications.</br>
</br>
In less than half an hour of work, the two small construction vehicles made a few trips along the square before one hundred small mobile homes were neatly placed in the square. The fallout shelter residents carried their belongings and entered the metal homes in order.</br>
</br>
Eighty of them had fallout shelter residents living inside, while the other twenty were given to the Fishbone force stationed there for them to distribute.</br>
</br>
Not long after, under the protection of a little over ten soldiers, three trucks rolled into the square.</br>
</br>
The trucks were filled with construction materials and workers from the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
It was not enough to just have a place stay, to protect the safety of the camp, walls were also necessary.</br>
</br>
The workers from the Fishbone base were mostly residents from Shenxiang town. After three months of work, they were promoted from "slaves" to "lower citizens" and some outstanding contributors were even promoted to "intermediate citizen".</br>
</br>
After parking on the empty ground, the workers jumped off the truck. After offloading the supplies, they skillfully set up the necessary construction equipment. Then following the engineer's directions, they began to dig the foundation of the wall.</br>
</br>
Based on the agreement, Fishbone base will build a wall on the outskirt of the square with a total distance of four thousand meters. The half-collapsed stores were bulldozed over, while the more complete buildings were circled inside the wall to be utilized.</br>
</br>
The workers on the campsite were busily working as the clanking and hammering sound from their equipment persisted till midnight. A lot of frozen zombies were attracted by their scent as they dragged their limping bodies near the camp.</br>
</br>
But the Fishbone soldiers were well prepared. The soldiers stationed on the street raised their rifles as a few shots took down the scattered zombies. Maybe it was because this area was not concentrated with zombies, or because the low temperature suppressed the reproduction of the zombies in the city center until summer, but it was hard to see a sizeable group of zombies in the Wanghai rural area.</br>
</br>
The construction of the camp was well underway, but compared to the liveliness on the surface, it was a lot more deserted in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua sat in front of the table as she looked apathetically at the enraged Wu Yaguo.</br>
</br>
"What did you do. Asking him to help us build our camp, I don't disagree with, but what's the point of stationing their forces here? Do you want us to become their slaves?"</br>
</br>
"From my perspective, this is the best ending." Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Both take what they need as they feared the same unbearable consequence. Both parties remain restrained.</br>
</br>
"Are you dumb or what? Since they are need of us, we can use the technology in our hand to demand more benefits!"</br>
</br>
When she heard Wu Yaguo's accusation, Han Junhua just found it funny.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, she couldn't laugh out loud.</br>
</br>
"Do you know what they brought when they came?"</br>
</br>
"What?" Wu Yaguo said uncaringly, "A huge army? So what? Even if we can't win, as long as we close the door, they can't come in. Unless they don't want our technology, or he wouldn't have sat down with us and talked it out."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
"They already know the news of our energy shortage. Or rather, it is not a secret at all. Threatening wouldn't work."</br>
</br>
"Then we will threaten them with our death." Wu Yaguo said fiercely. "If the door never opens, they will get nothing."</br>
</br>
"Have you ever heard of gambling?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo's eyebrows raised as he didn't understand.</br>
</br>
Seeing as he didn't speak, Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
"Two gamblers sat in front of the gambling table, both are eyeing the chips in the other person's hand. The rule of the game is simple. Each person holds a gun, but they are pointed at the same person. A uses the gun to force B to give up their chips, B uses the gun to point at himself to threaten A. The game revolves around the life of B. If B dies, A would get nothing."</br>
</br>
"This rule is not fair to begin with." Wu Yaguo laughed.</br>
</br>
"Rules are always unfair to the weak," Han Junhua said emotionlessly. "A few hours ago, Jiang Chen and I both held a gun. Except before the game started, I pointed the gun at my own head."</br>
</br>
That kind of apathy made Wu Yaguo hold his breath.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
As to who the representative stationed at fallout shelter 027 should be, Jiang Chen gave the task to the person in charge of the logistics department - Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
The representative's primary task was to the record the needs of the fallout shelter, and communicate the research direction to Jiang Chen. It was mostly a supporting job. Other than this basic task, Jiang Chen also gave the representative another mission, which was to verify their energy usage to prevent the fallout shelter from hoarding energy.</br>
</br>
The next morning, the representative followed the truck transporting construction material to camp 27.</br>
</br>
A 25 years old female name Xu Lu took on the role of the representative as she was part of the knight class. She acted as a salesperson in an insurance company before the war. Then she entered the hibernation chamber during the war and ended up at the Sixth Street ghetto after waking up. She was part of the first group of survivors the Fishbone base bought. Because she looked adorable, articulated well, was attention oriented, and possessed the right amount of experience, she was perfect for the representative role.</br>
</br>
The other five staff members were upper citizens of the base. They will be on a rotating shift to enter the fallout shelter to support Xu Lu's work.</br>
</br>
"Pay attention when you stay in the fallout shelter. Walk around, and be on good terms with the residents in the fallout shelter. You are representing the image of the Fishbone base." Jiang Chen patted her shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry boss, you can count on me." Xu Lu playfully saluted as she giggled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he watched her go down the elevator.</br>
</br>
Followed by the flashing signal light, the six people disappeared from the surface down to the cave a thousand meter below.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a young looking woman in the blue fallout shelter uniform walked up to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang, my name is Zhang Yuzhu, I will be the ambassador representing fallout shelter 027 to be stationed in the Fishbone base." A young looking girl's voice was pleasing to the ears. She was also very fluent. The only blemish was the slight nervousness in her tone.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, the representative sent by both parties were female.</br>
</br>
Based on the consideration of alleviating the tension in diplomacy? Since the wasteland had no professional diplomats.</br>
</br>
An interesting coincidence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he got rid of the weird thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the ambassador from head to toe as he smiled. "How old are you?"</br>
</br>
"Eh?... Twenty years old." Zhang Yuzhu paused as she didn't know why Jiang Chen would ask that question, but she still answered honestly.</br>
</br>
"Twenty?" How long did the fallout shelter close for?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It will be twenty years by July of this year," Zhang Yuzhu said.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Twenty years, twenty years old. Were you born in the first year of the fallout shelter?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"No, my father told me, I was born outside of the fallout shelter, but only a few months old when I entered the place." Zhang Yuzhu timidly smiled.</br>
</br>
"I see... Speaking of this, working somewhere so far away from home, is your father not worried?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yuzhu shook her head.</br>
</br>
"He has passed away already."</br>
</br>
"I am sorry."</br>
</br>
"It's okay, he left peacefully. Everyone the fallout shelter said he was a great guy. But... he always said he was sorry about everything. Although I don't understand why my father would say that, but if I can replace him to help other people, then it would make him watching over me from above feel better."</br>
</br>
When she finished speaking, a timid but bright smile surfaced on Zhang Yuzhu's face.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, you will." Watching the smiling face, Jiang Chen also smiled as he encouraged this little girl.</br>
</br>
It was a heartwarming story, even in the fallout shelter, without seeing any daylight, it could breed such a beautiful soul?</br>
</br>
After sending the little girl to the truck returning to the base, Jiang Chen was about the return to where the Fishbone soldiers were stationed, but he happened to see a group of people forming a circle at the other gate of the camp.</br>
</br>
Seeing the commotion, Jiang Chen walked over.</br>
</br>
"... Listen, everyone. With only a small piece, everyone can become a sharpshooter! This is the good stuff I transported from Liuding Town, 100% pure! Don't you want to try? I promise, the feeling is remarkable!"</br>
</br>
A suspiciously dressed merchant was passionately speaking as he was selling suspicious substance to the Fishbone soldiers guarding the door.</br>
</br>
He had a double-headed cow behind him and on its back was bags full of odd products.</br>
</br>
"What's the purpose of this?" He walked behind the crowd as Jiang Chen looked at the crowd quite curiously.</br>
</br>
When they heard Jiang Chen's voice, the soldiers slacking off were almost scared to death.</br>
</br>
No one listened to the merchant's bullsh*t as the soldiers scattered and returned to their post.</br>
</br>
Seeing all of his customers run away, the merchant blamingly looked at Jiang Chen as he stuffed the small vials into the bag on the double-headed cow's back and dragged its leash as he prepared to leave.</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that for this person to be able to scare the people carrying guns, this person's status must not be low. Although Jiang Chen ruined his business, he didn't dare to complain. Since a merchant like him was putting his life on the line, if he accidentally offended someone and got shot, it would be a tragedy.</br>
</br>
"What is this thing? You haven't answered me yet." Seeing as he wanted to leave, Jiang Chen asked again.</br>
</br>
"Jet, a magical thing that will increase the human sense. The exact effect is that after eating it, the world will appear to slow down." Seeing Jiang Chen's interest in wanting to buy it, the merchant stopped and began to give his pitch.</br>
</br>
Just like bullet time effect? Then it must be a good thing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin quite interested.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? A piece is only 10 crystals." The merchant rushed to him as he saw Jiang Chen's expression.</br>
</br>
"That thing only sells for 4 crystals a piece at the Sixth Street, I've seen it before." A soldier not too far away from Jiang Chen alerted, afraid the boss would be tricked.</br>
</br>
The merchant's eyes opened wide.</br>
</br>
"Could the thing from the Sixth Street be comparable to mine? My Jet is not addictive. Do you dare to eat the things they sell?"</br>
</br>
"You must be lying. Is there non-addictive Jet?" Another soldier mocked.</br>
</br>
When he heard this thing would be addictive, Jiang Chen instantly lost his interest.</br>
</br>
But seeing the merchant argue with the soldier, Jiang Chen had another idea.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, you are saying that your Jet is an improved version, stronger than the ones sold at the Sixth Street pharmacy? Non-addictive?" Jiang Chen cleared his throat as he interrupted the two's bantering.</br>
</br>
"That's right," the merchant proudly fixed his collar as he looked at Jiang Chen. "I can promise with my life that regardless how my Jet is used, it is non-addictive."</br>
</br>
"Okay, good." Jiang Chen nodded, "How many do you have on you?"</br>
</br>
"I only made... I mean I only brought 53 pieces," the merchant said.</br>
</br>
"What is your name?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Meng Qian."</br>
</br>
"Okay Meng Qian, this is 530 crystals." Jiang Chen put his hand in his pocket and took out a few sizable crystals from the storage dimension and threw it to him.</br>
</br>
"Thanks, boss." Meng Qian nodded and bowed as he joyfully handed the small vials of drug.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's next sentence made Meng Qian's heart freeze.</br>
</br>
"You are welcome." Jiang Chen casually threw the drug into the hands of the soldier beside him and pointed at the merchant packing up the crystals.</br>
</br>
"Capture him and feed him the drug. Report back to me if there are no problems."</br>
</br>
No matter how that person begged, Jiang Chen turned around and went back to camp.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
And seeing the result, that guy was a liar.</br>
</br>
That drug was not Jet at all, but something odd...</br>
</br>
After taking two pills, the person fell to the ground, unconscious.</br>
</br>
It was apparent it wasn't Jet, Jet wouldn't make a person unconscious after two pills. When he remembered this evil merchant was selling this to them, the soldiers were furious. They confiscated all the crystals from the guy's body before throwing him outside of the camp's gate.</br>
</br>
The small crystals were distributed among the soldiers. However, with the 530 crystals Jiang Chen paid, they were too scared to take it. Thus as the captain, after deliberating for a while, he personally sent the crystals to Jiang Chen and reported the incident to him.</br>
</br>
From the moment he saw him, Jiang Chen knew that guy was up to no good, so he was not surprised at all by the report. Jiang Chen paid for that drug purely because he wanted to waste some time and tease the liar.</br>
</br>
As for the 530 crystals, Jiang Chen didn't take it back as he asked the captain to distribute it amongst the soldiers. The wall has yet to be built. Therefore it was tiring to stand outside in the harsh winter. With 530 crystals, everyone would at least be given five. To the soldiers without money, and prioritized being fed well and kept warm, this was a sizable amount of wealth.</br>
</br>
Seeing the grateful captain run out of the door in excitement, Jiang Chen smiled, locked the camp door, and prepared to go to bed.</br>
</br>
He thought the incident would be over, but it was not...</br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
At the bus stop outside of the square, a shivering figure stood in the icy wind. The person would constantly look at the end of the street, and classically roll up his sleeves to look at the time. His two eyebrows were tightly locked together as if he was anxiously waiting for something.</br>
</br>
It was like this for a while.</br>
</br>
On the desolated street, his action was peculiar.</br>
</br>
The soldiers patrolling at the gate watched the weird guy afar as they judged him.</br>
</br>
Not long after, Jiang Chen, along with two soldiers in kinetic skeletons, slowly strolled over.</br>
</br>
When he approached, he found out it was Meng Qian, the one who sold the drugs to him. Jiang Chen surprisingly raised his eyebrows as he walked towards him.</br>
</br>
"What are you doing?"</br>
</br>
"Do you even need to ask? I'm waiting for the bus," Meng Qian glanced at Jiang Chen who stood beside him as he said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Bus?" Jiang Chen examined him quite curiously.</br>
</br>
"That's right, it seems to be late." Meng Qian frustratedly cursed a few times, but the man let out a sigh, tightened his collar, and prepared to leave.</br>
</br>
"Wait, where is your cow?" Seeing he was about to leave, Jiang Chen stopped him.</br>
</br>
"Cow? What are you even talking about?" Meng Qian turned around and looked at Jiang Chen as if he was crazy. Then he frowned as he asked back.</br>
</br>
</br>
His eyes looked as if he was looking at a psycho.</br>
</br>
Pretending to be dumb or really dumb? Jiang Chen's expression turned peculiar.</br>
</br>
Instinct told him, the reaction of this guy must have something to do the with the drug from yesterday.</br>
</br>
"Where are you planning to go?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Going to work," the person said, irritated.</br>
</br>
"Going to work?" Jiang Chen was confused as he looked at him as a psycho as well.</br>
</br>
"That's right, is there a problem? Fu*k, it's so late already..." After glancing at his rolled up sleeve, Meng Qian cursed as he ignored Jiang Chen and walked to the other end of the street in quick steps.</br>
</br>
Just as the soldiers behind Jiang Chen raised their guns and prepared to stop him, Jiang Chen stopped them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thoughtfully looked at Meng Qian moving in the distance as he ordered the two soldiers.</br>
</br>
"You two follow him first, I will be right there."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The two soldiers saluted as they began to jog after him.</br>
</br>
After he returned the base, Jiang Chen notified Cheng Weiguo before he equipped himself with the T-3 power armor and chased after Meng Qian.</br>
</br>
The two soldiers following Meng Qian were both knights of the Fishbone base; they were injected with the "honorary chip" it just had a different name. Therefore, their two-dimensional coordinates will appear on the EP map as green dots.</br>
</br>
After inputting the map's information into the full sensory screen in the power armor helmet, Jiang Chen moved at full speed to catch up with the two green dots.</br>
</br>
The snow was thick on the highway. Jiang Chen was planning to initiate gliding mode to chase them, but because the wheels were losing grip on the ground, he had to run.</br>
</br>
After wasting some time on the road, Jiang Chen finally arrived at the destination. However, the two soldiers were already waiting there for him.</br>
</br>
"Where did he go?" Jiang Chen slowed his speed in front of the two as he asked.</br>
</br>
"He went in. We were worried that we may alert them, so we didn't follow." The soldier pointed across the street.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes and looked over.</br>
</br>
It was a small mall three floors high. There was a sign that read "Like Store" dangling from the roof. From the car wreckages in front of the entrance, this place was popular before the war. A lot of the mall's windows were sealed shut with wooden boards or other materials. The rest of them were covered by curtains.</br>
</br>
Only the glass door of the mall was wide open.</br>
</br>
It blocked all possibility of peeking in from the outside. At the same time, there was to blockade at the front door.</br>
</br>
The building looking suspicious!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the dark entrance as he frowned. He opened the life detection device on the power armor. The waves scanned the hologram map, but when it passed through the building, there was not a single signal on the device.</br>
</br>
From this point, there seemed to be no human activity in the mall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't feel too surprised by the result, he was more confident that there was something strange inside.</br>
</br>
Although this device is effective in the modern world, which has a lower technology level, it is not so useful in the apocalypse. A lot of survivor groups, mercenaries, or raiders with a clever mind would install life detection device shields in their home to prevent their coordinates from being detected by people with ill-intention.</br>
</br>
The guy called Meng Qian just went inside, how could there be no one inside?</br>
</br>
"How long did he go in for?" Jiang Chen said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
The older soldier looked at his EP. "10 minutes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment.</br>
</br>
[The strange hallucination drug. The merchant appeared at the camp gate out of nowhere. Is this a coincidence? But it is too much of a coincidence.]</br>
</br>
Camp 27 has been built for only two days; the wall was not even half constructed yet. And there just happened to be a merchant that was passing by. One who was not even sure about the kind of people the group consisted of and walked over to the gate to sell products to the patrols who were holding guns? It didn't make sense.</br>
</br>
If the soldiers had bought his drug, they would also experience hallucinations and walk into here?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about this, his expression turned stern but then loosened.</br>
</br>
If they were targeting the Fishbone base, no reason not to recognize him as the general. But from the actions of the merchant, he didn't seem to recognize him. From this point alone, he shouldn't be targeting the base.</br>
</br>
Then they must be coming for Fallout Shelter 027!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes began to light up as the clues in his head became more evident.</br>
</br>
The opponent seems to have acquired the knowledge that fallout shelter 027 has opened. Then for some reason, they tried to lure the residents here. But the merchant didn't know the specifics of the plan as he was just ordered to sell the drug. So, he didn't care if they were "blue skins" or not.</br>
</br>
It would make sense this way.</br>
</br>
As to their intention, he would only know if he enters the building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the pitch black door, as well as the window only covered in cloth and instantly had an idea.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 297"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 297: How could it be this guy?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was unwise to enter through the front door, but Jiang Chen didn't plan to do that in the first place.</br>
</br>
The drone can take care of the reconnaissance.</br>
</br>
He ordered the older soldier to notify Cheng Weiguo and ask him to bring some soldiers for backup. At the same time, he ordered the younger soldier to stay by the back door of the mall to prevent people from escaping.</br>
</br>
After doing all this, Jiang Chen took out a hummingbird drone from the storage dimension. This type of hummingbird drone was not attached to a machine gun, but rather a set of light multifunctionality reconnaissance device. It would complete any reconnaissance mission and was a convenient tool.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was not completely satisfied. After deliberating for a moment, he also attached two fist-sized sticky explosives on top of the drone as he utilized the remaining load.</br>
</br>
After connecting the drone to the computer in his power armor, he slowly approached the mall. Then in front of the KFC, close to the front door, he threw out the disc in his hand as he controlled the drone and flew it to the third-floor window.</br>
</br>
Without making a sound, the disc sized drone approached the cloth-sealed window as the pin camera pierced into the cloth.</br>
</br>
Other than an office table and a row of filing cabinets, there was nothing else suspicious in the room.</br>
</br>
After slicing a small opening in the cloth, the drone flew into the room. Underneath the window, Jiang Chen saw a round shaped landmine.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt his scalp tingling.</br>
</br>
Good thing he didn't just flip inside, it was filled with traps.</br>
</br>
Not only at the window but below the open door, an infrared trip mine was also hidden.</br>
</br>
But those things were useless against a drone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen skillfully controlled the drone as it flew into the deserted tunnel as he searched room by room.</br>
</br>
Most of the rooms were empty or rather stuffed with pre-war office supplies.</br>
</br>
But in a room at the end of the hallway, Jiang Chen saw something that looked different.</br>
</br>
Four fridge-sized metal equipment were lined up and placed at the entrance of the door. Along with the equipment, a faint fan noise could be heard. There were computer towers? But it didn't look like that was possible.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the room was a surgery table filled with blood. The light squeezing through the cracks of the wooden boards happened to scatter on the blood stains. A few surgical knifes were placed a rusty tray nearby. From the yet to turn black bloodstains, a surgery seemed to have occurred not too long ago.</br>
</br>
What was more daunting was the paint in the paint can.</br>
</br>
The content of the can was obviously not painted, but blood mixed with meat chunks and broken limbs.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k." Jiang Chen outside of the mall cursed as his stomach turned.</br>
</br>
These were obviously not things that belonged to a mall.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was controlling the drone to hover around the room, looking for other evidence, a sound came from the floor below.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately controlled the drone to hover out of the room and fly down along the stairs.</br>
</br>
After directly flying through a row of offices, the disc stopped at the door of an office.</br>
</br>
The door was closed, but it couldn't stop the genius Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
This girl was not only talented in programming, but she was also experienced in electronic device modification. Jiang Chen carefully controlled the hummingbird drone towards the doorknob, aimed it at the mechanical lock, and pierced the pin camera inside.</br>
</br>
The needle followed the lock pattern inside. After making a few turns, it successfully came out on the other side.</br>
</br>
It was dark inside the room, but there was enough light to see clearly.</br>
</br>
There were four people inside the room, three stood up, one was on the ground.</br>
</br>
Meng Qian was the one who was lying on the ground. The person closest to him was a bearded man. He couldn't see the face of a tall but thin man, but instinct told Jiang Chen that he was dangerous. As to the man with his back against the door, he didn't look important and must be a pawn only.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Hell, why did this dumb*ss eat the drug himself, didn't I tell him not to eat it himself! What is this dumb*ss' brain made out of." The bearded man cursed as he kicked the unconscious Meng Qian.</br>
</br>
The kick seemed to hurt Meng Qian as he woke up from unconsciousness.</br>
</br>
When he realized that he was tied up, his eyes began to quiver in fear.</br>
</br>
"What do we do next?" The tall and thin man carrying a fluid-shaped rifle coldly looked at the twitching Meng Qian as he said without any emotion.</br>
</br>
"Hmm... Should we observe him for a bit longer?" The man at the door suggested.</br>
</br>
"That seems to be the only option, at least wait till he becomes conscious again." The bearded man sighed, sat on the chair, and lit up a cigarette.</br>
</br>
"Who are you? Why did you tie me up! God, are you crazy? Hongbo, little Du, come help me! These psychos..." Meng Qian screamed at the empty office table as he listlessly yellowed out random names.</br>
</br>
From the reactions on their faces, the names didn't belong to anyone there.</br>
</br>
"Who can keep this guy quiet?" The bearded man blew out a smoke ring as he said in annoyance.</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
A faint smoke rose from the rifle the slim man was holding.</br>
</br>
Meng Qian completely quieted down. In the widens eyes, his pupils began to dilate.</br>
</br>
Blood began to flow from the back of his head as it matched the daunting blood hole on his forehead.</br>
</br>
The room was gravely silent.</br>
</br>
Smoke slowly rose from the cigarette between his fingers. It froze there without moving. Then moments later a length of soot fell down.</br>
</br>
"You... killed him?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." The slim man said casually.</br>
</br>
Mouth twitched, the bearded man was clearly unsatisfied with what the guy did, but for some reason, he was afraid to be angry at the slim man.</br>
</br>
"Okay, that's good. Now we have to start over again." The bearded man slapped his thigh, threw away the cigarette in his hand, and complained while looking at his knee.</br>
</br>
"There was no value in that garbage," The slim man said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"At least we could have learned about the circumstances of that camp. Now, we won't even know if he had contact with those blue skins or not," The man standing at the door said feeling rather helpless.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he realized the lack of consideration or extreme arrogance, but the slim man didn't resolve his companion's complaints.</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, he used an authoritative tone.</br>
</br>
"Use mutated fly. Inject that drug into their poison bags, and then put them around the fallout shelter... I will take care of the surgery. You go find two mutated flies."</br>
</br>
Those flies were the size of human skulls. By using barbed maggots as their attacking mechanism, they were one of the most disgusting creatures on the wasteland. Although it didn't attack that often, it carried all kinds of bacteria, which made it problematic once one was infected.</br>
</br>
"You want it alive?" The bearded man raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." The person nodded.</br>
</br>
"Are you kidding me? Capturing two mutated flies alive? Do you think they are rabbits?" Perhaps his ordering tone made the bearded man unable to withstand it any longer but he roared at the slim man.</br>
</br>
"If you are infected with mutated bacteria, I can take care of it for you," still the same apathetic tone, the slim man responded.</br>
</br>
The bearded man scorned, "I won't let you touch my organs. Let me tell you, our Crimson Chamber of Commerce is only a partnership with you, not your servant."</br>
</br>
"Is this your boss's intention?"</br>
</br>
"We help you get into the fallout shelter, and you give us the ingredients to that drug-"</br>
</br>
"Shh." The slim man suddenly raised his finger and put it beside his lips.</br>
</br>
The room instantly quieted down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped as he began to maneuver the drone to move back.</br>
</br>
But then, an unfortunate thing happened.</br>
</br>
Because the lock has not been oiled for a long time, when the pin camera was retracting from the lock, it made a faint sound.</br>
</br>
"Who is there!" A loud shout came from behind the door as the man closest to the door quickly turned the doorknob and opened the door.</br>
</br>
Knowing that he has been discovered, Jiang Chen pushed the drone's engine power to its max. Following the buzzing sound, the drone dashed into the room.</br>
</br>
The slim man raised his gun. However, the instant Jiang Chen saw his face, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen? How could it be this guy?</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen pressed the trigger. At the same time, Jiang Chen pressed the detonation for the sticky explosive.</br>
</br>
The signal to the drone was lost. Jiang Chen raised his head to look at the second floor.</br>
</br>
After half a second.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Following the homing explosion, red flames scattered as it blew the wooden boards sealing the windows tens of meters away.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the thick snow coming out of the window and was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
He was lost. What show was this?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 298"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 298: Atomic Grenade</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The vibration from the explosion could be clearly felt ten meters away from the Like Mall. The two sticky explosives' TNT equivalency was two kilograms. Although it didn't have any metal shards inside, the shock of the explosion could easily have shattered the organs of the three people in the room.</br>
</br>
Since the construction of the building used technology from one and a half-century after his time, the mall that survived through the nuclear explosion didn't collapse because of the explosives.</br>
</br>
Watching the thick smoke, Jiang Chen estimated that the people inside all died, so he took out his tactical rifle and was about to enter the mall.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, a noisy shouting voice came from the mall.</br>
</br>
There were more than three people inside. The explosion alerted the other people inside the building. The pawns in rifles quickly rushed to the first floor as they bumped into Jiang Chen who was about to enter the mall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was a step faster.</br>
</br>
The tactical rifle in his hands spit out flames as he swept down three or four people during the first encounter.</br>
</br>
However, those mercenaries dressed soldiers were not to be underestimated. When they saw they were facing a power armor, they buried their heads along the rows of hangers and passed through the flame before hiding under the nearest cover.</br>
</br>
The rifles in their hands were not the "toys" the CIB had in their factories. To the power armor produced from the same era, it certainly posed a threat. Although the bullets were deflected off of Jiang Chen's armor and didn't penetrate through it, the high kinetic energy from the shots brought Jiang Chen agony and he was forced to retreat behind cover.</br>
</br>
The T-3 type, after all, is an airdrop type power armor. If it was the land warfare type, with over one ton in weight, the bullets would feel more like a tickle.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, when I have the opportunity I'll get a land type to try." The debris that fell from the edge of the building made a loud sound when it scratched the surface of his power armor.</br>
</br>
With his back against the wall, Jiang Chen cursed, and then took a deep breath to calm himself down. He took out five heat sensor grenades from the storage dimension and threw them towards the door.</br>
</br>
The heat sensor grenades followed a parabola curve and landed by the cover of the mercenaries.</br>
</br>
The grenade sudden stopped mid-air as the booster from its side adjusted its direction and flew to the heat source - a few luring bombs hidden in the corner.</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
The explosion made Jiang Chen feel relieved. He stuck his head out of the bunker, but the small explosion forced him back.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cursed as he scanned the damage assessment of the power armor.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the bullets left only a few dents on his helmet without causing more significant damage.</br>
</br>
</br>
Obviously, the five heat sensor grenades didn't play their role.</br>
</br>
After all, on the wasteland, high-tech products were not rarities.</br>
</br>
Laughter came out of the mall as a few mercenaries, at the top of their lungs, began to shout profanity at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You only can do this? Your mom definitely pushed hard enough when you were born!"</br>
</br>
"Hahaha! You are wearing a fu*king power armor, a chicken would be more resistant than you.</br>
</br>
"Longtao, I didn't know you were this humourous before, haha -"</br>
</br>
Suppressing the anger in his heart, Jiang Chen took a deep breath, as a grimacing smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
The storage dimension opened, and this time, he took out a metal tube the size of a pen.</br>
</br>
"Hide this time!"</br>
</br>
After running out of cover, Jiang Chen threw the "pen" on the ground before quickly running in the opposite direction.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen escape, those mercenaries was suddenly anxious as they chased with their anti-armor weapons.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k you, don't run-"</br>
</br>
However, this insult didn't have time to come out before they were engulfed in an arc of explosions.</br>
</br>
The blinding lightning flashed; the high-energy particles flowed, instantly blurring the full sensory screen in Jiang Chen's helmet. The shockwave without suspense pushed down the wall by the door, the cement blocks were blown tens of meters away from to the corner of the street.</br>
</br>
It was not a pen, but an atomic grenade!</br>
</br>
This stuff was made out of the 500 kilograms of uranium Jiang Chen left to Lin Lin. Outside was a layer of lead shell, while the inside was a layer of explosives used to initiate the explosion. The ink was also 1g of uranium oxide pulled into filamentous.</br>
</br>
Just 1g of uranium oxide! With only 60% involved in the chain reaction. But even so, it had a terrifying 12 tons TNT equivalent of explosive power! Two sides of the wall on the first floor were gone, leaving two structural walls and some steel frames.</br>
</br>
"Talk sh*t again." Jiang Chen opened the helmet as he angrily spat out on the ground. Then he put the helmet on again and started the air filtration system inside the power armor.</br>
</br>
Even the radiation dust caused by 1g of uranium explosion still could not be underestimated. Especially in this airtight space, he must be careful the radiation doesn't surpass the threshold value.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked up and looked at the horrors of the mall. Jiang Chen couldn't help but feel speechless.</br>
</br>
Because the actual effect was uncertain, and the uranium oxide treatment was not easy, Lin Lin only made one grenade. Surprised at its power, Jiang Chen made up his mind to convince Lin Lin to manufacture some more.</br>
</br>
When he stepped inside the mall, he couldn't find a complete body of the clamoring mercenaries. It was hard to say from their body instantly reached boiling point or was shattered by the shockwave.</br>
</br>
After walking over a pile of black clothes, Jiang Chen didn't even pull out his gun as he walked to the stairs.</br>
</br>
No one can survive after this level of explosion.</br>
</br>
However, at this time, he suddenly felt alerted. He instinctively jumped back and ignited the two pairs of turbine engines behind his back.</br>
</br>
A faint blue light flickered, as he rapidly retreated to the door. Almost at the same time, a figure quickly jumped down from the hole in the ceiling as it mercilessly hit where he was standing.</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
Among the debris, he saw a dark blue laser sword. Along with it, was a face with half of his head shaved. Under the burned skin, mechanical parts filled his insides.</br>
</br>
What is this thing? A digitized human?!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked. While he retreated rapidly he pulled out the tactical rifle from his side. That person didn't hesitate either as he dashed towards him.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k are you!" Jiang Chen roared as he pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
This person was obviously not human!</br>
</br>
The bullets fired instantly weaved a net of fire.</br>
</br>
The person didn't answer, the light sword in hand changed.</br>
</br>
Like a stretched umbrella, light particles from the blade stripped forward, melting the bullets.</br>
</br>
Looking at this scene, Jiang Chen was so scared his hair stood up.</br>
</br>
Being able to melt steel core ammunition, the C-type steel armor would be hard to resist! Although the power armor surface was coated with a scattering coating, which would offer some resistance to laser bullets, he could not bet on the laser sword that had "continuous damage".</br>
</br>
"Ka -"</br>
</br>
The clip was empty!</br>
</br>
The man did not give Jiang Chen the time to change clip, the light particles formed into a sword, as it stabbed straight at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
In the moment of the clash, Jiang Chen clenched his teeth and his pupil contracted.</br>
</br>
"Invictus!"</br>
</br>
The ability above fury, he didn't use it since his last fight with the lead mutated human.</br>
</br>
It felt like his entire body was submerged in cold water, all of his emotions were thrown out from his body.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt his brain was never so clear!</br>
</br>
"Nitrogen shield."</br>
</br>
He muttered to himself as he developed the circle on his left arm.</br>
</br>
The violent air burst out instantly, the high-pressure nitrogen circulated, blowing away the high temperature of the light particles, and cut off the light sword touching his front chest.</br>
</br>
Pupil reflected the parameters, Jiang Chen suddenly stepped on the broken face of the man, while extinguishing the turbine engine and used the reactionary force to stand on the ground.</br>
</br>
The man saw the light sword lose its purpose and simply threw it aside. He then took out a dagger and dashed again.</br>
</br>
Seeing that there was no time to change the clip, Jiang Chen threw the rifle aside and also took out his dagger by the power armor.</br>
</br>
However, when the two daggers met, that person's blade in hand cut through Jiang Chen's like butter</br>
</br>
Although surprised by the sharpness of the dagger, Jiang Chen did not panic as he stepped sideways to dodge the blow.</br>
</br>
"Particle vibrating dagger?"</br>
</br>
While murmuring to himself, Jiang Chen backed up to avoid the man's second hit.</br>
</br>
The sound of the buzz didn't escape his ear. He heard Sun Jiao mention this thing before, but it was the first time seeing it.</br>
</br>
It was said that this stuff could cut C-type steel like tofu.</br>
</br>
His back was against the wall.</br>
</br>
See Jiang Chen had no way to escape, the man with only half of his mouth smiled and swung the dagger down at him.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen, seemingly out of moves, raised his left arm.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 299"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 299: A Digitalized Human? A Robot?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Screech!</br>
</br>
The cringing screeching sound went out of tune as the broken mechanical face looked shocked.</br>
</br>
But before he could use his electronic parts to demonstrate his surprise, Jiang Chen’s right hand already slapped onto his face as he grabbed his neck to spin him around before pressing him against the wall.</br>
</br>
Followed by the mechanical shattering sound, the digitalized human’s jaw moved. He attempted to break loose but seeing he couldn’t, he soon gave up as his eyes glanced at the dagger pierced into his left arm.</br>
</br>
"Wh…Why?" He pierced through the armor with that dagger but couldn’t move it out a single inch.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen deactivated Invictus and stared at the digitalized human with a grimace on his face.</br>
</br>
"Obviously, it is stuck."</br>
</br>
The instant the dagger cut through Jiang Chen's left arm armor, Jiang Chen went into overdrive and burned the entire electronic circuit on his left arm. The high temperature caused the armor to expand which resulted in the point of penetration to contrast, therefore clamping down the vibrating blade.</br>
</br>
The particle dagger that has stopped vibrating was worse than a standard blade.</br>
</br>
"With a normal human's reaction speed, this seems impossible," the digitalized human said.</br>
</br>
"The power armor read the data of the dagger’s movement and calculated the distance between the blade and the armor. Then you just have to count and burn the circuit." Jiang Chen sneered.</br>
</br>
To maximize his existing combat ability was the incredibleness of this Invictus ability.</br>
</br>
"Abandoning the entire left arm armor? That’s brave." The digitalized human laughed as he scanned the dagger beginning to smoke.</br>
</br>
The dagger forcefully clamped down was sent into overcapacity which meant this vibrating particle blade was also destroyed.</br>
</br>
"Now can you be truthful? What are you?" The hand around his neck tightened as Jiang Chen threatened.</br>
</br>
"Lin Chaoen, we met at the Sixth Street." With sparks coming from his neck, he stuttered.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen paused for a moment as he narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"You are a digitalized human?"</br>
</br>
"That’s right," Lin Chaoen said honestly as he gave Jiang Chen a hollow smile, "The fusion of technology."</br>
</br>
"I don’t have time to listen to your bullsh*t, you have two choices now. Tell me what you know, such as the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, the Defenders honestly. Or, be disassembled by me," Jiang Chen threatened coldly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen already considered Fallout Shelter 027 as part of his territory, he would not sit around when someone is plotting against his jurisdiction. On the other side, the Crimson Chamber of Commerce was his old rival, Cao Jinsong died in his hands.</br>
</br>
But what was unsettling to Jiang Chen was the Defender, Lin Chaoen said that they were the survivors of Jia City and had the goal of an uprising against the mutated human’s reign. But as of now, the Fishbone base’s information was still blank about them.</br>
</br>
</br>
Not knowing what the opponent thought was more fearsome than knowing what the enemy was plotting.</br>
</br>
"I chose the latter."</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen’s eyes contracted as he locked his sight on the mechanical pupils.</br>
</br>
"I choose to be dissembled into parts-"</br>
</br>
With a "bang," Jiang Chen crashed his right leg with one kick as the bent titanium skeleton came out.</br>
</br>
"I am not joking," Jiang Chen said grimly as he increased the strength on his right hand.</br>
</br>
"I am also not joking," Lin Chaoen said nonchalantly, he even emotionlessly shrugged. "Do you think there's any purpose in threatening a digitalized human? The cost is one hundred ten thousand crystals, if you break it I’ll just make another one-"</br>
</br>
As he said this, smoke suddenly came out of the back of his head and he stopped moving.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned as he immediately ripped apart his neck, took out another tactical dagger, and cut open his metal skull.</br>
</br>
The internal circuit had been burnt already, he chose to self-destruct.</br>
</br>
"Dammit." Jiang Chen removed the black control chip, cursed, and then threw the chip into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
A digitalized human made by 100% mechanical parts?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly remembered Lin Lin. She is also a digitalized human, but only partially modified by electronics.</br>
</br>
But this guy had not a single living cell, he would be more of a robot.</br>
</br>
"The Defender? Why would they be connected with the Crimson Chamber of Commerce?"</br>
</br>
He couldn’t find a reason. Jiang Chen shook his head as he threw the mechanical body inside the storage dimension. He’ll get the people in the fallout shelter to research it to see if they could reverse engineer the technology behind it.</br>
</br>
But he could not fathom the thought that the mercenary he drank with was a robot.</br>
</br>
As he thought about it, a weird chill crept into his body; he shivered.</br>
</br>
He walked to the side and picked up the laser sword that was flung to the ground.</br>
</br>
It looked like a flashlight with three modes to select. The handle had three words engraved on it, sword, shield, and lance. Jiang Chen didn’t get to see the third mod yet as the robot probably didn’t have the opportunity to do so.</br>
</br>
After pressing the switch, Jiang Chen pointed the laser sword forward and changed it to lance mode.</br>
</br>
The faint blue light flashed, but then there were no other differences.</br>
</br>
He gently shook the sword's body as the faint blue spectrum followed his movement.</br>
</br>
Seeing the "soft" sword body, Jiang Chen was inspired. He looked at the wall not far away as he swung the sword,</br>
</br>
The sword broke from the middle. The broken part formed a light blade and flew to the wall.</br>
</br>
Without making a sound, the light blade disappeared through the concrete wall.</br>
</br>
"The far range mode of the laser sword?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered to himself and walked to the wall.</br>
</br>
The light blade burnt a mark on the wall. He poked with his finger as he easily pierced the wall. Although he couldn’t feel the temperature with the power armor, from how soft the concrete was, it was not hard to imagine the intensity of the sword.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the energy status on the side of the sword.</br>
</br>
"Damn, with only one swing, twenty percent of the energy was gone. No wonder that guy didn’t use this mode."</br>
</br>
After playing with it for a bit longer, Jiang Chen threw it into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Laser swords were not too useful to Jiang Chen who favored firearms. But perhaps it was a better choice to give it to other people to use, although he couldn’t think of the ideal candidate yet.</br>
</br>
The vibrating dagger was destroyed. Jiang Chen didn’t bother with it as he walked upstairs.</br>
</br>
When he came to the second floor, Jiang Chen walked into the half-destroyed room.</br>
</br>
He scanned the horrific scene in the room as he couldn’t even help but feel shocked.</br>
</br>
The wall was burnt to a crisp black color. The table and drawer were all blown to the wall by the shockwave. The three bodies were disfigured, it was impossible to tell who was who just from their appearance. Jiang Chen didn’t question that if he opened his helmet, he definitely would smell burnt meat.</br>
</br>
From the location where their bodies were, Jiang Chen made out the "bearded man."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen squatted beside him as he suppressed his nauseous stomach and removed the burned EP.</br>
</br>
Although the EP was broken, the chip inside was preserved.</br>
</br>
"Encrypted?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the password dialogue on the screen. Jiang Chen was not frustrated but somewhat happy.</br>
</br>
Since there was a password, that must mean some dark secrets were stored inside! He was afraid that the clue would be broken at this point, as to password, Yao Yao should be able to take care of that.</br>
</br>
After he had searched the area for a bit longer to ensure he didn’t miss anything, he walked down.</br>
</br>
But just as he went down one flight of stairs, he heard a monstrous roar from the back of the mall as well as a terrified scream.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen’s face immediately changed.</br>
</br>
That sound-</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 300: The Mother of Death Claw</br>
</div></br>
It was a Death Claw!</br>
</br>
He will never forget the deadly fight above Fallout Shelter 005.</br>
</br>
Immediately, scattered gunshots followed. Then the shooting stopped and the scream also ceased.</br>
</br>
The scream was the knight he sent to guard the back door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face was white, he opened the map, and the green dot at the back of the mall disappeared!</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cursed as he had no time to go through the front door. Stepping on the shattered-glass window, he jumped out of the ten something meter high floor.</br>
</br>
The turbine engine's turbulence blew away the snow as the power armor's feet smashed into the ground, leaving two spiderweb-like crack craters.</br>
</br>
"Roar-!"</br>
</br>
The beastly roar collapsed the snow on top of the roof. Even the steel armor on his power armor was vibrating because of the boom.</br>
</br>
Following the trembling of the ground, something was running in his direction.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, this is definitely not a normal Death Claw."</br>
</br>
But then suddenly, a name that even Sun Jiao feared appeared in his head.</br>
</br>
Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression grew paler. Not even thinking about his entire left arm that has malfunctioned, even if it didn't malfunction, going head to head against a Death Claw in this terrain would be unwise. Especially if it was the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, Jiang Chen gritted his teeth and immediately opened the wheels under his feet.</br>
</br>
The best strategy was always to leave! If I can't beat it, I can run faster than you.</br>
</br>
But before he could move two meters, the empty spin sound came from the bottom of his feet.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Followed by his curse, a black shadow pierced the window beside him as it smashed half the wall down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen used the corner of his eye to catch a glimpse of the shadow, it was the kinetic skeleton of the Fishbone base! But the flesh inside had been eaten clean by the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the nearly two-story tall Death Claw fiercely entered the street. Being woken up from its hibernation, the desire for flesh filled every single cell in its body.</br>
</br>
The bell-shaped eyes locked onto the pile of metal while it was still roaring - it spotted Jiang Chen in his power armor.</br>
</br>
"This thing..." A cold sweat broke out and rolled down from Jiang Chen's forehead.</br>
</br>
He thought he was like a one-armed fighter in the Roman Coliseum, and on the other side was a grizzly bear that's been starving for an entire winter.</br>
</br>
He didn't choose to run. Without the wheels, he could not outrun the strong Death Claw with only two legs. With his back against this type of monster, he would only die faster.</br>
</br>
&lt;The Death Claw's weaknesses are only its spine and its eyes...&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen repeated recollected those words as he locked his eyes on the giant Death Claw and search for an opportunity.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Mother of Death Claw also locked its sight on Jiang Chen, in the amber colored pupils flashed a bloodthirsty light.</br>
</br>
To be honest, it didn't like the prey covered in metal, the sharp edges of the metal may cut its mouth. But it was too hungry, hungry enough to eat an entire Roshan. The previous human was not even enough to be an appetizer!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's left foot moved back half a step.</br>
</br>
The amber pupils immediately contracted, the fear of the prey stimulated the beast.</br>
</br>
"Roar-!"</br>
</br>
With giant strides, the Mother of Death Claw dashed at Jiang Chen. It was hard to believe its enormous body could be so agile.</br>
</br>
But the monsters don't know, if a human wanted to run, they would step back with their right foot first.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put his strength in his right knee, under both mechanical and muscle strength, his feet cracked the concrete ground! He leaped at the monster!</br>
</br>
With the turbine engine on maximum, Jiang Chen locked its actions as he adjusted the direction of the power armor.</br>
</br>
The five sharp claws left a shadow in the air as it flipped off two pieces of armor on the left arm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's body shook as he stabilized the balance of the power armor.</br>
</br>
The opportunity exchanged by the malfunctioned left arm armor, was used to go behind the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
In this intense moment, he took out his remaining sticky explosives from the storage dimension and threw it on the back of the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
Because it was so massive, the Mother of Death Claw could not stop as it smashed forward.</br>
</br>
"Go die!' Jiang Chen grimacingly pressed the activation button.</br>
</br>
The scorching flame immediately blew the back of the Mother of Death Claw. The giant shockwave blew its massive body to the ground as it rolled a few times before smashing into the shop window.</br>
</br>
Looking at the thick smoke, Jiang Chen didn't let his guard down as he raised his right arm without stopping, the revolving trident machineguns focused in on the center of the smoke.</br>
</br>
"Roar-!"</br>
</br>
The thunderous roar blew open the smoke. The scattered dust created a shockwave.</br>
</br>
It smashed its chest but in the amber pupils, the tyrannical violence was only increasing.</br>
</br>
It was enraged.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Still not fu*king died," Jiang Chen pressed the trigger cursing.</br>
</br>
Tatata-!</br>
</br>
The bullets shredded the smoke, but it didn't manage to destroy the chest of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
That solid horn armor could withstand the revolving machinegun</br>
</br>
The Mother of Death Claw covered its eyes with one claw while the other one swung in his direction.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gritted his teeth to the point they were about to shatter. He maintained fire suppression while opening the turbine engine to move back.</br>
</br>
"Spine can't be broken, bullets can't penetrate it, is this even a creature!" Jiang Chen cursed with his eyes flashing.</br>
</br>
In the open area, he was afraid to use his interdimensional travel. It was hard to ensure that an atomic grenade wouldn't draw the attention of the nearby survivors. If he were seen, it would be a problem...</br>
</br>
But now, was there time to care that much?</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen made up his mind to do it and avoid this thing, a deep communication voice entered his channel.</br>
</br>
"Tiger 02 has arrived at the battlefield. General, please maintain current movement speed.."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't have time to react when an orange light flew by his arm and penetrated the chest of the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
It was backup sent by Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
That guy brought the Tiger parked in the camp!</br>
</br>
The four meter high Mother of Death Claw got blown away like a piece of paper as it smashed on the ground. At the same time, the sound of breaking the sound barrier slowly diffused from Jiang Chen's back.</br>
</br>
5 kg bomb. It smashed a wheel sized blood hole on its chest. At the same time, it removed all the flesh and exposed its jagged spine.</br>
</br>
"Is it over?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the thick smoke, Jiang Chen mustered to himself as he felt relieved and stopped the revolving machinegun.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, his pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
The Mother of Death Claw twitched its limbs. Jiang Chen thought it was its last effort before death, but he shockingly found the body parts were healing.</br>
</br>
"Tiger 02, shoot the head of the Death Claw!" Jiang Chen shouted.</br>
</br>
"Okay General... Reloading complete... Fire."</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
Debris mixed with snow blew ten meters up into the air.</br>
</br>
He let the concrete debris scratch his armor as Jiang Chen stared at the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
It lost its head. The Mother of Death Claw stopped moving and made no more noise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a breath of relief. If it was not for the steel armor holding Jiang Chen up, he would likely be sitting on the ground by now.</br>
</br>
"Kill confirmed, Mr. General. But please don't do something so dangerous next time. Fighting on the frontline is the duty of the knights." Although the driver was joking, the respect in his tone was not hard to identify.</br>
</br>
With just a power armor to be able to go head to head against the Mother of Death Claw. Although Jiang Chen didn't realize it, in the bystander's eyes, he was inhumanly powerful.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you will have plenty of chances... Before that, get Cheng Weiguo here to help me, I feel like this power armor is completely busted..."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
The invisible blade cut open the mercenarys throat, and through that momentary pause, everyone saw the transparent figure. However, when they wanted to focus their eyes and search for the persons trace, he had disappeared again.</br>
</br>
Fu*k, its optical invisibility! The mercenary with the automatic rifle screamed in horror, and hurriedly fired a clip of bullets toward where the man was. However, he did not hit the transparent figure, but instead almost shot another mercenary that was leaning against the door.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the guy reacted quickly, and he was able to escape the clip of bullets. Otherwise, it would be awkward to not die in the enemys hands, but by friendly fire.</br>
</br>
Idiot! Dont just shoot, you almost hit me!</br>
</br>
AHHHHH!!!</br>
</br>
Amidst the chaos, another mercenary had his throat slit open. He covered his neck in pain and collapsed in a pool of blood.</br>
</br>
Like a deadly ghost, the flying dagger traced the curvature of death in the air. In just a few breaths, the man had already claimed the life of five mercenaries.</br>
</br>
Even against Death Claws, these mercenaries had the courage to fight. However, against an invisible enemy, other than waiting for their inevitable death, they did not even know how to fight back.</br>
</br>
The offensive to besiege the theater had completely came to a halt. When the sixth mercenary was pierced by a dagger, the mercenaries surrounding the front entrance of the theater finally collapsed. Due to their fear of death, completing the mission was no longer in their mind. Just like how swiftly they arrived, everyone fled out of the theater in horror.</br>
</br>
With the defeat of the mercenaries who besieged the main entrance, Gerrard, who was hiding in the theatre, ordered his troops to blow up the last remaining passage to prevent mercenaries from rushing in from the safety entrance. Then, he took all his men out of the theatre and decided to rush out from the front entrance!</br>
</br>
These indigenous people!</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanghe looked at the defeated mercenaries with a look of disgust. He didnt waste any time and pointed his right hand forward. The triangular-shaped barrels protruded from the armor on his forearm and whirred toward the front door.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries attacking the front door had completely lost the courage to fight, and if he was the people inside, he would not miss this excellent opportunity to escape.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, the omen of death suddenly shrouded him.</br>
</br>
He increased the power of the vortex engine to the max and immediately yanked himself back.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, a dagger swept past his previous position. There was a looming transparent figure. However, Zheng Shanhe could see it very clearly through the tactical eyepiece. It was similar to the K2 with an optical invisibility module!</br>
</br>
Fu*k!</br>
</br>
A drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead, he retracted his minigun, pulled out the tactical rifle from his waist, and fired at the transparent figure.</br>
</br>
</br>
The man seemed to know that he had been exposed and simply gave up sneaking around. He turned off the invisibility module, protruded his dagger forward, turned on the nitrogen shield, and rushed toward the muzzle. The bullets formed a beautiful arc and bounced away, and at the moment the nitrogen shield was overloaded, the man appeared in front of the power armor at the perfect time.</br>
</br>
In front of the particle vibration dagger, even the composite armor of the armored vehicle was as vulnerable as thin paper, let alone the grade-C steel of the T-3 power armor</br>
</br>
The dagger that slashed through air was aimed directly at Zheng Shanhes throat.</br>
</br>
You are not wronged if you die in my hands. Like deaths whisper, that mans voice drifted in the air, with a hint of laughter in his tone.</br>
</br>
Haha, its not always certain who will die!</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe did not dodge or block. He raised his rifle and slammed it into the mans face.</br>
</br>
Although this fierce blow failed to hit the man, it forced the dagger that was aiming at his throat to move away. Taking advantage of this short gap while the man dodged, Zheng Shanhe leaped up suddenly, and at the same time raised the output power of the vortex engine to the limit. He took off like a rocket into the air.</br>
</br>
The thermal grenade launcher in the left hand and the minigun in the right hand rapidly turned as he firmly locked onto the figure on the ground!</br>
</br>
The mans pupils suddenly constricted when he watched Zheng Shanhe leap into the air. He was about to dodge to the side, but unfortunately, there was only empty ground next to him without any cover.</br>
</br>
GO TO HELL! Zheng Shanhe sneered at the man and pulled his triggers.</br>
</br>
NOOOO!</br>
</br>
Grenades and bullets splashed down like a waterfall, and the firepower of the entire power armor was unleashed in an instant. The scorching airwave even blew the cement debris up twenty meters into the air. When the dust dispersed, only the fragmented ground and scorched earth was what remained</br>
</br>
FU*K! THESE YELLOW MONKEYS, I WILL KILL THEM SOONER OR LATER!</br>
</br>
Gerrard managed to escape from the movie theater. He took the remaining two soldiers and fled towards the evacuation point.</br>
</br>
He encountered a power armor when they were evacuating. If Warrant Officer Harvey hadnt sacrificed himself to stop the power armor, it would be hard to say whether they could escape.</br>
</br>
Gerrard glanced back, after he was convinced that no one chased him here, he took out a signal flare, unscrewed the seal, and threw it on the street. Soon the green flames lit up and guided the course of the helicopter hovering at a high altitude.</br>
</br>
Supported by two clusters of flame, a streamlined-looking helicopter slowly emerged.</br>
</br>
When Gerrard saw the helicopter arriving as scheduled, he was finally relieved.</br>
</br>
As long as he could withdraw to the ocean, he would be completely safe.</br>
</br>
When he heard the explosion, Warrant Officer Harvey had likely suffered an unfortunate fate. He didnt plan to wait any longer and decided to leave immediately after he boarded. Although he had predicted the firepower of the NAC, he still did not expect that they would suddenly become so smart and discover that Gris had been instigated</br>
</br>
The helicopter hovered above the street and began to descend.</br>
</br>
Gerrard led the people to the landing point. However, at this moment, an orange trajectory suddenly struck from the side and hit the helicopter directly.</br>
</br>
The fragile armor broke inch by inch, and the high-speed kinetic energy warhead directly pierced the helicopter. The entire helicopter was like a fly struck by a fly swatter, the out-of-control engine carried the helicopter and sent it into the building on the next street. Reinforced concrete was chopped out by the blades like tofu, as they were scattered out onto the street.</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
Gerrard cursed in anger, then he took his soldiers and fled into the nearby mall.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, the strike obviously came from an electromagnetic pulse cannon!</br>
</br>
What frightened him the most was that they were exposed to the muzzle of the electromagnetic pulse cannon!</br>
</br>
A direct hit.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the building five hundred meters away, the six-meter-long type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon was just like a lance that pointed at the street where the helicopter crashed. In his N-100 power armor, Jiang Chen sneered as he watched the three people who fled into the mall.</br>
</br>
You want to escape?</br>
</br>
If he didnt want to keep a few alive to get information, they would not have survived till now.</br>
</br>
The steel supports anchored to the ground were retracted and Jiang Chen threw the electromagnetic pulse cannon back into the storage dimension. Then, he took the tactical rifle from his waist and stepped outside the building.</br>
</br>
The eerie blue flame glimmered, and immediately before it touched the ground, it stopped the downward power armor that was falling at high speed. After he confirmed the location of the fleeing people with a drone, Jiang Chen turned on the sliding wheels on the bottom of his armor and chased after the targets.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1402: Who Are The Invaders</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The distance of five hundred meters was just a matter of a seconds for the power armor sliding forward.</br>
</br>
The vortex engine emitted an eerie blue arc light, which turned the power armor into a meteor-like trajectory on the rundown highway. The moment he entered the mall, Jiang Chen retracted the wheels, adjusted the direction of his vortex engine while at the same time, stepped onto the escalator, then flew upstairs.</br>
</br>
The Hummingbird drone had locked the coordinates of the three people and closely followed them. Based on the directions sent to Jiang Chens tactical eyepiece, he could clearly see the three people flee towards the emergency exit tunnel on the third floor.</br>
</br>
He grabbed onto the guardrail and flipped onto the third-floor platform.</br>
</br>
DAMN IT! HES CATCHING UP! One of the soldiers heard the noise behind him and cursed out loud. Without any attempt to take cover, he fired at the small drones behind them. But unfortunately, the bullets did not hit anything and only left a string of bullet holes in the wall.</br>
</br>
We are being caught by the drones. If we dont get rid of those things, its useless for us to escape. Another soldier gave up altogether, unfolded the shield at the entrance of the tunnel, and mounted the light machine gun. Go up, Ill hold him here. Fu*k what kind of armor is that, I havent seen it before.</br>
</br>
Pan Asias X-1 experimental-type power armor It is most likely a mass-produced type that has completed development. Gerrards eyes were hazy as he gritted his teeth. You cant hold him here and we cant outrun the power armor. We can only get rid of the trouble here!</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw the targets were no longer running away, a mischievous smile emerged as the corner of his lips slightly curved up. He waved his right hand, and a drone terminal emerged from the storage dimension and slammed heavily on the dusty floor. Accompanied by the sound of air leakage, the aluminum alloy panels popped up on all sides and exposed the honeycomb-shaped holes underneath.</br>
</br>
Hummingbird drones rushed out from their hive and formed a dense attack formation in the air. The sheer number of drones almost filled the entire space.</br>
</br>
Different from the Hummingbirds who followed the three people before, these drones were not equipped with heat-seeking cameras, but attack turrets</br>
</br>
What is he waiting for?</br>
</br>
Maybe he is waiting for reinforcements A smile of mockery gradually appeared on Gerrards face. His eyes, fixated on the end of the tunnel, gleamed with a look of fierceness, Our fighter is already on the way, so we can just let him wait</br>
</br>
But halfway through his sentence, the calm and collected expression that said things were under control was gradually replaced by panic and disbelief.</br>
</br>
He didnt know when the countless drones filled the gaps outside the windows like dark clouds. The muzzles of the attack turrets and the red dots under the muzzles had sealed all their escape routes.</br>
</br>
</br>
Gerrard had no doubt that as long as NAC decided that it was time for him to go, he would be turned into a sieve the next second.</br>
</br>
There was no point in resisting.</br>
</br>
Gerrard gulped down, then put his gun on the ground.</br>
</br>
While he responded to the peculiar look from his comrades, Gerrard secretly eyed them before he slowly rose his hands above his head and stepped out from cover.</br>
</br>
I surrender.</br>
</br>
To surrender was just an attempt to buy time.</br>
</br>
Their fighter was going to arrive at the battlefield from the fleet in half a minute. By that time, they could squeeze this power armor to death as easily as they would squeeze a mosquito.</br>
</br>
The soldiers read the message from their commanders eyes, looked at each other before they put down their weapons one after another, and walked out from behind the cover with their hands over their heads.</br>
</br>
Their opponent seemed to approve their surrender, and they heard footsteps from down the tunnel.</br>
</br>
When Gerrard saw the power armor, his pupils constricted slightly.</br>
</br>
If he was only skeptical at the beginning, he was 100% certain that this was the legendary X-1 power armor, and the final design model completed by NAC designers.</br>
</br>
Are you the little mouse hiding in the back and making trouble? Jiang Chen grinned as he looked at the three people with their hands raised above their heads. He set the drones to surround the three people and put the rifle on his shoulder, then he raised his chin up while he looked at Gerrard, Whats your name.</br>
</br>
Gerrard, Gerrards eyes moved, You set the bomb on Gris?</br>
</br>
Yes, Jiang Chen smiled nonchalantly, The bottle caps inside were real, but the box was stuffed with explosives. This thing seemed to be called a cap explosive, and I learned it from those mercenaries.</br>
</br>
Not long after Gris entered the theatre, he estimated the time before he pressed the detonation button. However, he didnt expect these people would wear kinetic skeletons. This human bomb only killed himself, and none of the others were injured. The lethality of this weapon simply made Jiang Chen speechless.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment, then looked at Gerrard before he continued, From your equipment, you shouldnt belong to any forces on the West Coast. Im curious how we provoked you.</br>
</br>
Your existence is a hidden danger, Gerrard stared at Jiang Chen with gloom on his face, and said word by word, It doesnt matter if anyone else rules the West Coast. We will eventually correct their mistakes and bring them to the right path. And you, in our eyes, are a group of invaders!</br>
</br>
The invaders? In other words, are you loyal to NATO? Or a certain NATO-affiliated force? Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and laughed, But speaking of being the invader, if I remember correctly, you started the war first.</br>
</br>
Whether the discarded pre-war newspapers or the virtual reality program in Fallout Shelter 005 all clearly depict the day when World War Three broke out. The naval battle between Bohai aircraft carrier and Obama aircraft carrier in the East China Sea directly pushed the conflict between the two sides to the brink of no return. Afterward, the Gods Cane shattered Wanghais Holy Shield and the orbital airborne troops landing fully demonstrated the fact that Pan-Asia Cooperation was on the defensive side from the very start.</br>
</br>
But it was pointless to discuss this now. The war had ended twenty years ago, and the world government had been gone for more than a decade. Bathed in this afterglow full of radiation, it was pale and meaningless for anyone to claim to be the righteous ruler.</br>
</br>
It was you who used bloody means to suppress the revolutionaries in Singapore, Jiang Chen didnt expect Gerrard to retort immediately, We have clearly warned you before, and you took our warnings as deaf ears.</br>
</br>
Well, Im not here to listen to your nonsense, Jiang Chen said impatiently, then pointed his gun at Gerrard. Now, turn around and go downstairs from the emergency exit tunnel behind you. I probably only need one or two prisoners. If anyone is here to plays tricks, Ill just shoot.</br>
</br>
When Gerrard realized that Jiang Chen was not going to argue with him, it made him anxious. The reason why he spoke so much was to buy time, but the man in front of him clearly had no interest in this topic. This made him feel defeated and frustrated as if there was nothing he could do.</br>
</br>
Youll be last, Jiang Chen poked the muzzle against Gerrards back and looked at the other two soldiers, You go first-</br>
</br>
But at this very moment, a violent engine roar tore through the air right outside of the window</br>
</br>
The screaming bullets rained down and shredded the drones outside to pieces.</br>
</br>
A fighter with a streamlined fuselage flexibly flipped the movable tail and pointed its ignited engine downward. At the same time, the two wings on both sides of the fuselage changed their shape to a position that allowed for horizontal hovering and steadily hovered over the window on the third floor.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was surprised for a second, then he gazed out the window.</br>
</br>
When he saw the dark gun turret, his pupils constricted</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1403: The Weapon That Was Not A Weapon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, Jiang Chen tossed down the Rubiks Cube Lin Lin gave him onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as the shield unfolded, the turret gun unleashed its terrifying wrath, and the bullets arrived like a violent storm. The bullets tore the windows and the reinforced concrete walls to pieces together with the force of destruction.</br>
</br>
Wings of Freedom F-79, NATO F series close-range attack aircraft.</br>
</br>
The concept of close-combat attack aircraft was proposed after the sixth-generation fighter and was born after the completion of the basic artificial intelligence database. In the golden age of artificial intelligence, the widespread use of AI provided more options for air combat, especially in the form of ground support. In addition to beyond-visual-range strikes, NATO needed a fighter that was capable of air combat while also being able to provide firepower support at close range to ground units. The model Wings of Freedom was born.</br>
</br>
As a fixed-wing fighter, the F-79 could switch to hover mode when necessary, participate in the close-range combats of ground forces, and redefine the correct use of the gun turret with its high mobility and strong firepower.</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
Gerrard screamed in panic as he didnt expect that the incoming aircraft for support would include himself as the target. He dove to the side, however, he could not get far as his head slammed into the spread-out shield.</br>
</br>
The constant stream of bullets blasted the Holy Shield but was instantly deflected away like headless flies flying in all directions. The compressed air created countless ripples across the transparent surface along the surface of the gravitons and outlined the arc-shaped trajectories.</br>
</br>
Unlike Gerrard who was shrouded in a shield, his two soldiers were not so lucky. The deflected bullets bounced inside the hallway and tore the soldiers, along with their kinetic skeleton, into a million pieces.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a quick glance at Gerrard next to him and didnt dare to take this fight lightly. He immediately released the smoke bomb on the power armor.</br>
</br>
The gray air mass filled the space inside the shield. Under the cover of smoke, Jiang Chen took out the type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon from the storage dimension, locked it onto the aircraft outside, and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to deactivate the shield, a loud explosion suddenly came from outside, and the bullets that poured onto the shield suddenly came to a halt. As if the building was hit by something, the floor shook violently and made the shield unsteady.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen deactivated the shield, walked to the half-destroyed wall in the hallway, and looked out the window. The F-79 smashed into the building, the entire fuselage had been torn apart by a stream of bullets that hailed down from above, and the out of control engine was spewing out flames uncontrollably</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought about something, then immediately looked above, and joy appeared in his eyes.</br>
</br>
</br>
A black silhouette sped across in the sky, and at almost the same time, the communication screen was connected to the code of a friendly unit.</br>
</br>
This is Aurora, I am honored to serve you.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen exchanged fire with Gerrard and the others, AS Order just arrived above Hawaii. Two Aurora-20s took off from the deck and arrived first to cruise over the West Coast. When they arrived, they discovered the F-79 that was unleashing its firepower towards the mall, so they decided to deactivate the safety and fired their turret.</br>
</br>
This F-79 was quite unlucky. Its technological level was obviously much more advanced than the Aurora-20 developed after the war. If a fair duel occurred above the clouds, maybe even two Aurora-20s would be unable to win, even if the F-79 did not carry any air-to-air missiles.</br>
</br>
But the battlefield did not consider so many ifs. If it switched to hover mode, it was no different from a dummy target parked on an airport runway to other fighters. The two Auroras easily ended the fight.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen took Gerrard back to the colony, he ordered people to take him to the dungeon. He was locked in separate rooms with several other soldiers in NATO Army-model kinetic skeletons and they were interrogated separately.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he was traumatized by the death of his two comrades under friendly fire, or perhaps he knew that there was no hope of being rescued, the defeated Gerrard quickly explained everything. The information included their identities, included the whereabouts of the colony, included their base drifting in the Pacific Ocean</br>
</br>
The cause was that your people found a number of strategic nuclear warheads on a cargo ship off the coast. These nuclear warheads are what we have been looking for for a long. But in fact, whether this incident happened or not, we were ready to take action. Congress has long ago introduced the Anti-Invasion Bill because of the outpost you built on the West Coast, but unfortunately, our Congress has been debating whether or not we should take actions immediately or not, Gerrard shrugged and said in a somewhat helpless tone.</br>
</br>
The intelligence you leaked to me through Gris, the NATO Strategic Missile Force military base in the Grand Canyonor rather, the nuclear arsenal, how are these all connected? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Because there is indeed a military base of NATO Strategic Missile Force in the Grand Canyon, Gerrard laughed and no longer concealed anything, But now it is occupied by a mutated human tribe, and we thought that since we are going to drive you out of North America, its better for you to deal with those troublesome guys.</br>
</br>
Where is the nuclear arsenal? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Nuclear arsenal? There is no nuclear arsenal at all. Most of the strategic warheads were used up, and the unused warheads were almost all dismantled in the years after the war. The moon base was completely collapsed, and there was not much nuclear fuel left. At one point, we even considered recovering nuclear materials from tactical nuclear warheads but gave up due to the technical challenges. Gerrard looked at Jiang Chen and said calmly, Can you give me a cigarette? For the sake of all the things I told you.</br>
</br>
No problem. Jiang Chen smiled slightly, put a box of cigars and matches on the table, and pushed it towards Gerrard. Why dont you have a cigar. For the prisoners who cooperate with us, we will never treat them with disrespect.</br>
</br>
When Gerrards eyes landed on the box of Columbian cigars, his eyebrows twitched violently and his throat felt dry.</br>
</br>
The war had been over for twenty years, and it was the first time he saw a luxury item like a cigar. In the years when World War Three broke out, supplies were scarce to the extreme, not to mention the nuclear winter after the war and radioactive pollution everywhere.</br>
</br>
He had almost forgotten about the smell unique to cigars.</br>
</br>
There was a look of struggle in his eyes, but he finally reached and picked up the box of cigars.</br>
</br>
He lit a match to light the cigar. When he felt the acridity pass through his throat, tears filled his eyes. The silence lasted for a long time, and after a few puffs of smoke, Gerrard continued.</br>
</br>
What you are looking for is in the desert outside Las Vegas. The cargo ship stranded at the West Coast port and the nuclear warhead inside was originally planned to be sent there. I can show you the specific coordinates Thank you, if it werent for your accidental discovery, we might never find that thing.</br>
</br>
What is it? Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
Weather Weapon, Gerrard breathed out the smoke ring, then gently swung the cigar between his fingers, though from the very beginning, that thing did not exist as a weapon.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1404: Transferring Disaster</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Weather Weapon, Gerrard continued after he flicked off the soot from his cigar, Before 2150, it was used as a North American climate control device to respond to natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms. After 2150, it was given a new mission. Its purpose was no longer just limited to nature, but also our rival.</br>
</br>
Rival? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Yes, Soviets, Pan-Asia Cooperation All centralized empires that were against free will were our nemeses, Gerrard raised his head, watched Jiang Chen, and said calmly, Twenty years ago, the weather weapon was activated, and has been on till this day.</br>
</br>
It has been on till this day.</br>
</br>
Somehow, after Jiang Chen digested Gerrards words and connected them to the climate difference of the West Coast, a terrifying idea suddenly popped into his head.</br>
</br>
If the weather weapon continued to be activated from before the war to now, then the abnormal climate of the Pan-Asia continent was likely not only because of the nuclear winter</br>
</br>
Thats all I know, I have already told you everything. Gerrard looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Thank you for your cooperation. Jiang Chen stood up, smiled, and extended his right hand. In order to express my gratitude, I will order someone to move you to a room with windows in a moment.</br>
</br>
When Gerrard heard those words, he was taken aback.</br>
</br>
A room with windows was naturally outside the dungeon. He didnt understand why Jiang Chen wanted to do this. He had nothing else to confess, and he didnt expect that he would be able to get such preferential treatment now that he has lost all his value.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen left the dungeon, he fulfilled his promise and ordered someone to arrange a clean room for Gerrard.</br>
</br>
Not only that, Jiang Chen even ordered to replace his daily meal from two tubes of nutrient supply to a bento box with two dishes and one soup, as well as unlimited rice. Other than the fact he was still not permitted to communicate with other prisoners, he could even get two hours of fresh air outside the room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen never treated obedient prisoners badly. He always believed in one point and that was, torture could never pry open someones mouth while a reason to be loyal to himself could.</br>
</br>
For example, he could let him live a good life that even the great America did not give him.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, it was too simple to corrupt a person in the wasteland where supplies were scarce.</br>
</br>
A box of canned beef and two cigars could buy the loyalty of a desperado. Soldiers on the Obama Aircraft Carrier were well-trained, and their psychological price could be slightly higher, but they wont be much higher. Compared to Jiang Chens assets in the modern world, the amount would be so insignificant.</br>
</br>
These materialistic benefits were not only provided to Gerrard, but they were meant to set an example for other prisoners. Zheng Shanhe who attacked the theatre from the front also captured several prisoners. Although their rank was not as senior as Captain Gerrard, they were still officers in the military.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was certain that as long as the return of betrayal was generous enough, even if he didnt ask any questions, someone would take the initiative to share some interesting information with him</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ordered the arrangements made for Captain Gerrard to Han Yue, who was the supervisor, and then headed back to the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
He didnt have time to eat at noon and also did quite a lot in the afternoon. Although it was not even four oclock yet, his stomach had already started to growl.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didnt wait for the canteen to open, and directly took a self-heating lunch from the storage dimension, then he opened a can of beer and quickly finished the simple but enviable dinner of countless survivors.</br>
</br>
After a good meal, Jiang Chen threw the lunch box and the empty can into the trash can. After a satisfied burp, he skillfully activated the interdimensional communication chip on his watch and called the busy Lin Lin in the research institute.</br>
</br>
Communication between North America and Pan-Asia was still blocked, but the Klein particle wave emitted by the interdimensional communication chip was not affected in any way.</br>
</br>
During the video call, Jiang Chen briefly talked to her about the situation in North America and asked her to tell Sun Jiao what happened during dinner, and then asked her about the weather weapon. Jiang Chen didnt expect that as soon as he said the words West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, Lin Lin would turn serious immediately.</br>
</br>
West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, where did I see this name before, Lin Ling paused, thought for a moment, and then said, Um it should be in my fathers memo. That memo, along with the project plan for the Garden of Eden, as well as the project plan for Fallout Shelter 005s Advanced Artificial Intelligence were placed together. If I remember correctly, the identity of this meteorological monitoring center in the desert should be NATOs weather weapon.</br>
</br>
For a digitalized human with a large number of chips implanted in her brain, it was impossible for her to remember anything incorrectly.</br>
</br>
I dont quite understand. Jiang Chen frowned. If this weather weapon is located on the West Coast, how does it affect Pan-Asia on the other side of the Pacific?</br>
</br>
It can affect anything anywhere, Lin Lin shook her head. I will give a very simple example, imagine the gas flowing around us as countless tightly arranged balls. Then no matter what I do now, some will be affected, but the impact of my behavior on the entire system is not just as simple as changing the motion of a few small balls, but it will eventually be reflected by the sum of changes in the total motion vectors of all the balls.</br>
</br>
You mean the butterfly effect? Jiang Chen suddenly gained some clarity.</br>
</br>
It can be interpreted this way. This is what the so-called weather weapon is all about, Lin Lin nodded approvingly in response to Jiang Chens epiphany. In a system, any small change may lead to a long-term and huge chain of responses on the entire system., and the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, is using tiny variables on the Pacific Rim monsoon, guiding the power of nature itself to amplify the variables infinitely, and ultimately interfering with the global climate.</br>
</br>
Quality and energy are always conserved, and the input is always proportional to the output. For human power, it is absolutely impossible to create snow out of thin air, or to drop the temperature of a certain city by ten or even twenty degrees in a certain winter, let alone to freeze the entire Pan-Asia.</br>
</br>
The weather weapon did this not because of its amazing power, but its clever use of technology to transfer the blizzard that should have fallen on North American survivors to the other side of the Pacific, on the heads of the struggling Pan-Asia people.</br>
</br>
Its core is a quantum computer, Lin Lin continued, With the advantage of absolute computing power, naturally there is no secret in front of it. It only needs to collect a small number of parameters, and it can determine all variables using a specific algorithm, and then interfere with the variables through special means.</br>
</br>
In other words, the heavy snow in Wanghai is not exactly all because of the nuclear winter</br>
</br>
Correct, Lin Lin snapped her fingers and said, Or to put it another way, we are not just bearing the share that belongs to us, but also the share that originally belonged to the other side of the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1405: Befriend</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Lin Lins reply perplexed Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
His original wild and irresponsible idea turned out to be true.</br>
</br>
He once heard Zhao Chenwu describe that in the years immediately after the end of the nuclear war, the nuclear winter that shrouded Wanghai was just like a white hell. Many people escaped the war, but they failed to escape the snow. Almost half of the survivors died in winter in the years before the mutants were born and the leakage of X1 bacteria.</br>
</br>
The next day, AS Order arrived over the West Coast.</br>
</br>
Groups of soldiers set foot on North America and settled in an empty colony. Since yesterday, the Aurora-20 squadron had constantly lifted off to cruise over the West Coast. Their missions were to search for the whereabouts of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center and to search for the missing colonists.</br>
</br>
As Li Wang and the Tiger II tank on the lift platform landed on the ground, he walked to Jiang Chen. He opened the face shield on the power armor helmet and performed a clean salute.</br>
</br>
Li Wang, Commander of the Expeditionary Force and Captain of AS Order, reporting for duty.</br>
</br>
How many people came?</br>
</br>
A total of 2,000 soldiers have landed on the West Coast, and another 3,000 people will arrive subsequently in cargo ships along with supplies, Li Wang reported.</br>
</br>
The expanded NAC Army was at an absolute advantage with five thousand soldiers strong. Supported by the industrial capabilities of the Sixth Street and the other world, all these five thousand soldiers were armed to the teeth with the K1 kinetic skeleton, and some elite troops were even equipped with the new K2 kinetic skeleton. Even if those USN soldiers inherited NATOs military legacy, Jiang Chen would still be in an advantageous position.</br>
</br>
The only problem now was the attitude of the National Guard and the Minuteman.</br>
</br>
If these two local forces decide to stand on the USNs side, then NAC would be pressured from all angles.</br>
</br>
We must now figure out what National Guard and Minuteman are thinking. If they decide to stand with USN, then we will act fast and destroy them first, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Will they be on our side? Li Wang hesitated for a moment before he explained his thoughts. Compared to USN, we are outsiders. My suggestion is that instead of giving them time to organize, it is better to just decrease the likelihood of war and bomb their settlements.</br>
</br>
Li Wangs idea was very simple.</br>
</br>
If he stood from the perspective of a survivor in North America, he would also choose to join force with USN to drive out the invaders who landed on the West Coast first and then discuss the ownership of this land. There would be no reason to contact them at this time, but rather, it would alert them. The best option was to use the electromagnetic pulse naval cannon and fireball-1 to bombard Liberty City and Steel City, directly erase them from the map, so their side selection would no longer matter.</br>
</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chens opinion was completely contrary.</br>
</br>
But we will not interfere with them, and USN intends to rule them, Jiang Chen looked at Li Wang and said, For most North American survivors, America is already a term that should be in the grave of history. They have established their own settlements on the West Coast and established their own rules. Now some people have appeared to claim the sovereignty of this land, saying that they want to take them to rebuild a certain country. What would you think if you were put in that position?</br>
</br>
From the opposite angle, if a group of survivors emerged from north of Pan- Asia, waved the flag to revive the Qing Dynasty, called on the NAC and Southern Survivor Alliance to join forces, and claimed to be the rightful ruler of this land, how many people would join their cause?</br>
</br>
Not to mention the Qing Dynasty that had long been left behind in history, the Northern Alliance Area that claimed to be the righteous representative of Pan-Asia Cooperation was pushed back by NAC tanks deep into the northwest region. Only the mutated humans responded to their call, and the premise was that they promised a large tract of land to the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
No matter what choice the leaders of the National Guard and the Minuteman make, Jiang Chen was certain about one thing, and it was that these leaders would never surrender easily. It was very likely USN had already contacted them before Jiang Chen arrived in North America on Aerospace G100.</br>
</br>
It was quite an obvious point, but Jiang Chen didnt understand the connection until now.</br>
</br>
Why did the National Guard and Minuteman start preparations for war when the residents of the Outpost Town disappeared? They were definitely not preparing to fight against the NAC that had withdrawn from North America, but the USN soldiers who were about to land on West Coast and claim sovereignty over this land.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Li Wang and continued.</br>
</br>
Send someone to Liberty City and Steel City to contact the leaders of the National Guard and Minuteman. If they are willing to remain neutral, we promise that our outpost will only retain this square kilometer outside Los Angeles. If they are willing to stand on our side and fight USN together, we can exempt tariffs worth 100,000 to 200,000 credit points each year for the next ten years. This is very flexible. You can get someone to negotiate.</br>
</br>
Roger!</br>
</br>
Li Wang stood straight, saluted, then turned around swiftly.</br>
</br>
Although Li Wang was still skeptical about whether or not those people would accept such a covenant, in the hierarchical military government system, the command of the general was absolute. Before the order was issued, everyone had the right to raise objections, but once the order was issued, there was only one thing for him to consider.</br>
</br>
That was how to execute the order.</br>
</br>
With the alliance treaty given by Jiang Chen, two envoys left the fortress one after another under the escort of NAC soldiers. Li Wang made two-handed preparations. While the two envoys were on the mission, the electromagnetic pulse cannon at the bottom of the Order was also loaded with shells.</br>
</br>
If those North American survivors reject the alliance, the uncooperative forces would be bombarded. Before they could organize an effective defense, their organization would be completely wiped out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen expressed his silent approval to Li Wangs preparation.</br>
</br>
On the other side, the Engineering Regiment that landed on the West Coast through AS Order also moved into the fortress one after another. It began the construction of fortifications on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
At the highest point of the concrete fortifications of the fort, the NAC flag was raised once again. The engineers, under the command of Zheng Shanhe, were busy deploying the electromagnetic anti-aircraft guns and land-based radars from the Order in every corner of the fortress.</br>
</br>
The powerful combat effectiveness demonstrated by the F-79 already posed a threat to NACs air supremacy.</br>
</br>
For other survivor forces, AS Order flying in the sky would be an unchallenged existence, but for the USN that also possessed an air force, this big guy flying in the sky was just an easy target. The use of airships for air defense was obviously unreliable. NAC hoped to rely on ground air defense to make up for Aurora-20s disadvantage in the combat for air supremacy.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1406: Close Comba</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Seriously, I have been in North America for almost a year. I only applied to change my home base back to Wanghai a few months ago. An engineer in a safety helmet said as he welded the laser anti-aircraft weapon to the steel bracket. While he wiped the sweat from his forehead, he grinned and looked at his comrade next to him, After staying for so long, this is the first time I have seen a North American who claims to be an American.</br>
</br>
Then what do they usually call themselves? Another engineer wiped his sweat with a towel, took a swig of the mineral water, then joked along, Aboriginals of the West Coast? Or California Freaks?</br>
</br>
Neither. Cowboys in California, mercenaries in Nevada, gamblers in Alaska, NATO peopleusually the former ones are more common, the latter ones less so. Except for the folks in Chinatown who will stick together based on their ancestry, those whites and blacks like to use state names to draw boundaries from other people.</br>
</br>
Chinatown? Are there other Chinese near here?</br>
</br>
Its not just Chinese. Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, even Indians, Asians on the West Coast basically live there. The stuff there is quite interesting. When this battle is over, I can take you for a tour</br>
</br>
They were only halfway through the conversation when the harsh alarm sounded.</br>
</br>
The two engineers were taken aback for a moment, then their expressions changed all of the sudden. Without a word more, they grabbed their toolbox and ran toward the stairs.</br>
</br>
The moment the air defense alarm sounded, the entire fortress was like a pot of boiling water, and everyone began to move. The non-combatants evacuated into the air defense bunker immediately. Soldiers in kinetic skeletons lined up and quickly rushed to their combat positions.</br>
</br>
The anti-aircraft electromagnetic pulse cannons and laser weapons deployed on the fortress raised their barrels in tandem, and a stream of Aurora-20s took off from the deck of AS Order. In a blink of an eye, a squadron had all taken off and formed a defensive formation, ready to engage the enemy.</br>
</br>
Company A has entered combat position, requesting instructions. A soldier in power armor sat at the entrance of the air defense bunker, behind him were 120 soldiers in kinetic skeletons.</br>
</br>
The jet-black rifles were ready to fire, and everyone was prepared to fight.</br>
</br>
If the USN Army launched a raid on the colonys air defense facilities, then they would the first line of defense for the fortress!</br>
</br>
Inside a temporary command post deep into the colonys air defense bunker.</br>
</br>
It was not only the command tower of the Expeditionary Force but also the radar station of the colony.</br>
</br>
The observer sat nervously in front of the control terminal, and staff hurriedly ran back and forth between the terminals. This place was the eyes and brains of the entire expeditionary army, and a series of combat orders were issued from here to the front line.</br>
</br>
</br>
Taking the elevator underground, Jiang Chen quickly walked into the command post. When he arrived, Li Wang and Zheng Shanhe stood at the command table not far away and were discussing combat strategies with a group of officers.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instructed everyone to disregard him, then he looked at the big screen directly in front of the command post.</br>
</br>
When he saw the rapidly approaching red dots, his brows started to frown, he walked forward, looked at the radar observer next to him, and asked in a serious tone.</br>
</br>
Whats the situation.</br>
</br>
Unidentified flying objects have entered the radar and will encounter our flight squadron in one minute! Staring at the radar screen, the soldier immediately reported to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
How many enemy planes are there? Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
Fourteenwait, what the fu*k!</br>
</br>
Without the slightest warning, when the semi-arc cursor swept across the radar screen, rows of dense red dots suddenly appeared. When the observer saw the number rising exponentially, he even forgot that the general was standing next to him and cussed out.</br>
</br>
Five hundred and twenty-seven!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens eyes narrowed into slits as he stared at the scarlet number. Then he looked at Li Wang and ordered without hesitation, Launch the EMP missile immediately and bombard the target airspace at full capacity!</br>
</br>
ROGER!</br>
</br>
Even without Jiang Chens order, he planned to do so.</br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, Li Wang pressed his headset and issued a combat command to AS Order in the air.</br>
</br>
Thousands of meters above the ground, the armor on the side of the steel airship slowly moved, exposing the missile silos for the fearsome missiles. Without any prelude, along with the roar of the engine ignition, four missiles galloped toward the distant airspace along with four thick and long plumes of smoke trailing behind.</br>
</br>
The flight squadron that hovered on both sides of AS Order changed its formation. It covered both sides of the missile from a distance and charged up toward the target airspace.</br>
</br>
The squadron commander flying in the middle of the formation looked at the red dots on the radar, opened the insurance of the weapon system, and at the same time gave the order to each aviator to engage in combat.</br>
</br>
we are entering combat range, each aviator, freely fire. I repeat, each aviator, freely fire FU*K, WHAT IS THAT?</br>
</br>
The EMP weapons exploded in the air, but it did not have much impact on those flying objects. The countless black iron coffins formed a loose formation in the air and completely ignored the twenty-four Aurora-20s as they headed straight for the colony.</br>
</br>
If possible, the squadron commander would like to order a flight to chase after the group of iron coffins. However, when he saw the F-79s behind, he had to put a stop to this idea.</br>
</br>
The quality of pre-war equipment was always more than one notch better than the customized products manufactured by wasteland engineers. It was a truth that had been verified countless times.</br>
</br>
The distance of several kilometers was quickly closed, and the two sides entered into their respective engagement distance.</br>
</br>
The air-to-air missiles that dragged flames intersected each other, and the ejected flare formed countless beautiful fireworks in the air, and together with the exploding flames, they embellished the brilliant sunset on the horizon.</br>
</br>
In a matter of seconds, the first round of combat had been decided.</br>
</br>
Large pieces of wreckage fell from the air along with trails of long black smoke. When the last missile was fired, the two sides immediately entered close-range combat.</br>
</br>
The roaring gun turrets freely unleashed their bullets, chased each others afterburner, tore apart the pristine white clouds and the calm blue sea.</br>
</br>
On the other side, under the cover of Wings of Freedoms, the iron coffins successfully passed through the blockade of the NAC air squadron. They ignored the huge steel airship and rammed towards the colony.</br>
</br>
Of course, the Expeditionary Army would not easily make their wish come true. Under the guidance of radars, electromagnetic rapid-fire cannons were the first to fire fierce firepower toward the sky. The countless shells formed orange-yellow trajectories that weaved into a tight net. It was all aimed at the jet-black flying objects.</br>
</br>
But an astounding scene happened.</br>
</br>
Milky white airwaves condensed at the front end of the iron coffins, and the small-caliber shells fired by the electromagnetic anti-aircraft guns were deflected to the side by a dense air wall at the moment of contact.</br>
</br>
Except for a few that were shredded, most of the iron coffins successfully broke through the dense net formed by the first round of shells; they continued to fall towards the colonys fortress without any signs of slowing down</br>

SH*T! What are those things? Han Yue, with widened eyes, stared at the sky outside the window. He muttered to himself with a dull expression on his face while he was still holding a bento box in his hand.</br>
</br>
He had lived in the land ruled by NAC for a long time and this was the first time he had seen a formidable opponent. For some reason, the black dots that broke through the barrage made him feel a sense of anxiety from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
Not far from him, Gerrard glanced out the window, and lips holding his cigar moved slightly.</br>
</br>
Earth Warrior, NS-90, we also call it the Battlefield Cleaner. Sh*t, they even took out this bad boy. It seems that Congress and Mr. President are serious.</br>
</br>
NS-90? Han Yue asked in a daze.</br>
</br>
A kind of intelligent combat robot controlled by AI. All identifiable living creatures are within its attack range. Just like the literal meaning, they will generally not leave anything alive when they appear. Gerrard waved his hand impatiently, looked at the lunch box in his hand, and said indifferently, So can you give me the bento box? If possible, I want to have a good meal before I die.</br>
</br>
With the dense air wall, the countless black iron coffins broke through the shells interception and slammed into the colonys fortress.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, everyone thought that they were USN missiles, or something similar.</br>
</br>
However, the expected explosion did not occur. In the next second, their cognition was completely subverted by the action of this thing.</br>
</br>
A series of white mist-like air columns sprayed out, and the iron coffins started to move as if they had come to life. The cracked armor surface started to move around. It formed into steel legs and arms and a black automatic rifle in its hands!</br>
</br>
In the center of the rectangular shape, the eyepiece on its head flashed with a daunting red light.</br>
</br>
The air battle had yet to be decided, and the bloody ground battle kicked off.</br>
</br>
Enemy units have landed! EVERYONE FOLLOW ME.</br>
</br>
At the moment when Zhang Wei saw the team of mechanical soldiers wake up, he pressed the communication button on his helmet and swung his steel-covered fist to the entrance of the air defense shelter. Without any hesitation, the one hundred and twenty kinetic skeleton soldiers behind him stood up from their seats, followed him, and ran out of the air defense bunker.</br>
</br>
Ground combat began the moment the NS-90s landed, and the first wave to engage in combat were NAC-hired mercenaries. When Zhang Wei brought his comrades to the battlefield, the front court of the fortress was already in complete chaos.</br>
</br>
PROTECT OUR AIR DEFENSE! FOLLOW ME!</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei, equipped with a power armor and a Gauss rifle, shouted at the top of his lung. He took the lead and started the vortex engine behind him, then jumped to the top of the fortress. After two trots, he leaned heavily behind a concrete cover.</br>
</br>
</br>
Except for those intercepted by the shells, a total of 470 robots landed throughout the fortress. From the beginning, these iron machines were directed at the NACs air defense system, so after they landed, they completely disregarded the soldiers that attempted to stop them. Instead, they rushed to the electromagnetic rapid-fire guns and laser defense weapons.</br>
</br>
However, these Americans obviously underestimated the combat effectiveness of the NAC ground forces, or the earlier invasion of Outpost Town made them overestimate their combat effectiveness. Those mechanical soldiers controlled by AI quickly paid the price for their hasty behavior.</br>
</br>
Normal rifle bullets could hardly hurt them. However, after several rounds of upgrades, at least half of the soldiers in the NAC Army were now equipped with advanced Gauss rifles, as well as the second-generation anti-armor rocket launcher produced by the 27th Research Institute  Poisonous Python!</br>
</br>
The first few robots that rushed out were turned into scrap by the bullets. Dragging its white tail flames, a rocket burst out from behind cover. When it smashed into a robot soldier, the metal sparks directly appeared from its back and turned its body full of mechanical beauty into a pile of scrap iron gushing with sparks.</br>
</br>
However, AI was AI after all. After the AI realized the fierce firepower of the NAC soldiers, they immediately adjusted their original offensive strategy and returned behind cover. They changed their aggressive tactics into a conservative pushing strategy.</br>
</br>
As these robot soldiers took cover, the battle that favored NAC once again turned into a stalemate.</br>
</br>
Bullets flew in the open space of the fortress, and the flames of the explosion dotted the battlefield from time to time.</br>
</br>
Robot soldiers were constantly being turned into scrap metals, NAC soldiers, North America mercenaries were also shot down in the fray. NACs drone attack group had plowed the battlefield countless times, but the small-caliber ammunition with insufficient penetration power did not cause damage to too many robot soldiers. Instead, countless drones were smashed down.</br>
</br>
FU*K! WHAT THE HE*L ARE THESE IRON THINGS! The soldier who was crouching behind cover pulled down the trigger with all his strength, he stared in disbelief at the robot that was dodging bullet while firing back.</br>
</br>
Even when he compared it to the cyborg army that he encountered in Wanghai, it was the first time he saw just agile robots. If it werent for the unusual shape of its head, he would almost treat it as a living human soldier.</br>
</br>
The battle was in a precarious state. Just as the NAC soldiers were forced to shrink their defensive position, a team of power armors suddenly entered the battlefield from the flank.</br>
</br>
Many silver-white N-100 power armors stood on the top of the building, and the long and thick type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannons in their hands were shining with dazzling white light. After an immeasurable amount of mass shells blasted into the battlefield, with the help of the shooting assistance program, they all hit their target without exception. Each shot blasted the side armor of the robot soldiers into fragments.</br>
</br>
The robot soldiers were caught off guard. They were about to enter the fortress, but because of this sudden flank attack, they were forced to abandon the grounds they gained and retreated to their original landing spots.</br>
</br>
Its our power armor brigade!</br>
</br>
Fu*k, I was wondering where these damn things went, they were waiting there! HAHAHAHA!</br>
</br>
The original depressed morale of the frontline troops instantly rose to its peak again.</br>
</br>
The addition of the power armor brigade immediately reversed their losing momentum. Under the cover of infantry firepower, they launched a final assault on the USN position from the side. Although only a dozen robot soldiers were still holding on, there was no suspense to the outcome of the ground battle.</br>
</br>
For NAC, victory would only be a matter of time.</br>
</br>
The victory and defeat of the battle on the ground had been determined, and the air battle in the distance had also come to an end.</br>
</br>
The generation gap in equipment was difficult to overcome with just quantity. NACs flight squadron fulfilled their final mission and fought until the last fighter had fallen. They spared no effort to preserve the air supremacy until the end of the ground battle.</br>
</br>
The ground air defense firepower returned to normal, and the laser defense and shells once again closed the airspace off.</br>
</br>
The nine remaining Wings of Freedom slowly arrived. They circled the air defense zone for a while and coveted the massive figure of AS Order. After some trade-off assessments, they finally gave up. With engine output set to maximum, they retreated in the direction they came from.</br>
</br>
This sudden encounter finally ended with NACs victory.</br>
</br>
However, this victory was not easy for the Expeditionary Force.</br>

</br>
On the USS Obama, inside the bridge.</br>
</br>
Several men in military uniforms stood in a row with their heads down. A man in a suit stood in front of them. The mans face was flushed because of anger as he scolded the people in front of him.</br>
</br>
Five hundred and twenty-seven NS-90s, what do you fools even do! And you fu*king told me that you seized air supremacy, and we can pop the champagne and wait for NAC to collapse? FU*K! Tyrese, you fu*king tell me how you lost this war when they lost air supremacy!</br>
</br>
Sean Luke, Honorary Captain of the USS Obama, was also the President of the Federation. However, the current Federation possessed only one aircraft carrier, a few destroyers left from the postwar period, and hundreds of large and small cargo ships, and a port in Central America.</br>
</br>
When Sean learned that they lost the battle, he could hardly believe what he heard from his ears. Because before the start of this war, his people from the Joint Chiefs of Staff had full confidence during the battle evaluation. They stated how long it would take for the Wings of Freedom to disintegrate NACs air defense force, how long it would take to down the NAC airship, and then cooperate with the NS-90s that landed to take down the ground force.</br>
</br>
But now, the report he received not only told him that the five hundred and twenty-seven NS-90s were completely scrapped, but they even lost five F-79s. As for the Airship Order, they didnt even manage to make a dent in it.</br>
</br>
Five hundred and twenty-seven NS-90s could allow them to run their assembly line in Panama at maximum production capacity for a whole year! Even in the scenario where they possessed excessive supplies!</br>
</br>
The loss of so many dear robots made his heart bleed.</br>
</br>
His chest was violently pumping up and down, and Seans bloodshot eyes stared at the man named Tyrese while he waited for him to give a reasonable explanation.</br>
</br>
The first time we invaded the outpost was too smooth, which led to our inadequate judgment of NACs strength. After Tyrese swallowed down the lump in his throat, he cleared his throat and was forced to provide an explanation. To our surprise, their ground air defense was adequate. And those N-100s Originally, we thought they were wearing a type of power armor called T-3. Just give me another chance</br>
</br>
And let you scrap the rest of the NS-90s? This explanation obviously did not please Sean, and he was so angry that he started to laugh. His eyes were fixated on Tyrese, and he said word by word, Major Tyrese, your decision has caused a huge loss to the American Revival Plan. I declare in the name of the Federation that you are now suspended.</br>
</br>
Yes.</br>
</br>
Tyrese lowered his head and forced out the word.</br>
</br>
The afterglow near the sunset had completely disappeared, and the sunset on the horizon had returned to calmness again. NAC engineers trotted up to the top of the building with their toolbox and began to repair the damaged electromagnetic anti-aircraft guns and replace the defective parts.</br>
</br>
</br>
The residents of the colony left the shelter and returned to the surface. When they saw the daunting shell and bullet marks on the walls, they were silent.</br>
</br>
The front door of the fortress was open, and the originally flat concrete road was now filled with fragmented concrete blocks and black craters. Medics set up temporary tents. The wounded in bandages were put on stretchers and sent to the medical cabin for tissue repair treatment, while the slightly injured soldiers went to the medical tents alone to receive bandaging and medication.</br>
</br>
Scrapped NS-90s were scattered everywhere. Occasionally, a few scrapped robot soldiers would shake their heads, unwilling to stop functioning. It was not until their nuclear fusion core was removed did they finally stop. Scavengers in chemical protective clothing collected the destroyed nuclear fusion cores and other parts with excessive radiation levels.</br>
</br>
After all the parts were collected and gathered together, they were escorted by NAC soldiers to the temporary research institute set up, and the researchers who traveled with the Expeditionary Force disassembled and analyzed the pieces.</br>
</br>
Many people did not sleep that night.</br>
</br>
The field researchers especially worked tirelessly in the temporary research institute as they carried a heavy burden.</br>
</br>
The sooner they could identify their enemys weakness, the more advantageous it would be for NAC.</br>
</br>
Everyone worked hard at their posts. They untiringly surrounded the pile of NS-90 wreckage while they completed different experiments and analyses. However, facts proved the difference between scientific research and manual labor; the input and reward may not always be proportional for research.</br>
</br>
This doesnt work, A researcher dropped the cutter aside, squeezed his weary brows, and shook his head. The combat components and power system are not sophisticated at all, but the digital sensors and identification chips are two things I cant analyze at all. The environment here is too crude. We can only send the components back to Fallout Shelter 027.</br>
</br>
Is there no similar technology in Pan-Asia Cooperation? Jiang Chen slightly frowned.</br>
</br>
Different tactical concepts create different scientific research directions. The researcher shook his head. We have always emphasized the importance of humans in the research and development of military technology. A soldier with a kinetic skeleton while working with a drone will only have a better price/performance ratio compared to a pure AI soldier. If it is in the field of kinetic skeletons, tanks, and urban defense systems, our technology is far superior. But in terms of robotics, we lag behind.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldnt help but smile bitterly after the researcher finished speaking.</br>
</br>
Therefore, it was not a big loss for Aurora-20 to achieve such results.</br>
</br>
However, whenever he thought about the squadron, he felt pain. Not only because of the cost of the twenty-four Aurora-20s itself but also because of the pilots. Rather, those pilots were the real treasure.</br>
</br>
After all, to become a pilot of the Aurora-20, the first requirement was that the first genetic code must be Bullet Time. It was precisely because of the particularity of the hidden genetic code that allowed them to have infinite possibilities beyond electronic pilots.</br>
</br>
God, what happened here while we were away? Matthew jumped off the truck and dumbfoundedly stared at the bullet marks on the concrete wall, not knowing what to say.</br>
</br>
At the front entrance of the fortress, Matthew, who returned to the fallout shelter with the colonys mercenaries, finally returned to the fortress with a few large trucks of equipment.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the edge of the truck, Jessica glanced at the dark explosive marks outside the fortress, and secretly thought of pity, but did not dare to make it too obvious. If the people of NAC were wiped out, she would naturally be free. But in reality, it was just her wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
Your God is fine, its just our fortress that experienced some complications, Jiang Chen smiled as he walked to Matthew and said in a relaxed tone, Lets talk inside.</br>
</br>
On the way, he briefly recounted what had happened to Matthew. From sounding the air defense alarm to the final outcome of the war. Even if Jiang Chen didnt tell him these things, he would have learned this information when he returned to his compatriots in the refuge.</br>
</br>
But what Jiang Chen didnt expect was that when he heard the name NS-90, Matthew was obviously taken aback.</br>
</br>
NS-90?</br>
</br>
What? Have you heard of it? Jiang Chen looked at him with surprise.</br>
</br>
Not only have I heard of it, Matthew said without hesitation, The person who designed the NS-90 is in our fallout shelter!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
U17 was the name of Matthews fallout shelter. It was located in the desert at the junction of Nevada and California. Fallout shelters in North America were different compared to those in Pan-Asia. Eighty percent of fallout shelters were funded by insurance companies or other financial institutions, as well as built under private names.</br>
</br>
For most private fallout shelters, the amount of money spent when subscribing to the eligibility for admission directly determined the quality of life after moving into the fallout shelter. Some private shelters were contracted by large companies and were provided to the companys core employees as employee benefits.</br>
</br>
The U17 fallout shelter was the latter.</br>
</br>
As the design company of NS-90, the wealthy Masonte Military Industry Group had subscribed for Doomsday Insurance for almost every employee, and the nineteen shelters were scattered throughout the Nevada desert.</br>
</br>
As the supervisor of the fallout shelter, Matthew naturally was aware of the details of his residents. When Jiang Chen said the name NS-90, he immediately thought of the researchers in his fallout shelter who had participated in the design of the NS-90.</br>
</br>
The word America was too far away for him, but NAC instead, was their savior.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen needed help, he certainly wouldnt be stingy to offer help.</br>
</br>
Thats great! Can I borrow your researcher? Of course, I will pay you at a reasonable price, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Ill talk to them for you, but I think this shouldnt be a big deal. Matthew waved his hand. You dont have to pay anything. This little favor is not enough to pay the favors we owe you. If you really insist, can you pay these researchers a salary? But for a world that has become like this, what is the meaning of money?</br>
</br>
Although Matthew declined the payment, Jiang Chen still sent them a batch of supplies as their reward. Jiang Chen was confident that with the involvement of these twenty or so Masonte researchers, it would only be a matter of time before they fully understood NS-90s technology.</br>
</br>
In the early morning of the next day, a group of guests were greeted at the gate of the fort.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was a group of guests who belonged to two different forces.</br>
</br>
The envoys sent by Li Wang to Liberty City and Steel City did not disappoint the Generals trust. They successfully persuaded the leaders of the National Guard and the Minuteman. Even if they did not sign the pact on the spot, at least they gained enough interest.</br>
</br>
They returned to Outpost Town with the NAC envoys. Jiang Chen saw the two representatives from the National Guard and Minuteman at the gate.</br>
</br>
Its nice to meet you, distinguished Mr. Jiang Chen, my name is Barry Clive. The red-haired man shook Jiang Chens hand. On behalf of the militia organization on the West Coast, we bring you our regards.</br>
</br>
Russell Gilbert, National Guard Sergeant. Another man in a power armor looked rather serious and nodded. The polite greetings are unnecessary. Frankly speaking, we are very interested the pact you proposed. Steel City will not accept the rule of anyone, whether it is Great America, the British Empire, or the Native Indian Kingdom. But there is one thing we must be clear about.</br>
</br>
</br>
Thats right, the red-haired Barry nodded, If turning off the weather weapon is also one of your goals</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately understood what he meant, so he laughed and addressed the concerns of the two guests.</br>
</br>
You can rest assured that although the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center is also one of our goals, we do not intend to turn it off. We only intend to make some minor adjustments to its climate guidance program. On the issue of weather weapons, our interests are exactly aligned.</br>
</br>
No one enjoyed nuclear winters, and the National Guard and the Minuteman were no exception. If the price of driving away the United States was the spring on the West Coast, they would have to carefully weigh the pros and cons between the two.</br>
</br>
How do you plan to address it? Russell Gilbert asked without showing his true emotion.</br>
</br>
For example, we can transfer the climate disasters on the West Coast and the Pan-Asian East Coast to inland North America and the East Coast east of the Rocky Mountains, or we can simply throw all the trouble to South America, south of Panama, or even across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Jiang Chen revealed a sly grin and then continued, If you are willing to accept our proposal, we are even willing to share the energy expenditure of the weather weapon with you. If I am not mistaken, running this weather weapon does require a lot of energy.</br>
</br>
Russell and Barry looked at each other, exchanged opinions briefly with their eyes, and finally accepted Jiang Chens proposal.</br>
</br>
At the invitation of Jiang Chen, the two came to the office in the Governors Mansion and drafted the pact on the spot.</br>
</br>
Russell and Barry carefully reviewed the terms, and after they confirmed, as representatives of the National Guard and the Minuteman, they signed their names at the end of the draft.</br>
</br>
The revised pact was not too different from the original one. The only exception being a few terms added at the end.</br>
</br>
First of all, after they controlled the weather weapon, both the East Coast of Pan-Asia and the West Coast of North America would be included in the area of climate protection, and climate disasters would be transferred to the Mediterranean and Central Africa.</br>
</br>
As an outsider, NAC would bear 60% of the energy expenditure of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, and the Minuteman and the National Guard would each bear 20%. In exchange, the two major forces would introduce NACs credit point system, and Sixth Street Bank would help to establish a credit point payment network.</br>
</br>
From the date of signing the agreement, the currency settlement of trade between Liberty City, Steel City, and NAC Outpost Town would be conducted using credit points.</br>
</br>
When determining the NACs policy on North American survivors, Jiang Chen discussed with Chu Nan and Han Junhua extensively before he had set off. After careful consideration, he finally decided to employ a strategy that starts with trade and use indirect influence instead of direct intervention.</br>
</br>
After all, for him, the only things that truly intrigued him in North America were the pre-war technologies buried under the rubble. And these things could be obtained through trade, as long as he or the Sixth Street merchants clearly showed an interest in these things.</br>
</br>
Two thousand Minuteman Rangers, and one thousand National Guard Pioneers would participate in this war to fight against the invasion of the United States.</br>
</br>
When the pact was signed, Barry and Russell left one after another.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen sent the two representatives to the door, he handed both two gifts.</br>
</br>
Teas and cigars.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen looked at their surprised expression and smiled.</br>
</br>
The cigars produced in Colombia are as authentic as the ones before the war.</br>
</br>
I thank you for the gifts on behalf of Mr. Eddie, Russell sincerely accept the gifts while internally, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
Not because of NACs financial resources, but because of the message Jiang Chen revealed in this short sentence.</br>
</br>
Does NAC also have colonies in South America?</br>
</br>
Russell was uncertain, but if it was true, then the strength of these Asian was terrifying.</br>
</br>
With a grin, Jiang Chen watched those two people leave. Then, he returned back to the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
Looking at the signatures at the bottom of the document, and the title Anti-American Alliance at the top, he couldnt help but feel a little amused.</br>
</br>
The North American National Guard and the post-war militia teamed up with foreign colonists to fight against the USN, which was attempting to revive the United States. Regardless of objective factors, this pact seemed peculiar. But no matter what, they were now on the same side.</br>
</br>
You want to revive America?</br>
</br>
The soldiers on USS Obamas first opponent will not be the NAC, but their future citizens.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
A combat meeting against the USN was held in the temporary command post.</br>
</br>
The meeting was chaired by General Jiang Chen, and all the senior officers of the Expeditionary Army attended this meeting without exception. The topics discussed not only included plans to counteract USNs air superiority and how they would deal with the difficult NS-90 robots, but also the most fundamental and most urgent problem</br>
</br>
Where are they?!</br>
</br>
The chip on Governor Zhous body can send signals. As long as we get within a certain range, we can locate his coordinates, an officer suggested.</br>
</br>
The problem is that they are at sea and we have no air superiority. How do we search for them?</br>
</br>
How about releasing high-altitude drones? As long as</br>
</br>
Umm, as long as they are not blind, none of our drones will even get close</br>
</br>
Then search from below the sea level! Jiang Chen interrupted the argument around the conference table and tapped on the table with a finger to signal everyone to be silent. Immediately afterward, he looked at the Guards Captain next to him, and ordered in an absolute tone, Contact the Beluga Station and let them be in charge of the search. We will provide the chips frequency. As long as they can lock onto the position of the USN fleet, we will immediately pay them 10,000 credits. If they can bring Zhou Guoping back, I will pay 100,000.</br>
</br>
Many peoples eyes lit up when they heard the Generals words. They didnt think they could use Beluga Station to locate the USN fleet.</br>
</br>
Some people certainly considered this possibility, but they were hesitant to propose this idea. After all, NAC was developing its own navy, and the plan was to gradually recover the protection service from Wanghai to Yizhou, Yingzhou, and North America from Beluga Station. It was in direct conflict with their interests, and the relationship between the two parties was in a precarious state.</br>
</br>
But unlike these officers, as the General, Jiang Chen could see the situation clearly.</br>
</br>
The friction between the NAC and Beluga Station on the issue of sea power could only be regarded as competition and not confrontation. As long as NAC was willing to make certain concessions, the other side would certainly be willing to help.</br>
</br>
Also,10,000 credit points were enough to buy a whole truck of rice produced in the Garden of Eden.</br>
</br>
ROGER.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe nodded and left the conference room.</br>
</br>
The meeting continued, and then more than a dozen officers discussed and formulated a detailed combat plan against the USN. Given the topic required professional knowledge, Jiang Chen didnt interrupt the meeting. Instead, Li Wang presided over this portion of the meeting.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, Jiang Chen asked Li Wang to stay.</br>
</br>
Are the National Guard and the Minutemans troops here? While Jiang Chen put away the minutes of the meeting, he looked at Li Wang.</br>
</br>
They arrived this morning, Li Wang nodded and reported to him. I marked a place for them two kilometers east of Outpost Town, which was originally zoned as a newly developed residential area. Until this war is over, they will be stationed there and fight with us together.</br>
</br>
</br>
Very good. Jiang Chen nodded, Where is the reinforcement fleet? How long will it take to reach the West Coast?</br>
</br>
A week at the latest and maybe four days at the earliest, Li Wang said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, looked at Li Wang, and continued.</br>
</br>
I have another mission.</br>
</br>
Please go ahead. Li Wang respectfully said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not speak, but directly opened his watch, tapped a few buttons on the holographic screen, and a map of the Nevada desert appeared in front of them.</br>
</br>
This is When Li Wang looked at the map and the red area in the center of the map, he frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
This area is located east of Las Vegas, and the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center is nearby, Jiang Chen continued as he focused on Li Wang, Send a power armor team there and Ill recommend a guide for you. You have only one task, and that is to find the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center and control it!</br>
</br>
Inside the cold and humid room of the dungeon of Outpost Town.</br>
</br>
Black Skulls hands and feet were chained down by shackles. He laid on the bed lethargically as he zoned out staring at the outlines of the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because he was very cooperative when he explained the whole story, the sensible NAC did not shoot him. Instead, NAC threw him into the dungeon. Every day, two tubes of nutrient supplies were tossed in from the small window while he rotted away in here.</br>
</br>
Sometimes he really thought that it would be better to end himself here instead of staring at the dark ceiling.</br>
</br>
But now, he heard footsteps from outside the door.</br>
</br>
Is it time for food?</br>
</br>
Black Skull murmured in his mind and thought that the interval between the two meals was a bit short.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to get up and walk to the door, the black iron door suddenly opened slowly.</br>
</br>
He stared blankly at the ray of light that leaked through the crack of the door. For some reason, he felt an excitement that made him want to cry. The soldier who appeared at the door ignored the expression on his face, flipped through the list in his hand, and glanced at him emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Black Skull.</br>
</br>
Yes. After he swallowed, Black Skull nodded vigorously. Its me, whats wrong?</br>
</br>
A certain NAC unit is about to go to the desert for a mission. It needs a guide who is familiar with the Nevada Desert. Without any nonsense, the soldier closed the list, threw it on the side table, and concisely said, You now have an atonement. Even the opportunity for meritorious service, whether you can grasp it depends on your own performance.</br>
</br>
NO PROBLEM! I GOT IT! Black Skull exulted. I have lived in the Nevada Desert for more than ten years, I can even walk to Las Vegas with my eyes closed!</br>
</br>
As long as he could get out, he was willing to do anything! Even if he had to fight a Death Claw, he would not even frown for a single second. The days inside the dark room was inhumane. In that dark, cold and humid environment, even a determined person would go crazy after a while!</br>
</br>
The soldier nodded, and said to the guard next to him, Give him this collar. You can release the shackles.</br>
</br>
After he put on the electronic collar, the feeling of explosives hanging around his neck made Black Skull quite uncomfortable, but he also knew that he had no choice.</br>
</br>
He followed the soldier to an office where a high-ranking officer sat. As for how Black Skull determined his ranking, it was from the Knight Medal that hung in front of his chest</br>
</br>
The target we are searching for is the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center. The only information now is that it may appear in the eastern desert of Las Vegas, about two hundred meters deep underground. To put it bluntly, even though it is called the Meteorology Monitoring Center, it is actually a pre-war military facility.</br>
</br>
The officer then paused, looked at the black predator in front of him, and continued to speak, Ill just say that as long as you can bring us there, all your crimes will be forgiven. Based on how long it will take you to complete this mission, we may even pay out a hefty reward.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
A banquet was held on USS Obama.</br>
</br>
Ladies in evening gowns and gentlemen in tailcoats danced on the dance floor. The politicians and entrepreneurs who stood beside the long banquet table toasted and talked eagerly. Among them were shipowners, merchants, members of Congress, and politicians in government agencies.</br>
</br>
This kind of banquet was very common on USS Obama, as if something worth celebrating happened every few days. Even if most of the poor people on the cargo ships were struggling to get by, this did not stop them from squeezing out some supplies to enjoy life.</br>
</br>
Have you heard of Senator Bansars proposal? He actually proposed to the Congress to close the ranch on USS Lahaina and set free the thousand double-headed brahman cows! Jesus Christ. I have never heard of such a ridiculous proposal!</br>
</br>
Anyone can join our Congress now. We must tighten the threshold for those that want to become part of the Congress.</br>
</br>
But we cannot ignore the opinions of the thousand Indian-Americans. If they strike and protest, it will give us headaches.</br>
</br>
Lost? What a joke, if USN used all its strength, it is as easy to pinch an ant to death as it is easy to pinch them!</br>
</br>
I heard that the USN Marine Corps scrapped more than 500 NS-90 robots. Our fighters succeeded, but after all, we were still one step too slow.</br>
</br>
They wont be so lucky every time, let us toast the future of America!</br>
</br>
Haha, cheers!</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping let out a helpless sigh when he saw the charcoal-grilled double-headed brahman beef on the plates, the mutant cod burger with mud crab sauce, and the goblet full of quantum champagne. He felt like he had no appetite.</br>
</br>
If the banquet was compared to NAC standards, this banquet was probably of the lowest class. Not to mention anything else, at least at NAC banquets, canned food was never placed in the most conspicuous position on the table as if it were a treasure, and people had to show identification when they received the meal.</br>
</br>
Of course, they were not to blame. After all, for these survivors who drifted on the sea and had no homes, canned food was really a luxury.</br>
</br>
He missed his days in the Sixth Street very much now.</br>
</br>
At least from what he ate, it was not NACs tradition to treat its own poorly.</br>
</br>
When he arrived on USS Obama, the Americans not only did not abuse him but regarded him as an interesting characteror rather, a rare animal. President Sean specifically allowed him to attend the banquet on the aircraft carrier as the NAC Governor and even allowed him to live on the aircraft carrier as a state guest.</br>
</br>
We are a multicultural country. As long as you are willing to accept our ideas, you are one of us. The abuse of prisoners of war is done by barbarians, not by us. Those were President Seans words. While he sounded righteous, it was completely bullsh*t in Zhou Guopings ears.</br>
</br>
From the time he got on the ship, he had not seen his compatriots.</br>
</br>
</br>
Obviously, those three thousand colonists were not sent to the USN fleet at all. As for where they were sent, he had gained some insights.</br>
</br>
Although this group of Americans moved factories, farms, and even farmland to the deck of the cargo ships, this fleet was not all of the United States. After all, there were no recyclable waste products onboard and no resources for mining.</br>
</br>
The source of supplies for the American fleet mainly relied on the concentration camp in Panama, where criminals, slaves, and captives captured from the South American survivor settlements were held, and they were forced to do the most basic waste collection, mining, and resource recovery.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping was certain that the 3,000 colonists were sent there, and even the more than 30,000 slaves he purchased were also likely sent there even if most of those slaves were native to North America.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he heard a familiar and annoying voice beside him. A man in a suit and leather shoes walked towards him with a goblet and a bright smile.</br>
</br>
Haha, dear Mr. Zhou Guoping, how have you been recently? Are you used to life on the boat?</br>
</br>
When he saw this face, Governor Zhous previously pleasant mood was no longer pleasant.</br>
</br>
The man in front of him was no one else than the President of the United States of America at Sea, as well as Captain of the USS Obama, Sean Luke.</br>
</br>
Although USNs Marines were defeated by NAC some time ago, at this moment, there was not the slightest annoyance or frustration on his face. Instead, he smiled brightly, separated by two tables, and raised his goblet.</br>
</br>
As a president, he had to show sufficient demeanor in front of prisoners in order to win the favor of the domestic neutrals.</br>
</br>
Although Zhou Guoping could feel from far away that Mr. President looked down on him from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
Thank you for your thoughtfulness. Out of helplessness, he patiently raised his goblet and said stiffly, Im fine. Except for occasional seasickness, everything else is fine.</br>
</br>
Really? Sean laughed, I hope you can enjoy this banquet for the upcoming victory.</br>
</br>
Then I have to have a few good drinks. Zhou Guoping grinned and said sarcastically.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Mr. President did not hear the sarcasm in Zhou Goupings words, or perhaps he did not mind, he had already turned to the guests who surrounded him and began to converse with them.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping, who was forgotten in the corner, put down his goblet, walked outside the cabin, leaned against the guardrail, and lit a low-quality cigarette.</br>
</br>
The soldier standing outside on duty turned his body slightly and stared at him unabashedly.</br>
</br>
Without paying attention to that vigilant sight, Zhou Guoping planned to just take a breather before he returned. He could learn some news from those peoples conversations.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, the half-smoked cigarette fell into the sea.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping pretended the cigarette was blown away by the sea breeze, lowered his head to conceal the ecstasy on his face. The soldier who watched him found nothing unusual, and he just stood motionlessly on duty.</br>
</br>
Just now, an electric current mixed with static noise suddenly appeared in his mind.</br>
</br>
This is Parrot Is it Mr. Governor?</br>
</br>
A week had passed since AS Order arrived on the West Coast, and three days had passed since a team of power armors set off for the desert.</br>
</br>
During this week, small USN fighters broke into the colonys radar detection area almost every day, fired a long-range air-to-air missile at a distance aimed at AS Order, and then turned around before they approached the colonys air defense fire range.</br>
</br>
This kind of harassment was meaningless. Conventional air-to-air missiles at such a long-distance could be blasted down even with the airships built-in laser defense weapons. It was not even necessary to use ground-based air defense weapons.</br>
</br>
Their number of F-79s should be very limited. Jiang Chen put down the binoculars, squinted his eyes, and looked in the direction the flight of fighters left in.</br>
</br>
As long as they could breakthrough the ground-based air defense and exchange a few fights with the enemy aircraft carrier, the exchange would be well worth the trade. However, these fighters were afraid to enter NACs firepower coverage. Other than the daily trip to check the West Coast, they did not make any other moves.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the five lost fighters had already caused them a lot of pain.</br>
</br>
What are they waiting for? Zheng Shanhe frowned.</br>
</br>
A gust of wind, Jiang Chen smiled after a moments pause, and then said, Or a hurricane, a tornado, or a lightning storm.</br>
</br>
Slightly confused by the analogy, Zheng Shanhe didnt react at first. It took two seconds for him to turn to Jiang Chen with a look of shock.</br>
</br>
You, you mean!</br>
</br>
Thats right. Jiang Chen nodded, and his slightly narrowed eyes gleamed with a dangerous ray, Now the National Guard and Minuteman are already on our side, and the troops are stationed in the camp next to the fortress. If USNs fighters came once every day, then there must have discovered this information.</br>
</br>
For USN, the survivors on the West Coast had decided to stand on their opposing side. They had become obstacles to their plan to revive the United States.</br>
</br>
Therefore, since they had found the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center first, it was obviously a more convenient choice to directly use the weather weapon. The only plausible explanation as to why USN had not done so was because either activating the weather weapon would take a considerable amount of time, or summoning a large-scale natural disaster would require certain conditions.</br>
</br>
Now he could only pray that the team of power armors sent to the Nevada Desert could snatch the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center from USN before USN launched a weather strike</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1412: For Money</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Five kilometers below the sea surface, a streamlined submarine floated quietly in the bottomless trench and moved slowly forward. The word Parrot was printed with white paint on both sides of the submarine, and the symbol of the Beluga Station was at the center of the radar cover.</br>
</br>
There was no need to worry about being discovered by the USN destroyer because its current depth had far exceeded the maximum submersible depth of military submarines. This depth could only be reached by scientific research submarines. No sonar was capable of detecting any presence in this depth, nor could any depth charge or sonar threaten its existence.</br>
</br>
In contrast to the quiet movement, the inside of the submarine was already filled with joy.</br>
</br>
The two pilots high-fived each other and the observer put down his headset and whistled in excitement. At the door of the control room, the captain, with his arms crossed in front of his chest, grinned under his unshaven mustache.</br>
</br>
They just went for a stroll and earned an easy 10,000 credits.</br>
</br>
They had never made such easy money.</br>
</br>
Based on the rules of the station, 70% of the commissioned income was handed to the organization, 20% of the equipment maintenance fee was paid directly to the shipyard, and the remaining 10% was the bonus for all of them.</br>
</br>
Now they had a dilemma.</br>
</br>
Should they follow this fleet, report the coordinates to NAC, and receive the 10,000 credits, or should they send someone up to bring Zhou Guoping back and get the 100,000 credits promised by NAC</br>
</br>
The USS Obama must be heavily guarded. Its difficult for us to get in. We should just take what we have, a crew member hesitantly suggested.</br>
</br>
Thats one hundred thousand credits! The other crew member widened his eyes, Why dont we try it? Or why did we bring the soldiers along? Let them share the bonus for no reason?</br>
</br>
This is not as simple as trying, this is gambling! If the target has an accident</br>
</br>
Why are we afraid? NAC only asked us for the coordinates. They didnt say we need to care for the safety of the target!</br>
</br>
Listen to what he has to say first and understand the situation onboard USS Obama, the captain interrupted the quarrel in the control room, looked at the observer who was in charge of contacting Zhou Guoping, and ordered, If circumstance permits, we can send some people up. If it doesnt, then forget it.</br>
</br>
In the end, it was the captain that ended the argument in the room.</br>
</br>
The observer put on the headset again, entered the communication password provided by Jiang Chen on the tablet, and reconnected to Zhou Guopings chip. He asked Zhou Guoping for his current location and the security measures around him. At this moment, Zhou Guoping had used the excuse of going to the washroom and went to the washroom.</br>
</br>
There is a banquet happening on USS Obama, Zhou Guoping, who was sitting on the toilet, confirmed that there was no one outside, then took a deep breath, bridged his consciousness with the chip and sent a message to the crew on Parrot, Listen, you have no chance. They are watching me closely. Send this message on my behalf to Jiang Chen. These Americans have a base in Panama and all the residents of the colony were sent there!</br>
</br>
</br>
Are you alone on the ship?</br>
</br>
Yes, Zhou Guoping replied.</br>
</br>
Okay, we will pass the message on to Jiang Chen for you. However, I personally suggest you tell him about such valuable information in person. Then for the reward AHEM! For your safety and personal freedom, we will send a team of special force to sneak onto the USN fleet. Please wait patiently and cooperate with our rescue operation when necessary.</br>
</br>
You cant get in. Even if you get inside, you wont be able to take me away, Zhou Guoping smiled bitterly. I have someone following me to the washroom. They will never allow me to stay out of their sight.</br>
</br>
Is that so? Where are you now?</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping was taken aback for a moment and just wanted to answer that he was on the toilet of course.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, he suddenly realized what he just said.</br>
</br>
It seemed that he was out of the Americans sight right now</br>
</br>
On the highway from California to Nevada, NACs convoy headed deep into the desert. On the roof of the first truck, Zhang Wei took the binoculars out of his pocket and glanced out into the endless yellow sand.</br>
</br>
However, there was only sand and not a trace of human activity.</br>
</br>
To locate a military facility buried hundreds of meters underground was no different than finding a needle in a haystack.</br>
</br>
You better hurry up before I lose my patience, Zhang Wei said irritably as he glanced at the man who sat next to him.</br>
</br>
Three days.</br>
</br>
From when they set off, three full days had passed.</br>
</br>
But along the way, they had not even seen a decent-looking house, let alone the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center. If his mission didnt include that weather weapon, he wouldnt mind wandering around in the desert, but they were in a time crunch and had to find it before the Americans could activate the weather weapon.</br>
</br>
Every minute was precious.</br>
</br>
You cant blame me, Black Skull noticed the impatience in the eyes of the NAC officer next to him; he started to sweat profusely as he attempted to defend himself. The information you gave me is only a map that is not useful in any way and a name I have never heard before.</br>
</br>
Fu*k you. If I knew the specific location, why would I need you?</br>
</br>
The scolded Black Skull was afraid to look up and did not dare to respond.</br>
</br>
Not wanting to waste saliva on this guy, Zhang Wei took out the mineral water from his backpack and took a sip, then he stopped talking.</br>
</br>
The convoy continued to move forward.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Black Skull suddenly noticed something. He slapped the roof of the car and shouted.</br>
</br>
Wait, STOP! STOP!</br>
</br>
The convoy stopped, and without waiting for Zhang Wei to speak, the man hurriedly jumped out of the truck, trotted two steps forward, and then squatted down by the road.</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei watched his actions with a frown, then jumped off the truck and walked to him.</br>
</br>
The man got down first and pressed his ears on the ground. Then he climbed up from the ground and moved his fingers back and forth on the dry concrete road.</br>
</br>
What are you doing? Zhang Wei kicked this guy in the butt and frowned.</br>
</br>
A convoy passed by here, about two hours ago. They didnt use the road, but moved through the middle of the road. Black Skulls two mung-bean-sized eyes narrowed slightly as he looked up at the sand dunes beside the road. Theyre heading north.</br>
</br>
How do you know? A hint of surprise appeared in Zhang Weis eyes.</br>
</br>
The wind here was very strong. The blowing gust was enough to cover all tracks with sand within ten minutes, let alone two hours. However, this guy was not only able to spot the issue with this road with just a glance, but he could accurately pinpoint the direction as well as the time.</br>
</br>
At least in Zhang Weis eyes, there was no difference between this section of the road and the section they had passed through before.</br>
</br>
The temperature of the highway in Nevada is very high, and the tires will still leave marks. You can still feel it with your fingers. Black Skull clapped his hands and stood up from the ground. He touched his head, grinned proudly, and revealed his white teeth, This is how we used to track merchants.</br>
</br>
Fair enough.</br>
</br>
From when they took off until now, it was the first time Zhang Wei felt that this guy was still somewhat useful</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1413: Besiege In The Deser</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Deep into the Nevada Desert, a row of desert-camouflaged SUVs came from afar, avoided two hills covered by loess, and stopped outside a military base under the hills. The rusty iron gate looked as if it had been deserted for many years. By the amount of sand trapped under the tarp, it appeared that no one had visited this place for a long time.</br>
</br>
When the convoy approached the military base, the vehicles began to slow down.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a gust of wind that carried sand blew by. In just a blink of an eye, soldiers wearing desert camouflage stood around the convoy. They raised their rifles and surrounded the SUVs.</br>
</br>
The convoy stopped.</br>
</br>
The door of the second SUV opened and a military boot stepped onto the ground. He showed his identity card to the nearest soldier. The soldier didnt make any movement except for a red light that flashed in the center of the tactical eyepiece under the brim of his Bennies hat.</br>
</br>
After the soldier identified the code on the graphene card, the rifles pointed at the convoy all lowered. Colonel Ross put away his graphene card, narrowed his eyes, scanned the group of soldiers, and said.</br>
</br>
Where is Colonel McCarthy, get him to see me.</br>
</br>
Here. Colonel McCarthy, who wore a beret, stepped out and walked up to the officer. He raised his hand and performed a standard military salute.</br>
</br>
Although the two were both colonels in military ranks, one was serving in the Department of Defense while the other was a commissioned officer of the frontline forces. Colonel Ross came here with the order of the Department of Defense and could be considered as his superior. Therefore, he had no problem saluting first.</br>
</br>
Colonel Ross responded with a salute, then looked at the military base behind him and nodded.</br>
</br>
How is the preparation?</br>
</br>
The West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center is already under our control, and the only insider is also under our control, McCarthy replied seriously.</br>
</br>
Very good. Colonel Ross nodded and stared at McCarthy. Then he paused for a moment before he continued, Congress has already discussed this matter. Since those stubborn conservative forces are ready to stop us from moving into the future, then we will sweep them into the tomb of history together with the rubbish of the wasteland. Your task now is to include the entire California in the coverage of the weather weapon and implement an indiscriminate strategic strike.</br>
</br>
Roger, Colonel McCarthy replied in a cold and emotionless state.</br>
</br>
The combat order has been issued. I want to know when this thing will be ready. Colonel Ross said while he raised his chin and looked at the alloy door inlaid on the side of the hill behind the military base.</br>
</br>
It depends on when the fuel rods will be delivered. Colonel McCarthy then asked, How is the dismantling of that batch of nuclear weapons?</br>
</br>
A hundred 20mm nuclear fusion cores have been removed and they will be sent here soon, Colonel Ross responded.</br>
</br>
</br>
Thats enough. The upturned corner of his mouth showed cruelness and viciousness, Colonel McCarthy said, A category six hurricane will be more than enough to shred their defense-</br>
</br>
Before he could finish his sentence, a scream suddenly came from the sky.</br>
</br>
The two of them were taken aback by the noise and looked up.</br>
</br>
However, just halfway through the motion, shrapnel blasted and dazzling light exploded. Dark smoke then diffused at the entrance of the military base along with the fire. Unprepared, the two soldiers who stood next to the checkpoint were blown to pieces by the incoming shells. One of them entered into a coma and was immediately in an undetermined state.</br>
</br>
McCarthy reflexively took two steps back, raised his sleeves to cover his face, and stared at the blown checkpoint, then his pupils suddenly constricted.</br>
</br>
Mortars!</br>
</br>
ENEMY ATTACK!</br>
</br>
SPREAD OUT! HURRY, HURRY!</br>
</br>
This is Team Red Arrow. The position of the mortar has been calculated, we are heading to the target area</br>
</br>
Without the slightest warning, as the first shell exploded, the subsequent shells exploded near the convoy like countless beans being scattered down.</br>
</br>
When the first shell arrived, all USN soldiers started to move like in sync gears. Soldiers in desert camouflage rushed to the side of the road and held onto their rifle as they laid down on the spot behind covers. The SUVs quickly reversed and spread out; half of the SUVs, that carried supplies, drove into the military base. The other half, which carried soldiers, and two armored vehicles rushed out of the military base and headed for the direction where the shells came from.</br>
</br>
Haha! FIRE!</br>
</br>
With one foot on a desert-colored motorcycle, the man in a cowboy hat laughed hysterically while he looked at the explosions with his binoculars. The scene of enemies fleeing under his bombardment sparked an immense amount of joy in his mind.</br>
</br>
In the open space next to him, soldiers dressed as cowboys took the mortar shells from the back of the motorcycles, threw them to the comrades holding the mortar, and stuffed them into the thick barrel.</br>
</br>
The Rangers, as a purely motorized artillery unit, was the trump card of the militia organization Minuteman. Although they relied on old-fashioned fuel-burning motorcycles as a means of transportation, the performance of this old-fashioned machinery on wasteland, especially in the desert, was unexpectedly reliable. Moreover, synthetic oil was much easier to obtain than nuclear batteries, and the machine was also not affected by EMP weapons. With the excellent firepower of 60mm electromagnetic mortars, the Rangers had ravaged the California wasteland for more than a decade, frightening countless predators and mutated human tribes.</br>
</br>
They are coming here, another cowboy crouched behind a rock said as he observed the convoy moving along with a trail of dust with his binoculars, Tell NAC they can start!</br>
</br>
ROGER!</br>
</br>
No notification was required at all.</br>
</br>
When the cowboy ran to the motorcycle and sent the message, the NAC Expeditionary Force and the National Guard who were flanking nearby had already moved.</br>
</br>
Without any warning, dozens of anti-tank rockets sprang out from behind the haystack and went straight to the USN military convoy moving to the Ranger artillery position. Two SUVs were shot on the side and turned into exploding fireballs. The two armored vehicles at the back were hit directly and stalled on the road. In a split second, the USN convoy had completely lost its momentum.</br>
</br>
Knowing that they were ambushed, USN soldiers jumped out of the vehicles one after another and scattered to look for cover. However, the previous rockets were only the beginning. A group of soldiers also armed with kinetic skeleton flanked from behind the dunes. The rifle in their hands spewed out fearsome bullets. With the support of power armors, they surrounded the completely stalled convoy.</br>
</br>
IM HIT! MEDIC!</br>
</br>
SH*T! THIS IS TEAM RED ARROW! WE NEED REINFORCEMENT! I REPEAT, WE AHHHHHHH-</br>
</br>
There was no reinforcement.</br>
</br>
Just half a minute ago, countless rockets fell from above and instantly engulfed the abandoned military base.</br>
</br>
The tumbling balls of flame dyed the gray-yellow earth into a dark hell, and a pungent burnt smell lingered around the entire battlefield. Most of the USN soldiers died under the barrage of Fireball-1. While a few survived, under the siege of the NAC ground troops, the remaining soldiers were forced to retreat to the cave.</br>
</br>
Everything happened so suddenly that neither Colonel McCarthy nor Colonel Ross could react.</br>
</br>
When they were about to ask for help from the fleet, they found that all communication equipment had failed. It turned out that during the rocket barrage, NAC not only used high-explosive and incendiary warheads, but also the most insidious EMP warheads</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1414: Power of The Cannon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Gunshots persisted above the empty ground in the center of the military base and the flames of explosions bloomed from time to time. The previous full-scale rocket attack turned the entire military base into chaos. Burnt vehicles had tipped over on the side of the road, and from time to time, nuclear fusion cores exploded.</br>
</br>
USN soldiers in kinetic skeleton evacuated to the entrance of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, deployed an aluminum alloy mobile bunker at the entrance of the cave, and fired back as they waited for reinforcements that who knew when would arrive.</br>
</br>
FU*K! How did these monkeys find us!</br>
</br>
Its not just monkeys Fu*k, now we have to face those idiots. Colonel Ross cursed at the scene of National Guards power armors attacking the military base, Where is the spare communicator?</br>
</br>
In the headquarters, McCarthy fired a few shots outside the bunker, glanced at the chaotic military base, then looked at the destroyed building in the center of the base. His eagle-like eyes seemed to show that he was in a dire state. SH*T! How often is your interval communication?</br>
</br>
One hour, After Colonel Ross replaced the burnt chip in the tablet, tapped on the tablet a few times, looked at the rows of icons on the screen with a red cross, then threw a punch against the wall. FU*K! We lost the drones too!</br>
</br>
While they spoke, a rifle grenade exploded on the bunker. An unprepared soldier was blown upside down, and the blood-stained kinetic skeleton fragments scattered all over the floor. The two hurriedly ducked down and narrowly avoided the explosion debris.</br>
</br>
We cant hold this place anymore! After McCarthy emptied his last magazine, he tossed down the rifle in his hand, pulled out the laser pistol from his waist, and fired a few beams outside, then he grabbed Colonel Ross next to him, Lets go, we need to get inside!</br>
</br>
The bullet shells clinked as they fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
After he received the clip thrown over by logistic, Zhang Wei skillfully reloaded the rifle and fired at the soldiers hiding behind cover. With a few short bursts, a series of blood spurts appeared on the head of the soldier under the sight as the soldier fell backward and collapsed to the ground.</br>
</br>
The combat effectiveness of this group of USN soldiers was not strong. Compared with their powerful mechanical equipment, they could even be described as weak.</br>
</br>
Other than the invisible soldiers and the cyborg fighters who were not affected by EMP, which caused a lot of trouble for the NAC and the National Guard when they attacked NACs base because of their technical advantages. These USN soldiers in kinetic skeleton or even power armor, under the besieged attack of the NAC and the National Guard, collapsed in a one-sided slaughter.</br>
</br>
Not far from Zhang Wei, a National Guards power armor swung its power hammer with a full swing and directly landed it on the power armor inscribed with USN. Eerie blue sparks appeared on the surface of the power armor for a brief second. The shock wave of the swing blew away the gravel on the ground and dented the heavy front armor!</br>
</br>
</br>
The pilot inside couldnt be more dead</br>
</br>
On the other side, a soldier who wore an optical invisibility combat uniform was suppressed down by the hailstorm of bullets and was finally blown into fragments by a rocket along with the concrete bunker.</br>
</br>
The USN soldiers at the entrance of the cave were forced to retreat under the unrelenting firepower of NAC.</br>
</br>
The fishers are retreating! National Guard Deputy Captain Wade roared; he exchanged the heavy machine gun on his right hand of the power armor into a grenade launcher and pressed down the trigger with force against the closing alloy giant gate, FU*K! WHERE ARE YOU ROCKETS? WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH FIREPOWER!</br>
</br>
Deploying!</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei waved his fist and signaled the anti-tank infantry behind him to attack.</br>
</br>
Just as the NACs anti-tank troops rushed to position, the National Guards rifle grenades had already landed in front of the giant alloy gate. There was a series of loud booms, followed by the flame of explosions that almost swallowed the round gate.</br>
</br>
However, as Wade had expected, these high-explosive grenades effective against soft targets did not do any damage against the slowly closing giant alloy gate! They couldnt even stop it for a brief moment.</br>
</br>
USNs infantry had all retreated into the cave, and the mobile bunker was abandoned. The NAC anti-tank infantry from the rear finally arrived at the battlefield. Under Zhang Weis command, they deployed the recoilless cannon onto the ground and fired at the giant gate.</br>
</br>
A dozen Poisonous Python rockets along with orange tail flames galloped towards the entrance of the cave, then exploded into a series of orange-red fireballs on the giant alloy panel! The huge door made an overwhelmed buzz, and the dull sound reverberated throughout the hills.</br>
</br>
WE GOT IT!</br>
</br>
However, when the smoke dissipated, Zhang Weis pupils suddenly constricted.</br>
</br>
The giant circular alloy gates flat surface looked like nothing had happened. The dozen of rockets that could blow apart armored vehicles could not even leave a dent on its surface!</br>
</br>
A word suddenly appeared in Zhang Weis mind.</br>
</br>
Memory Alloy!</br>
</br>
He had no time to hesitate.</br>
</br>
As he watched the alloy gate that was only three-cars-wide before it was fully closed, Zhang Wei made the decisive decision, pressed on his helmet, and executed Plan B.</br>
</br>
Power Armor Squad on my command! ENGINE OUTPUT MAXIMUM. GET INSIDE BEFORE THE DOOR CLOSES!</br>
</br>
Blue flames burst out and thrust the T-3 power armors forward. With the wheels deployed, they charged into the cave.</br>
</br>
A dozen USN power armors that had previously retreated into the cave realized NACs plan. They resolutely appeared from behind the alloy gate, lifted the alloy shield on their left air while the tongue of fire reappeared from the heavy machine gun in their other hand.</br>
</br>
Bullets re-weaved a net between the two sides. Rockets screamed and were accompanied by the roar of grenades. These warriors who dared to face death were quickly sent by NAC to meet their god.</br>
</br>
But even so, they had accomplished their goal. When the last USN power armor was blasted in the explosion of an anti-armor rocket, the heavy giant alloy door was finally firmly shut and blocked out all the T-3s that just made it to the entrance.</br>
</br>
DAMN IT!</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei slammed his fist against the concrete bunker, then stepped out from behind the bunker carrying his rifle.</br>
</br>
The battlefield filled with gunpowder was full of fragmented mechanical wreckage. Without air support, USN soldiers were defeated in a firefight with the NAC, the National Guard, and the Minuteman. However, despite this outcome, they could not proclaim this victory.</br>
</br>
Because the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center was still under American control</br>
</br>
They had to try their last resort.</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei gritted his teeth and took out the tablet from his backpack. He set the attack coordinates on the map and clicked the last item in the Available Support list  the electromagnetic mega cannon!</br>
</br>
He clicked confirm and took two steps back. While he put away the tablet, he pressed the button on his helmet.</br>
</br>
attention all combats units, the electromagnetic mega cannons attack is en route. The target is the entrance of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center. Take the necessary avoidance measures.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
From a distance, there was a roar that tore through space.</br>
</br>
A thick cylindrical mass, engulfed in a ball of bright-orange flame, crossed a distance of hundreds of kilometers and smashed into the alloy gate like an iron fist.</br>
</br>
The shell that was accelerated to the limit shredded the giant gate together with the mountain next to it with its destructive force. A deafening roar surged up from the quaking ground. Its annihilation power could be felt even from far away.</br>
</br>
However, when the dust settled, Zhang Weis expression quickly changed to disappointment.</br>
</br>
The alloy door was blasted open.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was destroyed.</br>
</br>
Not only that, even the mountains that the cave was embedded into were also destroyed by this shell</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei stood there silently for a long time before he squeezed out a foul language that he had recently learned.</br>
</br>
Fu*k</br>
</br>
The entrance to the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center was destroyed. The USN soldiers inside could not get out, nor could anyone outside get in.</br>
</br>
Unwilling to just stand outside and do nothing against the weather weapon that could be launched at any point, Wade brought dozens of National Guard power armors into the ruins as they attempted to dig a way into the collapsed mountain. However, it turned out that the power armor was not designed for drilling. Despite their best effort, they did not succeed.</br>
</br>
Its useless, we need professional construction equipment, like excavators or drills. When Zhang Wei walked to Wades side, there was a visible frown on his face as he looked at the rubble.</br>
</br>
He debated if another shell was a good idea.</br>
</br>
But when he thought that this might make the situation worse, he gave up on the idea after some hesitation.</br>
</br>
Not far away, the National Guard finally gave up relying on manpower to remove the collapsed rubble, because they finally discovered that it was not just the door that had collapsed, but the entire tunnel behind the door.</br>
</br>
At this time, the Minuteman Rangers also rushed over with their motorcycles. After they saw the collapsed mountain, they also felt helpless.</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei could not formulate a plan, so he had to report to the command post. After he learned two excavators and an engineer company had set off from Outpost Town, he ordered his men to start cleaning the battlefield.</br>
</br>
Hopefully, we can make it.</br>
</br>
After he ended the communication with the command post, Zhang Wei was about to find a place to rest. However, a soldier in kinetic skeleton walked up to him and saluted.</br>
</br>
Report sir, we found him in the concrete ruins.</br>
</br>
As the soldier spoke, a survivor in ragged clothes was pushed in front of Zhang Wei.</br>
</br>
First of all, I am definitely not on their side. When Blood Axe realized Zhang Wei was examining him with intrigue, he quickly raised both of his hands to signal that he was not hostile. Then he carefully said, If you have heard of Outpost Town on the West Coast, you can hand me over to the Governor Zhou Guoping there. I can guarantee youll get a huge ransom.</br>
</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping? Zhang Wei raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, How long have you not been back to the West Coast?</br>
</br>
Blood Axe took a second to digest this information. He didnt react to the amount of information in this sentence.</br>
</br>
We are the people of NAC, Zhang Wei pointed to the collapsed mountain. The group of people inside are USN, and they have a lot of conflicts with us.</br>
</br>
USNwait, you are from NAC? There was a momentary look of joy on Blood Axe, then he quickly said, Then can you tell Zhou Guoping for me that this is not NATOs nuclear arsenal at all, but NATO</br>
</br>
Weather Weapon, Zhang Wei waved his hand impatiently, We have already learned this information. And the Zhou Guoping you mentioned was taken away by USN. Now it is unknown whether he is alive or dead.</br>
</br>
After Blood Axe learned that Zhou Guoping had been taken away, he was shell-shocked and it took him a while to accept this fact.</br>
</br>
Gradually, the color on his face turned from bad to worse.</br>
</br>
It wasnt because of how loyal he was to Zhou Guoping, but that guy still owed him thousands of bottle caps. In the beginning, they agreed that as long as he could trace the final destination of the batch of nuclear weapons, no matter whether there was any nuclear arsenal there, he could get at least a thousand caps.</br>
</br>
Although he did not find a nuclear arsenal, he did discover the weather weapon that sounded equally destructive. He thought that he could use this information in exchange for two or three thousand caps. However, the person in front of him now told him that Zhou Guopings whereabouts were unknown</br>
</br>
If you want to go back to Outpost Town, go back by yourself. We have something to do now and we have no time for you. After Zhang Wei left this sentence and was about to leave, he did not expect the next sentence from Blood Axe would stop his foot in the middle of the air.</br>
</br>
You you want to go in? Blood Axe looked at the group of power armors in the front, after a pause, he continued, In fact, there is another way to get in beside the main entrance.</br>
</br>
Colonel McCarthy sat down on the ground as he looked at the tunnel filled with rubble. He wanted to say something, but not a word came out.</br>
</br>
He thought he was for sure died from the power of that one shell.</br>
</br>
However, he did not expect that that shell not only blasted down the alloy gate but also collapsed the mountain. The collapsed gravel buried the entire section of the tunnel. If he hadnt run fast enough, he would have been buried inside.</br>
</br>
He forced a few dry laughs to celebrate his survival, then struggled to stand up from the ground with the support of a rifle. He shook his dazed brain and patted the dust on his legs. A dozen soldiers also stood or sat not too far from him.</br>
</br>
When he came, he took five hundred brothers with him.</br>
</br>
And now, they were the only people left.</br>
</br>
What should we do now? Colonel Ross swallowed dryly, unable to wet his parched throat. He stuffed the tablet back into his backpack and walked to Colonel McCarthy.</br>
</br>
We can only pray now that USS Obama will find out that we are in trouble soon.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, is there no energy at all in this meteorological monitoring center? Rosss brows were furrowed as he looked at the elevator that lead to the underground base behind him, If there is no energy at all, how did it transfer the nuclear winter in North America to Pan-Asia.</br>
</br>
The backup energy is sufficient. It is enough for this weather monitoring center to operate for fifty years, Colonel McCarthy shook his head after he put away the rifle in his hands, but the backup energy that is enough for the weather weapon to operate for fifty years has been locked for the existing weather guidance program. It cannot be used for any other purposes.</br>
</br>
If you crack the security program in the supercomputer, modify it directly from the inside</br>
</br>
Do you know how? McCarthy shrugged and said hopelessly, Im out of luck anyway.</br>
</br>
However, unexpectedly, Colonel Ross, who came from USS Obama, nodded.</br>
</br>
I can try I used to work at the Information Defense Center of the Department of Homeland Security before I went into the hibernation chamber.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1416: Weather Strike En Route</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, located at the bottom of the supercomputer was the control center of the entire supercomputer.</br>
</br>
Colonel Ross connected the tablet to the security program at the door, quickly unlocked the door, and stepped inside first.</br>
</br>
Colonel McCarthy ordered the soldiers behind him to secure this place then followed inside.</br>
</br>
The ground was covered with dry dust, the rubber-soled boots creaked as they walked forward. Colonel McCarthy looked around once he got in, then wiped the table closest to him with his finger. When he saw the thick layer of dust, he knew that no one had been here for a long time.</br>
</br>
The second console? Colonel McCarthy asked with an uncertain tone.</br>
</br>
When he was here the first time, he searched the area with his soldiers but did not find this room. The console they found was located in the center of the entire supercomputer. Just above their heads, there was a suspension bridge made of aluminum alloy that led directly to the center of the supercomputer.</br>
</br>
No, strictly speaking, its not called a console. Ross sat in the center seat in front of the control center, then he started the long-silent operating system. He moved his dry fingers with some excitement as he said, We call this place the backdoor, we generally use this to maintain the security program of the supercomputer, but as long as you want, you can also directly modify the running program of the supercomputer from herewith higher authority.</br>
</br>
How sure are you? Colonel McCarthy asked.</br>
</br>
I dont know, Colonel Ross said without turning his head while his fingers rapidly clicked on the touchpad, Like I said, Im just giving it a try. If it can be done, thats great. If it cant be done, then lets stay here and wait to be rescued.</br>
</br>
Time passed by, and there was only the sound of fingers tapping on the touchpad in the room and Colonel Rosss muttering.</br>
</br>
Full Net provided the security services for the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center supercomputer! Haha, this is much easier. His fingers crackled on the touchpad while his eyes moved along with the lines of the code.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he had devoted himself to the work at hand.</br>
</br>
Full Net? Colonel McCarthy slightly frowned, What is that.</br>
</br>
Dont you know? Colonel Ross glanced at Colonel McCarthy who stood behind him, then focused back on the virtual keyboard on the touchpad. The second biggest security service provider in North America, also the second biggest in the world. We have outsourced many projects to them, and they have done great.</br>
</br>
Then how are you going to hack the second-best security program in the United States? McCarthy looked at the string of numbers on the screen, then asked with a puzzled tone.</br>
</br>
This is actually not difficult, because the safety program they used was the 2160 version. After the weather weapon was put into use, the entire facility completely evaporated from the publics sight. Since then, not even a fly could get in, let alone security updates. The control terminal and transmitter were completely physically isolated from the outside world. Without a network, there was naturally no information security. Colonel Ross pressed the last enter key on the touchpad, then watched the series of loading bars on the holographic screen with a hint of proudness, It just so happens that the 2160 version of the security system used by Full Net was backed up in the database of the Department of Homeland Security. We have studied their security weakness.</br>
</br>
</br>
While he watched the codes execute line-by-line, Colonel Rosss upturned corner of his mouth showed how he felt.</br>
</br>
He had not done any work like this for many years.</br>
</br>
But he didnt expect that the skills he thought he would never use again turned out to be useful.</br>
</br>
[Whether parameters reset complete]</br>
</br>
[Target is set to West Coast]</br>
</br>
[Setting is successful]</br>
</br>
[Weather strike is en route, progress is 0.1%]</br>
</br>
They only had to wait!</br>
</br>
Colonel Ross clapped his hands as his hands left the touchpad. McCarthy glanced at the progress bar on the screen, and was about to ask This is it?, but then he was interrupted by a loud explosion outside the door.</br>
</br>
When they felt the tremor sent along the floor, the two of them were slightly taken aback.</br>
</br>
What are those idiots doing.</br>
</br>
Colonel McCarthy looked at the door with a frown and was about to move to the door. However, before he could, the iron door was blasted open by a corpse in kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
The moment General McCarthy saw the corpse, his pupils constricted, and he reflexively pulled out the laser gun from his waist. But before he could pull down the trigger, a steel boot stepped over the door and was followed by blue rays that thrust forward and a giant hand that was directly aimed at his head.</br>
</br>
SH*T</br>
</br>
With a loud bang, the back protected by the kinetic skeleton came into close contact with the wall.</br>
</br>
There was no room for resistance, and Colonel McCarthy was pressed against the wall by the National Guards power armor.</br>
</br>
Then, Zhang Wei stepped into the control center and rushed to Colonel Ross with a few NAC soldiers. Without saying anything, Zhang Wei knocked the Yankee with his gunstock and took control of the console.</br>
</br>
The weather weapon has been activatedFU*K! When Zhang Wei saw the line of words on the screen, he immediately grabbed the bruised Colonel Ross from the ground, pressed his head against the touchpad, and pointed the gun right against his head, Turn off this sh*t right away! IM NOT KIDDING, ILL COUNT TO THREE.</br>
</br>
No need to count. Ross dry coughed a few times, then coughed up bloody spit, and grinned. No one can stop this. Im not kidding.</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei kicked Colonel Ross in the stomach, then punched him again, and Ross directly fainted.</br>
</br>
As he looked at the West Coast marked in red on the screen in distraught, Zhang Wei immediately called the command post and reported the situation to General Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
This is Company A. We have successfully controlled the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center. But we were still a step too late. The weather weapon has targeted the entire state of California The procedure cannot be terminated! The blast team is ready to request approval for blasting.</br>
</br>
Whats the progress? Jiang Chen asked calmly.</br>
</br>
It has reached 7% 8%, FU*K!</br>
</br>
Connect your squad command module to the console, and completely transfer the authority to the command post. Jiang Chen ordered, IMMEDIATELY!</br>
</br>
ROGER!</br>
</br>
Without another word of nonsense, Zhang Wei pulled out a data cable from the left arm of the exoskeleton and directly inserted it into the port under the console. After he tapped a few times on the touchpad and confirmed that the interface was normal, the control authority was immediately transferred to the command post.</br>
</br>
At the command post, Li Wang looked the progress bar on the screen, swallowed down the lump in his throat, and made a difficult suggestion, Ill let the technical team tryGeneral, can you go back to the airship first?</br>
</br>
No need, Jiang Chen shook his head, and before Li Wang dissuaded him, he said, I will try.</br>
</br>
Everyone in the command post was stunned when they heard this sentence as they all focused on their general.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the look of surprise and skepticism and took off his headphones. He put them on the table, looked around at the officers all focused on him, and dry coughed a few times.</br>
</br>
Before that Let me go to the washroom first. Ill be back soon.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1417: More Spectacular Than Any Movie</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The moment Jiang Chen heard Zhang Wei say, The program cannot be terminated, he immediately thought of a person.</br>
</br>
If there had to be a person that could turn the impossible into the possible in programming, then other than the advanced artificial intelligence Lilith, there was no one else.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, when he returned to the modern world last time to take the aerospace plane, he adjusted his coordinates from Coconut Island to the backyard of his Coro Island mansion, otherwise, he would really be helpless now.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen rushed into the bathroom, he immediately traveled back to the modern world, then grabbed Lilith, who was in her helmet playing games with her stomach against the sofa and pulled her back into the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Where is this place? Lilith looked around emotionlessly, I have no signal now.</br>
</br>
North America! Jiang Chen threw the tablet terminal to Lilith, No nonsense. If you want to go back earlier, do me a favor, hurry!</br>
</br>
After Lilith received the tablet, she did not speak and just silently pressed her finger against the screen. For her, there was no need for a data cable connection. She could adjust the program through her finger.</br>
</br>
Stop the programits difficult. Lilith gave a brief but concise comment.</br>
</br>
Its also difficult for you? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Well, its not impossible, it just takes a long time, Lilith said. In the design of the program, the weather strike is irreversible. If you want to stop the weather strike that is already en route, you must make significant revisions to the program. When I finish the revisions, this place is probably finished too.</br>
</br>
Even Lilith cant do it?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned and thought.</br>
</br>
If it really doesnt work; I can only blow apart that supercomputer</br>
</br>
WAIT!</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he had an idea, and immediately turned on the holographic screen of the watch, then showed the coordinates of Parrot to Lilith.</br>
</br>
Then dont stop it, change the attack coordinates for me! Change it to this!</br>
</br>
That shouldnt be a big problem, I can try. As she spoke, a series of dark green data streams that flowed at an incredible speed and was almost impossible to catch by the naked eye appeared in her pupils.</br>
</br>
Soon, Jiang Chen saw Lilith nod.</br>
</br>
Well, this is really not a big problem.</br>
</br>
Small droplets of rain drizzled down on the deck of the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
Against the surging waves, the majestic USS Obama lead the fleet of giant ships through the mighty waves.</br>
</br>
Right below the deck, the banquets mood was at its peak.</br>
</br>
We lost contact with McCarthy!? How could that be possible! President Sean walked quickly to the corner of the banquet hall, looked around nervously, and made sure no one was looking at him. He lowered his voice and said, Get the fighter squadron to take off immediately! I want you to give me a definite answer within ten minutes! GO!</br>
</br>
</br>
Just then, he heard a charming female voice not far from him. He saw a lady in an evening gown, with a goblet in her hand, that was walking towards him in elegant steps.</br>
</br>
Dear Mr. President, may I ask what happened?</br>
</br>
Everything is normal, dear Christina, its just that there was a small problem on USS Rhino, but it has now been resolved. You know, thats my electoral district President Sean cleared his throat and politely explained to the lady in front of him while he edited a text message through the smart chip to his military advisor.</br>
</br>
There was a problem with the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center, and it was not a small problem.</br>
</br>
The White House had enough problems to deal with. If these people learned that the Army once again failed to execute, the congress members that finally gave support to his revival plan would likely turn back to isolationism. No matter what happened outside, he had to control the information.</br>
</br>
It was the duty of a president to immerse most people in the happiness of limited right to know!</br>
</br>
The banquet continued, and the guests drank the delicious champagne as if nothing happened. On the deck of USS Obama, a Wings of Freedom took off and galloped towards Nevada, hundreds of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
However, no one noticed that there was an inconspicuous supporting actor that went missing in this banquet.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping followed those special forces and ran quickly across the empty corridor. He looked nervously behind him and only after he confirmed that no one was following him did his unrested heart finally stop beating so furiously.</br>
</br>
By the way, are you really a scientific research station?</br>
</br>
Adhesive thermite was placed on the closed hatch, and the man in digital camouflage turned his head and grinned.</br>
</br>
What do you think?</br>
</br>
NOPE!</br>
</br>
Although Zhou Guoping had the answer in his mind, he kept it to himself.</br>
</br>
The blinding white light flickered, and in a series of electric sparks, the closed hatch fell backward.</br>
</br>
Soon, Zhou Guopings slightly dilated pupils reflected the blue ocean.</br>
</br>
Just then, a shout suddenly came from behind him.</br>
</br>
STOP! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING</br>
</br>
Before the second half of the sentence was finished, blood mist appeared over the sailors head and he fell backward onto the ground. The gunshots definitely had alerted the soldiers on USS Obama, but since they were already here, even if USN sent a division after them, it would just be a futile attempt.</br>
</br>
JUMP, HURRY!</br>
</br>
While Captain Wang put his still smoking gun away, he didnt give Zhou Guoping time to prepare at all. When he said this, he grabbed Zhuo Guoping with his right hand, lifted him up like a little chicken, and threw him out of the ship.</br>
</br>
AHHHH!!!</br>
</br>
In Zhou Guopings desperate and terrified scream, he plunged into the sea with a plop. Before the cold water gushed into his throat, a hand grabbed his clothes and stuffed him into the buffer cabin of a circular submersible.</br>
</br>
Just when he was about to suffocate, the surface of the water finally fell below his nose.</br>
</br>
As he sat on the ground panting heavily, Zhou Guoping took a look around him.</br>
</br>
The arc-shaped outer wall was sturdy and reinforced with alloy, and the simple layout did not show any sophisticated equipment. This kind of circular submersible was the type connected to a submarine that could float to the surface, not the type that was connected to a ship and went underwater.</br>
</br>
Many of the special force soldiers who had previously covered his retreat stood here. Captain Wang, who threw him out of the ship just now, grinned at him while he wiped his hair with a towel. Through the window of the bulkhead, Zhou Guoping saw the bottom of the ship that sailed away.</br>
</br>
If he guessed correctly, it belonged to USS Obama.</br>
</br>
We escaped?</br>
</br>
Yes, Captain Wang threw the towel aside, Even if they can spot us, there is no means of transportation that can catch up to us. However, even if thats the case, wed better return to the Parrot as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
Why? Zhou Guoping was dazed</br>
</br>
Youll know when you go back, Captain Wang smiled mysteriously and placed the unloaded equipment on the wall. I promise you, the scene will definitely be more spectacular than any movie you have ever seen.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1418: The Ships Of USN</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Its raining harder.</br>
</br>
Yes.</br>
</br>
In the ship cabin that was converted into a banquet hall, guests in tailcoats were still holding onto their goblet full of champagne. They stood by the window while they watched the droplets of rain that started to turn bigger and faster. Weather drones cruised above the stratosphere, and weather data within hundreds of miles were monitored by the fleet.</br>
</br>
When the fleet established its path, meteorological factors were considered as the top priority, and often before the storm began to brew, the fleet would have adjusted its route to perfectly avoid the storm. For the Americans living on the deck, sunny or rainy weather was all controllable.</br>
</br>
Even in the worst-case scenario that they accidentally encountered extreme weather such as storms, the weather would not even pose a threat. All the ships were firmly joined together by steel cantilevers as thick as elephant trunks. The connected fleet was like a city that floated on the water. A wave as tall as a few meters did not even cause the slightest turbulence.</br>
</br>
The occasional heavy rain like this was a rare scene of beauty.</br>
</br>
Not far away, several water storage cargo ships had opened their tarps to collect water. Residents living on the different cargo ships also rushed out onto the deck with their colorful plastic buckets as they eagerly waited for the rain to come.</br>
</br>
The rain was getting heavier, and the mung bean-sized drips turned into soybean-sized droplets. People no longer felt the gentleness of the water when the droplets splashed onto their faces. The people on the deck looked at the sky turning dark and finally realized something was wrong.</br>
</br>
On USS Jupiter Destroyer, in the radar room of the meteorological monitoring center, the staff quickly moved between desks. Several technicians in suits stood in front of the holographic meteorological cloud map with serious frowns as they pointed at each of the parameters.</br>
</br>
A lot of cumulonimbus clouds have gathered in the sky, and the wind speed skyrocketed by three levels Damn it, what is going on?</br>
</br>
Wrong weather data? Keynes frowned. Or the weather drone is malfunctioning.</br>
</br>
After working at the monitoring center on the Jupiter destroyer for so many years, it was the first time he had seen such a strange occurrence. It was the tenth time he verified the data in his hand, but regardless of the number of times he looked, the conclusion he could make was sunny.</br>
</br>
No! Bertram, next to him, shook his head. The data cant be more normal! This is the strangest thing. The parameters are accurate, but the final result is the complete opposite of what we see now! There must be something wrong, as if</br>
</br>
Halfway through his sentence, he suddenly stopped talking.</br>
</br>
That expression on his face was as if he was shocked by his own intuition.</br>
</br>
As if? Keynes asked with a frown.</br>
</br>
After Bertram hesitated for a moment, he finally finished his speculation.</br>
</br>
</br>
Its as if someone tampered with our weather</br>
</br>
Bertrams guess was correct. Someone did indeed tamper with their weather.</br>
</br>
To put it more accurately, NAC just returned what they originally planned to do to the West Coast intact.</br>
</br>
The meteorological monitoring center aboard USS Jupiter Destroyer reported the news to the Department of Defense on USS Obama. When the center was urgently requesting verification, the roaring wind finally revealed its hidden fang under the rumbling waves.</br>
</br>
The raindrops were getting bigger and bigger, and the raging wind, like blades, made people on the deck unable to open their eyes. The plastic buckets filled with water were blown away. The main axis on the water storage cargo ship spread out tarp was directly snapped in half and like a broken umbrella, it drooped backward.</br>
</br>
The raging storm gathered above and condensed the cumulonimbus cloud into endless dark cyclones. The entire sky was shrouded in the roar of the storm, and the people who succumbed to reality finally began to tremble.</br>
</br>
God, this wind is too strong!</br>
</br>
Fu*k, what are the guys on the boat thinking! Are they trying to go into the eye of the storm?!</br>
</br>
We are heading towards the eye of the storm!</br>
</br>
Enough, stop it!</br>
</br>
While they watched the situation on the fleet not far away, as well as heavy dark clouds, the distinguished guests in the banquet hall finally stopped their delightful sightseeing and let out cries of horror. Some people screamed and asked why they didnt change their course. Some people knelt and prayed, begging God to spare them.</br>
</br>
But obviously, God could not hear their prayers.</br>
</br>
Even if he could hear it, it was futile.</br>
</br>
Because it was not God who sealed their fate, but Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The huge waves tens of meters high far surpassed the highest point of the aircraft carrier. Even the most majestic USS Obama Aircraft Carrier was nothing but a small boat in front of the crashing waves.</br>
</br>
The broad bow completely left the water, then along with the turbulence of the waves, crushed down into the ocean, and it didnt take long before it was sent into the air again. The entire aircraft carrier was like a roller coaster pushed up to the highest point by the roaring sea, then sent down by the surging waves.</br>
</br>
The crew on the deck was thrown out and fell into the ocean and disappeared. The ones hiding in the cabin were not much better. Along with the waves, they were thrown into the ceiling along with other debris and items, then they were smashed down again by gravity.</br>
</br>
The two helicopters parked on the tarmac suffered the most unfortunate fate. They didnt even get to the takeoff before they were engulfed by a wave.</br>
</br>
As for the fleet behind the aircraft carrier, it was even worse.</br>
</br>
The cargo ships connected by the mechanical cantilevers in usual situations were used to stabilize the entire structure.</br>
</br>
However, it was obviously not the usual situation right now. A category six hurricane just rampaged across the entire fleet; the rivets were popped out like cannonballs; the broken mechanical cantilevers and the damaged cargo ships were scooped up into the air, then tossed out, and created more rubbish on the ocean surface</br>
</br>
Whats going on! Its impossible! How did they know we are here Wait, isnt the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center under the control of McCarthy? Seans fingers clenched onto the railing beside him and a safety belt was wrapped around him. His eyes were bloodshot.</br>
</br>
Right in front of the window was Rhino, his constituency.</br>
</br>
And now, he just watched that luxury cruise ship, together with the other ships in the fleet, get swallowed up by the raging hurricane</br>
</br>
Mr. President, we should go. The soldier in power armor stumbled through the office door, looked at Mr. President barely hanging on, and hurriedly said, There is a major failure in the power system of the USS Obama. The minister asked me to inform you to evacuate right away</br>
</br>
Evacuate? YOU FU*KING TELL ME WHERE ELSE I CAN GO!</br>
</br>
Sean roared at this special force commander with his eyes completely red.</br>
</br>
Any ship was equipped with a submersible, which could be used to escape to the bottom of the sea in the event of an accident, and USS Obama was no exception. As the President of the United States, Sean certainly was aware of this. But even so, he didnt plan to leave.</br>
</br>
Although he couldnt believe what was happening before him, he actually realized what happened. The reason why this hurricane appeared here was most likely the result of NAC taking control of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center.</br>
</br>
Colonel McCarthy and the Fourth Marine Brigade he led had likely suffered an ill fate.</br>
</br>
The raging storm blew away the last breath of the United States. Even if he survived, what was the point? He lost the aircraft carrier, the destroyer, with only a concentration camp in Panama left, he could barely form half a brigade of soldiers.</br>
</br>
Even if he escaped from here, the fate destined for him would not change</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The USS Obama sank.</br>
</br>
The spherical submersible that followed the undulating waves observed its last moment before the USN fleet was swallowed by the hurricane with its wide-angle camera dozens of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Unlike the previous two unlucky destroyers, as the flagship, the USS Obama persisted until the end. At least that was the case until a cargo ship was swept up by the hurricane, then smashed onto its deck before its luck finally ran out and sunk to the bottom of the sea.</br>
</br>
Inside Parrot cabin, Zhuo Guoping held onto the cup of hot water handed to him by the captain as he stared blankly at the scene from the camera.</br>
</br>
It took him a while to recover from his astonishment.</br>
</br>
This is</br>
</br>
Your Generals new toy. It seems to be called a weather weapon, Captain Wang walked to Zhou Guopings side with a glass of boiling water, then looked at the chaotic sea surface. He said, Annihilating an entire fleet is too awesome.</br>
</br>
Whatever, we are the ones that tracked the coordinates of this fleet. The pilot in the control room pursed his lips while he commented disapprovingly. If they got their fighters to direct the weather strike, they might not even touch the fleet.</br>
</br>
Its okay, lets not be bitter, the Captain of Parrot patted the pilots back, chuckled, then looked to Zhuo Guoping, Your General came to North America for you. If I were you, I would think of what Id say to him when I see him.</br>
</br>
Can you let me disembark in Wanghai? Zhou Guoping smiled wryly.</br>
</br>
Of course not, the captain said as he shook his head, If we dropped you off at Wanghai, who would pay us?</br>
</br>
Pay? Zhou Guoping was taken aback.</br>
</br>
Haha, thats right, 100,000 credits! The captain patted his shoulder with the same bright smile, Dont look so sad! If I were you, I would be so happy. After all, if I was caught by pirates, my boss would definitely not spend so much money to get me back!</br>
</br>
When the weather strike began, the war was over.</br>
</br>
After the fourteen F-79s bypassed the air defense positions on the West Coast, they arrived too late over Nevada. They circled the entrance of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center for a long time but could not do anything against the barren hills and empty base; they had to return to Panama.</br>
</br>
After the USS Obama had sunk, the USNs dream of reviving the United States had completely evaporated over the ocean.</br>
</br>
After the weather strike was terminated, Lilith, in accordance with Jiang Chens instructions, easily modified the weather guidance program of the weather weapon. She changed the heavy snow that should have fallen in the eastern part of Pan-Asia to the Mediterranean Sea on the other end of Eurasia.</br>
</br>
From the beginning of this year, European survivors would definitely enjoy a unique Christmas.</br>
</br>
In the colonys conference room, Jiang Chen ended the meeting with the Minuteman and the National Guard representative. The three parties discussed matters related to the maintenance of the weather weapon in the future and finally decided that the three parties would jointly station troops at the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, because NAC accounted for the bulk of the energy expenditure in climate guidance projects, it had stationed the greatest number of soldiers at the center. In addition, the task of maintaining the weather weapon also fell onto NAC.</br>
</br>
For other survivor forces, the expenditure of a large quantum computer was definitely a burden they wished to avoid, but for NAC, it was the complete opposite. This meant that Jiang Chen could send a scientific research team to research the weather weapon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was still very interested in this dark technology that could kill with the power of nature.</br>
</br>
If he could, he would like to build one in the modern world too.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen returned to the Governors Office, he saw Zhou Guoping who had been personally accompanied by the Captain of the Parrot.</br>
</br>
As soon as their eyes crossed, Zhou Guoping looked at the mischievously smiling Jiang Chen, then he smiled with wryness, lowered his head, and said.</br>
</br>
Sorry, I messed up.</br>
</br>
You really messed up a lot of things, Jiang Chen laughed, paused for a moment, and then continued, But in the end, it was the chip in your head that sank the USN fleet. Ill give the credit to you.</br>
</br>
Thanks General Zhou Guoping said gratefully.</br>
</br>
Dont thank me, Jiang Chen waved his hand. Ive seen the financial report you left when you governed the colony. Generally speaking, although you didnt make a big contribution during this period, you did a lot of hard work. I cant blame you for this one. If you are blamed for this, it doesnt seem right.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping had only a hundred people in his hands at the time, and the fact that they could not win against USN was really not because of his incompetence. In that situation, it was unlikely anyone else could do better than him. To say that the only thing he did not do well was that he did not report the nuclear weapons immediately after they were discovered. However, that was human nature. Since the information had great uncertainty, he had to verify first before he could report it up. After all, the position of the governor possessed high decision-making power, which was different than a soldier that had to report all incidents.</br>
</br>
The governor of a colony was a drudgery not many people took up. If he was punished too harshly for this incident, the negative impact would definitely outweigh the positive impact. After some consideration, Jiang Chen decided to be on the more lenient side.</br>
</br>
Although rationally, youre not really at fault and even gained a bit of merit in the end, it cant be justified if I dont punish you for getting into such a mess. So, I will fine you half a years salary, and youll be put on probation for a year. Are you satisfied with this result?</br>
</br>
After Zhou Guoping heard his punishment, the big rock that was pressed onto his chest finally disappeared. He looked gratefully at Jiang Chen and was about to express his thankfulness. However, Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped him.</br>
</br>
Dont thank me. Im punishing you, why are you thanking me? You think I punished you too lightly?</br>
</br>
After being glared at by the General, Zhou Guoping scratched his head with an awkward smile and quickly responded.</br>
</br>
Youre right General.</br>
</br>
You are under probation now, so behave well. Jiang Chen laughed at the Zhou Guoping with his typical attempt-to-flatter expression, then said, If you do well, just continue to sit in this position. If you dont get results, then go back to Wanghai for retirement.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen spoke, he got up and patted the back of the chair.</br>
</br>
Okay, I wont stay here any longer. This chair belongs to you, so naturally, you should sit on it.</br>
</br>
Not at all! Zhou Guoping chuckled and habitually attempted to flatter Jiang Chen again, After all, you lent me this chair, you can sit as long as you want. Ill just stand!</br>
</br>
Thats enough, dont try to butter me up all day long, Jiang Chen jokingly scolded Zhou Guoping, I dont want to see flattery, I want to see your achievements. I still have something to do, so I wont keep chatting with you.</br>
</br>
He had to admit that this guy was really good at flattering.</br>
</br>
At least it made him feel good, and he didnt feel repulsed by it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted this guy on the shoulder and left the office under Zhou Guopings surprised and touched gaze. He then headed to the command post.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1420: Expedition: Panama</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not have time to chat with Zhuo Guoping. There was still a lot of things he had to review.</br>
</br>
After the USS Obama sunk, the radio communication between Pan-Asia and the West Coast of North America had returned to normal.</br>
</br>
After he arrived in the command post, he immediately held a combat meeting. All officers above the rank of the expeditionary battalion commander appeared in the meeting room. Even Han Junhua, who was far away at the General Staff Headquarters, attended the meeting through holographic imaging.</br>
</br>
Based on the intelligence that Governor Zhou brought back, our people were sent to Panama as slaves. Although our enemies have been destroyed by the weather weapon, our compatriots are still waiting for us to take them home! Jiang Chens right hand clenched into a tight fist as he smashed down hard against the table. In an authoritative and fierce voice, he ordered, Li Wang, on my order.</br>
</br>
YES, GENERAL! Li Wang stood up; his eyes gazed straight forward.</br>
</br>
Bring our compatriots home with two thousand expeditionary troops!</br>
</br>
ROGER!</br>
</br>
A sonorous and powerful answer responded to Jiang Chens call.</br>
</br>
Lu Hai.</br>
</br>
YES, GENERAL! A burly man stood up straight.</br>
</br>
The Third Battalion of the Hunter Corps to set off immediately to assist Captain Li to complete the mission!</br>
</br>
ROGER!</br>
</br>
You have to formulate the specific military operation plan, I will not interfere, Jiang Chen looked around the officers present, then continued. Ill only provide you with the direction, you can follow this direction to create the plan.</br>
</br>
The commander of the Expeditionary Force, Li Wang, stood up first to express his thoughts. He said respectfully.</br>
</br>
General, please give us your command.</br>
</br>
Infiltrate from the inside and then destroy from the outside. The execution must be fast! And it must be steady! Jiang Chen stared at Li Wang, then looked at the holographic image of Han Junhua next to him, We must ensure that our colonists can return home safely.</br>
</br>
The meeting lasted for the entire afternoon.</br>
</br>
With the help of Han Junhua, every small detail of the military operation plan was carefully drafted. Everything was done to achieve one purpose, that was, the key objective Jiang Chen stated at the start of the meeting  bring back every detained NAC citizen from the USN concentration camp.</br>
</br>
Early the next morning, Li Wang bid farewell to Jiang Chen with two thousand soldiers, then boarded the AS Order.</br>
</br>
In the next two days, AS Order would head south along the California peninsula towards Panama. This time Jiang Chen did not make the trip, but instead delegated the task of rescuing the captured colonists to Li Wang.</br>
</br>
From the intelligence given by Zhou Guoping, only a small number of USN soldiers were stationed in Panama. Although the force had been expanded several times, the size was less than a brigade, and many of the soldiers were new recruits.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the laboratory, Lilith used a cutter and fumbled with the wreckage of F-79.</br>
</br>
When the weather strike arrived, many F-79s that did not have time to take off were all parked in the hangar. And these wreckages in front of Lilith were all salvaged by Beluga Station from the waters where USS Obama sunk.</br>
</br>
Of course, for NAC, this salvage service was not free.</br>
</br>
These piles of scrap copper and iron costed Jiang Chen 10,000 credits.</br>
</br>
However, it was worth the price. The precious pre-war technology was priceless to NAC, or at least for Celestial Trade in the other world. Besides, for NAC, these credits were merely just a dozen boxes of canned food.</br>
</br>
There were still many treasures left on the bottom of the ocean floor that Beluga Station was still salvaging. As to what could be salvaged, he was looking forward to finding out.</br>
</br>
But now, NACs scientific research mission was clear. Jiang Chen gave orders to Fallout Shelter 027 in Wanghai and the field researchers who had arrived in North America with the Expeditionary Force. They had to crack the technology in NS-90 and F-79.</br>
</br>
The NS-90 project was carried out in an orderly manner. With the help of employees from the Masonte Military Industry Group in Fallout Shelter U17, NACs fighter research and development capabilities took a giant leap forward. On the F-79 side, with Liliths help, things were progressing smoothly.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen, a boss who had no knowledge in this field, all he could do now was waiting.</br>
</br>
There is nothing wrong with the AI. The design of the sensor system and processor chip are somewhat interesting. Lilith nodded thoughtfully while she fiddled with the parts spread out on the table, Wait until I have completely understood the technology. I plan to upgrade the parts on my body.</br>
</br>
These things have value to you? Jiang Chen glanced at the pile of parts unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
Of course, Lilith said without hesitation, In terms of programming, I am omnipotent, but in terms of hardware, my knowledge depends entirely on your research. This is the first time I have seen this design, so there is a lot of value. Lets not talk about this anymore, when do you plan to return to that world?</br>
</br>
You want to go back?</br>
</br>
A little bit. Lilith nodded.</br>
</br>
For an AI whose virtual world was larger than the real world, the apocalypse without the Internet was equivalent to a barren desert. Since she learned from Jiang Chen about that world, she had long yearned for it.</br>
</br>
Of course, he didnt rule out the possibility that she just wanted to go back for another raid</br>
</br>
Wait until the matter here is finished, Jiang Chen patted her head, and said with a smile, If you want to go back soon, finish this quickly. When your work is done, I will send you back first.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen did make a promise, this kind of incentive measure didnt seem effective for an AI. She had used 100% efficiency from the very start, so the expressionless face and the movement of the cutter in her hand still looked the same.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not stay here to disturb her work. He headed to the port.</br>
</br>
Just now, the cargo ship at the Beluga Station dragged a batch of cargo back from the sea where the USS Obama sank.</br>
</br>
And this shipment was a bit unique.</br>
</br>
It was not something worthy of recycling but living people.</br>
</br>
Fifty credits per person! I cant go lower, or we will lose money. When the owner of the cargo ship saw that NAC was not interested in the shipwreck survivors they scooped up, he started to feel anxious as he desperately tried to explain to the staff at the port, Think about it. Those who can get on the submersible must have a good status on the aircraft carrier! They are either scientists, officers, or politicians. You must be able to get some information out of them</br>
</br>
Scientist? In that case, how many scientists do you think can get on the submersible and escape in that situation? Dont try to fool us. The person in charge of accepting the cargo said with a smile, Not to mention that the war is over. What use is this group of prisoners to us? Either you keep them yourself, or you sell them to us for ten credits per person, and we can keep them as slaves.</br>
</br>
While the captain of Beluga Station argued, Jiang Chen, who received the call, had already arrived at the port.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to ask someone in charge what was going on, he saw an interesting figure among the group of prisoners, and from the corner of his mouth turned up, the grin was full of mischievousness</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1421: Slave Revol</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the port area next to the Panama Canal, dozens of trucks were parked beside a row of rusty wire fences.</br>
</br>
Under the watch of armed USN soldiers, scavengers in orange prison uniforms carried plastic bags of different sizes and lined up beside the trucks. After they weighed the bags, the bundles of garbage were tossed onto the trucks, and their tasks for the day were then considered complete.</br>
</br>
Before the outbreak of the World War in 2171, the Panama Canal was a shipping hub for the entire Americas, and the cargo throughput was several times higher than any other ports. Mountains of containers were stacked here and they stored everything from the most basic iron and aluminum ore to high-end large-scale electronic equipment. As long people were willing to spend the time, they could find whatever they desired.</br>
</br>
In the second year after the Peace Treaty was signed, Panama was designated as a special zone by NATO. At the time, the Captain of the USS Obama was ordered by the NATO authorities to transfer a group of survivors from Washington, New York, Boston, and other places. This was the predecessor of the group that strived to revive the United States.</br>
</br>
Later, when the space colonization ship lifted off, the World Government announced its dissolution, the officers of the USS Obama Aircraft Carrier decided to revive the United States. The ships of the entire Panama SAR were utilized and everyone in the area moved onto the fleet. This port full of containers had become their material supply base.</br>
</br>
Of course, these Americans couldnt pick garbage themselves.</br>
</br>
Since they were reviving the United States, those Central American and South American survivors were their natural labor force. The situation got even better when Congress issued a combat order against the NAC. The three thousand Chinese colonists captured from Outpost Town and more than 30,000 West Coast residents directly expanded the workforce in Panama by ten times.</br>
</br>
In order to manage the surplus labor force, they even added half a brigade. They also promised the North American prisoners at the time that as long as they were obedient, they could redeem themselves and become a glorious overseer.</br>
</br>
After the trucks were filled, the trucks drove onto the highway and headed for the base ten kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The slaves who had previously entered the port area were herded by soldiers in chemical protective suits to undergo radiation and virus inspections. After they passed the inspections, they were each given a nutrient supply. As for the amount of fluid in the nutrient supply, it depended on the mood of these Americans.</br>
</br>
Herbert, with a rifle in front of his chest and equipped with desert-colored camouflage kinetic skeleton, couldnt help but utter his tongue while he flipped through the statistics in his hand.</br>
</br>
Seventeen tonsSh*t, these monkeys look thin, but they sure work very effectively.</br>
</br>
</br>
Why didnt those idiots in Congress do it sooner? Jeff, who was next to him, grinned and cussed out. Fu*k, if I knew they were so capable, we could definitely have gone to the other side of the Pacific Ocean to catch more slaves. I heard they have a lot of people anyway.</br>
</br>
Haha, you can apply to Congress, Herbert joked.</br>
</br>
I will once I get promoted to captainwhat is that? When he was halfway through the conversation, Jeff suddenly stopped talking and looked towards the horizon.</br>
</br>
In the distant mouth of the canal, where the sea and sky intersected, a black spot suddenly appeared in their sight.</br>
</br>
Jeff took two steps forward, squinted his eyes as he tried to get a clearer view. Herbert, next to him, also noticed the situation in the distance. He frowned and touched his chest, as he tried to grab his binoculars to take a closer look. However, only then did he realize that he had not brought his binoculars with him.</br>
</br>
Old Wu, do you think our General will come and save us? Yu Buwei lifted his shirt up to wipe the sweat from his face, as a trace of sadness appeared in his brows.</br>
</br>
Americans were giving them less and less nutrient supply. From the beginning, they were barely full, but now, they were only half full most of the time. With 500 kilograms to complete in the afternoon, he didnt know how long he could survive if the situation continued.</br>
</br>
Do you need to ask that question? The man called Old Wu replied without hesitation. He looked to the few USN soldiers scattered around the empty ground with hatred in his eyes, but as well as a stubborn pride. When did our General accept losses? Not to mention in the hands of white foreigners.</br>
</br>
Wang Fucheng inserted the empty tube of the nutrient supply on the ground. As if he was holding a dagger, he grasped the tube tightly and seemed to be deep in thought. Unlike these colonists, he was a soldier in the colony.</br>
</br>
Had it not been for the fact that the bullet, which penetrated the kinetic skeleton, got stuck in his ribs, he would have died in Outpost Town. The reason why he survived was all because of luck.</br>
</br>
He had been thinking of revenging his dead comrades every single second. He thought about revolting with the Chinese survivors in Panama, but these Americans were well equipped. Last time, someone started a riot in the concentration camp, but before the riot spread, he was killed by a patrolling drone.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he suddenly noticed the black spot that loomed on the horizon.</br>
</br>
His brows furrowed slightly, and when he wanted to look more closely, his pupils suddenly dilated, and there was a hint of ecstasy.</br>
</br>
A name suddenly came to his mind.</br>
</br>
NAC Expeditionary Force!</br>
</br>
The black spot was gradually approaching them, but for the people in the port area, it still looked blurry because of the distance.</br>
</br>
The slaves that sat in the corner, biting on the nutrient supply also began to notice the situation on the horizon. They stretched their necks forward and looked to the horizon. They wanted to stand up, but because of the guns pointed at them, they were forced to remain seated.</br>
</br>
Sh*t, whats the matter with that thing! Jeff cursed out, turned around anxiously, and looked to Herbert, We must report the situation to the base.</br>
</br>
Calm down, my friend, Herbert tried to reassure him, If something really happened, the people at the base must already know. Dont forget, the radar can see farther than our eyes!</br>
</br>
Well, that does make sense the person over there, what are you doing!</br>
</br>
Without any warning, a Chinese slave who had been squatting on the ground suddenly got up.</br>
</br>
Taking advantage of the fact that the USN soldier next to him was distracted by the black dot on the horizon, Wang Fucheng hooked the soldiers neck with one hand, and with his other hand, he grabbed the dagger on his shoulder and stabbed down.</br>
</br>
AHHHHHHH!</br>
</br>
The sound of the gushing blood drowned the tragic howl, and Wang Fucheng successfully snatched the rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
When Jeff saw the death of his comrade, he immediately grabbed his rifle and fired at the rebelling slave. But he didnt manage to hit Wang Fucheng, instead, he killed and injured the slave next to Wang Fucheng.</br>
</br>
When the slaves on the ground saw the murder take place. Some stood up and fled, some brave ones grabbed weapons from the soldiers hands. There were not only Chinese survivors that joined the riot, but also South American survivors.</br>
</br>
Wang Fucheng hid behind cover, fired a few shots at the USN soldiers. When the situation turned more chaotic, he roared at the top of his lung in his broken English to the slaves.</br>
</br>
Chinese Brothers! Comrades from South America! All the enslaved people! The NAC Expeditionary Force is here, and within half an hour, these fools will be crushed by the soles of our power armors! Before being rescued, we must stand up and show our General that we still have the courage worthy to be saved!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The angry shout reverberated in the empty square, and more gunshots responded to his call.</br>
</br>
Several slaves were shot and collapsed in a pool of blood. However, more slaves rose up. They picked up bricks and steel pipes and rushed to the soldier closest to them.</br>
</br>
FOR FREEDOM!</br>
</br>
FIGHT!</br>
</br>
AHAHAHAHA!</br>
</br>
The riot began.</br>
</br>
The slave who took the rifle from the USN soldier followed Wang Fuchengs example and hid behind cover while he returned fire at the remaining USN soldiers.</br>
</br>
In a position slightly further away, Jeff pressed down his trigger and fired into the crowd. Many people fell but even more people rushed forward.</br>
</br>
After his thirty rounds of bullets were emptied, he hurriedly reached for the magazine on his waist. Just as he was about to finish the reload, the slaves with their bricks and bars already got close to him. Even with the kinetic skeletons ability to defeat ten people at once, the sheer number of slaves simply overwhelmed him.</br>
</br>
He sent a few blows with his gunstock, and blood splattered everywhere. At least five slaves heads were smashed open, but his neck was quickly strangled from behind. Just as he was struggling to break free, a South American with a black face screamed and smashed a pipe down on his head.</br>
</br>
The steel bar was bent, and the eyepiece on his helmet shattered.</br>
</br>
In his agonized scream, his forehead was directly whipped by a steel bar, and he collapsed right into the arms of the person behind him.</br>
</br>
Before he lost consciousness, he saw with the last light that Herbert, who stood a little further away, was rushing to rescue him. However, before he made it halfway, several bullets hit him in the chest. The final shot hit him directly in the skull and downed him.</br>
</br>
Not far away, a soldier climbed onto the SUV and desperately reached for the heavy machine gun on the roof. However, as soon as his hand touched the handle, his heel was grabbed by a few muscular guys, and he was beaten down.</br>
</br>
The roars of shouting and killing resounded at the entrance of the port area, and the scene was chaotic.</br>
</br>
Five hundred slaves rioted, at least fifty people were killed on the spot, and there were countless people wounded</br>
</br>
The slaves paid a heavy price, but they achieved an incredible victory.</br>
</br>
Under the leadership of Wang Fucheng, twelve USN soldiers were killed on the spot. The soldier with the rank of captain engraved on his arm was pierced through the chest by the angry survivors and hung at the entrance of the port area.</br>
</br>
Amidst the cheers of victory, Airship Order arrived slowly from the horizon.</br>
</br>
When the Chinese survivors saw the flag on the airship clearly, they burst into enthusiastic cheers, took off their shirts, and waved them above their heads like flags. Those South American survivors instead looked at AS Order with a hint of fear.</br>
</br>
It was the first time they saw a steel airship that could float in the sky.</br>
</br>
</br>
The muzzle in his hand slowly lowered, and Wang Fucheng stepped on Jeffs chest with one foot and looked up at the towering steel airship with reverence. As he watched the platform that was slowly descending, as well as the Tiger II parked on the platform, he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Expeditionary Army! I was right, its our Expeditionary Army! Our General did not abandon us!</br>
</br>
When slaves rioted at the entrance of the port area, USNs concentration camp in Panama was also in a serious crisis.</br>
</br>
The hunters who infiltrated the concentration camp paralyzed the base radar station and immediately split into two groups. One group went to the airport, and the other group infiltrated the concentration camp next to the military base, successfully inciting the Chinese survivors to uprise.</br>
</br>
A rifle and a bundle of magazines were delivered to every survivor who was determined to resist. When the USN logistics were distributing nutrient supply to the slaves in the concentration camp, the hunters lurking inside found the perfect opportunity.</br>
</br>
The explosives buried at the door blew up the logistics company truck. The soldiers on the sentry tower were just accessing the situation before a few bullets hit them in the chest and knocked them down from the tower.</br>
</br>
Immediately, gunshots resounded throughout the camp.</br>
</br>
The revolt quickly spread from a few rooms in the corner of the concentration camp to the majority of the military base.</br>
</br>
In order to suppress these insurgents, the commander of the base had to isolate the entire south side of the base and dispatched the power armor company and even armored vehicles to the base. However, what surprised all the USN soldiers was that the insurgents not only had light weapons such as rifles and pistols, but they even had weapons like rocket launchers and grenade launchers.</br>
</br>
Explosions flickered in every corner of the base. Although these well-trained soldiers had the upper hand in tactics and equipment, the gap in numbers between the two sides directly wiped out the advantage.</br>
</br>
A flying rocket directly hit the power module, and the armored vehicle that was blocking the intersection and unleashing its fearsome firepower was instantly turned into a ball of burning scrap iron. The soldiers who were crouching around ran in different directions desperately, and it didnt take long for the nuclear fusion core of the vehicle to explode, and the shock wave of the explosion almost destroyed the concrete tower next to it.</br>
</br>
FU*K, WHERE DID THESE MONKEYS GET WEAPONS?!</br>
</br>
Captain Nance pulled down the trigger desperately, then he freed his left hand and gestured to his comrades behind him to flank from the side. However, at this moment, he suddenly felt that a black figure had overshadowed the entire area.</br>
</br>
He raised his head subconsciously, and when he saw the towering steel airship, he was completely stunned.</br>
</br>
Countless vortex engines lit up the sky with eerie blue light, and the immeasurable amount of deadly power armors descended towards the USN military base like droplets of rain.</br>
</br>
All the anti-aircraft guns were pointed towards the sky, as they vented fierce firepower at the huge monster that suddenly emerged from the clouds. The orange bullets weaved into a sparse ammunition net in the air, but they could only create countless milky ripples on the expanded nitrogen shield in vain.</br>
</br>
The rifle in Captain Nances hand was slowly lowered, along with his last bit of courage to resist.</br>
</br>
The explosion from all directions almost turned him deaf. As he stared up at the sky decorated by weapons, his chapped lips opened and closed as he murmured the same sentence repeatedly.</br>
</br>
This is impossible</br>
</br>
This is impossible!</br>
</br>
It was the voice in the head of every USN soldier who was still resisting.</br>
</br>
Although the news of the USS Obama sinking reached here as early as two days ago, it was strictly controlled in the headquarters by the senior military officers of the base. They couldnt believe this airship was able to breakthrough F-79s pursuit and flew all the way here from California</br>
</br>
This must a dream!</br>
</br>
A nightmare!</br>
</br>
It didnt take long for the air defense firepower to be shut down by the hunters who infiltrated the military base.</br>
</br>
As for the fourteen F-79s that escaped the shipwreck, they didnt even have a chance to take off. Before the revolt began, they had been paralyzed by the hunters with the virus written by Lilith.</br>
</br>
The star-spangled flag that hung on top of the headquarters building was burning in a blazing fire.</br>
</br>
When it burned out, the NAC power armor that rushed into the command building also happened to break through USNs defenses. He raised the NAC flag on the roof.</br>
</br>
On the deck of AS Order, Li Wang looked at the military base dotted with fire from a distance, and his tense muscles relaxed. The corners of his mouth finally turned up as he revealed a triumphant smile.</br>
</br>
The flag of the NAC flew high, and the last bit of USN resistance was also extinguished.</br>
</br>
The freed slaves raised their rifle above their heads, shouted the Generals name, and celebrated this great victory</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1423: Send Them To Pick Garbage</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Originally, Sean planned to sink into the depth of the Pacific Ocean with the USS Obama, but the moment when that cargo ship was tossed against the deck of the aircraft carrier by the howling hurricane, fear ultimately prevailed.</br>
</br>
People were afraid of death after all.</br>
</br>
If he asked himself about the dream of reviving the United States, his desire for power still outweighed his pure belief.</br>
</br>
After the desperate attempt by the Presidential Guards, Sean narrowly evacuated to the bottom of the cabin. Before the USS Obama sunk, he got into the submersible and evacuated with several Congress members of the same party.</br>
</br>
Curled up in the submersible, he carefully calculated his future.</br>
</br>
Panama was definitely not a place where he could go. The USN fleet was destroyed by the weather weapons. The next stop of NAC had to be the concentration camp in Panama.</br>
</br>
Originally, he planned to go to Boston, the Sacred Place of Revolution for the Thirteen Colonies on the East Coast. He could gather like-minded allies to look for opportunities for a comeback. However, their submersible had not traveled for dozens of nautical miles before it was captured halfway by Beluga Stations submarine.</br>
</br>
There was not much to say about what happened next.</br>
</br>
It didnt take long for him to be sent to Outpost Town by a Beluga Station cargo ship, together with other captives rescued along the way.</br>
</br>
Sean, who stood among the prisoners of war, looked at the man in his early twenties as his face turned into a ghostly white. He felt a chill down his spine.</br>
</br>
Although it was the first time he saw the fabled NAC General, he had long heard of his tales. Until two days ago, he was still dismissive of these rumors as he thought the so-called General was just a wannabe of the old world.</br>
</br>
As for now</br>
</br>
His insignificant conceit had long since sunk into the trenches under the Pacific Ocean with the USS Obama.</br>
</br>
Just as Sean looked at Jiang Chen, Jiang Chen also examined him with interest.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen retrieved the image records stored in Zhou Guopings chip. He had already met the legendary American president on the computer. To talk about the difference between the real person and the holographic image, it was that in the eyes that were avoiding his eye contact, the pride and arrogance had disappeared, only panic and fear were left behind.</br>
</br>
Mr. President?</br>
</br>
Sean swallowed down the dry lump in his throat, then tried to squeeze out a smile that was no better than crying with his tense muscles, he stuttered, No, no, not at all</br>
</br>
I heard that you are going to hang me on the mast of the USS Obama? Jiang Chen joked as he looked at the panicking Sean.</br>
</br>
He heard this sentence from Zhou Guoping in a speech to voters.</br>
</br>
Mr. President seemed to make similar rhetoric frequently. Jiang Chen just picked one and repeated it. He didnt expect to directly scare the president even more; he was even afraid to breath out loudly.</br>
</br>
</br>
Those Sean swallowed down another dry lump and started to tremble. However, he had still put on a flattering smile, Those are all misinformation, absolutely nothing like that happened Your subordinates must have heard it wrong.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at him with a mischievous smile, then finally looked at the Beluga Station captain, and pointed at the group of slaves.</br>
</br>
Give me a price for these people.</br>
</br>
Since the NAC General was negotiating, the captain was afraid to provide the previously quoted price of fifty credits per person. After he hesitated for a moment, he took a middle number and cautiously said, Thirty credits per person.</br>
</br>
Thirty credits, slightly higher than the expected price, but not much higher.</br>
</br>
Two hundred and seventy-eight people, eight thousand and one hundred credits, Jiang Chen nodded and looked at the port worker next to him. Pay him. Find a few containers for these salves. Panamas battle should be over soon. Once Li Wang brings our colonists home, well send them there.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen finished this sentence, he left the Americans with grim expressions and exited the area.</br>
</br>
An endless amount of work was waiting for them.</br>
</br>
Until death, they would work under the supervision of those who had been oppressed by them.</br>
</br>
After the USN trouble was resolved, Jiang Chen spent a rare weekend of peace in North America.</br>
</br>
Outpost Town that had restored order was like a magnet in the ruins. An endless stream of merchant fleets soon gathered here again. When they saw the familiar flag and the familiar goods in the warehouse, all transactions proceeded as before, as if nothing had happened to this place.</br>
</br>
During this relaxing week, Jiang Chen, at the invitation of the two leaders, Paul Revere and Brian Eddie, took the time to visit Liberty City and Steel City respectively, and received a warm welcome in both cities.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because the two sides reached an agreement on the climate issue, the attitudes of the two major West Coast native survivor forces towards Outpost Town and NAC were not as tense as they were initially. In addition to trade, the two sides had also reached agreements on issues such as the elimination of predators and the elimination of mutated human tribes.</br>
</br>
As for the specific details of these agreements, Jiang Chen left them to Zhou Guoping. After all, he was the governor of the colony and Jiang Chen had to return to Wanghai in a few days.</br>
</br>
At noon on the eighth day, the figure of AS Order appeared on the horizon of the West Coast.</br>
</br>
Two cargo ships followed far behind the steel airship, and the colonists stood on the deck, cheering or crying toward the West Coast. During this month, they suffered humiliation. Many people died in Central America, and less than half of them returned home.</br>
</br>
The suffering they experienced in the past month had finally ended.</br>
</br>
At the colonys port, Jiang Chen saw the triumphant Li Wang.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen first praised the glorious achievements of a group of soldiers in Panama, and then he stood on the lift of the port and gave a heartfelt condolences speech to the colonists who had returned home.</br>
</br>
After he finished all of these tasks, he instructed Zhou Guoping to settle these poor and unfortunate people, then returned to the colony headquarters with Li Wang and others.</br>
</br>
As for the victory celebration, the award ceremony, and the like, would be carried out at the square in Sixth Street based on tradition.</br>
</br>
In addition to our people, there are about 20,000 South American survivors. We got their help when we attacked the USN Panama base. I would like to ask your thought on how should we handle this situation? Li Wang asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The Panama base can be kept, Jiang Chen looked at the world map on the wall. Its also very important to us. Its the gateway between the West and East Coast.</br>
</br>
Our next goal is the East Coast? Li Wang asked.</br>
</br>
Lets talk about that later, we should finish whats on our plate first. Jiang Chen laughed, We havent digested the West Coast yet. If we join the fun on the East Coast, more likely than not, we will get into more troubles again.</br>
</br>
The two looked at each other and laughed together.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen glanced at the world map and said seemingly nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
After I go back, I plan to push army reform.</br>
</br>
Is it the advice of Chief of Staff Han? Li Wang carefully asked.</br>
</br>
Thats right. Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
With the expansion of territory and the increase of the population base, the NAC military government had now amassed more than 100,000 troops. The current army establishment of the NAC was no longer suitable for its size, and reform was imperative.</br>
</br>
In fact, as early as the end of last year, Han Junhua had suggested this to Jiang Chen and even designed the reform plan, but it was not implemented for various reasons.</br>
</br>
By the time he returned to Wanghai, it was time to push forward the long-delayed reform</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1424: Return Home</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the colonys port.</br>
</br>
Under the escort of two warships, ten cargo ships loaded with containers slowly approached ashore.</br>
</br>
In these containers, in addition to the canned luncheon meat, instant noodles, and compressed biscuits produced in the Garden of Edens, there were also some industrial products produced at the Sixth Street. These things would be exchanged for crystals, mutant furs, and even blondes that would be shipped back to the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
At the port, Han Yue commanded the slaves under him to unload boxes of goods from the ships.</br>
</br>
As he looked at the slaves who were busy in the port, and the newly appointed overseers that swung their whips and listened to his order, he felt surreal.</br>
</br>
How did I, a security guard from a Wanghai bank, become the NAC North America Colony Human Resource Director of Slave?</br>
</br>
Han Yue thought about it for a long time, but he couldnt come up with an answer. In the end, he attributed the answer to luck.</br>
</br>
Of all the colonists, he was the only one who escaped from the Black Skull Gang. Although he was caught by the predators of the Airport Gang, he was lucky enough to run into the General. He also happened to do well when he repaired the airport, and now that the number of slaves skyrocketed in the colony, he replaced the former director that died in the concentration camp.</br>
</br>
Just as Han Yue looked at the direction of the port in a trance, his deputy trotted over and respectfully handed a signed document to him.</br>
</br>
Director, todays loading and unloading tasks have been completed. This is the signature of the Port Affairs Office. Please review.</br>
</br>
Well, Han Yue nodded, took the document, and glanced through it, I see.</br>
</br>
Then, he handed the document to the secretary behind him, and said, Can you go to the Human Resources Department in a moment and give it to Minister Wangs secretary?</br>
</br>
Yes! The secretary nodded quickly.</br>
</br>
A days work was so simple, so simple that he couldnt believe it.</br>
</br>
In most cases, he didnt even need to go to the site in person. He could just sit in the office, drink tea, flip through the newspaper, and wait for the slaves to finish their work. He would then seal the document to the Secretarys Office of the Human Resources Department, then his work for the day was complete.</br>
</br>
And these trivial things could be done by his deputy and his secretary.</br>
</br>
Back at the office, Han Yue boiled a pot of water and threw a few tea leaves from the Garden of Eden into the kettle. As soon as he was about to open the newspaper to see what big news was happening at the Sixth Street, a phone call came.</br>
</br>
Han Yue cleared his throat then pressed the connect button.</br>
</br>
Hello?</br>
</br>
Its me, Wei!</br>
</br>
Wei! Han Yue was slightly taken aback, then he responded in joy, Zhongwei?! Why are you</br>
</br>
Oh my God, I finally found you! A relieved voice came from the other end of the phone, and then Song Zhongwei asked with concern, What happened to you? I heard something happened in the colony. Yeah, but I couldnt get through your phone. I went to the Colonial Registration Office to inquire, and those people didnt give me an answer.</br>
</br>
</br>
Dont mention it, something small happened, but fortunately, our General took care of it. Han Yue smiled bitterly. The communication in North America was only restored recently, and my EP was repaired at Chinatown yesterday. Ive been thinking about when to call you, but my mind has also been messy these days, so</br>
</br>
Its okay! Song Zhongwei laughed loudly, You still owe me one hundred and twenty credits and a meal. I will remember.</br>
</br>
Han Yue couldnt stop chuckling when he heard his friends voice.</br>
</br>
When you come to North America, I will pay you back ten times.</br>
</br>
Oh, okay, youre doing well? Song Zhongwei asked in surprise.</br>
</br>
Well, you can say that. Im now a full-time official and Im the Director of Slave of the Colony Human Resources Department, Han Yue grinned, If you come here, you can work with me. What do you think?</br>
</br>
Holy fu*k! You became a director in two months? Song Zhongwei envied, Youre too lucky.</br>
</br>
In the local administrative system of the military government, director was a senior ranking. The monthly salary of one hundred credits and the monthly special supplies were enough to envy countless others. The fact that it was the Human Resources Department made the role even more enticing, with thousands of laborers under his command, any other departments had to establish a good relationship with him.</br>
</br>
Song Zhongwei thought of this and couldnt help but be emotional.</br>
</br>
This colony was called the Land of Opportunity for a reason.</br>
</br>
Among all the rumors about the colony, Han Yues story was not the only one, and Song Zhongwei was also not the only one surprised.</br>
</br>
After the Battle of Panama, the survivors who were still alive in the concentration camp were safely returned to the fortress in Outpost Town by the Expeditionary Force. However, for the colony, the problem was far from over. Many people died in the concentration camp, which resulted in a serious shortage of administrative posts.</br>
</br>
In order to fix the paralyzed administrative system, many inexperienced people were quickly promoted.</br>
</br>
These real-life examples were precisely what made the name Land of Opportunity even more mystifying.</br>
</br>
And it was something Zhou Guoping, who made the decision, did not expect.</br>
</br>
It was not until a few months later that Zhou Guoping concluded this point in a meeting with the leaders of the department where they saw the number of immigrants that far exceeded their expectations, as well as the continuous increase in investment and trade.</br>
</br>
Of course, this was after the fact.</br>
</br>
The military camp under AS Order was just as lively as the port.</br>
</br>
Boxes of packed arms and supplies were being transported into the airship by the lift along with the Tiger IIs.</br>
</br>
The technical data of the NS-90 and F-79 had been completely analyzed. With all the glories and spoils, the Expeditionary Force was set to return tomorrow.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sent Lilith back to the modern world first, and along the way, he also copied the files to Future Militarys server. The production line could be solved with industrial-grade 3D printers. This kind of robotic soldier controlled by AI would be a deadly force in any world.</br>
</br>
As long as the shell was applied with a heat-resistant coating, the robot soldier could even be airdropped from low orbit. In some cases, they could even perform better than Celestial Trades Orbital Airborne Brigade. After all, there was no need to worry about casualties.</br>
</br>
The next morning, it was finally time to set off.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping and a group of officials, stood at the gate of the military camp as they bid farewell to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Work hard here! If anything happens next time, remember to report to the Generals Mansion immediately. Dont just think about taking everything by yourself! When did I ever treat those with merits poorly?  Without much nonsense, Jiang Chen patted Zhou Guoping on the shoulder and jokingly lectured him.</br>
</br>
Yes. Zhou Guoping nodded repeatedly.</br>
</br>
There was nothing more to instruct, and when Jiang Chen saw that it was getting late, he was ready to leave.</br>
</br>
Just then, a voice interrupted him.</br>
</br>
WAIT!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1425: Army Reform</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hey, wait! When do you plan to take this thing off of me. Jessica pointed at the collar around her neck as she rushed to the entrance of the military base and shouted to Jiang Chen inside.</br>
</br>
Jessica was stopped by the soldiers at the entrance before she even touched the gate.</br>
</br>
When she saw the countless intimidating sights, as well as the raised muzzles, the momentum she had built up instantly faded.</br>
</br>
She took a few steps back, gulped reflexively, then looked at Jiang Chen nervously.</br>
</br>
We, we agreed, when everything is over, you would let me go</br>
</br>
Oh, I almost forgot about this. Jiang Chen smiled and pressed his watch.</br>
</br>
Peng-</br>
</br>
A soft noise made Jessica jump.</br>
</br>
But it was not her head that fell on the ground, but the electronic collar that broke in two. She put her hands against her chest as she let out a few breaths of relief.</br>
</br>
This collar will be my gift to you, but dont thank me. Jiang Chen chuckled, Also, be a changed person and dont become a predator again. Ill eventually get rid of all the predators on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether she heard it or not, Jiang Chen finally bid farewell to Zhou Guoping and walked to the elevator.</br>
</br>
Because he was among the last group to board the airship, as soon as the platform ascended to the airship, the huge vortex engine began to slowly charge.</br>
</br>
In the colonists waves of goodbye, this steel airship sailed towards the distant sea horizon.</br>
</br>
Although it was more time-efficient to return by the aerospace plane, Jiang Chen chose to board the airship and attend the victory celebration in the Sixth Street Square with the soldiers of the Expeditionary Force. On the one hand, he could enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way, and on the other hand, he could take advantage of this rare free time to think about the details of the army reform.</br>
</br>
On the deck, the Guard Captain, Zheng Shanhe, walked next to Jiang Chen, touched the back of his head, then grinned at the West Coast that was slowly fading in the distance.</br>
</br>
I thought I would stay here.</br>
</br>
What? Do you want to stay here? Jiang Chen smiled, Why didnt you tell me earlier?</br>
</br>
No, no! Zheng Shanhe shook his head quickly, but immediately realized that his attitude was not right, and then changed his words, I mean, Ill not hesitate when the General asks me to go anywhere! But if I can choose, I still want to stay by your side.</br>
</br>
Its useless to stay by my side, Jiang Chen laughed, You are willing to bend your talents in this position, but Im not willing to keep all the talents as my personal guards.</br>
</br>
Not at all! General, you dont know how many people want to get in but cant get in. Zheng Shanhe laughed along.</br>
</br>
Of course, I know. Lets not talk about this, Jiang Chen paused for a moment, and then in a casual conversational tone, said, The situation in North America is different from Hongcheng and Wanghai, so our strategic focus is naturally different. The strategic focus remains in Pan-Asia, and there is no need to keep a large standing army in North America.</br>
</br>
</br>
In a colony of less than 40,000, the number of legal citizens of NAC was less than 3,000. With no plan to control the area, NAC did not need to deploy so many soldiers in North America.</br>
</br>
I see. Zheng Shanhes expression showed a hint of realization.</br>
</br>
After he heard Jiang Chen mention strategic focus, he thought about it and immediately understood.</br>
</br>
As for you, I have other arrangements for you. After a pause, Jiang Chen smiled, As for the specific arrangements, you will know when you get back.</br>
</br>
The voyage that spanned a week quickly came to an end. Time had quietly passed through October and entered the freezing November. The climate guidance function of the West Coast Meteorological Monitoring Center was still being adjusted, so the Pan-Asian winter this year was still as cold as previous years.</br>
</br>
The feather-like snow erased the boundary between the sky and ground; and connected everything into a vast expanse of whiteness.</br>
</br>
After the snow passed and the sky cleared, the white ground was as dazzling as a mirror.</br>
</br>
But even if the temperature dropped, it did not impact the survivors in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
The snowflakes fell in the air and slid down an invisible arc. The expanded Holy Shield blocked the heavy snow and the permeating cold away from Wanghai. Although it was not as warm as spring, at least it was much better compared to the frigidness of previous winters.</br>
</br>
As AS Order approached, the Holy Shield slowly opened a circular passage to welcome the return of the heroes.</br>
</br>
In the Sixth Street, the Expeditionary Forces victorious return was warmly welcomed by the citizens of NAC. As in previous ceremonies, the high-spirited soldiers passed through the main road of the Sixth Street and stopped in the central square.</br>
</br>
On the podium, Jiang Chen awarded the new Knights Emblem and personally put the medal on each soldier.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street was spent in a festive atmosphere all day long.</br>
</br>
The second day after the celebration, with Jiang Chens return, the NAC military government ushered in the largest reform since its establishment.</br>
</br>
The original four corps were upgraded to four army groups. The First Army Group was commanded by Cheng Weiguo and stationed in Wanghai. The Second Army Group, headed by Wang Zhaowu, was still deployed in Hongcheng and Wu City areas to guard against the Northern Alliance Area in the northwest. The commander of the Third Army Group was Zhao Gang, stationed in Hangzhou. The commander of the Fourth Army was still Lu Fan, stationed in Shangjing and guarded the PACs northern territory.</br>
</br>
150,000 army soldiers were divided into ten divisions and each consisted of five brigades. There was no fixed number of combat units at the battalion level and above. Each battalion consisted of 360 infantries, and each company was made up of 120 combat units.</br>
</br>
In peacetime, the organization of divisions would not change. In wartime, each army group would adjust the number of brigades under its division-level combat units as needed.</br>
</br>
And the number of divisions under each army group, the number of troops, the number of armored units, and the amount of support available would be dispatched by the Wanghai General Mansion, known as NAC General Command.</br>
</br>
On the surface, ranks were promoted, the division commanders were promoted to commanders, but in fact, the power of these commanders, who had long been overstaffed, had actually been reduced.</br>
</br>
This reform had strengthened the control of the general command over the local army groups, and at the same time emphasized the role of military staff in the command system.</br>
</br>
For example, if there was a war in Shangjing, and some Russian stragglers also fled from the Siberian wasteland into NAC territory, the military staff would decide the number of divisions sent to the Fourth Army Group and the number of tanks and fighters for reinforcements. As for how the battle had to be fought, each army group had the ability to make decisions. Unless they were in an absolute advantage, the general command would no longer take over the battlefield command at will.</br>
</br>
The Hunter Corp responsible for cleaning the mutants outside the NAC was not within the scope of this reform. Special forces such as the Stalker Corps and the General Guards would not change. They would still retain their original structure and be under the direct control of the general command.</br>
</br>
Among the four army commanders, three were Jiang Chens old subordinates, one was a confidant from his guards, and with Jiang Chens prestige in the army, the reform did not encounter any resistance; the transition was unexpectedly smooth.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1426: Becoming A Chancellor Once Again</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The army reform lasted till mid-November. During this time, Jiang Chen either traveled between the Sixth Street and the Fish Bone Base every day or stayed at the Generals Mansion. When he was busy, Yao Yao even prepared a lunch box for him and sent it to the Generals Mansion.</br>
</br>
In the past two weeks or so, even Jiang Chen himself was surprised at how much work he had done.</br>
</br>
As opposed to the effort, the returns brought by the army reform were also quite astonishing.</br>
</br>
The bloated departments had been streamlined, and the communication between each army group with the General Command as the core had been greatly strengthened. The reorganized NAC Army was like a polished sword, ready to return to its former glory.</br>
</br>
The combat effectiveness could not be intuitively demonstrated for the time being, but at least in terms of military expenditure, the effect was quite evident.</br>
</br>
Based on the statistics provided by Wang Qing, the Minister of Logistics, the four major army groups after the reform had reduced their military budget by at least 13%. The newly enlisted soldiers had also been distributed to the division-level combat units, and each brigade was expanded, instead of before, where they were all waiting for order in the First Corps.</br>
</br>
In addition to the reform itself, Han Junhua, the Chief of Staff, also put forward a supporting proposal.</br>
</br>
With the expansion of the NAC territory, large-scale warfare would become less and less, while on the contrary, small-scale conflicts would intensify. Whether it was fighting against predators, mutants, cannibal tribes, there would only be many more channels for new officers to advance.</br>
</br>
And this led to another issue, that was, the requirements for the professional knowledge and skills of officers. If military merits were used as the only criterion for promotion, and the training of the officers themselves was ignored, no one could guarantee that officers competent for small-scale operations would be capable of large-scale battle. No one could ensure the promoted king of soldiers could become outstanding generals.</br>
</br>
After all, with the current development of the NAC, it was already difficult to meet a comparable opponent, and it was difficult to have conflicts that required a division of force, let alone combat at the army group scale. There were fewer and fewer opportunities to train senior officers in actual combat.</br>
</br>
As a result, it could lead to the situation that talent among the senior officers would vary wildly; some would be extraordinary, while some would be incapable.</br>
</br>
To solve this problem, Han Junhuas solution was also very simple.</br>
</br>
It was time to create a military academy!</br>
</br>
Since these officers could not be trained in actual combat, then at least they would be trained with theory!</br>
</br>
I have discussed with Chu Nan and plan to rebuild a university on the original site of Wanghai University, which will consist of five military academies and an engineering college, As Jiang Chen spoke, he pulled out a document from the drawer and threw it onto the table, then he looked at Zheng Shanhe, who stood in front of the desk, smiled, and said, From tomorrow onwards, you can go report at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
How can I teach students with my ability, Zheng Shanhe was stunned when he heard his new arrangement, and hurriedly said, I can fight no problem, but to teach</br>
</br>
Im not asking you to be a teacher, Im asking you to be the vice-chancellor. Dont worry, there are people from the theoretical school that can do the teaching. Jiang Chen waved his hand to comfort Zheng Shanhe. Your job is very simple; to focus on the ideological education of the students, as well as perform military management in the military academies.</br>
</br>
The theoretical school Jiang Chen referred to were naturally those Pan-Asia Cooperation officers and professors from military academies from before the war. It was a bit difficult to get these people to serve in the military government system, but they could certainly shine in the education system.</br>
</br>
Well, who is the chancellor? When Zheng Shanhe saw that Jiang Chen had no plans to change his mind, he smiled bitterly and accepted the arrangement.</br>
</br>
Although it was not Zheng Shanhes ambition to leave the army for education, for him as the Captain Guard, the command of the general was absolute.</br>
</br>
The chancellor? Is it necessary to ask? Jiang Chen smiled, and pointed to himself in Zheng Shanhes surprised eyes, Of course thatll be me.</br>
</br>
Since it was a crucial position, of course, he had to have firm control over it. Even if he didnt plan to do anything and would leave the work to the vice-chancellor and deans. As the General, he had to be named as the chancellor. After all, this place would become the talent training base for the NAC military government in the future, and its influence on the entire NAC system was self-evident.</br>
</br>
Even if he didnt consider any of these factors, in the future, if half of the officers in the NAC military system were his students, it would be a fact he could proudly brag about.</br>
</br>
After Zheng Shanghe learned that the chancellor was Jiang Chen, the last bit of reluctance in his mind also disappeared. He thumped his chest with his right fist and gave a military salute to Jiang Chen. He then left the office, satisfied with his arrangement.</br>
</br>
Although it was a bit regretful to leave the military system, at least he was not marginalized.</br>
</br>
From the selection of the chancellor, it was evident the emphasis the General placed on the military school. Even though the position of the vice-chancellor gave him many regrets, if he performed well in this position, there would still be plenty of opportunities for promotion.</br>
</br>
It was just that Zheng Shanhe had yet to realize how painful it would be to work for a boss that never showed up to work.</br>
</br>
After he officially took office, he would find that the so-called chancellor would just give a speech at the opening ceremony. As for how the entire school would be run, what had to be done, and how differing opinions between professors would be settled These issues that should have belonged to the chancellor would be all dumped onto the plate of the vice-chancellor.</br>
</br>
Of course, that would be another story.</br>
</br>
In the blink of an eye, its already November. Jiang Chen lied in the bed as he held onto the warmth in his arms. He looked out the window that was still murky and let out a soft sigh.</br>
</br>
It was the end of September when he came, and two months had just passed by.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who had finally got off of his busy schedule, did not feel how fast time passed.</br>
</br>
Yeah, its been so long since youve been back here, and you havent stayed at home for a few days. A few strands of her hair gently covered the flush on her cheeks, and Sun Jiao put her head against Jiang Chens chest, then bit his shoulder as she quietly complained, Youre going to leave again in a few days, right?</br>
</br>
Have I said that? Jiang Chen smiled and touched Sun Jiaos hair. Besides, Lin Lins research will soon have conclusive results. I will take you there when the time comes.</br>
</br>
What about here? Sun Jiao looked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Yeah, what about here?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was in deep thought.</br>
</br>
He had not thought about this question before.</br>
</br>
If he could take all his beloved people to another world, then would it be necessary for this world to exist? He had unearthed almost all the technology and the modern world that inherited the past of Gaia would only have more potential. Even if there were technologies yet to be discovered, it would only be a matter of time before they appeared with the support of advanced scientific theories.</br>
</br>
But it would be a pity to just let this world go</br>
</br>
You havent thought about it? Sun Jiao carefully examined Jiang Chens face, and the corners of her lips turned up.</br>
</br>
It was her favorite expression of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
From her perspective, while Jiang Chen was in deep thought, he possessed a special attraction to her.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, Jiang Chen sighed, smiled, and said, I really didnt think about it. Would you like to have an heir for me? I will pass the position of General to him?</br>
</br>
Want to make me pregnant? Sun Jiao raised her eyebrows teasingly and rubbed her finger against Jiang Chens chin, Then you have to work hard.</br>
</br>
The birds on the branches outside the window dispersed and only left the swaying branches.</br>
</br>
The gasps interrupted the soft-spoken love words, the dripping sweat, and morning dew soaked the sheets together.</br>
</br>
Maybe she was disturbed by the movements of the two. Xiaorou, who was asleep on the side, scrunched her nose and her bright red mouth opened and closed. Then, her delicate body curled up under the quilt and turned over gently.</br>
</br>
Whether it was her expression or her action, all were extremely similar to her sister.</br>
</br>
Perhaps, she was also having a beautiful dream.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1427: Edge Of The Solar System</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Good news came from the distant Kuiper belt.</br>
</br>
After more than half a year of voyage, the first Envoy-class starship from Earth  SS Origin, traveled nearly 30 astronomical units and finally arrived at the edge of the solar system-the Kuiper Belt. (There is also a hypothesis that the edge of the solar system is Otter cloud)</br>
</br>
Even for light, this span would take more than four hours to finish.</br>
</br>
The feat to pilot a million-ton starship to the Kuiper belt would definitely go down in the history of manned spaceflight and recorded in the history of earth civilization.</br>
</br>
However, after the countless firsts Celestial Trade had already achieved, these titles almost people feel numb. Unlike the astronauts and officers from all over the world, the astronauts and officers from Xin on SS Origin</br>
</br>
Well, they were actually no different than anyone else. After all, when they personally pushed forward history, even the crew from Xin was quite thrilled.</br>
</br>
The day before they arrived in the Kuiper Belt, they grabbed the champagne from the fridge, took out the roasted chicken from the oven, and held a celebration party in the cafeteria. They partied late into the night, and for the first time in a while, they did not follow the strict resting schedule on the ship.</br>
</br>
But the next day, when they got up, everyone walked to their posts even more energetically, and people did not show any sluggishness at all. No one dozed off or felt tired because they knew very well that today was an important day. Their compatriots 30 astronomical units away eagerly waited for their good news.</br>
</br>
Everyone had the same opportunity to be interviewed.</br>
</br>
Everyone hoped that they would appear in front camera as their best self.</br>
</br>
After the ship had completed the final deceleration step, SS Origin, which orbited smoothly along the edge of the Kuiper Belt, unfolded the quantum communication antenna on top, got in touch with the Aerospace Command Center in Celestial City, and presented this great moment to the media around the world.</br>
</br>
Ice, ice, and more ice! Just as we had observed, the water resources here are quite abundant! If you dont see it with your own eyes, you can never imagine that a tuft of ice that is about the size of the moon is just floating beside you! Speaking of which, Ill definitely drink the ice from the beginning of the solar system if the gamma value is okay.</br>
</br>
Not only ice but there are also a large number of asteroids. The minerality is currently unknown. Our prospecting robot has just landed on one of the asteroids. Ideally, we can use the ore here to build outposts, docks, and even fortresses! No matter where our guests are from, they have to slow down here if they dont want to miss us.</br>
</br>
Look over there! Look at where Im pointing! Well, you may not be able to see it clearly, but we will make the video public in two days. In short, just half a minute ago, our probe planted the flag of the Earth Defense Alliance on that asteroid!</br>
</br>
</br>
As the camera lens cut to a different shot, people of different nationalities, skin colors, cultures, and beliefs appeared in front of the camera one after another. They all shared the same joy and amazement at this moment in regards to the distant blue planet.</br>
</br>
All the emotions spread to every corner of the world through wireless transmission, and in the eyes of people in front of the TV, in addition to joy and amazement, there were envisioning and imaginations for the future.</br>
</br>
Once upon a time, when people heard the news of an imminent invasion of the Harmony civilization, they were so desperate. Some people even sold their cars and houses, even took out huge loans, just to purchase from different escape funds a ticket that they didnt know where it led to.</br>
</br>
The flag of the Earth Defense Alliance is swaying at the frontiers of the solar system, and the captain will make a speech to the world on behalf of the crew  Xinhua News Agency</br>
</br>
The door to a new era has been opened, and our civilization is moving towards a great era!  Moscow News</br>
</br>
The development of space technology has turned space travel from unattainable words to the norm. From the earliest space elevator to the current Envoy-class starship, our range has also expanded from the moon to Mars, and to the present-day Kuiper belt. What else can we not conquer? Human creativity is destined to stand at the top of the food chain, and one day in the future, we will also stand at the top of the ecological chain of the universe- Xin Daily</br>
</br>
These were not the sentiments shared only among the member states of the Earth Defense Alliance, the British Times even issued the term Hope for all Mankind to the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Prior to this, most Western media regarded the Earth Defense Alliance as a scourge that wanted to create another Cold War in the new century. Even if they made the occasional neutral comments, it was rare to see such explicit praises.</br>
</br>
Not only in traditional media but also on the Internet, there were overwhelming reports on SS Origin that sparked worldwide discussion. Based on Google search engine statistics, Origin and Earth Defense Alliance reached top ten in search popularity in just twenty-four hours.</br>
</br>
On the official website of Celestial Trade, the video sent back to Earth through quantum communication technology was first published on the page for SS Origin. In less than half an hour, the videos download reached more than 100,000 times and appeared on major streaming sites around the world.</br>
</br>
For example, the reuploaded video of SS Origin arriving at the Kuiper Belt, accompanied by the countless comment barrage from the audience, fully expressed the audiences enthusiasm</br>
</br>
Im impressed. I havent been impressed by anything else in my life!</br>
</br>
Mom asked me why Im typing this comment while kneeling on the ground.</br>
</br>
HOLY! CELESTIAL TRADE IS RIDICULOUS!</br>
</br>
What do you mean Celestial Trade! This time it is the Earth Defense Alliance! Every member state shares the same credit!</br>
</br>
Come on, without Celestial Trade, can they send so many people to the Kuiper Belt? Even if there are another 20 member states, I doubt theyd be able to do it. Without Celestial Trade, I dont think they can even send people to Mars!</br>
</br>
In my lifetime, the plot of the prequel to the Edge of the Galaxy has unexpectedly unfolded in front of my eyes.</br>
</br>
I want to drink the water from five billion years ago. Will I evolve and gain special abilities? For example, the force of the universe! XD</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the modern world, it was already mid-December.</br>
</br>
He spent a whole month with Sun Jiao, Yao Yao, Xiaorou, and Lin Lin. It was precisely because of this that he regrettably missed this world-renowned event, but from the newspaper kept by Ayesha, he learned that Origin successfully reached the edge of the solar system and caused a global sensation.</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen returned to this world, the UA election also entered the most intense phase.</br>
</br>
After countless TV debates and campaign speeches, two battle-tested candidates finally stood in the final arena. This election would determine the fate of the UA, and at the same time, to a certain extent, the fate of the world.</br>
</br>
Left or right? Forward or backward?</br>
</br>
The people of the UA had been thinking about these two issues for an entire year</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1428"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1428: Between The Acts</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was a sunny and lively day on the beach at northern Coro Island.</br>
</br>
It was the third week of December, and Christmas would arrive in a few days. The commercial street not far from the mansion had already set up a Christmas tree early and decorated the street with red ribbons. Girls in red cotton skirts distributed leaflets in the street to warm up the upcoming sales.</br>
</br>
New Years Day would be a few days after that. The red ribbons would then be replaced by red lanterns, the red cotton skirts would be replaced by cool cheongsams while the evergreen trees would stay there unchanged. It was a unique heritage in Xin to celebrate Christmas and New Years Day together.</br>
</br>
Because it was Sunday, neither Xia Shiyu nor Natasha had to work. Early in the morning, Jiang Chen was dragged out of the door by two energetic women as they drove to the shopping district in the city center, where they went on a shopping spree.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who was in the passenger seat, looked at the countless bags of clothes and handbags and rolled his eyes at the mirror.</br>
</br>
Why didnt you guys go buy stuff when I am away?</br>
</br>
Whats the point if youre not here? Natasha glared at Jiang Chen, then raised an eyebrow and said in a flirtatious tone, Okay, dont frown. I bought two new pieces of lingerie, Ill put it on for you when I get home.</br>
</br>
I can help you change into it, With a smirk, Jiang Chen glanced at the shirt that was fully supported by her chest.</br>
</br>
Natasha, instead of being shy, straightened her chest defiantly, Okay, you said it.</br>
</br>
AHEM!</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, with her arms folded, blushed and dry coughed loudly, then she rolled her eyes at the two. She seemed to blame the two for talking about such a shameful topic in broad daylight and it destroyed the atmosphere of a family shopping trip.</br>
</br>
As Ayesha listened to the two bicker, she smiled gently.</br>
</br>
In those days when Jiang Chen was away, the house was always quiet, whether it was dinner or nighttime, it seemed like something was missing. Although she did enjoy the quietness, deep down, she liked this atmosphere more.</br>
</br>
When they returned home carrying shopping bags of different sizes, it was already evening.</br>
</br>
Not beyond Jiang Chens expectation, Ayesha brought the most trophies home. This little one, like before, enjoyed different fashions. However, she always felt embarrassed about it when she saw something she liked. Every time Jiang Chen saw her expression, he couldnt help but pull out his credit card voluntarily.</br>
</br>
The final result was that the clothes and handbags the four people bought all afternoon almost couldnt fit in one car. On the contrary, Jiang Chen, who worked the most, bought only a belt and two pairs of leather shoes. With a small mountain-like shopping bag stack, he facepalmed hard.</br>
</br>
The good thing was that he had a successful business, otherwise, it would be difficult to afford everything</br>
</br>
</br>
On the way, Jiang Chen considered using the storage dimension more than once to solve these troubles, but with Natasha there, he had no choice but to help the girls carry the bags home.</br>
</br>
As soon as they got home, Natasha rushed into her bedroom with her shopping bags. When she went upstairs, she squeezed her eyebrows at Jiang Chen, as if she was suggesting those things that she had said in the car. Jiang Chen was really tempted to go up, but Xia Shiyu pulled him into the kitchen, so he had to give up on the idea.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu, who was wearing an apron, took out the eggs from the refrigerator, Jiang Chen glanced at her, unexpecting of this appearance.</br>
</br>
You can cook too? When did you learn?</br>
</br>
I know how to cook, okay, Xia Shiyu glared at Jiang Chen. She skillfully chopped the potatoes in her hands into fine slices, then swayed her ponytail, Its not good to always make Ayesha do the cooking. We discussed some time ago that Ayesha will cook Monday to Wednesday, Natasha will cook her Russian stew from Thursday to Friday, and I will cook on the weekends.</br>
</br>
What the h*ll is a Russian stew?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not convinced.</br>
</br>
He vaguely remembered that it seemed to be called borscht</br>
</br>
Would you like to take a shift too? Her delicate chin raised up as she pointed with her chin to the schedule posted on the refrigerator, and giggled, In fact, cooking is quite interesting.</br>
</br>
Come on, I can only cook scrambled eggs with tomatoes, you know that. Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
You havent improved at all.</br>
</br>
Haha, I have you guys, I can just eat. At that moment, Jiang Chen suddenly noticed Xia Shiyus apron, and he was quite intrigued, Huh? I remember this is Ayeshas apron?</br>
</br>
You finally realized? Xia Shiyu shook the hem of her apron, pursed her lips as she smiled, Do you think it fits me?</br>
</br>
Well, the fit is a bit off, Jiang Chen touched his chin and seriously commented, Well, the key is height. You are much taller than Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Then do you like tall or petite?</br>
</br>
This can I say I like all? Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
I knew you would say that.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu responded peevishly, then she turned around to focus on cutting vegetables.</br>
</br>
But the subtle smile hidden in the turned up corner of her mouth could not be hidden.</br>
</br>
After dinner, Jiang Chen opened a bottle of champagne, turned on the TV while he sat on the sofa.</br>
</br>
During the time he was away, this world was also in troubled times. For example, Nippon, Finland, and other countries joined the Earth Defense Alliance. The second negotiation after the civil war between North and South Colombia, and what was now being broadcasted on TV right now-</br>
</br>
The analysis by a commentator on the UA election and its ultimate impact.</br>
</br>
In the polls, we are leading for the time being, With a cup of steaming coffee, Xia Shiyu folded her arms in front of her chest, then sat next to Jiang Chen, she said, The B City Consortiums public opinion tactic has done quite well, and supporting Mr. Joseph Kennedy in many states has become politically correct.</br>
</br>
Its useless to say that, Jiang Chen shook his head, and tapped his finger on the armrest of the sofa. The UA has the Electoral College system. No matter how loud the red and blue camps on the East Coast and West Coast are, eventually its still the few swing states that determine the outcome.</br>
</br>
That was what concerned Jiang Chen the most.</br>
</br>
If Joseph Kennedy rose to power, then according to his agreement with the B City Consortium, the UA would unconditionally join the Earth Defense Alliance, and the East-West confrontation and New Cold War would be terminated before it escalated further</br>
</br>
But if Trump came to power.</br>
</br>
While how global politics would shape out was still undetermined, he was certain that the probability for a potential conflict between the UA and Celestial Trade would at least double.</br>
</br>
I also thought about this issue, Xia Shiyu nodded, but at this stage, we did all we can do, we can only wait for the results.</br>
</br>
Thats not true. Actually, we can help our allies based on the situation. As he moved his sight away from the TV, he looked to Xia Shiyu, smiled, and said, Remember those astronauts detained in our Mars Colony? Flights to and from Mars and Celestial City will be available by the end of the year, and we can let them start packing.</br>

</br>
At the cleaning warehouse of the Mars colony, .</br>
</br>
Bris pushed a cart of mops and brooms into the warehouse, signed his name hastily on the tablet terminal, and locked the movable door of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
He had been doing janitorial work for some time.</br>
</br>
It was worth mentioning that Celestial Trade did not make him do any work. He applied for these jobs on his own. After all, in this environment, work became a kind of pastime. If there was nothing to do, despite the availability of entertainment facilities in the base, it would still drive people crazy.</br>
</br>
Since he was not allowed to touch anything sensitive, then he could only work in janitorial or catering roles.</br>
</br>
After he had lived on Mars for half a year, Bris had become accustomed to the life here.</br>
</br>
To be honest, his feelings towards this colony were rather complicated.</br>
</br>
He saw with his own eyes how this colony gradually regained its advantage from the attack of the Devil Worms and how it developed and grew tenaciously under harsh conditions</br>
</br>
Admire?</br>
</br>
Maybe a bit.</br>
</br>
But Bris knew that he probably felt more awestruck.</br>
</br>
The more he learned, the more he realized how terrifying of an opponent his country faced. Even prehistoric species more than three billion years ago were not enough to defeat them. Even the barren Mars could not stop them from progressing, what else could really stop or threaten them?</br>
</br>
Bris had also paid close attention to the approaching general election.</br>
</br>
If possible, he hoped that Joseph Kennedy could win, as promised in the campaign pledge, he would push the UA to join the Earth Defense Alliance. Contrary to the views of the nationalists, he did not think it would be a compromise to the fact that the UA was losing its hegemony, but a compromise of history.</br>
</br>
After work, Bris was planning to go to the bar for a drink.</br>
</br>
Just then, the indicator light on his watch flashed.</br>
</br>
After a moment of pause, Bris took out the Bluetooth headset from his pocket and put it in his ear.</br>
</br>
Hello?</br>
</br>
Come to my office. Without any nonsense, Hong Zewei, the governor of the colony, said concisely.</br>
</br>
How is the memory extraction work going?</br>
</br>
Very smoothly, Dr. Amos smiled, We almost overcame the side-effects, and I am going to apply to return to Celestial Trade very soon.</br>
</br>
There is a flight in two days, you can hitch a ride. Hong Zewei smiled.</br>
</br>
Just now there was a knock on the door, and the two ended the topic simultaneously.</br>
</br>
Then I will go now.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, go ahead.</br>
</br>
Amos quickly picked up the documents on the desk, put them back in the sealed document bag, and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
The moveable door slid open, Bris, who was walking in, passed by Dr. Amos who was heading out.</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei looked at the UA astronaut in front of his desk with a smile, then he said.</br>
</br>
</br>
Hows it going? Are you getting used to life here after half a year?</br>
</br>
Getting used to it. Bris nodded and said helplessly, I just feel homesick.</br>
</br>
Let me tell you some good news. Probably the day after tomorrow, the flight between Celestial City and the colony will official commence. Although it is temporarily closed to the public, from the perspective of the friendship between the two countries, we have decided to let you board the ship first with your companions. You will be home soon.</br>
</br>
Bris processed the information for a moment, but quickly, an ecstatic look replaced his expression.</br>
</br>
Is it true? We can go home in two days?</br>
</br>
Of course, its true, Hong Zewei smiled, Except for the person suspected of espionage that we cant release for the time being, all of you can go home! Go back and pack your things and get ready.</br>
</br>
I have to go and tell my companions the good news immediately. Also, thank you! Bris said sincerely.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome, go now. Hong Zewei smiled.</br>
</br>
Amy Qassim was a reporter for The Washington Post.</br>
</br>
SS Origin recently arrived in the Kuiper Belt, which created an earthquake in the UA. From the financial world to ordinary citizens, everyone was discussing the impact on the UA and the future of mankind.</br>
</br>
Following the trend and at the request of the editor-in-chief, Amy was currently writing a report on Origin and Celestial Trades aerospace technology. Just as she was contemplating at the word document in front of her, someone knocked on her door.</br>
</br>
Come in.</br>
</br>
The door opened, and her immediate boss, Editor-in-Chief Wood, came in.</br>
</br>
Stop all the work at hand, I have another more important job waiting for you to deal with.</br>
</br>
I dont understand, what is more important than SS Origin? Amy leaned back against the chair, took a sip of her coffee, and then said with her arms folded in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
Of course it is the election.</br>
</br>
Oh, God, Amy sighed exaggeratedly. The entire media is covering this farce. Even if a certain candidate has a scandal with someone, we cannot attract more eyeballs with this. People are numb, why dont you think about it again</br>
</br>
The flights between Celestial City and Mars will commence by the end of the year, and the UA astronauts stranded on Mars are about to come home. The other thing is the diplomatic meeting between Joseph Kennedy and the Xin Ambassador some time ago, and there have been many private exchanges. I want you to report on these two pieces together. Wood gestured as he put his fingers together. Do you know what I mean?</br>
</br>
You mean, Amy frowned slightly, and then her eyes lit up. Credit the astronauts return home to Mr. Kennedy? Is the source reliable for the private exchange?</br>
</br>
No, no, you got it wrong. After Wood stopped Amys words, Wood stared at his top reporters eyes, smiled, and emphasized it again, Celestial Trade wants to give the credit to Joseph Kennedy, do you understand what I mean?</br>
</br>
Amy Qassim rolled her eyes and suddenly showed a look of realization, I understand what you mean.</br>
</br>
I trust you.</br>
</br>
When Wood saw his subordinate was so sensible, he did not say more and looked rather pleased. He patted her on the shoulder before he left the office.</br>
</br>
After he walked to a secluded place, Wood took a deep breath, took his phone out of his pocket, and dialed an unfamiliar number.</br>
</br>
The phone rang twice and soon someone picked up.</br>
</br>
I have finished our arrangement. The report will be written by Amy Qassim, our top reporter. I have done as you requested, do you think</br>
</br>
Dont be nervous, Mr. Wood, through the phone, the persons hoarse voice carried a hint of lightness, I promise, as long as you do what we say, no one will know about your deal with Senator Davis</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The magnificent city skyline made up of towering skyscrapers decorated the charming scenery of the East Coast. Whether it was Halloween or Christmas, whether it was sunny or snowing, the air here was always brisk. The modern girls in glamorous clothes sat inside luxury cars as they fixed their makeup. The elite white collars with their briefcases walked by hastily and always put their attention on their gold-rimmed watch. The scenes that happened here were no different than Wall Street two hundred kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Although everyone in the country was cogs in a huge machine, the people who lived and worked here enjoyed the life that ordinary citizens simply could not imagine.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was not the luxury goods they wore, but the funds that flowed through here every day. If everything was converted into dollar bills, it was enough to be spread on every tile of every building on the whole street.</br>
</br>
Unlike the world-famous Wall Street, B City Financial Street was quite low-key, just like B City itself. If it was not for the few mentions of the city in movies, books and newspapers, even the people in this country would forget that capitalism was born in this very city.</br>
</br>
Of course, these were past events.</br>
</br>
Only one of the partners who conspired in the tea-pouring incident that year remained here. Located in the most secluded corner of this financial street, a line of concise English letters was hung in the most conspicuous position of the building for every white-collar worker who aspired to look over and pay respects.</br>
</br>
First National Bank of B City, the heart of the Boston Consortium. This bank was founded in 1859, and after the merger with the Bank of Massachusetts in 1903, it was still called the First National Bank of B City. As the earliest multinational bank in the UA, its growth history, to some extent, also reflected the rise of capitalism in the country.</br>
</br>
On the highest floor of the skyscraper, in the chairmans office, the old man with glasses picked up the newspaper on the table with his old and dry fingers.</br>
</br>
The newspaper in Lokis hands was B City Financial Daily, and under the title was todays headline  SS Origin Arrived in the Kuiper Belt, About Our Future.</br>
</br>
About our future, after he paused on the first line of the article for a very long time, he suddenly raised his head, and looked to Bernie Adams sitting on the sofa across from him, he smiled, My dear friend, what do you think?</br>
</br>
My opinion is actually the same as yours, otherwise our votes in the consortium meeting would not be so unanimous. Mr. Adams smiled, took a sip from his teacup, Where did you get this tea?</br>
</br>
The new farm I bought in Ceylon. It is said to be a gift from the East India Company in the early 19th century to Her Majesty the Queen. If you like it, I can give you some. Loki responded.</br>
</br>
No, just send me some seeds.</br>
</br>
The key to growing good tea is not only the seeds of the tea, but also the techniques, climate, and even the soil, Loki said, I did this experiment a long time ago. The same batch of seeds; part of it was planted in the farm in Ceylon, and part of it was planted in the back garden of my villa in Lexington. They were drastically different from both aroma and taste.</br>
</br>
</br>
Compared to the mainstream hobbies in the upper class such as winetasting, equestrianism or golfing, Loki preferred to study tea craft and gardening. It was the one thing that his partner and friend despised the most. Adam made a helpless expression, put down the teacup in his hand, and said.</br>
</br>
Well, lets put the tea aside, you know I didnt come for this.</br>
</br>
Im as anxious as you are, but now all we can do is to wait patiently. At this juncture, any extra measures may become superfluous. We have provided the best choice to the people, and now all we can do is to wait for them to cast the correct vote.</br>
</br>
As Loki spoke, he flipped the newspaper to the next page.</br>
</br>
The article was on Origin and the prospects of the future of the space industry.</br>
</br>
He read this article for almost half an hour, not because of how profound the article was, but because he had been thinking about it recently.</br>
</br>
On the investment projects in the space sector, Celestial Trade had imposed countless barriers for European and American investors, while for the investment banks of the member states of the Earth Defense Alliance, they had loosened the policy that simply made the outsiders envious. Although European and American investors had won a lot of benefits for themselves through the WTO, compared to the few years after the space elevator was built, their market share in space development had been gradually overtaken by Xin and Xins allies.</br>
</br>
The B City Consortium had always supported the UA to join the Earth Defense Alliance, because their chips in the space sector had far exceeded those of Rockefeller and Morgan, who had successfully dominated Wall Street. On the contrary, B City Consortiums investment in the military industry had been gradually taken over by other consortia since the end of the Kennedy era.</br>
</br>
Rockefeller and Morgan needed to maintain a tense but not dangerous political environment around the world, while the B City Consortium wanted the opposite. The UA had to maintain a friendly relationship with Xin to advance its space sector. Since the legacy of the Jewish consortium was divided, the WASP consortium had fallen apart. The originally united Anglo-Saxon consortium had also already parted ways for their own interests.</br>
</br>
If I can, I really want to catch their ride. After a sigh, Loki shook his head.</br>
</br>
Just then, the phone on the desk rang.</br>
</br>
Loki put down the newspaper and picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
In an instant, the expression on his face suddenly changed.</br>
</br>
He changed the hand holding the phone, deliberated for a moment, and then said in a serious voice.</br>
</br>
I see, contact Senator Van Buren for me. Ask him to cancel all the arrangements for the afternoon and wait for me at the old place. Also, go to the Washington Post headquarters in person and talk to him about that report.</br>
</br>
What happened? Adams frowned when he noticed the expression on his friends face.</br>
</br>
There is a little problem, Loki pushed his chair and stood up, Im going to the Capital.</br>
</br>
Now? Adams was surprised.</br>
</br>
Yes, now.</br>
</br>
This is shameful cheating!</br>
</br>
Trump threw the newspaper onto the desk in a fit, and yelled, They want to use a few astronauts to buy the position of the president? NO WAY!</br>
</br>
We can make a move about this matter. Behind the sofa where Trump was sitting, a middle-aged man bowed his head as he carefully planned, For example, hyping Xins interference in the election by secretly supporting Joseph Kennedy.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open, and the assistant of the campaign team rushed in excitedly, as he held onto the newly published Washington Post in his hand.</br>
</br>
The situation has turned!</br>
</br>
What happened? Trump frowned. Didnt I say it before, dont let me see these things, what can a bunch of incompetent people write! I dont want to know how they are jealous of me</br>
</br>
No! The Washington Post didnt attack you, but you should read it yourself!</br>
</br>
While the assistant spoke, he handed the newspaper to Trump.</br>
</br>
Trump took the newspaper suspiciously, then his gaze focused on the turned page.</br>
</br>
The moment he saw this report, he was stunned.</br>
</br>
There were only two thoughts in his mind at this moment.</br>
</br>
Is the Washington Post helping him?</br>
</br>
Did the sun rise from the west?</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1432: Shooting On The Streets Of Capital</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At ten oclock in the evening, in a hotel less than one kilometer from K Street, Jacob Wood carried a briefcase, walked out of the elevator hastily, and left the elegantly renovated lobby.</br>
</br>
He looked haggard, and he had barely closed his eyes since yesterday. One call after another hit his phone, and each one of them was all from significant individuals. Out of helplessness and panic, he turned off his phone, ran away from his apartment, and hid in this hotel.</br>
</br>
He didnt understand why those people had to find him and not anyone else.</br>
</br>
His work, career, family, and personal relationships were all ruined because of that one article. There was no doubt he got caught in a political turmoil. Based on his experience, occupations such as journalists, private investigators, and hackers would not have the besting ending once they get caught in a political turmoil.</br>
</br>
He didnt understand why these people are reacting so negatively just over one article.</br>
</br>
Originally, he planned to stay here for a few more days, but after he went outside at lunch, he found that someone had been in his room, and he also found a bug on the bedside table. Obviously, he couldnt stay here any longer. He decided to go to C State to stay with his brother until the limelight passed.</br>
</br>
A Ford slowly stopped on the edge of the road.</br>
</br>
The door of the drivers seat opened, and a man in a suit with a buzz cut stepped down and walked straight to Wood.</br>
</br>
Hello, are you Mr. Jacob Wood?</br>
</br>
When Wood heard the polite question, he subconsciously wanted to answer yes, but he quickly recovered, slightly bowed down his head, and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
No, you found the wrong person.</br>
</br>
Really? The man glanced around, took out a picture from his sleeve, and glanced at Wood with a sly smile.</br>
</br>
The way that man looked at him made Wood quite uncomfortable, especially when he took out a photo to compare him. Just as Wood frowned and was about to get angry, two black men in suits stood behind him and blocked his path of escape.</br>
</br>
A drop of cold sweat dripped down from his forehead, and at the same time, a lowered voice sounded behind him.</br>
</br>
I advise you to cooperate with us, we still can discuss this.</br>
</br>
When Wood heard the crackling noise from the fist behind him, Wood nervously swallowed the dry lump in his throat.</br>
</br>
What do you want?</br>
</br>
Nothing, we just want to have a nice chat with you, the man in the suit smiled as he said, If you dont want something unpleasant to happen, then youd better follow us into the car</br>
</br>
The man did not finish his sentence when a Hummer suddenly appeared from the corner.</br>
</br>
The two fog lights were turned on, and with the deafening sound of friction, the Hummer rammed towards them.</br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, the man in the suit dove to the side, while the other two men also ran with their eyes covered. As for Jacob Wood, who they previously surrounded, he was completely disregarded.</br>
</br>
</br>
For them, it did not matter if Wood was dead or not.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was preferred to control him and have him help them in the future, but if he did die, they could also use his death to their advantage.</br>
</br>
However, the Hummer that seemed to be out of control didnt hit Wood as the man in the suit thought, but suddenly turned around and hit one of the bodyguards.</br>
</br>
With a loud thud, the two hundred pounds burly man was sent flying like a kite. He was hit by the Hummer and blood splattered all over the wall. The door slammed open, and two men with sunglasses and baseball caps quickly jumped off and dragged the frightened Wood into the car.</br>
</br>
When the other bodyguard saw the scene, he immediately took out a submachine gun from under his coat, but before he could pull the trigger, an abrupt gunshot from the distance sent a sniper bullet right into his chest and downed him.</br>
</br>
Screams soon flooded the street. When the passers-by who were going to help the car accident saw the submachine gun and heard the gunshot, they immediately screamed and fled. Some people ran and took out their phone to dial 911.</br>
</br>
Everyone looked horrified.</br>
</br>
This is the Capital!</br>
</br>
The political center of the country!</br>
</br>
Who is so out of their mind to start a gunfight here?!</br>
</br>
SH*T!</br>
</br>
The man in suit that was pruned on the ground just took out his pistol. However, when he saw his teammate got shot, he immediately crawled behind the garbage can. Under the suppression of a sniper rifle, he could not get to the hijacked at this moment and pressed the Bluetooth earphone in his ear.</br>
</br>
The target was hijacked! The hijacker drove a Hummer with the license plate number XXXX. The car was fleeing towards L Street! Be careful! They have sniper support!</br>
</br>
Bernice took the sniper rifle apart without any hassle, then put the parts into the backpack she carried with her. Instead of walking down the stairs, she locked the hook on the water pipe on the roof and dropped the rope down the building a dozen stories high, then slid down the rope.</br>
</br>
After she landed in an alley, Bernice pulled out a motorcycle from the back of the trash can, put the helmet on her head, and hopped on the motorcycle with her slender legs. After a trail of exhaust gas, the roar of the engine soon drifted away from the intersection of the alley.</br>
</br>
The target has been controlled, he should be in the hands of the B City Consortium. Galloping on the streets of the Capital, Bernice reported to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Very well, it makes no difference whose hands he is in. They know what to do. Jiang Chen nodded, Whats the situation on your side? I just watched the news, and you made a lot of noise?</br>
</br>
When the people from B City Consortium arrived, Morgan and Rockefellers people had already surrounded the target, and they carried weapons. Just in case, I fired a shot in the distance to help them out. The police have not noticed me yet. Theyre trying to hunt down the Hummer that escaped.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, report the specific situation to me later. Get out first. Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Roger.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen hung up the phone, he looked at Ayesha who was next to him.</br>
</br>
The situation may be more serious than we thought, but fortunately, we got him.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Jacob Wood was controlled by the B City Consortium. Otherwise, if the truth-teller died, then even if Joseph Kennedy was not involved in this mess, his image would be smeared.</br>
</br>
With a little guidance on public opinion, people could easily associate Woods death with the article he signed before his death.</br>
</br>
The editor-in-chief of the Washington Post is already under our control, whats next? Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
The next step is to figure out who instigated him to publish that article, and then follow the trail to find the people behind this incident. After a pause, Jiang Chen continued, This is the final moment, any possible source of accidents must be completely eliminated.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1433: A Disruptive Finding</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The shooting on the streets of Capital resulted in two deaths and one minor injury. Due to the seriousness of the incident, the FBA had started an investigation. However, the result was not far from what Jiang Chen expected, the incident was classified as a gang fight.</br>
</br>
It was almost predictable that after this incident faded out from the publics attention, it would be swept under the rug. But since the editor was controlled by B City Consortium, there was still room to turn the situation around.</br>
</br>
The next day, Celestial Trades Los Santos office held a press conference. The UA business director (mainly responsible for Celestial Trades investment and promotion) stood in front of the cameras and gave a speech on the recent controversies.</br>
</br>
The flights between Celestial and the Mars colony will commence at the end of the year. From the perspective of peace, friendship, and common development, we will also bring home the astronauts stranded on Mars. In the fastest scenario, these astronauts will have to wait until mid-January next year to return to the country, when the election is over. Therefore, the use of astronauts by Celestial Trade to interfere in the election is pure speculation.</br>
</br>
We have noticed the previous report of the Washington Post. We found the argument used by the Washington Post to be very strange. When did a serious news source start to interpret two articles with no basis by distorting facts?</br>
</br>
Of course, I understand the current circumstance in the country.</br>
</br>
Using accusations and speculations as means of collecting votes are perhaps part of the election process?</br>
</br>
At the same time, under the coercion of the B City Consortium, Jacob Wood also appeared in front of the media to apologize.</br>
</br>
I have a great responsibility for that report. First of all, I would like to apologize to Celestial Trade. I shouldnt quote those two reports without basis. As a media professional, I</br>
</br>
This speech clearly sounded scripted and it was obviously the work of B City Consortium. Given how smooth the speech went, he definitely was very well prepped.</br>
</br>
In any case, the public controversy triggered by the three reports had finally come to an end. As for how it would affect the election in a few days time, it would only be evident after the election result was made available.</br>
</br>
After all, the time left now was not even enough to do a pre-election poll.</br>
</br>
As for the other person, Amy Qasim, her whereabouts were currently unknown. It was unclear whether she fled to the central states and hid after she realized the severity of the situation, or she was already controlled by Morgan and Rockefeller and locked into a dark room.</br>
</br>
Now to shift the perspective from the Earth to the Kuiper Belt 30 astronomical units away.</br>
</br>
After half a month of exploration work, the researchers on SS Origin had conducted a rough mineral identification of the types of asteroids around the spaceship.</br>
</br>
</br>
The result was beyond everyones expectations. These asteroids, which were originally thought to have the same minerality, had large differences in elements. After the news was revealed, it not only created a shockwave among the astronomy researchers, but even the physics researchers were also shocked by the finding.</br>
</br>
If this phenomenon was universal in the Kuiper Belt, then it would undoubtedly be a major discovery in the study of the origin of the Solar System that could change the existing understanding. Many scholars and scientific researchers in astronomy and physics submitted applications to Celestial Trade to fund a research ship to send them and their equipment to the Kuiper Belt, and establish a scientific research base for more in-depth research on those asteroids.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade stated that it would seriously consider the applications but did not give an immediate answer.</br>
</br>
After all, for Jiang Chen and other members of the Earth Defense Alliance who represented the interests of the member states, they were not interested in scientific topics such as the origin of the Solar System or even the universe, but what kind of benefits could be brought to them by the major discoveries of the Kuiper Belt as well as breakthroughs in interstellar travel technology.</br>
</br>
In the next six months, SS Origin would attempt to mine the nearby asteroids and build mining space stations. In particular, the collection of tritium and deuterium within the ice blocks with sizes comparable to asteroids to achieve energy self-sufficiency. It was the top priority of all scientific research tasks of SS Origin.</br>
</br>
After all, Celestial Trade and the Kuiper Belt were separated by 30 astronomical units. It was not easy to make a return trip.</br>
</br>
At about three oclock in the afternoon, Jiang Chen had just returned home from work at Future Building, but Wu Changfeng, the representative of Hua in the Earth Defense Alliance, visited him.</br>
</br>
After Ayesha made a pot of tea for the two, she went upstairs as usual and left the living room for the two. As for Natasha and Xia Shiyu, they were still at work.</br>
</br>
We are very interested in the Kuiper Belt, whether it is the resources there or the scientific value. They had already exchanged greetings at the door, Wu Changfeng went straight to the topic after they sat down, Well pay, if you provide the technology. We can even cooperate to establish a permanent research station in the Kuiper Belt. Its very helpful for the cultural exchange between the two countries and the friendship between the people! Im very optimistic about this cooperation. What do you think?</br>
</br>
There was another reason Wu Changfeng wanted to build a research station but he didnt mention it. He believed Jiang Chen would understand.</br>
</br>
This proposal was definitely not just the opinion of the Hua Academy of Sciences. Putting the national flag on the edge of the Solar System would not only help boost national confidence but more critically, it was an achievement that could go down in history for a particular individual.</br>
</br>
I dont have any problems here, Jiang Chen smiled, but I have to give you some information in advance. The cost of building a research station in the Kuiper Belt is not low. And we plan to establish a permanent space outpost in the name of the alliance, covering all aspects of military and scientific research projects. I recommend this proposal more than building a separate scientific research station.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng lowered his head and thought for a moment, then spoke.</br>
</br>
I will communicate your proposal, and we will seriously consider it.</br>
</br>
If the Earth Defense Alliance intended to build a permanent space outpost in the Kuiper Belt, then it would be unnecessary to build a separate research station. Moreover, the budgetary issue Jiang Chen said was also the point he was most worried about.</br>
</br>
General Wu came to see me today, just for this matter? Jiang Chen said with a smile, You could have called me. It would have saved you the hassle.</br>
</br>
Not exactly, Wu Changfeng took his cup, took a sip, then leaned back on the sofa and smiled, Actually, there is one more thing. The person above asked me to inquire you on this matter. But, because Im a straightforward person, Ill just be honest. Of course, if its inconvenient, just pretend I didnt ask anything.</br>
</br>
Since youre being direct with me, Ill say what I know. Jiang Chen laughed, Of course, I also have a premise here, that is when confidentiality issues are not involved.</br>
</br>
Then Ill be straightforward, After he put down the cup in his hand, Wu Changfeng looked at Jiang Chen, What do you guys think of the UA election?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1434"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1434: Once And For All</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed Wu Changfeng used you guys instead of you.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he didnt want to ask about his personal opinion.</br>
</br>
Can you be more specific? One corner of Jiang Chens mouth was curved up as he said in a relaxed tone, Your question is very general.</br>
</br>
Then Ill be direct. If Joseph Kennedy is president-elect, what are you going to do? Wu Changfeng asked Jiang Chen while he fixated his gaze into Jiang Chens eyes.</br>
</br>
We will be very happy, Jiang Chen laughed, as he slightly raised the cup in his hand and pretended to make a toast. This is the best scenario for us. The UA takes the initiative to join the Earth Defense Alliance, give up its hegemony and embrace the future. The Iron Curtain of the Pacific Ocean unwinds down before it unfolded, and all mankind will work together towards a beautiful new world</br>
</br>
Ahem. Wu Changfeng gentle cough interrupted Jiang Chens nonsense, then he asked, Then what if Trump becomes the president?</br>
</br>
Trump is an unstable factor, after he put the teacup on the table, he didnt go on about his nonsense this time and instead concisely explained, Based on his choice, we will react accordingly.</br>
</br>
Including war? Wu Changfeng asked.</br>
</br>
Are you scared? Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng was taken aback for a moment, then he laughed.</br>
</br>
Not at all! Its just that we are still a little worried. At the time of the Colombian Civil War, there were signs of escalating tensions. Fortunately, you both stepped on the brake in time. If it ended up escalating</br>
</br>
If it is the time when we have to make the worst choice, Jiang Chen smiled at Wu Changfengs probing gaze, and said nonchalantly, I can guarantee that before the situation becomes uncontrollable, everything will be over.</br>
</br>
They both tacitly agreed to end the topic on this note. In the conversation after, they did not discuss international affairs and just chatted about SS Origin at the Kuiper Belt and the next development plan of the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng declined the invitation to stay for dinner, got up and bid farewell to Jiang Chen, and left the mansion.</br>
</br>
Before he got on the car parked at the entrance, he looked back at the mansion with mixed feelings.</br>
</br>
Before the situation becomes uncontrollable, everything will be over? Huh, so confident Wu Changfeng smiled, muttered to himself and shook his head, the strong alert in his mind still lingered. At this moment, he was looking at this issue as a major general in the Hua Army.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen was bluffing, it would be fine.</br>
</br>
But if the nonchalant attitude was not deliberately faked, then the strength of Celestial Trade would be terrifying.</br>
</br>
After all, it was the UA they were discussing about.</br>
</br>
It was neither Country F nor Colombia nor the anti-government armed forces in Syria and Ukraine.</br>
</br>
So far, the engagement between Celestial Trade and the UA had been limited to small-scale encounters in local conflicts. Even in the most intense collision on the battlefield in Colombia, the UA only sent only a Marine expeditionary brigade.</br>
</br>
</br>
The war between great powers was not a simple science and technology competition. Xins strategic depth was no more than a hundred square kilometers deep, where did he gain his confidence?</br>
</br>
Until he returned to the hotel he was staying at, Wu Changfeng still couldnt think through the confusion in his mind. In the end, he had to attribute the answer to that Celestial Trade still possessed power hidden to outsiders. After all, no matter what, he couldnt believe that the man pretended to be nonchalant</br>
</br>
At the window of the office, Jiang Chen watched the car that disappeared at the end of the road, then he suddenly said.</br>
</br>
Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Mhmm? Ayesha turned her head and looked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
I have been thinking about a problem these days.</br>
</br>
Whats the problem? Ayesha asked curiously.</br>
</br>
I used to think that only when Joseph Kennedy came to power, the UA joined the Earth Defense Alliance, and everything developed in the direction we planned for, could we get to a happy ending, Jiang Chen said thoughtfully while he stared straight out of the window. But now I suddenly feel that it seems that the opposite is true.</br>
</br>
Why? Ayesha was puzzled.</br>
</br>
If you think about it, even if Joseph Kennedy wins, he will only lead the UA for four years. After four years, there will be another election. Even if he succeeds in re-election, he will only be there for two terms at most. If every change of term, we have to reconsider adjusting our strategy At that point, Jiang Chen stopped.</br>
</br>
A crazy idea appeared in his mind.</br>
</br>
Although this idea had appeared before, it was the first time where he seriously considered the feasibility of this idea.</br>
</br>
Rather than let a sensible politician push all the contradictions to four years later, it was better to let a layman lunatic come to power. Maybe Celestial Trade could seize this opportunity and solve all the troubles once and for all.</br>
</br>
Do you need me to let Bernice adjust her strategy? Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
No matter what choice Jiang Chen ultimately made, she would always be on his side.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Jiang Chen finally sighed.</br>
</br>
No need, Jiang Chen gently stroking Ayeshas hair, and watched the cheeks gradually get covered with a red hue, and whispered, Its only a few days from now, so let them toss this coin.</br>
</br>
Seven oclock in the evening.</br>
</br>
After a busy day, Xia Shiyu finally got home.</br>
</br>
After she closed the door, she held the shoe cabinet at the entrance as she lazily hooked off her high heels with her finger. Just now, she suddenly noticed the cups placed on the table in the living room and asked curiously.</br>
</br>
A visitor was here?</br>
</br>
Left about two hours ago, Lilith, who was lying on the sofa in her Phantom Helmet, added with her unwavering voice, By the way, you missed dinner.</br>
</br>
You came back just at the right time. We just finished eating. Ayesha made beef stew today, and Ill let her heat it up for you, Jiang Chen walked out of the dining room and rubbed Liliths head, then asked with concern while he looked at Xia Shiyu, What were you doing today? Why did you come back so late?</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu poured herself a glass of water, stuck out her tongue, and sat down on the sofa.</br>
</br>
Ive been working on an acquisition; High-Tech Freshwater acquired a 30% stake in IDE at a price of 3.5 billion Xin New dollars. Future Bank will act as the guarantor for this deal. Now the negotiation is in its final phase Im really exhausted. Dont mind me, Ill just have some fruits later.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard what she said, he processed the information for a few seconds before he looked at her again with a look of surprise.</br>
</br>
If he recalled correctly, IDE was a company with a strong background.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1435: Aerospace Planes Delivered</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There was a saying that made a lot of sense.</br>
</br>
To control the oil price meant to control the Middle East.</br>
</br>
To control the global economy meant to control the oil prices.</br>
</br>
To control the entire Middle East meant to control access to freshwater.</br>
</br>
As the only developed country in the Middle East, as early as ten years ago, Israel operated the worlds largest desalination facilities, with more than 30 desalination plants and hundreds of companies in the country active in the field of water management.</br>
</br>
And IDE was among the leading Israeli desalination companies.</br>
</br>
IDE? You managed to acquire IDE? If I remember correctly, Sorek should be Israels largest desalination plant and tap water supplier, right? The Israeli government just allowed you to do that? Jiang Chen was slightly surprised when he asked the question.</br>
</br>
Of course they didnt just allow us. Our acquisition can be described as full of twists and turns. Fortunately, the B City Consortium helped us tremendously. After all, they also owned some Hightech Freshwater shares. In addition, Yerif did also play a role. One corner of Xia Shiyus mouth was upturned with a proud smile on her face. Once the acquisition is completed, Hightech Freshwater will become the largest freshwater supplier in the Middle East. Eighty percent of the people in the Middle East will be directly affected by us.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finally showed a satisfied smile on his face.</br>
</br>
If it was only a 3.5 billion Xin New dollar acquisition, it would not be able to attract his attention. After all, relative to his current assets, even the entire market capitalization of Hightech Freshwater was not significant. But he combined the influence of Hightech Freshwater on Future Group, its significance would completely change.</br>
</br>
To give the most direct example, Celestial Trade had continuously worked to expand the Global Grid to Europe. As the gateway for the Global Grid to enter the Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean, Celestial Trades business in the Middle East had not been progressing smoothly.</br>
</br>
It was not only due to the influence of the UA in the region but also the result of Middle East countries vigilance towards Celestial Trade. Although Saudi Arabia had continued to seek means to reduce the huge number of high-polluting thermal power plants in the country, the current King of Saudi Arabia had kept reservation about fully opening the grid. Coupled with the UA lobbying, even if Yerif stood on Jiang Chens side, his influence was only limited in this case.</br>
</br>
And now, with the water pipes of Future Group paving the road, everything else was about to get easier. With the increasing influence of Xin industries in the Middle East, it would only be a matter of time before the Global Grid crossed the Gulf of Aden into the Mediterranean.</br>
</br>
One more thing, the 2020 financial report is going to be released soon. I just saw the first draft from the Finance Department today, do you want to have a sneak peek? Xia Shiyu said.</br>
</br>
</br>
First draft? Then Ill leave my expectations for the final version. Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Are you not curious at all? Xia Shiyu grinned, then she teased, Anyway, I was surprised when I saw it.</br>
</br>
Curious? Jiang Chen chuckled, and exaggeratedly let out a sigh. Then he said, No matter how long it is, its just a string of numbers.</br>
</br>
Puff</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu couldnt hold it in as she leaned back into the sofa and burst out laughing. Her slender shoulders trembled, and the strand of hair that had fallen onto her cheek vibrated along with her pumping chest. Before she could catch her breath, she suddenly saw a dark figure leap to her.</br>
</br>
ACH!</br>
</br>
With a short exclamation, Xia Shiyu was turned over by Jiang Chen and placed on his lap.</br>
</br>
What are you doing Xia Shiyu looked nervously to the stairs and pushed Jiang Chen on his chest as she began to blush. Then she struggled restlessly, Put me down. What time is it nowOUUU!</br>
</br>
She was only halfway through her sentence before the rest of the words were replaced by a squeal.</br>
</br>
It was not painful at all; it was just that the loud slap made the thin-skinned Xia Shiyu so embarrassed that she wanted to hide in a crack in the ground.</br>
</br>
How dare you to make fun of your husband, With a smirk, Jiang Chen raised his right hand that was aimed at that butt, Do you still dare to make fun of me now?</br>
</br>
As the sensation on her butt began to spread, Xia Shiyu felt her face burn.</br>
</br>
She bit into her lower lip that was as red as blood. Even if she thought about resisting at the moment, the worrying thought of Ayesha or Natasha could see her at this moment made her suppress her embarrassment and bow her head.</br>
</br>
No, I dare notACH!</br>
</br>
There was another loud slap that interrupted her weak attempt to surrender.</br>
</br>
What, what are you doing!</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu tried hard to turn her head around and stare at Jiang Chen in shame.</br>
</br>
Her response was Jiang Chens innocent gaze.</br>
</br>
Uh, I just suddenly felt that, it feels nice to slap</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chens response, she only felt her face become redder. She buried her face into the sofa pillow, felt the heat on her butt, and then muttered under her breath.</br>
</br>
This pervert</br>
</br>
In the early morning of the next day, as soon as Jiang Chen came back from a jog, he received a call on his watch.</br>
</br>
The call was from Saudi Arabia. Recently, he always occasionally received long-distance calls.</br>
</br>
Haha, my friend, thank you so much! I like this plane a lot. I believe my father has the same taste as mine. He will fall in love with it the first time he sees it. On the phone, Yerif laughed and thanked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Just now, the two aerospace G100s customized for him by Future Heavy Industries were delivered to his private airport. In addition to the supporting equipment, Future Heavy Industries also included four Matador electronic pilots.</br>
</br>
After Yerif received the aerospace plane, he immediately got on the plane, set his destination to Celestial Trade, and experienced the speed from Mecca to Celestial Trade. Despite his collection of many private jets, it was his first aerospace plane.</br>
</br>
Its not really a gift, but Im glad youre pleased. To put it bluntly, you paid for it after all, Jiang Chen laughed, I should be thanking you. I heard from my CEO that you helped in the acquisition of IDE.</br>
</br>
As the old Chinese saying goes, no trouble at all. Yerif waved his hand and said, Moreover, I believe you will honor the promise you made and turn our desert into an oasis.</br>
</br>
By the way, can I ask something? Yerif asked after a pause.</br>
</br>
Of course. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
When will the war in Syria end? The old kings health is getting worse by the day. The domestic situation is in a delicate state. My brother has recently gotten closer to the UA At this point, Yerif hesitated for a moment.</br>
</br>
He didnt know whether he should continue.</br>
</br>
It will end in February next year at the latest. Jiang Chen looked at the calendar on the wall. The battle is progressing smoothly. Based on the report from our front line from yesterday, our people have won a decisive victory in the Raqqa region.</br>
</br>
After Yerif heard this, he was finally relieved, and his tone no longer sounded tense. With a smile, he said, Then I will be waiting for your good news.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1436: A Case Study</br>
</div></br>
</br>
2020 was destined to be the most unusual year of this century.</br>
</br>
The UA election was in the last three days countdown, the SS Origin reached the edge of the solar system and traveled along the Kuiper Belt for half a month now. The ray of the new century was already rising. When everyone eagerly looked forward to the dawn and imagined a better life in the next era, the contradictions and backwardness that accumulated in the old era were also about to erupt.</br>
</br>
The whole world was waiting for the UA to make a choice. The election, from the start, had occupied the top spot of every search engine.</br>
</br>
In a world-renowned institution of higher learning at Cambridge, Massachusetts.</br>
</br>
Frank Dobbin sat in the corner of the library as he read through the Wall Street Journal with his brows furrowed.</br>
</br>
As a professor of the Division of Social Sciences at Harvard, as a leader in the contemporary Law and Economics Theory, many of his socioeconomic works received high praise internationally. Unlike most sociology professors that focused on theories, his research was closer to reality and emphasized practical application.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that his class was not only very popular with students at Harvard, but also very popular with large and medium-sized enterprises. His lesson plans were not only repeatedly studied by social science students, but also viewed as references by management around the world.</br>
</br>
To be precise, Frank Dobbin was closely examining the article on Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Recently, the media had been filled with the topic of SS Origin. Whether it was a serious scientific journal or a seemingly unrelated financial weekly, the latest articles were more or less connected to SS Origin, Celestial Trade, and Xin.</br>
</br>
The reason why he was so intrigued by this article was mainly because of his new book. The book combined current social forms, analyzed the problems and relationships between society and economy. At the same time, the book predicted the future social and economic development to a certain extent.</br>
</br>
And Xin and Celestial Trade was a very classic case discussed in his new upcoming book.</br>
</br>
From Celestial Trade, he saw the final form of two different economic theories, capitalism that dominated the Western world and the state capitalism advocated by Lenin. It was a malformed enterprise that was not subject to the constraints of the antitrust law, it would eventually forcefully merge all the industries that could produce surplus-value, and finally acquire the government to be part of the enterprise.</br>
</br>
Prediction was something that academia from all over the world enjoyed.</br>
</br>
As a tidbit of a great masterpiece, a moderate prediction would not only heighten the work but would also guide the future to some extent. Even if the prediction was wrong, it would be okay. After all, the limitations of the thinking and vision of the people in the past were understandable to those who study history in the future.</br>
</br>
</br>
And if he guessed correctly, it would be remarkable.</br>
</br>
Not only would his work be heightened infinitely, but even the author would be regarded as a true genius</br>
</br>
Of course, Frank Dobbin did not consider such far-flung things when he wrote the book. At this moment, he contemplated on the insights that Western socioeconomics could learn from the rise of Celestial Trade, and about the prospects of the Celestial Trade model.</br>
</br>
Still working on that subject?</br>
</br>
Christopher Grandi brought coffee and sat across from him. As a scholar in the same field, his research was similar to that of Professor Frank Dobbin, and the two often discussed certain topics together. For the unpublished piece of work, Professor Grandi had the honor to read the manuscript, some of which he agreed with.</br>
</br>
Except for one point, the part about Xin.</br>
</br>
The model of Xin is worth learning from. It is not necessarily applicable to the UA, but it is applicable to the future. This model appeared briefly in the colonies of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and other countries before the eighteenth century, and it was ultimately due to its own reasons that it was eliminated by history. This system with many problems in itself will be restored in the twenty-first century. The underlying reasons should be something we should study</br>
</br>
While Frank Dobbin spoke, he began to write this sentence in a notebook. However, for some reason, when he was halfway through the sentence, the pen in his hand stopped. He shook his head and scratched out this sentence.</br>
</br>
There are many coincidences in the rise of Xin. If you want to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of a certain social policy by studying the history of the development of Celestial Trade, the final result will definitely disappoint you, Professor Grandi said after he took a drink from the coffee, Because the advantages of Celestial Trade do not come from their system at all, but from their leadership in science and technology.</br>
</br>
Then my dear friend, what is the reason Celestial Trade can achieve leadership in science and technology? Professor Dobbin smiled and asked in a nonchalant tone.</br>
</br>
Maybe its just luck. Professor Grandi shrugged.</br>
</br>
Luck? Frank Dobbin shook his head while he laughed, then closed his notebook, I plan to go to Xin myself. You and I may never understand the answer to this question by just sitting here in the library.</br>
</br>
Its the same even if you go, Christopher Grandi said, I went to Coro University with Harvard last year for academic exchange. I also visited the Chancellor of Coro University and discussed this issue with him.</br>
</br>
The final conclusion? Frank Dobbin raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
There is no conclusion. We cant find any case in history that can define the rise of Celestial Trade. Professor Grandi shook his head.</br>
</br>
Thats because you discussed this with the wrong person. If it were me, I would visit Jiang Chen directly.</br>
</br>
When Professor Grandi realized that his friend was not willing to change his mind at all, he let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
The Chancellor of Coro University is Rafael Leif. When I was doing academic exchanges at MIT, I had a good relationship with him. Ill write a letter of introduction for you. If you want to meet Jiang Chen, you can ask him for help.</br>
</br>
Thanks a lot, Frank Dobbin said gratefully.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Jiang Chen would never have thought of how much shock Future Heavy Industries Origin would bring to the world on the other side of the ocean. This kind of shock was not only limited to conversations between ordinary people, department of social science in different universities and colleges started to use Celestial Trade as a case study. Even the aerospace companies in Silicon Valley, B City, and Florida had viewed Celestial Trade and Future Heavy Industries as goals to target</br>
</br>
At this moment, it was still very early in the morning.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who sat at the dining table, also saw the report published in the Wall Street Journal</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
From things as small as the water people drink everyday, to feats such as the colonies in outer space, a company that encompassed all aspects of peoples lives gloriously stopped the Pentagon, ruthlessly eliminated Wall Street, integrated Hollywood. Before the anti-trust law hammered down on the company, or rather because Xin was born under the influence of Celestial Trade in the first place, the law simply did not apply.</br>
</br>
In short, it was a monopoly. It was an oversized Samsung. The government was its human resources, and the army was the security at its door. The sheer size seemed to mock the Koreans. What else was scarier than turning an entire country into a company? Its efficiency and understanding of currency could not be surpassed by any bureaucracy, because it was built on the word efficiency from the beginning. As long as it could remain profitable, its growth would continue to snowball.</br>
</br>
Of course, an enterprise like this was also quite dangerous.</br>
</br>
Once social development had stagnated and all walks of life entered a period of saturation, then the people of Xin would be seeing soaring prices, unemployment, poverty, and endless protests. However, Celestial Trade would not let this ever happen. It controlled the internet, the media, as well as the magical Phantom Helmet; it possessed hundreds of ways to keep the people happy.</br>
</br>
The final ending would definitely be something similar to what Ray Bradbury described in Fahrenheit 451, the potential of the society would burn faster than any capitalism, and the society would usher in a complete dystopia</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Celestial Trade, or Xin, was in the perfect era.</br>
</br>
People that used to watch the stars in their childhood were now stepping into the sea of stars. It was unknown how far they were from fully embracing the starry night, but since they took the first step, would the second step be far away?</br>
</br>
The future offered enough space for this monster to continue to grow. Perhaps the day of stagnation would never come true</br>
</br>
This report is very interesting.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen read the article, he smiled, stabbed the fried egg on the plate with his fork, and put it into his mouth.</br>
</br>
Let me guess, Natasha drank a sip of hot milk, and as one corner of her lips turned up, she teased him, Looking at how happy youre smiling, the Wall Street Journal definitely praised you, right?</br>
</br>
It did not praise me, As he put down the newspaper in his hand, he laughed, but it did praise my company.</br>
</br>
He had developed the habit of reading the newspaper during breakfast a long time ago. Every day, at least forty different newspapers were delivered to the mailbox at the entrance of the mansion. Of course, it would be impossible for him to finish all of them. Typically, he would pick two and read them during breakfast and dinner.</br>
</br>
Recently, he had been paying attention to the news on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, so he selected Washington Post that represented the mainstream views of the North American elites and Wall Street Journal, a thought leader in the financial sector. Unexpectedly, as soon as he opened the first page of Wall Street Journal, he saw an economics professors evaluation of his company and the Xin Model.</br>
</br>
</br>
Chen. Natasha suddenly stopped eating, rested her chin against her interlaced fingers, and looked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Whats wrong? Jiang Chen glanced at her unexpectedly and joked, Are you fascinated by my handsomeness?</br>
</br>
You are the least humble among all the Chinese people I have ever met. Natasha rolled her eyes and said unceremoniously, I have met many Chinese people. They are very humble, and also very gentlemen.</br>
</br>
Thats because you only have a connection with me. Jiang Chen rolled his eyes as he mimicked her actions, then he mockingly replied, My vibe is great in front of outsiders, or rather, do you prefer me to treat you like a guest?</br>
</br>
Natasha seemed to imagine the scene seriously in her mind, shuddered, then shook her head.</br>
</br>
Forget it!</br>
</br>
Although he didnt know what she imagined, Jiang Chen thought for a while and decided that it would be better not to ask</br>
</br>
After breakfast, Jiang Chen took the unfinished newspaper to the office.</br>
</br>
It was Saturday today, and he didnt need to go to the company, so it was time to relax Although he rarely visited the office during work days.</br>
</br>
He asked Ayesha to help him make a cup of Blue Mountain Coffee, then he leaned against the window and flipped through the newspaper in his hands. Just then, there was a knock on the door, and after the door opened, Lilith, in a dress, walked in.</br>
</br>
Are you not playing games? Jiang Chen looked at the unexpected Lilith, who was at the door, and put the newspaper down.</br>
</br>
The sun must have risen from the west. Lilith did not have the Phantom Helmet on.</br>
</br>
Im not playing games all the time. Recently, I discovered that the literature of this world is unexpectedly interesting, Lilith said in her usual expressionless state. In addition, Lin Lin asked me to tell you that the weather weapon launch terminal drawing has been analyzed. It is uploaded to the database, file number ZS149.</br>
</br>
Z was the abbreviation of Future Heavy Industries, and S was the confidentiality level.</br>
</br>
When he heard the news, he immediately pressed the button of the watch and called the CEO of Future Heavy Industries, Yang Guanglei.</br>
</br>
Project No. ZS149 will start production immediately, use an industrial-grade 3D printer, I want to see a prototype within one week</br>
</br>
After the phone call, Jiang Chen realized that it was Saturday.</br>
</br>
My phone call just ruined his weekend</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his nose in embarrassment and muttered an apology in his mind.</br>
</br>
Anything else?</br>
</br>
Lilith still stood at the door, so Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
I have finished reading the books at home.</br>
</br>
After he took some time to process the information, he responded.</br>
</br>
so?</br>
</br>
So, you can take me to the bookstore. Lilith said as if everything made perfect sense, I have no money.</br>
</br>
Cant you just download it directly from the Internet? Jiang Chen was baffled.</br>
</br>
What age is it now, why cant you just read e-books?</br>
</br>
Moreover, you are an advanced AI cyborg, scanning the global e-book library will take a matter of minutes for you.</br>
</br>
You dont understand. If you simply scan the book, you will not be able to experience the joy of reading. Its a waste of hard disk space, Lilith shook her head and said seriously, Its just like playing games, if you only pursue the victory in data, then I might as well modify the server memory directly.</br>
</br>
Cyborgs have so many issues</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen facepalmed in his mind.</br>
</br>
Ill go with you in the afternoon, Jiang Chen said after he glanced at the clock on the wall, It happens to be the weekend and I have time.</br>
</br>
The corners of Liliths mouth slid upwards.</br>
</br>
Thank you.</br>
</br>
Then, her petite figure disappeared from the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
She just</br>
</br>
Smiled, right?</br>
</br>
I didnt just see things.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chens phone rang suddenly and interrupted his thoughts.</br>
</br>
After he pressed his watch, the holographic screen unfolded in front of him.</br>
</br>
When he saw the caller, he seemed surprised.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Rafael Leif, the 17th Chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, returned to his hometown of Venezuela after he retired. The headhunter hired by Jiang Chen invited him to serve as the Chancellor of Coro University and offered him an annual salary of 4 million dollars.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen handed over his cosmology public elective course to Mr. Hawking, he, the chairman of the school board, an honorary professor of Coro University, and an honorary chancellor, had rarely participated in university affairs and passed over the tasks to the Ministry of Education of Xin.</br>
</br>
Of course, even though he didnt participate in managing the university, Jiang Chen had never been stingy with the budget. After all, for him, investing in education was more than just a slogan.</br>
</br>
Chancellor Leif was also impressive. Under his leadership, Coro University had become a world-renowned institution of higher learning by virtue of its advantages in aerospace technology, bioengineering, and other fields. It had become the preferred university for international students in East and South Asia.</br>
</br>
Chancellor Leif, whats the matter? Jiang Chen said in a pleasant tone after he picked up the call</br>
</br>
A scholar from the UA wants to interview you, Rafael Leif said on the phone. His name is Frank Dobbin, a professor in the Division of Social Sciences at Harvard University. He is interested in the rise of Celestial Trade and Xin and is researching this topic. I wonder if youre free in the next few days?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard someone wanted to interview him, he was slightly caught off guard.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he did not like reporters attempts to corner him with tough questions, so he naturally did not like interviews.</br>
</br>
Just when he was about to refuse, the next words of Chancellor Leif made him unable to refuse.</br>
</br>
If it is convenient, he hopes to write a biography for you through this interview.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked to the door and saw Lilith, who looked at him with eyes of hope.</br>
</br>
It was indeed an occasion that was worthy of her to use her expression simulation program.</br>
</br>
Tomorrow. I have something to do today, Jiang Chen responded after he confirmed he had no arrangements tomorrow.</br>
</br>
Then I will thank you on behalf of Frank Dobbin. Leif smiled.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome.</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen drove Lilith.</br>
</br>
He said he would take her to the bookstore.</br>
</br>
Although she was a digitalized human, Jiang Chen did not intend to break his promise.</br>
</br>
Have you thought about what to buy?</br>
</br>
I searched for a book list on the Internet, and based on the description, it looked very interesting. Lilith expanded her holographic screen, then gently pushed it in front of Jiang Chen as she said with a hint of excitement in her tone.</br>
</br>
Dont block my view, Im still driving. Wait until I get on the maglev track first.</br>
</br>
As he pushed the holographic screen to the side, with the corner of his eyes, he scanned a few familiar names on the book list.</br>
</br>
</br>
All detective and horror novels?</br>
</br>
As expected, because she was an AI, her preference towards novels was based on logic</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was a little surprised.</br>
</br>
He originally thought that Lilith would prefer novels with great plots, or simply fantasy novels that were far away from reality.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen drove Lilith to the largest bookstore in downtown, Bris, far away in the Mars colony, was packing his luggage into the trunk of the rover along with the other six astronauts from the UA.</br>
</br>
The flight was suddenly delayed some time ago, which disappointed him since he had already packed his luggage. Fortunately, the engine failure of the transport ship had been eliminated. Although he could not make it back for Christmas, he was still very satisfied to reunite with his family.</br>
</br>
Where is Jenny?</br>
</br>
She cant go. Celestial Trade does not intend to give up the prosecution of her espionage, a slightly bulkier-looking man complained in a low voice, I told her earlier, dont fool around. This is not Capital. I bet she cant even find a lawyer.</br>
</br>
Are we just going to abandon her like this? Leave her here alone? Another female astronaut looked at the male colleague next to her with disbelief, She is our companion!</br>
</br>
Its not that we gave up her, but she got into trouble herself! The man who looked silent and hadnt said a word from the beginning until now said after he put his luggage into the trunk, Otherwise we might have been able to go back long ago.</br>
</br>
How can you say that to her!</br>
</br>
The female astronauts eyes widened, and she was about to argue with him but was quickly stopped by Captain Bris.</br>
</br>
Enough, dont argue, As Bris glanced at the Celestial Marines that were eyeing their direction, Bris said to his companions, Jennys matter will be resolved by the politicians. Lets not get into this mess since you and I cant do anything. In addition, I also warned her at the start, but she obviously didnt listen to me. Im going to repeat what I said to her at the beginning. Once again, dont do anything thats unnecessary! Especially at this point.</br>
</br>
After the female astronaut heard what her captain, said, she also quieted down.</br>
</br>
Although she was fighting the injustice for Jenny who was locked up, as Bris said, they couldnt do anything. Celestial Trade would not listen to their complaints. Those soldiers only obeyed orders and did not even want to look at them for a second longer.</br>
</br>
Lets cheer up, we will go home soon. When we get back to B City, shots on me. Bris patted the shoulders of everyone, then squeezed a smile as he was the first one to walk to the opened rover door.</br>
</br>
Twenty Mars rovers drove out from the open gate, crossed the steel city wall covered by alloy, left ripples of gray dust on the sand, and headed mightily to the south.</br>
</br>
In that distant sky, there was a black line that connected the ground and sky.</br>
</br>
Inside the car, Bris opened his eyes bigger.</br>
</br>
He recalled that when Ares landed on the surface of Mars, he had never seen this thing before. Unexpectedly, it took less than a year for Celestial Trade to build a space elevator on Mars. The efficiency of the construction was simply astonishing.</br>
</br>
What Bris didnt know was that Celestial Trade had been studying the feasibility of a space elevator at the Mars equator as early as the second half of last year. The project was launched at the end of 2019.</br>
</br>
From the beginning of construction to the completion of the main structure, the construction time of the entire space elevator had exceeded one year.</br>
</br>
Of course, whether it was the gravitational constant or the orbital height, the difficulty of building a space elevator on Mars was much lower on Earth. With the space elevator below Celestial City as an example to learn from, the construction of this space elevator on Mars was very smooth.</br>
</br>
Relying on the large graphite mine found in the crater near the colony, 60% of the materials for this space elevator were manufactured by the Mars colony. The current Mars colony was no longer the child who had to rely on imports from the parent planet. With the opening of fixed flights between Celestial City and the Mars colony, the industrial potential of this city placed above a giant iron ore mine would surpass any city on Earth in the foreseeable future.</br>
</br>
This also included Celestial City.</br>
</br>
On the twenty Mars rovers, there were not only astronauts from the UA but also 200 Xin researchers that included Dr. Amos. After they completed the inoculation of the Flower of Memory, these researchers, accompanied by nurses, had completed a total of 100 rehabilitation training sessions as they sorted the knowledge in their heads into the database.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen and the others had expected, these Flowers of Memory were not without side effects.</br>
</br>
Some people, after they accepted the memory of the Gaia civilization, felt nauseous to all mammalian meats such as pork and beef, but they involuntarily salivated to insects such as snails, earthworms, and even demon worms. Some people even forget how to walk upright, and often used their non-existent tentacles to hit the wall</br>

</br>
In the waiting room below the elevator.</br>
</br>
How is your recovery coming? At the entrance of the elevator, Hong Zewei nonchalantly asked.</br>
</br>
I have almost recovered, Dr. Amos smiled, in a relaxed state, he said, and I prefer to call it instinct resuscitation rather than illness, which can be eliminated after a certain amount of adaptive training. Its not a particularly serious illness.</br>
</br>
Instinct resuscitation.</br>
</br>
Yes, when Gaia gave us their memory, they also accidentally gave us their own behaviors and habits, Dr. Amos continued. The Flower of Memory interferes not only with our cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but at the same time, it also has a radiative effect on other parts of the brain. Such results are excusable. After all, they cannot predict the species that will take over their heritage in the future, and their brain structure. Moreover, when I was leading the researchers to collect the data in our memory, I noticed a special phenomenon.</br>
</br>
What phenomenon? Hong Zewei was surprised by the finding.</br>
</br>
In all the materials from billions of years ago, there is no detailed record of the Flower of Memory, but rather, they wasted a lot of time on irrelevant details. I have a bold suspicion that perhaps they didnt invent the Flower of Memory, therefore they couldnt even determine its impact.</br>
</br>
They didnt create the Flower of Memory? Hong Zewei smiled, Who else could have created it? Could it be another higher civilization?</br>
</br>
Perhaps, Amos smiled, Of course, everything is just my inference. After all, everything we see is always just the tip of the iceberg relative to the entire universe.</br>
</br>
Just as the two chatted, the announcement of boarding the elevator sounded in the waiting room.</br>
</br>
Its almost time, have a safe journey, Hong Zewei said, Ill say my farewells here.</br>
</br>
You also take care. Dr. Amos smiled.</br>
</br>
As the announcement sounded, the people waiting in the waiting room went to the boarding escalator one after another, then they walked into their respective cabins according to their numbers. Soon more than two hundred people entered the elevator cabins shaped like a train in the space elevator track.</br>
</br>
Guided by a series of lights that turned on sequentially, the elevator cabins slowly accelerated towards the egg-yolk-colored sky.</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos gazed down at the desert slowly disappearing from his vision and the Mars colony that shrunk into a dot. He felt emotional and excited at the same time.</br>
</br>
He would return to Earth soon, with over two hundred researchers who accepted the heritage of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
He believed that the knowledge stored in his brain was destined to bring earth-shaking changes to the world.</br>
</br>
Sunday, early morning.</br>
</br>
In the office of the mansion, Jiang Chen met the Harvard Professor  Frank Dobbin.</br>
</br>
The old man over sixty years old looked much younger than his actual age. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that he still traveled around the world for research and seminars. Unlike most scholars in the same field that focused on a large number of journals and add to the conclusions of their predecessors, he advocated for in-person research and the use of scientific means for his research topics.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this trait that Frank Dobbin had generated countless ground-breaking views in the field of social economics, backed with factual arguments. It was also the reason why his works were regarded as classics by academia.</br>
</br>
Hello, Mr. Jiang.</br>
</br>
After they met, Frank Dobbin extended his right hand first.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen shook his hand, he smiled and nodded.</br>
</br>
Hello.</br>
</br>
You are now a renowned man around the world. Its my honor to be able to interview you. After Frank Dobbin let go of his hand, he smiled, then said, Since last year, I have been studying how Celestial Trade can stand out among the hundreds of millions of companies around the world.</br>
</br>
Have you found anything in your research? Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
I regret not, Frank Dobbin shook his head, and said in a relaxed tone, Thats why I am visiting you today. Thank you again for taking time out of your busy schedule.</br>
</br>
No worries, I may not be able to help you much with academics, Jiang Chen smiled, I may only say one thing about the rise of Celestial Trade and that is we are just standing on the shoulders of giants.</br>
</br>
The shoulders of giants? Is there any company in the world that is strong enough to provide you with shoulders? Frank Dobbin laughed.</br>
</br>
One hundred and seventy large and medium-sized research institutes covering the nine islands of Xin, as well as 4,371 scientific researchers in different fields. They are all giants we rely on, Jiang Chen said, There can be many giants.</br>
</br>
The true giant was a huge technological heritage from another world, but obviously, he could not share this.</br>
</br>
So, do you attribute the achievements of Celestial Trade to the progress made in natural science and applied science? Frank Dobbin asked.</br>
</br>
After he thought for a moment, Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Yes.</br>
</br>
What do you think of the future of Xin? With the same smile, Frank Dobbin said as he took out a cut piece of newspaper from the bag he carried with him, Wall Street Journal from December 21st, 2020. Did you read this article?</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen said with a smile, I can only say that it is well written, although this will never happen.</br>
</br>
Oh? Frank Dobbin asked seriously, What makes you so confident that this day will never come?</br>
</br>
Because the future has a large enough space, I am convinced of this, Jiang Chen smiled, Rather than squeezing surplus value from poor people, we are more inclined to expand outward, such as asteroid mining and outer space colonization. In the future, there will be enough land to absorb the surplus population and enough jobs to absorb the surplus labor. We only need to use the leading position in the industries to control the pace of expansion. The dystopia world described in Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451 will never happen in Xin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen used an inciting tone to vividly describe to Frank Dobbin about the future of Xin and Celestial Trade in his perspective. He had given similar speeches many times at internal meetings and at press conferences, and even if he did not prepare a script, he could easily deliver the speech.</br>
</br>
Frank Dobbin was dumbfounded as he listened to the speech that he even forgot to move the pen on his notebook.</br>
</br>
Although the topic had digressed, Jiang Chens answer solved all the confusion he had after he read that article.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Jiang Chen, who gave this speech, didnt realize it himself, but from the perspective of a researcher, Frank Dobbin gained a deeper understanding of Celestial Trade, and the Xin Model familiar to every social science scholar.</br>
</br>
Although he was only halfway through the questions he had prepared, he already felt the trip was worthwhile</br>
</br>
Many years later, Frank Dobbin wrote in his memoir.</br>
</br>
I have visited many great people in my life, from the first black president of the UA to the warlord of a dictatorship in Africa. If you were to ask me who had the deepest impression on me, it would undoubtedly be the President of Celestial Trade, Jiang Chen, the richest man in the world. I have spent ten pages in Introduction to Society and Economy in the New Era  Xin on everything about him, and my personal evaluation. Just to ensure that there is no misunderstanding by the future generations, my memoir is also sponsored by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Since then, I have made bold predictions in my new book. This great man not only belongs to Xin, but he belongs to the entire world.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1440: What“s meant to come will always come</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Whats meant to come will always come.</br>
</br>
Even if theyre unwilling, it is still unavoidable.</br>
</br>
Due to objective reasons such as the relocation of UA troops in Nippon and the Colombian Civil War, the UA election was postponed from the second week of November to late December. Voters across the UA walked to the polling stations with mixed feelings of pessimism, optimism, excitement, and indifference about this overdue election.</br>
</br>
The vast infinite blue covered the city of Los Santos. Just as everyone walked out of the house, a plane flew by in the sky and smeared the sky with a sentence  The UA is great, Trump is disgusting!</br>
</br>
The people of Los Santos looked up in bewilderment</br>
</br>
In the crowd, someone shouted out with their hands around their mouth, Oh my god! This is brilliant!</br>
</br>
At this moment, at the polling stations in CA State, college students took to the street and held up the slogans in their hands. Performance artists even painted slogans against Trump on the wall with spray paint. And all this got the acquiescence of the police, and the onlookers applauded.</br>
</br>
In CA State, no one liked the guy that always made unjustifiable claims.</br>
</br>
Anti-Trump!</br>
</br>
Say NO to racial discrimination!</br>
</br>
We cant let a rogue steal our nuclear button! Even if its just for our neighbors!</br>
</br>
Anyone can be the president except for Trump.</br>
</br>
Joseph Kennedy is great!</br>
</br>
The voices of opposition were not only concentrated on the streets of CA State but also centered in Silicon Valley and spread across the Internet. More than 170 Silicon Valley leaders collectively voiced their opposition to Trump.</br>
</br>
Even if their political views had always leaned towards the Democratic Party, the attitude shared by the technology sector had never been so unified.</br>
</br>
Especially Apple CEO Tim Cook, his dislike of Trump was already the worst kept secret. Trump stated that he would force Apple to move their factories back to the UA, otherwise, it would impose heavy taxes. Moreover, Apple refused to cooperate with the FBA to unlock the iPhone of a terrorist suspect. Trump, therefore, called on his people to boycott Apple products.</br>
</br>
In addition, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who was annoyed by Trumps tax avoidance issue, stated on Twitter that we should send Trump into space.</br>
</br>
This tweet was praised by another Silicon Valley leader. Tesla CEO Elon Musk then said in a half-joking and half-serious tone that he would leave a place for Trump on the rocket</br>
</br>
In CA State, supporting Joseph Kennedy had almost become political correctness. People were proud of their choice. Even if there were a few Trump supporters, they had to be sneaky when they voted to avoid being caught.</br>
</br>
If someone else knew that they voted for the villain, there definitely would be an argument. In the worst case, it would lead to a fight. Those in the black community and people from Mexico despised that man.</br>
</br>
</br>
But in T State, it was another scene.</br>
</br>
In SA City, the site of the Alamo Fortress.</br>
</br>
Dressed in cowboy costumes as T State militia during the War of Independence, people carried old-fashioned Fergus rifles as they marched from the ancient birthplace of the revolution towards downtown under the beating of drums.</br>
</br>
Their stand was clear, their slogans were concise, and their chants were easy to understand. All this was accentuated by their outfits.</br>
</br>
Destiny!</br>
</br>
Defend our country!</br>
</br>
Fu*k the Mexicans!</br>
</br>
If you dont like Trump, get out of T State!</br>
</br>
Even if people didnt like Trump, the people from T State were also skeptical about Joseph Kennedys foreign policy. As a traditional red state, voters had to heavily contemplate before they walked to the machine and cast their own sacred vote.</br>
</br>
In front of the camera, when asked why he supported Trump, as well as his thoughts on some of Trumps remarks, a red neck emotionally roared at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
Should there not be freedom of speech in this country! Is it wrong for me to defend my homeland! Why should I use political correctness to restrain the true leader of this country! For so many years, there has never been a politician that voiced our emotions! All these years! There has never been a politician who can express our aspirations! Dont mention the Democratic Party! Even the Republicans are soft! Finally, there is a real leader that can represent us and say what needs to be said. And you still have to ask me why I chose him?</br>
</br>
I dont want to listen to any of the multicultural equality, anti-war, racial equality, womens rights, animal protection! I dont want hypocritical ethics, fabricated data, empty editorials! I need to vent my feelings and let my voice be heard! I just dont like people who are different from me! Why are there so many people who are different from me in my homeland!</br>
</br>
There were cheers and whistles around.</br>
</br>
They had enough of those hypocritical politicians and had enough of the lies from those moral models. Thanks to the efforts of Obama and Hill, southern T State had turned into another Latin America. Their ancestors used blood and guns to drive away Mexicans, but now the enemys descendants had swaggered into their homes, robbed them of their jobs, and occupied their social resources</br>
</br>
All this was due to those politicians political correctness.</br>
</br>
This damned political correctness!</br>
</br>
And now, a candidate stood in front of them and said all they wanted to say. For example, Mexico is sending criminals and thieves to the UA, I want to build a wall on the border</br>
</br>
In their unique way, the cowboys cheered for their leaders arrival.</br>
</br>
There was one thing they shared with the people of CA State.</br>
</br>
If someone stood in front of those rednecks and claimed to be a fan of Joseph Kennedy, the situation would indeed turn violent.</br>
</br>
CA State was the traditional Democrat state while T State was the traditional Republican state. No matter who the candidate was, the result hardly changed. The swing states determined the outcome of the election, especially the swing states that hold a large number of electoral votes.</br>
</br>
For example, F State, which held 27 electoral votes.</br>
</br>
It was almost the hardest-hit area.</br>
</br>
What could be more exciting than putting Democrats and Republicans together on election day?</br>
</br>
Voters in the two camps had never been so antagonistic. They were like roosters eager to fight as they stared at the vote in their neighbors hands. The controversy had gone from factories to schools, from argument to verbal abuse, to even physical confrontation. The overwhelming advertisements of the two parties made many neutrals start to feel tired; they only hoped that this day could pass soon and everything could return to normal</br>
</br>
When the last ballot was cast and the last polling station was closed, the sun had fallen on the east side of the Pacific. This was followed by the dawn of the west side of the Pacific.</br>
</br>
In the morning news, countless scenes told the story about this election.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw how Trumps supporters got beaten in CA State, he couldnt resist the urge to laugh, even though he knew it was a terrible thing to laugh at.</br>
</br>
He believed that he was not the only one waiting to see the comedy show continue.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1441: I“M GOING TO DRINK UNTIL I THROW UP!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The results were tallied up after the polls closed.</br>
</br>
Several mainstream media and some online media broadcasted the results in each state in real-time</br>
</br>
In an apartment building in Capital, several men sat around the sofa as they stared at the votes on the TV. The beating numbers seemed to possess magical powers that froze time and words as they captured all their attention.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a man in a suit pushed open the door and walked in.</br>
</br>
Joseph Kennedy looked to the door, then asked immediately.</br>
</br>
How is the situation?</br>
</br>
I just asked, the results of H State have came out, we won!</br>
</br>
When Joseph Kennedy heard those words, he didnt display any pride or excitement. Instead, he just looked at the map on the wall and said calmly.</br>
</br>
H State has only four electoral votes, and traditionally, its a Democratic State. Winning in H State does not mean anything. The key is those swing states. Only by winning those swing states can we win this election</br>
</br>
At this moment, Joseph Kennedy stared at the TV and suddenly looked ecstatic. Though that joy was quickly hidden behind his calmness, the corner of his lips turned up made it difficult to hide the emotions he felt at this moment.</br>
</br>
In less than half a minute, the results from IN State came in. Joseph Kennedy won the state by a mere 500 votes. Based on the Electoral College winner-takes-all system, all 11 electoral votes in the state went into his pocket.</br>
</br>
But it was not what excited him the most.</br>
</br>
Traditionally, IN State had always leaned toward the Republican Party, but now it had surrendered to the embrace of the Democratic Party. Although they only won by a slight margin, it was quite significant to turn a state blue among the red states on the map.</br>
</br>
Nice job. The people of IN State have embraced the deep blue. I guess the Republican will be very grateful for the Mr. Loudmouth they elected. Joel Neeson blew a whistle as he joked.</br>
</br>
At least we will thank him. Jim Magris smiled.</br>
</br>
Laughter echoed throughout the living room, and the room was full of joy.</br>
</br>
Although the outcome was not yet clear, everyones clenched fists and frowning brows seemed to relax. God bless, fortunately, the people remained sane. Fortunately, the Democratic Partys credit had not been consumed.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the laughter in the room suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
Joseph Kennedys mood suddenly fell from cloud nine as his face gradually turned gloomy.</br>
</br>
Just now, the host on TV broadcasted the results of MI State.</br>
</br>
With a 5% advantage, eleven electoral votes fell into that rogue pocket.</br>
</br>
The original advantage was reversed in an instant, and the previously uplifting atmosphere in the room turned into silence.</br>
</br>
Its okay, the outcome is still unclear, Joel Neeson put his hand on Kennedys shoulder and comforted, The key to the victory or defeat is F State and O State. As long as we win those two swing states, victory is still ours.</br>
</br>
</br>
Joseph Kennedy took a deep breath and said slowly.</br>
</br>
I know.</br>
</br>
F State and O State had 27 and 20 electoral votes, respectively. MI States eleven electoral votes were less than half of those in these two states. It was just that the failure of Missouri made him tense again.</br>
</br>
He was only one step away from the presidents throne. Whether the hardships of the past year would come to fruition or become worthless was determined at this moment.</br>
</br>
His hands clenched again.</br>
</br>
His palms gradually turned sweaty</br>
</br>
Hahaha! Good job! Ivanka, go and help dad get the champagne from the fridge, my dear Mr. Bannon, the party has started early! We won two swing states! This is a great victory!</br>
</br>
Trump slammed his fist on the table as he laughed out excitedly.</br>
</br>
Ivanka rolled her eyes but still went to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
Just now, three swing states made their choices.</br>
</br>
Other than the wrong choice made by C State, five and eleven electoral votes from N State and MI State respectively went into his pocket. The results of the two swing states ballots swept away the haze on his brows from the fact that IN State turned blue a few minutes ago.</br>
</br>
Its too early to celebrate the victory. When F State comes out, I will definitely have a drink with you. Steve Bannon pushed up his black-rimmed glasses, stared at the vote count on the TV, and said calmly.</br>
</br>
Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News Network, was currently the director of the Trump campaign. Although Mr. Bannon didnt speak much in front of the public, he was the engine behind the Trump campaign.</br>
</br>
Standing next to him was Kellyanne Conway.</br>
</br>
As the only female member of the Trump campaign team, she was also the first female manager in the presidential campaign team in the history of the Republican Party. To a large extent, it was Ms. Conway who reversed the bad impression that Trump disrespected women among white women. And it was precisely because of her phrase that the voters are eager to have someone outside of the political circle challenge the existing power structure that prompted Trump to take the non-mainstream campaign approach. She was juxtaposed with Bannon as the two key members of the Trump campaign team.</br>
</br>
I agree with Mr. Bannons point of view. Its a bit early to start the party. Kellyanne Conway agreed with Steve Bannons point of view, but the joy between her eyebrows was the same as Trumps.</br>
</br>
The numbers shown on the TV proved that her work in the past few months had not been wasted. Whether it was for the promised bonus or for the promise of entering the top political circle in the country, this moment was worth celebrating. Republican Party, who had previously fallen behind, had caught up to the temporarily leading Democratic Party and even appeared to have overtaken.</br>
</br>
But it was still too early.</br>
</br>
The electoral votes of the remaining three swing states were enough to change everything and reshuffle the so-called advantages and disadvantages. Steve Bannon closed his eyes and prayed silently. His clenched palms were almost drenched with sweat.</br>
</br>
At this moment, presumptuous laughter filled the room again and broke the silence in the living room.</br>
</br>
Haha, we won! We won! My dear Mr. Bannon!</br>
</br>
Just now, F State made a choice with its 27 electoral votes.</br>
</br>
And there was no need to say what those 27 electoral votes meant.</br>
</br>
The game was not over yet, but the winner was already decided</br>
</br>
This time you have to drink with me! And Kellyanne too, you have to join us! Let us celebrate this great moment, we won! With his flushed, Trump unscrewed the cork and handed the bottle in his hand to Steve Bannon as he said with a voice trembling with excitement, Lets toast to the UA!</br>
</br>
Steve Bannon opened his eyes and stared at the distinct red letters on the TV. He was silent for a long time.</br>
</br>
The circles under his eyes gradually turned red. He suddenly stood up and called out fumblingly.</br>
</br>
How is champagne enough? Bring out the whiskey! IM GOING TO DRINK UNTIL I THROW UP!</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1442: An Expected Surprise</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Oh, God, Virgin Mary, tell me this is not true. I bet that people all over the world are waiting to make fun of us A man in a suit clasped his head emotionally in the lobby of the Javits Convention and Exhibition Center as he stood in front of the results.</br>
</br>
When the votes of the last state were released, the victory was a foregone conclusion. Although it had been determined a long time ago, many people still chose to believe that the results could change and everything would not be so bad.</br>
</br>
Thank you, thank you for choosing me, and I will lead this country to greatness again, Trump said loudly, uttering his signature gesture in front of his supporters, I will deliver on my campaign promise! I promise to all of you again. Xin will be the first stop of my diplomatic visit after taking office. I will have a good talk with that man, in a mans way!</br>
</br>
The thunderous applause and deafening cheers reverberated inside the center.</br>
</br>
Under the star-spangled flag, there were enthusiastic and zealous faces, as if the great dream had been rekindled, as if everything had gone back to forty years ago, back to that great era.</br>
</br>
Of course, not everyone was happy with this result.</br>
</br>
On the day after the election results were announced, an atmosphere of disappointment and anger shrouded the entire Silicon Valley.</br>
</br>
In many technology companies, the working atmosphere was extremely down and gloomy. Many people were depressed, with red and swollen eye sockets, especially some female employees. When they saw Joseph Kennedy deliver his concession speech on their mobile phones, many even shed tears.</br>
</br>
On the other side, on the streets of metropolitans in CA State, hundreds of people took to the streets for two consecutive nights to protest the election of Trump. They chanted He is not our president, We dont want racists, and threw cans or even stones at Trump supporters.</br>
</br>
In some areas, the protests even went out of control and turned into violent rioting and looting, as well as flag burning. The police had to arrest some radical protesters, and Hill, who had not yet transferred power, had to call on all parties to maintain rationality and calmness.</br>
</br>
In G State, a militia called Guardian assembled in the suburbs. Under the leadership of a 50-year-old white veteran, they began military training. The organization claimed that it would use bullets to defend the Constitution and suppress those traitors who attempt to divide the country</br>
</br>
The election of Trump made CA States left-leaning white population, black population, and Mexican population completely irrational. They went to the streets for three consecutive days to vent their dissatisfaction. Because Asians generally supported Trump, the Asian communities were the hardest-hit areas of riots and they suffered the most from riots and arsons.</br>
</br>
We lost.</br>
</br>
Yes, we lost.</br>
</br>
Why do I feel that you dont seem disappointed? After Loki hesitated for a moment, he said in a subtle way with a dissatisfied tone.</br>
</br>
</br>
No! Im quite disappointed, butI just dont know what to say. Everything happened so suddenly and we have prepared for so long</br>
</br>
I cant, I cant resist any longer.</br>
</br>
After he finished his sentence, just as Loki began to speak, Jiang Chen quickly pressed the mute button on the holographic screen. He put his head on the table and his shoulders started to shake violently.</br>
</br>
Although he lost, for some reason, he just couldnt stop himself from laughing at this moment.</br>
</br>
Maybe this could be described as gloating.</br>
</br>
After he laughed for about half a minute and finally got it out of his system, Jiang Chen sat up straight again, cleared his throat, and pressed the button to turn on the microphone again.</br>
</br>
Ahem, sorry, the signal on my side was not so stablewhat did you just say?</br>
</br>
Im saying what are you going to do? Loki repeated it patiently.</br>
</br>
I havent thought about it yet, you know, all this is too sudden, its too sudden, As he said too sudden twice, Jiang Chen leaned back against the chair and tapped the armrest with his finger. After he deliberated for a moment, he adjusted his wording, To be honest, I dont know very much about Trump But considering his campaign declaration, I am worried about the prospect of the UA joining the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Worried? Loki shook his head and smiled wryly, You dont need to worry, you can basically give up. He will never agree to join the Earth Defense Alliance, even nominally.</br>
</br>
This was what made Loki the most heartbroken.</br>
</br>
If the UA could not join the Earth Defense Alliance, it meant the next step of cooperation between the B City Consortium and Celestial Trade could not move forward, and the investment of the First National Bank in the space industry would still be subject to policy restrictions.</br>
</br>
This kind of feeling was similar to seeing a giant cake in front of him and not being able to take a bite of it despite how hard he tried. This made Loki and other shareholders of the First National Bank feel suffocated.</br>
</br>
Then dear Mr. Loki, for the sake of our friendship, I kindly remind you, Jiang Chen said softly, It doesnt matter if we lose, we are outsiders. However, as a citizen of the UA, and as someone who went all-in on the loser.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen continued, Should you consider leaving a path for yourself?</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Loki spoke slowly.</br>
</br>
You are right, but I have to ask other partners for their opinions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned back on the chair, then smiled.</br>
</br>
Better hurry up.</br>
</br>
Wall Street despised Trump. Many people had suffered heavy losses because Trump was elected. If Joseph Kennedy was elected and the UA joined the Earth Defense Alliance as expected, the UA space industry would undoubtedly usher in a period of rapid growth.</br>
</br>
But now, all this seemed like a distant dream.</br>
</br>
Even if Trump promised to increase the federal investment in the aerospace sector, no matter the size of the investment, would it compare to a space elevator with its doors open to the UA? The answer was obviously no.</br>
</br>
Ironically, it was the two Wall Street leaders who pushed this candidate hated by countless Wall Street investors to the throne of the president</br>
</br>
On the second day of the election, when Joseph Kennedy made his concession speech, there was a private banquet held in a five-star restaurant in the center of Nouveau York City. The size of the banquet was very small, with only two participants.</br>
</br>
One represented the Morgan family and the other represented Rockefeller.</br>
</br>
Cheers to our victory! Morgan raised his glass and smiled, and also for the coming Christmas.</br>
</br>
Haha, cheers! Rockefeller also smiled and raised his glass.</br>
</br>
The crisp sound of clinking glasses echoed on the wine table, and the two finished the red wine in their glass.</br>
</br>
The wine glasses returned to the table, and the two looked at each other, then burst into laughter simultaneously.</br>
</br>
The dining table was full of joyful atmosphere, which formed a sharp contrast with the gloomy clouds outside the window. For Nouveau York, for Wall Street, today was definitely the darkest day of 2020. But for the two around the table, the opposite was true.</br>
</br>
Trumps rise to power meant that the Iron Curtain over the Pacific Ocean was inevitable, and an arms race comparable to the Cold War era would ensue. It was almost foreseeable that in the next four years, military orders from the Department of Defense would double.</br>
</br>
The direct beneficiaries of all this were here.</br>
</br>
If it werent for the fact that extravagant celebrations could result in a poor image, Morgan even planned to hold a grand banquet to celebrate this day.</br>
</br>
Those old folks in B City are getting more and more out of line, Rockefeller said casually while he cut the steak with a knife and fork.</br>
</br>
Yes. Morgan sighed, but his tone was quite relaxed, We almost let them win.</br>
</br>
Whats your opinion?</br>
</br>
Do you still have to ask? My opinion is the same as yours.</br>
</br>
While he said this nonchalantly and seemed focused on cutting the steak with his knife, a hint of viciousness suddenly flashed across his dark green pupils</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1443: Preparing For War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On a quiet night at a port on the west coast of South America.</br>
</br>
Two cargo ships slowly stopped at the berths in the port.</br>
</br>
Under the cover of night, containers were unloaded one by one from the ships by the bridge cranes in the port, placed on the back of heavy trucks, and driven towards the military base about five kilometers from the port.</br>
</br>
On another smaller cargo, soldiers in kinetic skeletons stepped off the deck, boarded the long-waiting military trucks, and drove along with the convoy of heavy trucks to the Celestial Trade military base.</br>
</br>
Tumaco, a port town on the border of South Colombia and Ecuador, had a population of only two thousand people.</br>
</br>
After the Colombian Civil War, the President of South Colombia Timoshenko signed the Trans-regional Economic Development Zone Agreement with Celestial Trade. The 740 square kilometers of land from Tumaco to the Ecuadorian border was allocated to Celestial Trade as a special economic zone.</br>
</br>
Based on the content of the agreement, under the premise of abiding by the Colombian Constitution, Celestial Trade possessed a certain degree of autonomy, including setting tariffs and dispatching troops. On the other hand, Celestial Trade promised to increase the GDP of this special economic zone in South Columbia to 50 billion Xin New dollars within ten years and maintain a growth rate of 5% within 50 years.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Celestial Trade used the space elevator as a bargaining chip to rent 260 square kilometers of land from Ecuador to get a whole number. However, the land was not made available to Celestial Trade yet. The Ecuadorian government stated that the special zone agreement would be signed after the second phase of the space elevator begins.</br>
</br>
Just like when the New Malaysia Special District was established. The creation of a special economic zone in the border area would benefit both countries so that neither party would be able to leave Celestial Trade. This move would not only strengthen the regional influence of Celestial Trade but also reap direct economic benefit. Jiang Chen had also set up one on the border between Moro and Country F earlier, which also yielded favorable results.</br>
</br>
With the completion of the port at the special zone, batches of Celestial Trade Army also began to land in South Colombia.</br>
</br>
In less than a month, more than 10,000 Celestial soldiers had arrived in South America and were stationed in the military base located in Tumaco.</br>
</br>
Among them, seven thousand were part of the Celestial Foreign Corps. Most of the soldiers came from Moro, Madagascar, Ukraine, Central Africa. The other three thousand were made up of the Celestial Army; their weapons and equipment represented the highest technological capability of Future Military</br>
</br>
Their weapons also represented the highest technological capability of the world.</br>
</br>
It was not only Celestial Trade soldiers who patrolled the port, but also soldiers in South Colombia uniforms.</br>
</br>
</br>
While Celestial Trade was stationed in South Colombia, it also took over four thousand South Colombian recruits.</br>
</br>
It was a special request made by President Timoshenko of South Colombia to Jiang Chen during the negotiation of the special zone. In consideration of improving the combat effectiveness of his allies, Jiang Chen readily accepted this proposal. These recruits would be familiarized with the Scythe drone, S1 kinetic skeleton, and all Future Military equipment exhibited in the defense exhibition under the training of Celestial Trade commanders and virtual reality system.</br>
</br>
In the commanders office of the military base, Cai Deye sat in front of his desk as he frowned at the list in his hand.</br>
</br>
Two hundred NS-90s? What are they? Why havent I heard of them.</br>
</br>
Its normal that you havent heard about it, said the man standing in front of his desk with a shaved head. This is a land-based robot newly developed by Future Military. The confidentially level was reduced from S to B yesterday, and it was officially armed into the Army.</br>
</br>
Cai Deye looked surprised.</br>
</br>
He had heard a long time ago that Future Military was working on a AI robot soldier that could replace flesh and blood at an affordable cost, but he didnt expect it to be completed so quickly</br>
</br>
Is there going to be a war? Cai Deye said seriously.</br>
</br>
You can say that, the man nodded, The international situation is unpredictable, and the message from above is not yet clear, but the preparation has started. You are the front line, and you must be prepared no matter whether there is a war or not. You should understand what I mean.</br>
</br>
After he put the arms list with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons into the drawer, Cai Deye looked at the man in front of his desk and nodded seriously.</br>
</br>
I understand.</br>
</br>
Great, the man nodded, Now I can report back to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
The chaos caused by the election lasted for five full days.</br>
</br>
Until Christmas was approaching, the vengeance and hate in peoples hearts finally started to dissipate as they stopped the meaningless struggles and attacks on dissidents.</br>
</br>
It turned out that time could repair any cracks. The G State militia announced its dissolution, although the leader of the militia had repeatedly stated that they will regroup under the flag at any time if necessary. Those demonstrators who were clamoring for the establishment of the California Republic also dispersed one after another and began to return to their daily routine.</br>
</br>
All impulses turned into nothing in the end.</br>
</br>
After all, life had to continue no matter what, even if there were unwilling, they could not change the fact that the person was elected.</br>
</br>
But just when everyone thought it was over, the aftermath of this farce did not stop.</br>
</br>
On Christmas Eve, Wall Street gave a big gift to Trump. The dollar index plunged two percent upon opening, the Dow Jones Index led the global stock markets down, and everything seemed to be foretelling the economic crisis that would occur a few months later</br>
</br>
Early in the morning, Jiang Chen came to the dining room after he washed up.</br>
</br>
Except for Natasha who slept too late and couldnt get up, Xia Shiyu and Ayesha almost finished breakfast.</br>
</br>
Ayesha took her plate, got up, and walked to the kitchen. Just as she walked to the entrance, she tiptoed and kissed Jiang Chens cheek. As he recollected the softness, Jiang Chen pulled out a chair and sat down.</br>
</br>
Have you read the news? Xia Shiyu started a conversation while she wiped the corners of her mouth with a napkin.</br>
</br>
I havent read it yet, is there anything interesting? With a yawn, Jiang Chen picked up todays Wall Street Journal from the side, glanced at the headline printed on the cover, and started to chuckle, The Dow Jones Index plunged, NASDAQ collapsed? When did Wall Street start to become so unstable.</br>
</br>
The aerospace sector was completely annihilated. It seemed that even the UA knew what failure to join the Earth Defense Alliance meant.</br>
</br>
Are you going to send those astronauts back? Xia Shiyu asked casually.</br>
</br>
Why not? Are we keeping them for Chinese New Year? Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Speaking of it, why do I feel that you are not surprised by the fact that Trump was elected? We threw a lot of chips on Joseph Kennedy, Xia Shiyu grinned as she looked at Jiang Chens unsound appearance, then she said jokingly, I thought you would be more disappointed.</br>
</br>
Disappointed? As if he had heard something funny, Jiang Chen laughed, turned the page of the newspaper, and said in a relaxed state, How can it be me whos disappointed. No matter who is elected, I have done all the preparations.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1444: Typhoon “Banyan“</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At noon, a layer of dense black clouds covered the originally vast blue sky above Penglai.</br>
</br>
The air felt damp and dry, and even the sound of the sea tides was mixed with a bit of hoarseness. The pedestrians quickened their steps to the subway as they hoped they could return to their home or the hotel they stayed at before the storm arrived.</br>
</br>
The majestic Penglai stood tall upon the ebb and flow of the tide, just like the mythical island that shared its name, the city was like a fairy mountain floating on the ocean.</br>
</br>
As the crystallization of the best technology in the world, the combination of the greatest achievements of architecture and materials science, this city that floated in the vast ocean was undoubtedly the brightest pearl on the Pacific Ocean. More than three million tourists were active in this futuristic city and the permanent population was more than three times that number.</br>
</br>
With a pair of AR glasses, the distance from the virtual world would be infinitely close to zero inside this city.</br>
</br>
People were fascinated by the freshness brought by the next era and admired the technology of Future Group. Whether it was the countless holographic screens or the drones that constantly flowed above the city, every detail of this city was so captivating.</br>
</br>
Cordis, look over there, its amazing, how did they come up with the idea to use these gadgets to deliver packages? God, are they not afraid of things falling down and hitting people? A female tourist from Sweden yelled out as she pointed at the series of drones that passed through the tall buildings.</br>
</br>
While she had seen the scene on the news before, the astonishment she experienced with her own eyes was far greater than the images on TV.</br>
</br>
In the years when Freemasonry was in confrontation with Future Group, few products passed EUs product quality and safety law, let alone courier drones. Many Europeans didnt realize the seriousness of the disconnection between their country and the times until they had been to Xin or the surrounding countries.</br>
</br>
Built by Future Heavy Industries. Those who can work there are monsters. I wouldnt be surprised by anything they design Damn, the weather is so hot, babe, should we go back to the hotel soon? It looks like its going to be a heavy rainstorm, The man with curly hair looked at the dark clouds in the sky and said lethargically.</br>
</br>
The weather forecast yesterday said it was sunny, but this clearly did not look sunny?</br>
</br>
At this moment, the holographic screens around the street suddenly changed. The news anchor in a suit and tie reported.</br>
</br>
Reporting on an updated weather forecast.</br>
</br>
Typhoon Banyan has passed through the Mariana Islands ten minutes ago and is expected to travel northwest along the Pacific Rims volcanic belt in the next ten days, passing through the Philippine Sea, and reaching the Dongsha Islands. According to the latest information from the Xin Meteorological Bureau, Banyans central pressure index is expected to exceed 10 million pascal, and the maximum wind speed near the center is expected to be 35 meters per second, which can be categorized as a category 5 typhoon.</br>
</br>
</br>
The route originally scheduled for December 25 is temporarily canceled. Penglai will move along the original route to the northern waters of Coro Island. The Xin Meteorological Bureau is reminding citizens and tourists to minimize marine sports in the near future to avoid potential accidents.</br>
</br>
After the anchor spoke in the official language Mandarin, he repeated it in different languages.</br>
</br>
About five minutes later, the interrupted weather forecast was finally over, the holographic screens in the streets and alleys returned to normal, and the temporarily suspended programs continued to be shown. However, Cordis and his girlfriend stood there in a daze as they listened to the discussions around them.</br>
</br>
Oh, damn, our Christmas may have to be spent in the rain.</br>
</br>
Typhoon? How did a typhoon suddenly appear?</br>
</br>
I dont know, maybe someone from the Meteorology Bureau has misread the satellite cloud pictures? Its not like it has never happened before.</br>
</br>
What surprised Cordis was not the typhoon, but the attitude of the people living here. Even with a typhoon approaching, the way they spoke about the typhoon sounded like they were just discussing ordinary bad weather.</br>
</br>
So nonchalant?</br>
</br>
This is a typhoon!</br>
</br>
Although Cordis had never seen a typhoon in person, he could still feel the horrifying power of the typhoon based on the news. However, the people on the streets only sped up to avoid the potential heavy rain, they did not have more reactions and did not panic at all.</br>
</br>
Cordis did not understand, all the tourists who came to Penglai did not understand.</br>
</br>
For people that lived here for a long time, breaking news weather forecasts were common. As for typhoon and hurricane warnings, they were nothing new.</br>
</br>
There was nothing to worry about at all.</br>
</br>
Even if the typhoon was moving in their direction, it was as simple as making a turn for Penglai. The only pity part was that with only a dozen hours left before Christmas, they would have to spend it in the downpouring rain.</br>
</br>
A hundred nautical miles from the Mariana Islands, a cruise ship undulated in the rough sea. The flag hung on the mast was blown loudly by the gusting wind, and the people on the deck grasped tightly on the railing, for fear that they could be blown away at any moment.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping looked at the lightning in the distance dumbfoundedly. As his attention slipped for a second, his mouth was filled with heavy wind.</br>
</br>
He lowered his head and patted his chest for a while before he finally got his composure back and squeezed a sentence from the slits between his teeth.</br>
</br>
The person who designed this weapon must be crazy.</br>
</br>
It was the closest location to the edge of the typhoon and the closest location this cruise ship could approach. Although the wind was strong, it was generally safe. If they were a few nautical miles further in, the deck would be unsafe.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping was forcibly dragged here from his Presidential Palace by Jiang Chen. At first, Zhang Yaping was curious about this trip, but now the only thought in his head was to get out of this place.</br>
</br>
Crazy? Haha, perhaps! But it is said that this thing was designed to avoid economic losses caused by natural disasters. The howling wind blew up the hair on his forehead. Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he focused on the plaster-like milky white air mass at the horizon, he raised his voice and shouted, And we just amplified, amplified, and then amplified its function! And with proper guidance, natural disasters can appear in specific areas, and it will become a weapon.</br>
</br>
Its said that? Zhang Yaping tightly grabbed onto the railing with both of his hands as he looked at Jiang Chen unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
It is said?</br>
</br>
Didnt you make this thing?</br>
</br>
Thats right, Jiang Chen nodded in the strong wind, and even though it was not easy to do so, he still squeezed a smile from his stiffened face, It is said.</br>
</br>
In fact, including the Holy Shield System, many dark technologies before 2150 were designed with good intentions. It was not until the economic crisis that hit the world that they gradually deteriorated under the influence of some ambitious schemers.</br>
</br>
What I want to ask is how far can this thing affect? Zhang Yaping laboriously spoke against the howling wind, Dont tell me that we have to create this giant thing in front of our door every time and then push it out.</br>
</br>
Of course not! Jiang Chen laughed, Every inch of land, ocean, and glacier shrouded by the atmosphere is under the interference of our weather forecast! As long as I want, I can create a sandstorm in the Sahara Desert on the other side of the Earth! The only question is how much energy is needed!</br>
</br>
This is simply Zhang Yaping swallowed down the dry lump in his throat</br>
</br>
What only God can do, you want to say this, right? Jiang Chen laughed and patted Zhang Yaping on the shoulder, Lets go, Ive seen enough. Its time to go back!</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1445: A Visitor From South Colombia</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Yesterday, Typhoon Banyan passed through the Mariana Islands and headed northwest towards the Philippine Sea. Affected by the typhoon, the eighty UA Navy ships docked at the Guam Military Base were forced to temporarily relocate. Scholars affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization have yet to provide an official explanation to the reason Typhoon Banyan formed. Some scholars claimed that the reason why a typhoon of this scale formed in December may be due to global warming</br>
</br>
International organizations have dispatched rescue teams to Country F and Malaysia for emergency response. It remains to be seen what kind of impact Banyan will have on the Asia-Pacific region. Next, a professor from the University of Colombia</br>
</br>
The morning news played on the TV while a simple and nutritious breakfast was placed on the table. However, Timoshenko, who was in front of the table, was focused on neither. He stared at the map on the wall.</br>
</br>
To be precise, he was looking at the dotted line on the map.</br>
</br>
The dotted line that divided the country into two.</br>
</br>
If Joseph Kennedy was elected and the UA joined the Earth Defense Alliance in anticipation, the relationship between the two countries was bound to be in a honeymoon period for a long time, and it was unlikely that Celestial would support him in continuing this war.</br>
</br>
In the worst case, Colombia could even become the second Korean peninsula. The two countries shared the same heritage, same tradition, the same language, but because they were caught between two superpowers, they were forced to be divided into two countries</br>
</br>
He had no hope at all.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, Trump won.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was relieved when he saw the results of the election.</br>
</br>
In addition, Celestial Trade had been amassing troops in South Colombia recently, which made him see the dawn of an unified Colombia.</br>
</br>
During this period, his subordinates had been advising him to seize this opportunity to create a border incident and tear up the armistice agreement. It was just that Celestial Trade had been silent, which made him hesitant on making the decision. Celestial Trade could accept the consequence of Colombia turning out of control, but he could not bear the consequence of being abandoned by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Push back everything on my schedule for the day. If you cant push it, get Antonio to go for me. The breakfast on the table was barely touched as Timoshenko pushed back the chair and stood up. Then he looked at the assistant beside him, Arrange a flight for me. Im going to Xin.</br>
</br>
Is it too rushed? The assistant hesitated, It will take at least three working days to submit an application for a state visit to the Xin Embassy through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</br>
</br>
Apply directly to Celestial Trade. They will arrange it for us. Timoshenko interrupted his assistant, paused, then continued, If I didnt overthink, Jiang Chen should also want to see me now.</br>
</br>
</br>
I heard that there was a typhoon there. You have to be careful not to be blown away.</br>
</br>
The typhoon is at the Mariana Islands. Its far away from me. It will at most rain a few times. On the phone, Jiang Chen listened to Liu Yaos playful words and laughed, Have you been busy lately?</br>
</br>
Not as busy as you, Liu Yao pouted and with a hint of complaint in her tone, Humph, men are all the same. You all like the next one. After you got those two little lovers in Nippon, you completely forgot about me.</br>
</br>
How come, Jiang Chen was confused as he tried to defend himself, were you not filming when I went to Nippon last time? So, I didnt invite you.</br>
</br>
The way she got jealous was a bit strange.</br>
</br>
She was not jealous of Ayesha or Xia Shiyu, instead, she was jealous of Qian Xia and Officer Kwai.</br>
</br>
Really? Liu Yao asked suspiciously.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
Hehe, then I can rest assured. Wherever you go next time, remember to bring me! Promise</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had to admit that Liu Yao was the most sophisticated in the art of being jealous. She could satisfy Jiang Chens vanity while also ensuring he was not tired or annoyed. This was also what Jiang Chen was most satisfied with.</br>
</br>
It was also why Liu Yao could go from a little-known actress to a star in Asia.</br>
</br>
From her background, who else could compete with her?</br>
</br>
The phone call with Liu Yao was Jiang Chens quick moment of relaxation. After a few more words, Jiang Chen hung up and picked up the document again.</br>
</br>
This document was the outline of the meeting in the afternoon. He had to review it before the meeting.</br>
</br>
In the past few days, Jiang Chen had been busy with Celestial Trades deployment. The senior officers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force on New Moon Island had held more than a dozen meetings. The meetings included the expansion of the military, raising the military budget, formulating combat plans for possible partial or even full-scale wars</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that Timoshenko did indeed overthink. Jiang Chen had no plans to see him at all.</br>
</br>
South Colombia was a very critical component in the strategic plan of Celestial Trade in South America. However, the so-called critical component was only from geographical factors. It would be better to count on Moro soldiers than South Colombia soldiers in a war.</br>
</br>
Of course, since he was already here, Jiang Chen had to see him to ensure that they maintained a good relationship.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen received the call from the embassy, he thought about it for a moment, then called Ivan to cancel the afternoon meeting. In the meeting room of the Future Building, Jiang Chen met Timoshenko, the warlord who disturbed the calmness of South America.</br>
</br>
Strictly speaking, it was the third time the two had met. The first time was when the Colombian Civil War just broke out, and the second time was at the Coro City International Defense Exhibition. Every time Jiang Chen saw this old warlord, he noticed that there were more white hairs around his ears.</br>
</br>
After a simple greeting, Jiang Chen invited Timoshenko to sit down. The receptionist that stood on the side poured tea for the two, then respectfully exited the room.</br>
</br>
How do you like those pilots? After he touched the teacup with his finger to test the temperature, Jiang Chen retracted his right hand, looked at Timoshenko, and smiled, I mean the ones produced by Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
Very easy to use. Your technical prowess is impressive. After a pause, Timoshenko continued, But you know, Im not here today to discuss this.</br>
</br>
In the Colombian Civil War, Russia was the second-biggest winner after Celestial Trade. After Timoshenko got the loan from Future Bank, the first thing he did was spend money, buy equipment, and arm his second-tier army. Arms orders of more than three billion dollars had helped Russian military companies reduced a lot of accumulated inventory. For example, Timoshenko bought an entire squadron of MiG-29s.</br>
</br>
As for the pilots, they were naturally the Matador electronic pilots bought from the defense exhibition.</br>
</br>
I know what you want to discuss, Jiang Chen said softly while he looked back at Timoshenko, My suggestion is to wait patiently.</br>
</br>
How long shall we wait? Timoshenko quickly responded, Our people long for unity.</br>
</br>
I cant give you a specific time, but if you have paid attention to our actions, it should not be difficult to see that we have already begun to make preparations for this, Jiang Chen said. We also hope that Colombia can be restored to unity. After all, a unified Colombia is more in line with the interests of Celestial Trade in South America. On this point, our position is the same.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw the anxiety in Timoshenkos eyes, he paused for a moment, and his tone carried a hint of warning.</br>
</br>
In addition, Mr. Timoshenko, I have to remind you that during this period of time, please restrain your subordinates and exercise caution. Regardless of whether there will be unpleasant wars in the future, you must ensure at this time that you remain calm. The last time you arrogantly advocated an early revolution and disrupted our plan. I dont want to hold you accountable, but I hope that was the last time.</br>
</br>
Trump would visit Xin after taking office.</br>
</br>
Even though he did not have many expectations for the diplomatic visit, Jiang Chen still planned to make the next decision after his meeting with the new president.</br>
</br>
As Harmonys Space Colonization Ship approached, if he could avoid unnecessary internal friction, he would do anything possible to ensure no conflicts happened. However, if this president who pursued the concept of UA First was really as tough as he promised in his campaign speech</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could only say that Celestial Trade would never make a compromise.</br>
</br>
However, plans always change. While he was preparing for war while he waited for the transfer of power to happen in North America, the Colombian people posed a difficult problem for him</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1446: Border Inciden</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was not just South Colombia that saw the dawn of unification.</br>
</br>
Trumps rise into power also gave the President of North Colombia, Vargas hope.</br>
</br>
Six months ago, the former Colombian president was assassinated. As the vice president, he stepped into power and took control of the military and political power of North Colombia with the assistance of NATO. Even though the civil war was unsuccessful from the very start, he always believed that the failure of the war was not because of NATOs inability to defeat Celestial Trade, but the weak Hill government that led the war.</br>
</br>
Although Celestial Trade is slightly superior in military technology, war has never been a simple competition of science and technology. In addition to scientific and technological factors, many other factors determine the outcome of war, including industrial strength, economic strength, and diplomatic strength. I believe I dont need to explain these further. You all should understand.</br>
</br>
At the highest meeting of the Colombian Military Commission, Vargas knocked his fist on the table and said loudly.</br>
</br>
Although North Colombia was incomparable to Celestial Trade from all factors, Celestial Trade could not compete with the giant war machine known as NATO in any of the factors mentioned before.</br>
</br>
The advantage of Celestial Trade was based on small-scale wars. If the war escalated, Xin would definitely be dragged into the Colombia battlefield that was enough to swallow it in the mess. The left-leaning Democratic Party could not make a decisive decision against Celestial Trade, but the right-wing Republican Party was different, even for an ultra-conservative like Trump.</br>
</br>
Once a total war broke out, the outcome for that damned yellow-skinned monkey would be sent to the gallows by the UA soldiers.</br>
</br>
Just like the fate of Saddam!</br>
</br>
The outcome of a small-scale war cannot explain any problems. As long as the battlefield expands beyond Colombia, NATO will squeeze Celestial Trade to death like an ant!</br>
</br>
Vargas passionate speech ended but the entire conference room was silent.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for about three seconds before applause filled the room.</br>
</br>
The applause gradually ceased.</br>
</br>
The key of the problem is, will the UA really escalate the war against Celestial Trade for us? After the General of North Colombia heard President Vargass speech, he said hesitantly, If the war escalates, even if NATO eventually wins, the price paid will not be small.</br>
</br>
Until last week, I was thinking about the same question, One corner of Vargas mouth was turned up as he continued, But just the day before yesterday, Wall Street gave us a gift.</br>
</br>
There were small chatters around the table as the members present looked at each other in confusion.</br>
</br>
The discussion was focused on Celestial Trade and NATO a second ago, how did the topic suddenly change to Wall Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just two days ago, our Columbia Unity Foundation received two billion dollars in donations, and on the list of donation signatures, the names of Morgan, Rockefeller, Martin, and Bush appeared. On the table, the excitement in his tone could not be concealed. Vargas glanced around at the military committee members present, Comrades, think about it, what does this mean? It means that Wall Street, which represents the elites of North America, is already on our side. North Americas military-industrial complex is already on our side!</br>
</br>
Only then did the expressions on everyones face begin to change.</br>
</br>
Military-industrial complex.</br>
</br>
Many people were still unconvinced when they heard the name Wall Street. But when they heard the military-industrial complex, almost everyone looked joyful. A huge interest group composed of the military, military-industrial enterprises, and some members of Congress. It was one of the most powerful political forces in North America that contracted almost 90% of the UA foreign wars from the 1950s to the present.</br>
</br>
After the fall of Goldman Sachs, who didnt know who the arms giant in North America was?</br>
</br>
This list gave everyone hope that they could reclaim their lost territory.</br>
</br>
The opinions of Wall Street cannot represent the opinions of the UA government, but this list of donations can be used as a reference, the Supreme Commander of North Columbia said solemnly, To be on the safe side, we can create some border tensions to test the reactions of South Colombia, Celestial Trade, and the UA.</br>
</br>
Lets execute your plan! Vargas said.</br>
</br>
On December 26th, the atmosphere of Christmas had yet to completely fade, and the snowy streets at Town of Caucasia in the north of Antioquia were still filled with the fragrance of roast turkey and turrn. Evergreen trees, red ribbons, and big bells decorated the streets. Children laughed and chased each other around the snowman, and adults walked together in groups as they chatted and laughed.</br>
</br>
The tavern on the corner of the street was like a stove that turned peoples passion for winter into the fragrance of malt beer. Although due to the war, this years Christmas atmosphere was slightly more depressing compared to usual, peoples wish for tomorrow remained unchanged.</br>
</br>
Everyone believed that tomorrow would be better. North and South Colombia would eventually reach unification again, the outposts and border posts outside the town would be removed, and the villagers who worked in Montreal could return home for Christmas next year</br>
</br>
At this time, I should be drinking beer by a warm fireplace instead of standing guard in this sh*tty place. The soldier in a thick snowsuit and carried an AK47 rifle squatted by the fire. He loosened the collar stuck to this neck, then looked at the forests not far away, Seriously, even soldiers need a vacation.</br>
</br>
Lets talk about something happy. Maybe the war will end next year?</br>
</br>
Haha, that is a good joke.</br>
</br>
With a bit of sorrow in his laughter, the captain used a branch and fiddled with the fire. The soldier who had spoken before became silent.</br>
</br>
At that moment, the sound of a car engine was heard not far away.</br>
</br>
There is some noise.</br>
</br>
The captain tossed the branch into the fire, stood up from the ground with his rifle, Carlos, go outside and have a look.</br>
</br>
Ok.</br>
</br>
Carlos patted down the snow on his lap, then gestured to the soldier on top of the sentry tower as he walked out of the topside with his rifle. He stopped in the middle of the road and raised his right hand at the van that came from North Colombia.</br>
</br>
The van came to a halt slowly, the door opened, and a man wearing a thick leather jacket and a knitted hat on his head got out of the van.</br>
</br>
Youre entering South Columbia, show me your ID, Carlos said.</br>
</br>
The man didnt speak and just put his hand in his pocket.</br>
</br>
However, what he took out was not some sort of ID but a pistol.</br>
</br>
Pewpew!</br>
</br>
Two unsuspected gunshots ignited the gun battle outside the post.</br>
</br>
Carlos was shot in the chest. He collapsed in the snow as his limbs gradually lost consciousness.</br>
</br>
He saw masked soldiers get out of the van in his dying consciousness, then army boots stepped past him. After a brief exchange of fire, they quickly rushed into the border post.</br>
</br>
The gunshots seemed to dissipate, along with his consciousness.</br>
</br>
About ten minutes later, the townspeople of Caucasia were surprised to see smoke from the outpost.</br>
</br>
When the border guards stationed nearby arrived, all the people who attacked the outpost had left. The only thing they left was an outpost raging in fire, a wall full of bullet marks, and a South Colombia flag that was half burned</br>
</br>
On the day of the incident, President Timoshenko of South Colombia happened to be in Coro City for a state visit</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1447: On The Brink of War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There was an accident at the border, Jiang Chen looked at Timoshenko, smirked, then tossed the paper on the table, Though I guess you already knew about it.</br>
</br>
The headline of the newspaper was exactly the tragedy that happened on the border between North and South Colombia. The spokespersons of both sides immediately came out with statements that accused the other side of causing the attack, which made the situation even more confusing.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chens thought Timoshenko self-directed and acted out this incident. After all, he really couldnt believe that North Columbia dared to tear up the ceasefire agreement after the brutal defeat.</br>
</br>
However, Timoshenkos performance was too realistic. The pupils gleaming with anger, the tightly clenched fists, all made it look like it was real.</br>
</br>
These scumbags! Shameful liars! They tore up the ceasefire agreement! He cursed in Spanish, which Jiang Chen couldnt understand. Like an angry bull, Timoshenko grinded his teeth.</br>
</br>
Although he cursed, he and his men had planned yesterday whether they should create an incident on the border as an excuse to tear up the ceasefire agreement. But coincidentally, North Colombia also shared the same thought, and was the first to act, and even accused North Colombia that this attack was self-directed and self-acted.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how Timoshenko acted, Jiang Chen opened the flashing watch, leaned back against the chair, and answered the call.</br>
</br>
The call was from Ayesha.</br>
</br>
As soon as she received the news, Ghost Agents stationed in South America rushed to the scene of the incident. Through investigation, it was preliminarily determined that the attackers were the original Colombian Navy Special Force.</br>
</br>
This special force and the FARC led by Timoshenko were old enemies. When South Colombia was not called South Colombia, and the FARC were still guerrillas fighting in the Andes, this special force were Colombias main counterinsurgency and anti-drug force. Many FARC executives died in the hands of this special force.</br>
</br>
I see.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, hung up the phone, then focused his attention back on Timoshenko.</br>
</br>
The North Columbia Navy Special Force attacked the border post. You should be familiar with this name.</br>
</br>
Ill remember them even if they turn to ashes, Timoshenko said with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
Ill lend you my Aerospace G100, and you will return home this afternoon. After a pause, Jiang Chen continued, I know what you are thinking, but I still maintain what I said before. Keep calm before the opportunity comes.</br>
</br>
They are literally in our face, and youre telling me to keep calm? The people are waiting to see my reaction. Tell me, how can I keep calm? Timoshenko said angrily.</br>
</br>
Ill allow you to retaliate against them appropriately, but no matter what, you must remember that maintaining the ceasefire agreement is our bottom line. Before getting my permission, if you tear up the ceasefire agreement without authorization, you will bear the consequences yourself. Jiang Chen stared into Timchenkos eyes and said in an irrefutable tone.</br>
</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for about a minute, and Timchenkos finally nodded reluctantly.</br>
</br>
Okay.</br>
</br>
In the afternoon, the silver Aerospace G100, propelled by a ray of blue light, disappeared above the clouds. Jiang Chen lent his plane to Timoshenko so that he could return home as soon as possible and stabilize the situation in South Colombia.</br>
</br>
The six soldiers at the border post were killed, and the walls were sprayed with insulting graffiti.</br>
</br>
The pro-war faction in South Colombia was enraged by the humiliating action. Even the pro-peace supporters that originally supported the maintenance of the status quo were silent on this issue as they planned to change their status. This accident made everyone feel angry, and the anger was becoming increasingly uncontrollable.</br>
</br>
It was impossible to do nothing. After Timoshenko returned home with Jiang Chens permission for limited retaliation, he immediately convened the Supreme Military Commission of South Colombia to formulate a retaliation.</br>
</br>
It was too low-level to carry out the same attack on the border, and North Colombia was definitely prepared at this moment. If it was not carefully planned, the attack could be detected, and it would be difficult to explain. Timoshenko chose another angle and sent more than two hundred well-trained guerrillas across the border.</br>
</br>
All electricity, water, and communication facilities were included in the targets of the attack. During a period, there were frequent fires at the North Columbia power plants, power failures occurred in the entire city, and civil communications were interrupted from time to time. These incidents had created headaches for the North Columbia authorities for a while. They had to seek help from the CIB to curtail the harassment of these guerrillas.</br>
</br>
Of course, this alone was not enough.</br>
</br>
In order to calm the anger of the pro-war faction and to prevent internal injuries caused by pent-up anger, on the morning of December 30th, there was a sudden explosion in a military camp on the outskirts of Monteria, North Colombia. A total of six soldiers died on the spot, two were seriously injured, and 17 soldiers were slightly injured.</br>
</br>
North Colombia declared a national state of emergency, and at the same time condemned South Colombias attack as an act of terrorism and threatened to not rule out the use of military means to respond to this attack.</br>
</br>
Just when North and South Colombia condemned each other as the side that provoked, NATO suddenly took a new stance.</br>
</br>
At the NATO foreign ministers meeting held in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, the NATO Secretary General revealed a piece of breaking news in his speech</br>
</br>
NATO would send four more modern divisions to South Colombia within a year to stabilize the turbulent situation in South America</br>
</br>
Bernice traced a donation, and there are many interesting names on the donation list, Inside the office of the mansion, Ayesha reported to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The recipient is? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
The Columbia Unification Foundation is a fund specially established by the North Colombian government to facilitate the receipt of financial assistance from National Endowment for Democracy and purchase of arms from North American arms dealers through legal channels. Ayesha gently placed a list on the desk, then said, There are quite a few names are on it.</br>
</br>
After he looked at some of the incredible surnames on the list, Jiang Chen thought for a moment and said.</br>
</br>
If we publish the list</br>
</br>
It doesnt make much sense. This list seems to be semi-public. Ayesha shook her head and said, And there is no direct evidence to prove that this donation is directly related to the incident that occurred on the border.</br>
</br>
I see His finger lightly tapped on the armrest as he cast his gaze outside of the window, he said thoughtfully, Is there any news from North America?</br>
</br>
One more thing, Ayesha nodded. The day before the NATO foreign ministers meeting, a high-level military meeting was also held in the Capitol. We are unsure about the agenda of the meeting, but it is believed that the topics of the meeting are related to the defense budget</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1448: New Year</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On New Years Day 2021, history flipped to a new page.</br>
</br>
To the surprise of the World Meteorological Organization, typhoon Banyan did not make its way onshore. Instead, it disintegrated abnormally after it arrived at Dongsha Islands, which made residents in Southeast Asia and Hua relieved.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the abnormal snowfall that occurred in northern South America and Central America this year also surprised the international meteorological community. The abnormal weather around the world seemed to be an indication that the international situation this year could be more uncertain than last year.</br>
</br>
On New Years Day, Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu went back to their parents house and stayed for two days.</br>
</br>
Because they were from the same hometown, and since they were neighbors after they moved here, the two families were very close. Papa Jiang and Papa Xia often fished together and competed in fishing once in a while. As for the marine fish that they catch every time, the two elders obviously couldnt finish them all. In the end, they either ended in Jiang Chens stomach or were sent to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Even if work was busy, Jiang Chen would always spend a few days every month at home to have a few meals and chat.</br>
</br>
Although he could let his parents live a prosperous life, there were some things that could not be replaced by wealth.</br>
</br>
Chen, Mom knows that you are busy with work now, but youre not young anymore. You should get married soon. I think Old Xias daughter is pretty good, why dont you consider her? Mama Jiang was making dumplings in the kitchen as she nagged Jiang Chen about his marriage.</br>
</br>
From the year before till now, there was no news at all, and his parents started to get a little worried.</br>
</br>
Mom, dont worry, marriage will come sooner or later. Its just that Im still too busy at work now, its not the right time</br>
</br>
Whats not the right time! Mama Jiang glared at Jiang Chen, and pressed the wrapped dumplings on the board, Im not asking you to bring up the child, you just need to give birth.</br>
</br>
With a helpless expression on his face, Jiang Chen was speechless for a while as he chopped up dumpling fillings with a kitchen knife.</br>
</br>
Every time he came home, his mother would touch on this problem that he didnt want to face at this stage. He didnt want to wrong any of the relationships he maintained, but if he married them all, he didnt know how to make his parents accept this reality.</br>
</br>
Maybe time could solve this problem.</br>
</br>
Of course, perhaps it was his wishful thinking</br>
</br>
Finally, Jiang Chen seized the opportunity and quickly changed the subject.</br>
</br>
By the way, did you drink the health supplements I sent you on time?</br>
</br>
Those so-called health supplements were life-prolonging drugs that extend DNA telomeres. In order to prevent changes from being too abrupt, each tube was mixed and diluted with other body-building medicines and had to be taken every day.</br>
</br>
</br>
The reason for saying they were health supplements was the same reason as to why he was not willing to confess about Ayesha and Natasha. He was purely worried that the two elders would not be able to accept it.</br>
</br>
Weve been drinking it every day on time. Your parents health is very good, so dont worry about it. Also, in the future, dont buy these health supplements. Even if you have money, dont waste it. Have you not heard? All health supplements are made to fool people!</br>
</br>
While they chatted about the health supplements, Mama Jiang scolded Jiang Chen again.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen listened tentatively, but he was laughing in his mind.</br>
</br>
The so-called health supplements were not only unavailable in the market, but if they were sold, countless people would cry and beg to buy them</br>
</br>
By the way, at the end of the month, your dad and I are going to go back to our hometown. Will you go with us? We havent been back for a long time. I heard that our home has changed quite a bit.</br>
</br>
I wont go back. Jiang Chen smiled and said, You guys have fun over there.</br>
</br>
At night, the family ate dumplings together.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waited until the bell rang on New Years Day before he went back to the room upstairs to sleep.</br>
</br>
It was the first time he slept alone for a while, and he slept particularly peacefully.</br>
</br>
Early in the morning of the next day, Jiang Chen got up, washed up, and ate breakfast. After he greeted his parents, he left the house and drove to the Coro International Airport.</br>
</br>
With flights between the Mars Colony and Celestial City commencing at the end of last year, the first passenger ship from Mars to Earth had arrived at the port of Celestial City. The ship not only brought the few astronauts from the UA stranded in the colony, but as well as the two hundred researchers that inoculated the Flowers of Memory.</br>
</br>
Soon after Jiang Chen arrived at the airport, he received a call from Kelvin as soon as he got on the Aerospace G100.</br>
</br>
The researchers inoculated with the Flowers of Memory have arrived in Celestial City. They are now temporarily placed in the Special Project Research Institute of the Space Department and await your next instructions.</br>
</br>
I will arrive in Celestial City soon, Jiang Chen checked the time on his watch, At about twelve oclock.</br>
</br>
Ill wait for you at the airport.</br>
</br>
No need, just wait for me at the Special Projects Institute.</br>
</br>
After he hung up, he gestured to the flight attendants and indicated that they could depart.</br>
</br>
Propelled by a trail of blue tail flame, the Aerospace G100 accelerated through the atmosphere and finally reached the synchronous orbit.</br>
</br>
Todays synchronous orbit was much more crowded than when the space elevator first started construction.</br>
</br>
The Aerospace G100 passed through the satellites floating around Celestial City, as well as the functional units and small space stations connected by various pipelines. The engine behind the Aerospace G100 gleamed with a faint light and slowly moved towards the port.</br>
</br>
The hatch door that covered an area of 1,000 square meters slowly opened to make way for the Aerospace G100s vertical landing.</br>
</br>
This newly built spaceport looked quite empty. After all, only a few Aerospace G100s were manufactured, and they were difficult to buy even with money. Naturally, there were only a handful of people who experienced this new spaceport.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen arrived at the Special Projects Institute of the Space Department by train, then met Kelvin and Dr. Amos.</br>
</br>
Compared to the time when Dr. Amos left Celestial City half a year ago, he had lost a lot of weight. It was rumored that it took a lot of effort to overcome the cognitive barrier for food. For a long time, he had to drink liquid food to maintain his daily energy consumption.</br>
</br>
How do you feel? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Not bad, Amos shrugged. At least now I wont drool when I see Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
Haha, if you would like to eat it, I can ask the people at specimen to prepare one for you, Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
Come on, I want to live a few more years. Dr. Amos also laughed along.</br>
</br>
Even the blood of the Devil Worm was highly corrosive and composed of organic acids. To the species on Earth, every part of the worm was poisonous. Even Bear Grylls would refuse to eat the Devil Worm. Only the native Mars species considered it a delicacy.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1449: It Has To Do With Our Time</br>
</div></br>
</br>
They didnt just stand at the door. Kelvin took the two to the B3 floor, where the Special Projects Institute was located, and led them to the office at the end of the hall.</br>
</br>
It was a huge scientific research center and a semi-enclosed housing facility. In addition to scientific research facilities, there were also living and entertainment facilities.</br>
</br>
Almost all researchers involved in S-class confidential scientific research projects had reported to here before. The more than two hundred researchers that returned from the Mars colony were temporarily placed here at this moment. Except for Amos and other special researchers with S-class authority, most people would have to spend several years here before they could return to society.</br>
</br>
Of course, Celestial Trade was also generous with the compensation for these devotees.</br>
</br>
Not only was the direct bonus for each person over 10 million Xin New dollars, but everyone was also permitted to inject ten years of DNA telomere extension agents as compensation for their contributions. These terms were written in the confidentiality agreement and were completely voluntary.</br>
</br>
I know you are more concerned about how many weapons we can dig from the graves of the Gaia civilization, but what I want to say next may disappoint you. In the two aspects of space technology and military technology, the Gaia civilization had no significant achievement. They completed the unity very early through the unique method within their species and maintained peace and stability for thousands of years. And according to my research and in the later stages of the civilization, they may have realized the so-called utopia, Dr. Amos said.</br>
</br>
Not all civilizations are keen on researching tools for killing the same kind.</br>
</br>
Using the standards of human civilization to analogize extraterrestrial civilizations, thinking that the civilization theory based on human history, culture, and behavior habits are universal, and it is itself an ignorant and arrogant behavior.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen had considered this possibility a long time ago, after he heard Dr. Amoss words in person, he couldnt help feeling a little disappointed. However, before he had time to be disappointed, Amoss next sentence made him see the light again.</br>
</br>
But that being said, based on the theoretical knowledge left by the Gaia civilization, it is not impossible to develop weapons capable of fighting colonial ships of which are beyond our times, Dr. Amos continued after a pause. As you know, science and technology are two different things. The former determines the development potential of the latter, while we mainly inherit the former.</br>
</br>
Can you finish talking in one go? Jiang Chen complained.</br>
</br>
Amos smiled and chose not to respond to that question. However, he continued on this topic, In addition, I found that the Gaia civilization has a deep understanding of the Klein particles. Their understanding between the three-dimensional world and the four-dimensional world has completely subverted my understanding of this kind of particle that only exists in concepts.</br>
</br>
</br>
Oh?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Amos unexpectedly, only to see the latter nod before he continued.</br>
</br>
In their research on Klein particles, I found a very interesting phenomenon. It is about the short-lived form of Klein particles when they collapse from four dimensions to three dimensions and the form of energy conversion across the three-dimensional coordinate system.</br>
</br>
Kelvin, who stood next to Amos, was confused. With a frown, he asked, What do you mean? Can you make it clearer?</br>
</br>
Since his profession did not match this topic, it was difficult to conversate.</br>
</br>
Kelvin came from building spacecraft, therefore he didnt understand a word Amos said.</br>
</br>
However, Dr. Amos didnt say anything more. He just looked at the clock on the wall and said.</br>
</br>
It has to do with our time.</br>
</br>
On January 29th, Trump officially took office.</br>
</br>
On the podium, Trump, in a suit, excitedly delivered his impassioned inauguration speech to his supporters below the stage and the media.</br>
</br>
Thank you the people of our country, the people of the world, thank you.</br>
</br>
On this great day today, we have transferred power from Capital to the hands of the people, that is, yours.</br>
</br>
For a long time, the fruits of our labor have been taken by a small group of people, and the cost has to be borne by all of our citizens. Capital is thriving, Wall Street is making a lot of money, and our people have not shared the wealth. They use the interests of one group of people to buy the votes from another group, flaunting the so-called political correctness to change their image. And this is why our welfare is getting higher and higher, but life is getting worse and worse, and there is fewer and fewer job opportunities. The economy is deteriorating, and countless factories are closing</br>
</br>
Its time to change everything. Get those lazy refugees out of our country, send criminals who crossed the border illegally to where they belong, and say no to the barbaric third world gangsters.</br>
</br>
Thank you again, thank you for choosing me, and I will lead this country back to greatness, thank you!</br>
</br>
After the transfer of power was completed, Trump nominated the cabinet members of the new government within a week and formed his own leadership team. Including the former Secretary of State Kerry, the current Secretary of Defense Carter, all officials had gone through a major change in this power shift.</br>
</br>
Oil tycoon Rex Tillerson was appointed as the new Secretary of State; James Mattis, a war hawk among the war hawks and a retired Marine Corps Four-Star General, was appointed as the new Secretary of Defense; Steve Bannon, who served as the soul of Trump campaign team, transformed from a far-right media executive chairman to the Chief Strategist and Senior Adviser of the President</br>
</br>
From the perspective of the composition of the cabinet, apart from a few positions reserved for the supporters of the Republican Party, Trump used the Secretary of State to repair the tense relationship with Wall Street while at the same time, added a war hawk into his team.</br>
</br>
Finally, as promised earlier, he made Xin the first stop of his diplomatic visits and revealed to the media that the Colombia, UA military in Nippon, space resource development, and the most sensitive issue of alliance membership would be discussed in the upcoming meeting.</br>
</br>
While surprised by the efficiency of the new UA President, the outside world shared a pessimistic view about his ability to solve problems.</br>
</br>
However, there were still some voices that had a sliver of hope.</br>
</br>
What if the dream did come true?</br>
</br>
What if the Earth Defense Alliance returned to the UN framework?</br>
</br>
What if</br>
</br>
There were no what-ifs.</br>
</br>
Just three days before Trumps visit to Xin, Celestial and the UA increased their troops in South and North Colombia by 100,000 respectively, and added a bundle of dry firewood to the burning stove in Colombia.</br>
</br>
Before it started, a layer of gloom had already shadowed this meeting.</br>
</br>
And, compared to a negotiation, it was more like a final showdown.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1450: Sugar Cube Diplomacy</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the early morning of February 10th, a silver-white jet landed on the runway of Coro International Airport.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by a group of men and women in suit, Trump walked down the gangway with his head held high, waved to the cameras on both sides, and went up to Zhang Yaping. He smiled and shook hands with him. No matter how tense the relation between the two countries, they still had to appear friendly.</br>
</br>
On behalf of the people of Xin, welcome.</br>
</br>
Thank you. On behalf of the people of the UA, I would like to express my gratitude to you for your warm welcome After Trump let go of Zhang Yapings right hand, he looked around the airport, Why do I feel There seems to be someone missing here?</br>
</br>
What do you mean? Zhang Yaping asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Oh, you mean Mr. Jiang, Zhang Yaping said with a smile. He is waiting for you in Future Building.</br>
</br>
Trump raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he was a little surprised by the fact that Jiang Chen did not show up to greet him at the airport.</br>
</br>
But at any rate, he was also a well-known celebrity on talk shows. This kind of small awkwardness was normal for Trump, so he didnt mind at all. After a brief conversation with Zhang Yaping, he went to the Xin Presidential Palace along with the senior officials from Xin.</br>
</br>
At noon, Xin Presidential Palace had set up a state banquet in the Heart of the Sea to welcome the delegation from UA.</br>
</br>
The state banquet was not particularly pleasant. He constantly sipped on the wine while he searched in the banquet hall for Jiang Chens presence. However, the situation made him feel awkward again. It seemed that Jiang Chen did not plan to discuss sensitive issues with him in front of the media, so he did not attend the banquet at all.</br>
</br>
At last, it was the end of the state banquet. Trump delegated the afternoon visit to the Xin Presidential Palace to his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as he headed to the Future Building on the other side of Coro City.</br>
</br>
At last, they met.</br>
</br>
He finally met Jiang Chen in the meeting room of Future Building.</br>
</br>
I have been looking forward to this meeting for a long time ago. I didnt expect it to be difficult to meet you, Trump walked into the room, then said while he looked at Jiang Chen in front of the table.</br>
</br>
I just dont want our conversation to be on someones talk show. According to my observations, compared to when you are in front of the camera, you are calmer in a place without it. Jiang Chen smiled politely, made a gesture to Trump to invite him to take a seat, Its better for us, isnt it?</br>
</br>
Trump pulled out a chair and sat down.</br>
</br>
Let the guest come to the door by themselves, is this the way you treat your guest?</br>
</br>
You and Zhang Yaping are both presidents. It doesnt seem to be impolite to let him greet you. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Really? Trump raised an eyebrow, and said in a meaningful tone, Who doesnt know that Zhang Yaping is a puppet.</br>
</br>
</br>
It doesnt matter whether he is a puppet or not, he also relied on votes to get to his current position, Jiang Chen said, Just like you.</br>
</br>
Trump was about to refute, but he found what Jiang Chen said made sense.</br>
</br>
He also rose to power because of votes from the people of the UA.</br>
</br>
Except that when Jiang Chen compared him to a puppet president, it still made him feel unpleasant.</br>
</br>
Dear God, I became president because of my own abilities!</br>
</br>
For now, Mr. Trump was still unaware of the roles Morgan and Rockefeller played behind this election.</br>
</br>
Enough of the nonsense, your time and my time are both precious, there is no need to waste it on irrelevant topics, Trump waved his hand impatiently, then continued, If you have no objection, lets just get to todays topic.</br>
</br>
If there were reporters standing here, he would still be interested in taking a tough stance and banter with Jiang Chen. However, since all the reporters and cameras were stopped downstairs at the door of Future Building, he lost his desire to act tough.</br>
</br>
I agree with your point of view. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Very well, lets talk about the mess in Colombia first. I ask you to immediately</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lifted his right hand and interrupted Trumps speech.</br>
</br>
If we continue to talk like this, there will be no results. I seem to know how todays meeting will end, with no agreement reached between us. So, since you and I are both businessmen, I think you are tired of the way politicians do things. Why dont we change to a negotiation method that you and I are both familiar with? Jiang Chen smiled and pointed to the porcelain plate in front of Trump, Do you see the sugar cubes there?</br>
</br>
Trump raised his eyebrows, slightly narrowed his eyes, and stared at the small plate of sugar cubes on the table, as if he was trying to decipher the mystery behind the sugar cubes.</br>
</br>
But regardless of how he looked at them, they were just ordinary sugar cubes.</br>
</br>
Now we have the same amount of chips, ten sugar cubes in total,</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed to the porcelain plate in front of him and smiled, We each put forward an equivalent final proposal, which is worth ten chips. After both parties confirm, the game starts. Each round, both parties propose a reciprocal offer, and then we place our bets separately. The proposal with the higher bet gets passed, and the chip is paid to the opponent, and the opponents proposal is rejected. The passed proposal cannot be bet on again, but the rejected proposal can be bet on again.</br>
</br>
What are the criteria for winning or losing? Trump asked.</br>
</br>
There is no victory or defeat. This is the purpose of the game. Its to avoid us wasting time on meaningless arguments. When one party loses all the sugar cubes, the other party uses ten sugar cubes to directly acquire the other partys final proposal, and the game ends. Jiang Chen laughed and spread out his hands. The final proposal on my side is that the UA unconditionally joins the Earth Defense Alliance. Of course, we can make you a major member state. Now, its your turn.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade joins Trump Group. This is my final proposal. Trump laughed and pushed the stack of sugar cubes out, Lets get started quickly.</br>
</br>
Mr. Trump, you are wasting time. Jiang Chen looked at the rogue expression on Trumps face, let out a sigh, and said unhurriedly, I said it very clearly. After both parties agree that the final proposals are equivalent, then we can get started. To show my sincerity, I have put forward my final proposal first. If you insist on putting your whimsical proposal on the negotiation table, then I can only regret to announce that this is the end of the negotiation and the game is over.</br>
</br>
All proposals had to be realistic. All word games were meaningless, and there were no loopholes. In each round, if any party was dissatisfied with the other partys proposal, the game could be terminated unilaterally. Therefore, boring proposals such as jumping out of the window and paying one trillion dollars were just a waste of time.</br>
</br>
Trumps eyes narrowed slightly and he sat up straight.</br>
</br>
He stared at the porcelain plate full of sugar cubes for a moment as his eyebrows gradually showed a hint of interest.</br>
</br>
Interesting.</br>
</br>
Although the game in itself did not end in victory or defeat, victory or defeat did exist in the outcome.</br>
</br>
The two parties would put forward a final proposal, then the ultimate goal would be to use as few chips as possible to pass as many proposals as possible, and finally use all twenty cubes of sugar to make the other party compromise on the final proposal.</br>
</br>
This involved an issue, that was, how much chips had to be spent on a particular issue. If one party deliberately raises in order to win the opponents chips, then the risk was that the other party could not call, and the chips would be wasted on less meaningful proposals.</br>
</br>
Both parties had to guess the price in the other partys mind while at the same time, give an evaluation, and the ten sugar cubes were the only things with equivalent value on the table.</br>
</br>
A diplomatic negotiation was abstracted into an intuitive transaction. Through this method, it did spare a lot of meaningless arguments. Both parties would only need to use their chips instead of speaking.</br>
</br>
There was a look of realization in Trumps eyes.</br>
</br>
He had read the essence of this game.</br>
</br>
Then what is your final proposal? Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance is incorporated into the United Nations framework, after a moment of pause, Trump continued, Similarly, we can promise you a seat as a permanent member of the council.</br>
</br>
After Trump finished, he looked at the silent Jiang Chen as he waited for a response.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen believed this proposal could be negotiated, then their negotiation could officially begin. If Jiang Chen did not believe this negotiation would ever get accepted, and the Earth Defense Alliance would not be incorporated under the United Nations, then there was no need for the two sides to continue their talks.</br>
</br>
This game would only begin when both parties agreed that the proposals were equivalent.</br>
</br>
Very well, I see your sincerity. At least you didnt make those whimsical requests again, Without letting Trump wait too long, Jiang Chen nodded slowly and smiled, Then, since weve already reached a consensus on the price of the chips, let us start our game.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

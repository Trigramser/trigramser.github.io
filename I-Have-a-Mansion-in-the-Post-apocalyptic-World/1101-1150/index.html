</div></br>
</br>
On July 1st, Liuding Town requested assistance from NAC on the grounds that the aircraft carrier was in disrepair.</br>
</br>
As an ally with a strong relationship, NAC was obliged to help and sent an engineering team to carry out a comprehensive inspection of the Bohai Aircraft Carrier. The NAC engineering team concluded that the aircraft carrier, due to a lack of maintenance, was in critical condition.</br>
</br>
Only a full replacement of the aging parts could save the city on the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
It made sense what happened next. NAC built a shipyard at the port in front of Liuding Town to produce parts for replacement. NAC also sent technicians on the aircraft carrier in the name of site maintenance . But in fact, only they knew what they were actually doing it.</br>
</br>
NAC's move made the Beluga Station feel nervous, but it all made sense. Wu Yue, stationed at the Sixth Street, went to see Jiang Chen several times to subtly learn his perspective and to understand what NAC was planning.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen would never reveal his true intention to him.</br>
</br>
As for the protagonist of this fiasco, was Liuding Town pleased?</br>
</br>
The senior officials of Liuding welcomed NAC with open arms!</br>
</br>
Not only did NAC help them replace parts, they also renovated the hull for free. NAC even promised them over a hundred thousand credit points. Where could they find a better deal?</br>
</br>
Would the NAC navy pose a threat to Liuding Town? No one thought from that perspective.</br>
</br>
When the strength of the two sides was too drastically different, the idea of a threat was no longer within consideration.</br>
</br>
Since NAC eradicated the mutants of Wanghai in a dominating manner, Liuding Town never mentioned the idea of ​​splitting Wanghai with NAC once more. Later, Liuding Town was fully integrated into NAC's credit point monetary system, and the economy became more and more dependent on the Sixth Street. The senior officials of Liuding Town even began purchasing assets in the Sixth Street, and even regarded themselves as part of the NAC.</br>
</br>
Just like this NAC built a shipyard on the edge of Wanghai and trained the ship engineers in the name of repairing the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, a message came back from the outpost on the West Coast. It included a list of California specialty and resource deficiencies.</br>
</br>
Inheriting the scientific research results of the pre-war Silicon Valley, the electronics industry there was extremely developed. The drones and robotics level were far above Wu City, mostly attributable to the leadership position of Silicon Valley's electronic chip production technology.</br>
</br>
In addition, North American power armor was vastly adopted. Even the raiders could build power armors using scraps. For pre-war militia organizations like the National Guard, almost one out of every four soldiers owned a "Militia 02" Power Armor. Today, almost everyone owned a power armor.</br>
</br>
Electronic chips, robotic accessories, and even power armors were all promising goods to be traded. With almost no hesitation, Jiang Chen listed these three products as the key imports for this trade route across the ocean.</br>
</br>
</br>
Other than advanced electronics industry.</br>
</br>
Due to the development of animal husbandry, California's canned meat was even sold by dealers to South America. And some of the radiation-resistant crops that could only grow on specific soils made California a granary of North America.</br>
</br>
Under such circumstances, it was obviously meaningless to export food to California. Even if NAC's pre-war food was more delicious, the advantage would not be too substantial. After all, quantity mattered more than quality on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
As long as it was not the Double-headed beef raised in the Sixth Street five years ago that tasted like wax, people were already happy being able to eat meat.</br>
</br>
This proved that a food trade had no future in North America. However, the development of animal husbandry meant that they were quite lacking in spices and condiments.</br>
</br>
For example, the mutated peppers and anise produced by Hongcheng, the various sauces processed in the Sixth Street, and the Mud Crab roe produced in Yizhou Island should have a good market on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
In addition to spices and condiments, arms would be another option. The ammunitions produced by the Sixth Street were definitely more durable than the rifles hand-built by the survivors. Of course, the kinetic skeletons and the T3 and T4 Power Armors would not be exported, even if there were hundreds of thousands of miles between California and Wanghai.</br>
</br>
"...In addition, when trading with the locals, remember to pay attention to items related to NASA. If they find the wreckage of advanced spacecraft or satellite, ship it back with other trade goods." After discussing trade items with Chu Nan, Jiang Chen added one more point.</br>
</br>
Although the NASA of the modern world was completely outclassed by Celestial Trade, the NASA on this timeline remained a powerful organization.</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
It was no longer a secret among NAC officials that their boss loved to collect spacecrafts. Chu Nan simply agreed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stretched out and sunk into his chair after the call ended.</br>
</br>
After the NAC went on the right track, very few things required him to personally overlook. To the point where he didn't remember the last time he sat in the General Office to take care of affairs.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao opened the door and walked in with coffee. When she saw Jiang Chen relaxed in the chair, she smiled gently. With quiet steps, she walked behind him and began to massage him.</br>
</br>
"Tired? Let me help you."</br>
</br>
Such a gentle action from Sun Jiao made Jiang Chen unable to comprehend.</br>
</br>
"Does it feel nice?" Sun Jiao asked.</br>
</br>
In order to confirm that he wasn't hallucinating, Jiang Chen looked up and met a pair of gentle and watery pupils.</br>
</br>
"Did you eat something strange this morning... AH, it hurts... BE GENTLE."</br>
</br>
The smile on her face did not change, but the murderousness in her eyes was oozing out as her fingers sunk into his shoulders.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, this is the Sun Jiao that I know of...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought with a painful grin. If it was Xiaorou or Yao Yao, he would have turned around and took them down. But at the moment, it was Sun Jiao with impeccable strength.</br>
</br>
But quickly, the pressure on his shoulders disappeared.</br>
</br>
Softness embraced the back of his head, and Sun Jiao wrapped her arms around him, gently placing her chin on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
She wanted to say many things, but in the end, there was only one word that came out.</br>
</br>
"Fool."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and reached out to hold her hand.</br>
</br>
A moment of silence lingered between the duo, then Sun Jiao gently bit her lower lip before whispering.</br>
</br>
"You are going back tomorrow?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"...I will always miss you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Dummy—"</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law~"</br>
</br>
Before he could finish, he was interrupted by a crisp voice outside the door. Sun Jiao quickly jumped away and stood next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The office door was pushed open and Sun Xiaorou hopped in.</br>
</br>
However, when she took her first step into the office, her foot stopped midair and looked suspiciously at the two people in the office.</br>
</br>
When she saw the red glow and nervous expression on her sister's face, she quickly read the atmosphere in the air, and a naughty smile appeared.</br>
</br>
"Ah...sorry to bother you guys, please continue~"</br>
</br>
"Wait, this is not what you think—" Sun Jiao was blushing and rushed to explained.</br>
</br>
Xiaorou gave no chance for her sister to explain. She spat out her tongue and quickly escaped.</br>
</br>
Looking at the door, Sun Jiao, wearing a red hue, stomped her feet in anger before rushing out the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Looking at the cup of coffee on the table, he heartbeat returned to normal, and ripples began to form again in his calm state.</br>
</br>
If Xiaorou didn't interrupt them, then he and Sun Jiao probably would have started in the office...</br>
</br>
When they are together, it seemed like there was always no self-control.</br>
</br>
Shaking his head and throwing such thoughts out of his mind, Jiang Chen picked up the documents that he put aside on the table.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping's diplomatic visit had ended. Without any surprise, he should be on the plane back to Xin.</br>
</br>
From tomorrow on, it was time to overlook the overall situation.</br>
</br>
Before that, he must finish the work at hand...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1102: Earth Defense Alliance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On July 3rd, the two-day UN General Assembly ended.</br>
</br>
Because of a lack of cooperation from Celestial Trade, this meeting didn't make as much progress as most people expected. On one hand, it was because the United Nations had no right to directly interfere in the internal affairs of member states. On the other hand, it was because the representatives from Xin had no power to make decisions at all.</br>
</br>
For example, Canada proposed that Celestial Trade should sell its space elevator to the United Nations at a premium of 20%. Ultimately, it would be jointly funded by all countries and the United Nations would lead the defense of extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
Even though this proposal received a high number of votes, it wasn't well-received by Xin.</br>
</br>
In contrast, the negotiations between Xin and Hua, Frankberg and Russia made great progress.</br>
</br>
With Zhang Yaping's continuous efforts, the leaders of the four countries reached an agreement on the specifics. At the end of the UN General Assembly, all four countries held press conferences at the same time and announced the formation of the Earth Defense Alliance in Coro City, Shangjing, Moscow, and Ber...</br>
</br>
When night embraced the Revolution Square in Coro City, the lights illuminated and dispersed the darkness. In front of the reporters, Jiang Chen solemnly gave the opening remarks of this defining ceremony.</br>
</br>
In this darkest hour, people's eyes looked over the fully-armed soldiers and quietly observed the center of the square, no one made a sound.</br>
</br>
The protests and demonstrations swept the world in the past few days made everyone feel exhausted and confused. From the moment they learned about the existence of the extraterrestrial civilization, panic and fear were bred in everyone's hearts and grew uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
"There's already enough evidence to prove that the tragedies in City K, Yoto, Somalia, and Finland were caused by the extraterrestrial civilization. They used lies to confuse our people. They used a conspiracy to split our people!"</br>
</br>
A powerful voice echoed in the square, blowing away the fear in people's hearts. In this square once filled with the blood of revolutionists, a monument stood tall in the center, people were revitalized, and their blood began to boil.</br>
</br>
"Their behavior has already constituted aggression." Jiang Chen paused as he looked around the crowd, then he said slowly, one word at a time: "An aggression against all of mankind."</br>
</br>
"The option of dialogue hasn't existed from the beginning. All diplomatic means don't have meaning; traditional borders are meaningless. What we can do is use blood to defend our homeland! No one, no country can stay out of this war!"</br>
</br>
"So, we choose to stand up."</br>
</br>
"In this solemn and sacred moment, on behalf of Xin and the colonies of Celestial Trade, I declare to Xin, to our allies, and the world that the Earth Defense Alliance is formally established!"</br>
</br>
</br>
Thunderous applause and cheers resounded through the square, and people waved the small national flag in their hands. In their pupils full of life, there wasn't a hint of fear.</br>
</br>
For most people, they were fearful not because of the unseen extraterrestrial civilization but because of the chaos before the darkness. If the whole world was united, Earth's civilization would have a fighting chance. Although still young and weak, the establishment of the Earth Defense Alliance brought hope.</br>
</br>
Amidst the deafening cheers, Jiang Chen read out the list of member states of the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
According to the "Coro City Agreement" signed the previous day, the major members of the Earth Defense Alliance were Xin, Hua, Russia, and Frankberg. The secondary members included a total of 21 Asian countries including Pakistan, Moro, Malay and so on.</br>
</br>
Based on the consensus, the major member states would contribute 5-7% of GDP according to their territorial size and population size, and the secondary member states would contribute 3-4% of GDP. All contributions would fund the development of the aerospace industry.</br>
</br>
Of course, obligation wasn't without reward—although they had joined the Earth Defense Alliance to protect themselves, Celestial Trade would also treat its allies right.</br>
</br>
In the Coro City Agreement, Celestial Trade promised to member states that its space resources would be tilted toward member states.</br>
</br>
In addition, the agreement also stipulated that the Earth Defense Alliance would impose a 50% defense tax on all non-member states in outer space resources development. The money would be collected by Celestial Trade and used to establish an Earth Defense Fund. The purpose of the fund was to establish extraterrestrial fortifications and build a fleet and other defensive measures.</br>
</br>
Since this was for the common interests of all people, everyone had to contribute somehow.</br>
</br>
If they weren't going to put in the effort, then it was fair to pay some money.</br>
</br>
When this measure was released, it suddenly caused an earthquake, especially in the financial world. The aerospace companies listed on NASDAQ plunged.</br>
</br>
The prospects of aerospace companies weren't the only things that took a heavy blow. With light and heavy industrial raw materials increasingly dependent on outer space resources, pessimism began to spread from aerospace companies to manufacturing industries.</br>
</br>
What was the concept of the 50% defense tax?</br>
</br>
Taking iron ores as an example, as of July 1, 2019, thanks to the increase in the capacity of the space elevator, the industry-standard ore was quoted a price of 58 New Xin dollars per ton. Before the introduction of the defense tax, the UA could import iron ore from Xin at a price of 45 New Xin dollars per ton, but after the introduction of the defense tax, their cost skyrocketed to 67.5 New Xin dollars.</br>
</br>
What's more, the price of 67.5 New Xin dollars was still lower than the production cost of 76 US dollars per ton quoted by the former mining giant, Vale. In other words, no countries would be able to find a substitute at the same price!</br>
</br>
It was impossible to underestimate the difference of 22.5 New Xin dollars.</br>
</br>
Steel was the foundation of industry, and fluctuations in commodity prices would be reflected in the cost of manufacturing. If the global price experienced volatility, the effects might be invisible because of the exchange rate. But if this price volatility was confined to a certain part of the country, then the impact couldn't be underestimated.</br>
</br>
The same unit of industrial manufactured goods would be 22.5 Xin New dollars more expensive if produced elsewhere.</br>
</br>
Not only iron ore but all metal minerals from iron ore to rare earth metals were impacted. Non-Earth Defense Alliance members would be forced to accept this "unequal treaty." Unless they wanted to stop using the space elevator, they had to accept the 50% tax.</br>
</br>
It was foreseeable that with gradual expansion in space resource development in the future, the defense tax would be an unavoidable burden on non-member states. In the long run, the market competitiveness of the Earth Defense Alliance members would only grow.</br>
</br>
As a result, the foreign exchange in the global economy would exhibit a trend where the Xin New dollars would strengthen against other currencies.</br>
</br>
For Wall Street, no news could be worse than this new reality.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
At the New York Stock Exchange, there was another exclamation in the lobby.</br>
</br>
The Seattle Trailblazers that carried countless optimism by investors fell below the issuance price at opening.</br>
</br>
The company's primary business focused on the exploration of extraterrestrial planets, as well as the search for a habitable planet. Due to major breakthroughs in space telescope technology, many investors viewed them as the Columbus of the new century. Not long ago, the Noah's Ark Fund invested $200 million in this company, and on the date of its initial public offering, this bizarre incident happened.</br>
</br>
Although it wasn't rare for stocks to fall below the issuance price on the first day, it was rare for the stock price to be slashed in half, especially for a company that carried such a positive forward guidance.</br>
</br>
What made this situation even more odd was that it was the second Silicon Valley aerospace company to suffer a hard landing on the date of initial public offering in three days.</br>
</br>
"God, you can't do this to me. I bet everything on it!" A man in a suit was holding his head in pain, he was on his knees while his eyes were bloodshot.</br>
</br>
No one sympathized with him. Most of the people there felt the same despair.</br>
</br>
The entire NASDAQ sector plunged, as if all the companies related to the aerospace industry overnight no longer possessed any value.</br>
</br>
Countless investors' mood plummeted along with the downward trendline.</br>
</br>
Compared with those who used their own money to invest, many professional managers who worked for investment banks and funds or even prominent figures stood there.</br>
</br>
Their expressions were more or less somber. They knew very well that a failed investment could mean the end of their professional career, which meant their luxury homes might be taken by banks and they might not even afford to pay back their credit card balances. As the capitalists' hounds, once they lost their sense of money, they were useless.</br>
</br>
Not just NASDAQ .</br>
</br>
The Dow Jones Index, known as the economic barometer, was also brewing a storm. Many people began to decrease their holdings. In a zero-sum game, once the selloff began, it was impossible to close the floodgate.</br>
</br>
On the same street, not far from the New York Stock Exchange in the Morgan Stanley Building, Daniel Morgan was reading the newspaper in his hands with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
Without any warning, he suddenly scrunched up the newspaper and threw it into the corner of the office, he screamed, enraged.</br>
</br>
"Fifty percent defense tax? Shameless robbers—this is a highway robbery!"</br>
</br>
When Celestial Trade brought together Hua, Russia, and Frankberg to form the Earth Defense Alliance, he wasn't concerned. After all, without the participation of the world's largest economy, what was the use of an alliance?</br>
</br>
If the Earth Defense Alliance could really stand on the first line of defense selflessly, he was more than welcome. With the economic strength of the four major powers and more than 20 small countries, it would be impossible to burden the defense as they must squander money on fortifications and battleships without any return.</br>
</br>
</br>
By that time, Wall Street with a war chest of capital could become the savior again and take the Alliance's fruits of labor as their own.</br>
</br>
And the introduction of the defense tax put Morgan in a hot seat.</br>
</br>
Since the collapse of the Rothschild consortium, global mining giants such as Vale and BHP were on the brink of bankruptcy due to cashflow issues. Future Mining almost swept and took control of one-third of the world's commodity market, and they stole the market share previously that belonged to Vale and BHP Group through cheap and high-quality ore.</br>
</br>
Especially rare earth metals produced from the Moon, which overtook Hua's market share and made Xin the world's largest exporter of rare earth metals.</br>
</br>
Without any exaggeration, once the 50% defense tax was introduced, the global commodity market would suffer damage no less than a magnitude seven earthquake.</br>
</br>
Of course, that was for the non-members.</br>
</br>
It wasn't just Daniel Morgan who was furious; the Capitol's reaction was similar.</br>
</br>
Hill's economic adviser read the true intentions of Celestial Trade with just a glance.</br>
</br>
They were taking the fruits of other countries' interests and transfusing them to their own space industry! Of course, they alone couldn't digest the fruit, so they also invited other countries to the feast.</br>
</br>
If this was an era of space competition, developing the aerospace industry was just a means to boost national confidence, so it wouldn't matter. But with the profit prospects of the industry surging at an exponential rate, the Capitol must respond.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the space industry parks in Silicon Valley and Seattle had already exceeded 1 trillion USD in value. If they were kicked off the space elevator, the loss would be instrumental.</br>
</br>
"The risks of the economic crisis have emerged, and we might not see anything in the short term. But if this defense tax persists for a long time, the gap between us in the space industry will only grow. Before it's too late, we must do something!"</br>
</br>
"I propose to impose economic sanctions on Xin on the grounds of suspected trade protectionism!"</br>
</br>
At a regular meeting in Congress, a congress member stood up and spoke fiercely.</br>
</br>
Economic sanctions—the term which was drastically different from antitrust investigations. If antitrust investigations were rifles, then economic sanctions were nuclear weapons. Based on the market size of both countries, both would suffer. It was ultimately depended on who could last longer.</br>
</br>
In the exploitation of third world countries, economic sanctions often worked wonderfully. Using poverty to force the compromised had been a common trick since the Cold War era.</br>
</br>
However, in Congress this time, there was surprisingly no reaction and different perspectives emerged.</br>
</br>
"Now our top priority is to negotiate with Celestial Trade to minimize the impact of the defense tax on our space industry, rather than let the conflict escalate further and spread to other areas." A Republican member stood up and raised objections.</br>
</br>
Quickly, another Congress member stood up.</br>
</br>
"I concur. If it eventually turns into a trade war, I believe we can win in many fields, but in the tech sector, we will suffer a tremendous loss. Especially in the virtual reality network—no modern country can leave the network, and we can't afford this loss at all."</br>
</br>
"In addition, there's a very crucial point," the Congress member said, who looked around at the other members. He said helplessly, "At this time, the sanctions against the Earth Defense Alliance are simply unjustified from the public's perspective. Before the meeting, I paid attention to the official website of the Capitol. The application for the Capitol to join the Earth Defense Alliance has exceeded 20 million signatures..."</br>
</br>
Everyone looked at each other in shock.</br>
</br>
What they were most worried about had finally happened.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1104"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1104: Battle Meeting</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Time quickly passed, and a week had passed since the Earth Defense Alliance was established.</br>
</br>
With the joint efforts of more than 20 countries, the administrative and command system of the Earth Defense Alliance was completed. Celestial City was selected as the final location and the ultimate headquarters of the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
The purpose of the Earth Defense Alliance was to resist the aggression of extraterrestrial civilizations. Therefore, the organization had a separate administrative and command system independent of all countries and did not report to any country. Aside from major decisions that required voting from all member states, all matters were executed by the highest commander.</br>
</br>
Based on the "Coro City Agreement", in addition to the bureaucrats and military officers appointed by each country, the Earth Defense Alliance administrative officials and volunteers would be selected from member states' citizens who had voluntarily applied.</br>
</br>
Once the applicant was selected, the person would automatically be deemed to have given up their original nationality to become a glorious member of the Earth Defense Force. The person would hold a passport issued by the Earth Defense Alliance with free mobility in member states. Food and housing expenses would all be covered by the Earth Defense Alliance, as well as a competitive salary.</br>
</br>
The trade-off of great benefits was harsh training and strict discipline.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance would strictly implement militarized management and even non-combatant personnel would need at least five months of military training. The training time of the Marine Corps and Space Soldiers was more than a year and not capped.</br>
</br>
The ultimate goal of all training was to create an army that would never retreat. Even in the worst situation, they would only move forward.</br>
</br>
Even if only one person remained.</br>
</br>
While it sounded simple, it was impossible to truly achieve this goal without a decade or more of training. Fortunately, the space colonization ship was still many years away. Jiang Chen had enough time to re-sharpen the claws of the civilized people.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance would be a war machine that guarded the future of Earth's civilization. From the giant spaceships to the wrenches of the workers, they all served for the war.</br>
</br>
It was the only way for Earth to have a fighting chance against the fearless bugs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood very well what kind of beast he was creating.</br>
</br>
But he also knew very clearly that it was an evitable step that must be taken.</br>
</br>
Celestial City, Earth Defense Alliance Headquarters.</br>
</br>
Representatives from various countries walked into the external space station. They took the elevator and arrived at the office floor of their own department. They were the elites selected from various governments and military forces with a wealth of experience in leading and planning. They also had a preliminary understanding of space.</br>
</br>
</br>
At the top of the Earth Defense Alliance Headquarters, the elevator doors opened and representatives in their nations' military uniforms walked in.</br>
</br>
A middle-aged man in a Hua military uniform entered and fixed his collar. When he passed by Jiang Chen, there was a smile on his aged face. He then extended his right hand to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I saw it; great speech."</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen shook hands with him, smiled, and nodded before he gestured. "Please sit down."</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance was established. Before the formation of the army, the parties needed to further discuss the details of the covenant. For example, one of the most critical issues that must be discussed at the forefront was countermeasures against extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
An effective strategy was necessary to develop targeted defense countermeasures.</br>
</br>
A total of 20 members of the Earth Defense Alliance Committee were present, including senior officials from national intelligence departments, experts in the space industry, and scientists and military personnel.</br>
</br>
For example, the man who shook Jiang Chen's hand was Wu Changfeng. He was the former deputy commander of the General Staff Department, Second Division, ranked Major General. The old hairy Russian on his left was a subordinate of Natasha's father, and the former Special Operations Brigade of the 58th Army, also ranked Major General.</br>
</br>
And the Frankberg astronomer, Anthony Leibniz, was also a prominent figure in the international astronomy field. He served as the director of the European Space Agency.</br>
</br>
Of course, not all member states had sent their own representatives. For example, countries like Country F and Moro, without much understanding of the space field, hadn't come.</br>
</br>
After all the members sat down, Jiang Chen looked at the people present and began.</br>
</br>
"Before the meeting, I must emphasize one thing. I hope you will keep the contents of today's discussion strictly confidential, even to your home country. If you have any objections, you can apply to leave."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked around the conference table. When no one stood up, he nodded and turned on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
In the center of the holographic screen was a star map between the solar system and Gliese 581. In the star map, several broken white lines were drawn. These white lines marked the trajectory of the vacuum belt left by Harmony's space colonization ship as it traversed in space. If these broken trajectories were put together, a clear path between Gliese 581 and Earth formed.</br>
</br>
"Based on infromation obtained by Celestial Trade, the distance between Harmony's space colonization ship and Earth has shortened by at least fifty percent in the past century. It's currently only 10 to 6.7 lightyears away."</br>
</br>
"That's a high margin of error?" Wu Changfeng frowned, as he examined the star map in the holographic screen with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"It's because they entered the unobservable zone." Jiang Chen's fingers gently clicked on the control panel and circled a large dark area in the star map. "This unobservable area is about 5 lightyears wide. Due to the low density of stars, we cannot judge their coordinates due to the lack of reference point."</br>
</br>
"We have to prepare for the worst case. If they're only 6.7 lightyears away from us, then we're likely to encounter them within 50 years. In order to avoid them landing on Earth, we better take care of the problem outside of the solar system. Besides building a space fleet, I would like to hear if there are any better opinions."</br>
</br>
After the two Russians exchanged their opinions quietly, the seemingly reticent Mogunov stood up and made a suggestion.</br>
</br>
"Although I have no experience in star wars, in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, we're on the defensive and tactically inferior. In contrast, we have the strategic advantage."</br>
</br>
"I suggest we build fortifications in the Kuiper Belt outside the Solar System to increase our firepower to the maximum at the expense of mobility. This'll also support the frontline fleet in the battle against Harmony's space colonization ship."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1105"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1105: Project “Trench“</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Mogunov's proposal received support from all the members present. Everyone saw the benefits of the plan and even Jiang Chen complimented the idea because when he talked to Kelvin yesterday, they reached the same conclusion.</br>
</br>
The Kuiper Belt 40 astronomical unit from the Sun extended to hundreds of astronomical units away. The belt was formed by frozen micro-planets ranging from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers in radius and tens of thousands of comets. They were formed when the Solar System was created.</br>
</br>
The construction of fortifications in the Kuiper Belt not only provided long-range fire support for the battlefield, but it was also capable of providing supplies and ammunition to the fleet. The fast-moving comets and ice bodies would not only serve as defensive bunkers, but they would also provide abundant water for the garrisons in the fort.</br>
</br>
"It's a good idea to build a fortification, but how can we solve the problem of rotation? If our fortification changes position constantly, how can we ensure that they will be defending the path of the colonization ship? And how can they provide support to our fleet?" Wu Changfeng got up and raised his questions.</br>
</br>
"This isn't something to be worried about," Leibniz, who once worked at ESA, said. "One rotation of the Kuiper is quite long. If we build the fortress inside the Kuiper belt, we can control the revolution period to three hundred years. With consideration to the direction of Harmony's space colonization ship, if they want to be captured by the gravitational forces of the solar system, they must approach the Kuiper Belt at a tangential angle and reduce the speed below the third cosmic speed. With the 60-degree wide-angle range, the fortification can effectively provide support."</br>
</br>
"As long as we ensure that the fortification's coordinates are accurate and the engine is fine-tuned with its coordinates, then the plan is entirely feasible."</br>
</br>
After Wu Changfeng listened to Leibniz's explanation, he nodded and sat back down. His knowledge about space was limited, but from a military point of view, this plan sounded feasible. As long as the space fortress didn't turn in a completely different direction.</br>
</br>
Therefore, while building the space fleet, the decision for the construction of the space fortress in Kuiper Belt was also made.</br>
</br>
As for the technical feasibility of building space fortress 40 astronomical units from the Sun, it wasn't the consideration of this meeting—that would be the work of the scientists.</br>
</br>
In the next hour, twenty members made comments and refined details relating to building the space fortress. For example, they discussed how many artilleries would be necessary, the budget, the size of the fortress, and the force stationed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also put forward additional suggestions on the plan, such as creating a minefield outside the Kuiper Belt.</br>
</br>
The entire plan was named "Project Trench."</br>
</br>
</br>
Because they were uncertain if organizations similar to "Kurofune" that maintained connections with Harmony still existed, "Project Trench" was classified as class E confidential. Other than the fortress itself, no other information would be disclosed to the public.</br>
</br>
At the end of the meeting, the twenty members took an oath and swore to keep the topics discussed in this meeting a secret.</br>
</br>
Of course, the so-called oath was only ceremonial. For people of their status, the idea of the law was hardly binding to them. Their positions ultimately dictated their decisions. If conditions permitted, they would do their best to protect the interests of their own countries.</br>
</br>
For example, they might leak the plan to the relevant companies in advance then prepare a bid in advance.</br>
</br>
For at least two decades, the nationalism inside the Earth Defense Alliance would remain prevalent.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen wasn't in a hurry. He prepared many ways to assimilate them into becoming "his own."</br>
</br>
After the oath took place, the members packed up and were prepared to exit.</br>
</br>
However, just as people were about to leave, Jiang Chen clapped his hands and gestured to everyone to look at him.</br>
</br>
"Before we officially conclude today, I want to give you a present on behalf of Celestial Trade."</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen gently clicked on the control panel.</br>
</br>
Soon, four housekeeping robots walked out from the side door with trays in their hands. The robots then distributed the contents on the table.</br>
</br>
Everyone was confused.</br>
</br>
"This is a DNA Telomere Modification Agent."</br>
</br>
When they heard the strange name, the members present frowned and became even more confused. After all, they hadn't studied biology. While they understood DNA, what did telomeres mean? Only the biologist from Malay reacted.</br>
</br>
"DNA telomere?! Is-is this...!" The biologist was so excited that he could hardly articulate, completely unable to speak properly. He passionately stared at the needle on the table, with eager glowing out from his eyes, his fingers trembled as if he was coveting a heavenly object.</br>
</br>
"Is this... a genetic vaccine from Celestial Trade? Interesting." Holding the needle in his hand, Wu Changfeng was intrigued.</br>
</br>
As the former deputy commander of the General Stuff Department, Second Division, he certainly heard rumors about the magical genetic vaccines. Hua had always wanted to bring some back for research, but Celestial Trade never planned to sell them.</br>
</br>
The genetic vaccine was rumored to greatly strengthen bodily conditions with just one injection. Even a weak, untrained individual could possess the explosiveness and endurance of a special forces soldier.</br>
</br>
The most important thing was that the changes only affected somatic cells and had no effect on the reproductive cells, so changes wouldn't be passed on to offspring.</br>
</br>
Hearing the term "genetic vaccine," the Russian member also looked at the needle on the table, eyes sparkling with fiery.</br>
</br>
"This isn't a genetic vaccine," Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head as he looked at the people with different expressions.</br>
</br>
"What is it then?" Wu Changfeng asked.</br>
</br>
With a mysterious smile, Jiang Chen made a revelation.</br>
</br>
"Something that will make you live longer."</br>
</br>
After the meeting, Wu Changfeng took the Express to return to the hotel he was staying at in the residetial area of Celestial City.</br>
</br>
At the door, he paused and ordered the guard behind him with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"Without my orders, don't come in and bother me."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The guard saluted and stepped aside.</br>
</br>
He walked into the room, then closed the door behind him. He hurriedly sat down on the sofa and stared at the needle in his hand as his breathing gradually turned heavier.</br>
</br>
He was forty-one years old. With the rank of Major General at this age and capability of representing his country in such an important position, his resume was peerless among his peers. He has a beautiful wife who was ten years younger than him. He also had a son who was in junior high school and a daughter who was in elementary school.</br>
</br>
With success in both career and family, he thought that there was no temptation in the world that could allure him.</br>
</br>
However, his eyes were firmly glued to the needle in his hand.</br>
</br>
His identity reminded him that he should bring this thing back, take it to the Academy of Sciences, or gift it to a more powerful individual who "needed this more". However, another voice in his mind repeatedly told him to use it for himself.</br>
</br>
He began to recall what Jiang Chen said in the end.</br>
</br>
...The serum in the test tube is only 20ml, which can effectively resist aging and prolong your life by ten years. Before absolute resistance, each person can inject up to ten tubes and each injection must be separated by ten years, and the efficacy of each injection will be weakened each time.</br>
</br>
In an ideal situation, as long as you can inject this special serum every ten years, there's no problem extending your life by seventy to eighty years.</br>
</br>
Frankly speaking, the production of this serum is quite limited. If not for the fact that I want you all to see our day of "victory", I wouldn't have given this to you as a gift.</br>
</br>
Living longer than others is both your power and your obligation.</br>
</br>
Of course, you can take it or let it go. The choice is on you.</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1106: Shackles</br>
</div></br>
</br>
This is both your power and your obligation…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's last sentence touched the most sensitive part in Wu Changfeng's mind.</br>
</br>
Yes, this is my power. Why should I gift it to you?</br>
</br>
I'm the one making the sacrifice; I'm the one standing in front of mankind. What do you have to offer to make me give my "life" to you?</br>
</br>
No longer hesitant, he pushed out all the thoughts of giving it to the country. He picked up the needle and directed it at his vein. Pushing away all of his distractions, he made up his mind and injected the needle with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
As the serum was injected into his body, his heartbeat gradually returned to normal.</br>
</br>
He quietly waited for the onset of the drug as he leaned back into the sofa.</br>
</br>
The second hand of the clock ticked, but the expected pain didn't arrive. He frowned and looked at the spot where he injected the serum.</br>
</br>
"Is there no response?"</br>
</br>
Just as he was talking to himself, a sharp pain diffused out from his arm.</br>
</br>
He sweated profusely.</br>
</br>
As a soldier, Wu Changfeng's face turned into a pale white. He gritted his teeth, but he somehow endured the pain without saying a word.</br>
</br>
Boiled blood spread through his veins, surged freely in his blood vessels, the pain also diffused throughout his body.</br>
</br>
"Is this the price of life? That's too easy then." Wu Changfeng gasped for cold air, and he barely squeezed out his words before he slowly laid down on the sofa.</br>
</br>
The pain began to spread out from his blood vessels, deep into his internal organs, and out to his skin.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, all the pain disappeared in an instant.</br>
</br>
"This is the... end?"</br>
</br>
He quietly murmured, then he closed his eyes and drifted asleep.</br>
</br>
He made a choice without realizing it.</br>
</br>
The choice of loyalty.</br>
</br>
In his sleep, he had a dream.</br>
</br>
He dreamed that his wife, son, and grandson turned old. He watched them being lowered into their graves, but he remained so young. At the end of the dream, he saw a fire. Flames engulfed Earth, swallowed up all the cities, immersed the battleship of the Earth Fleet, and incinerated everything...</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng woke up from the nightmare and suddenly popped up from the sofa.</br>
</br>
After he realized that everything was just a dream, his rapidly pumping heart gradually calmed down.</br>
</br>
"Is it already noon?"</br>
</br>
The guard had obeyed his order from last night and didn't wake him up.</br>
</br>
As he panted, he looked away from the clock on the wall. He rubbed his forehead, and slowly sat up from the sofa. He now just realized that he was drenched in sweat and he started to feel cold.</br>
</br>
After he took his clothes off, he went to the bathroom to take a shower.</br>
</br>
However, when he passed the mirror, he suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was an illusion, but he realized that he seemed to be at least five years younger than yesterday...</br>
</br>
"Everyone chose to inject."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Excellent, keep an eye on them until they leave the city."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone and leaned back in his chair. He looked at the blue planet outside the floor-to-ceiling window and regained a sense of certainty.</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, everyone eventually chose to use the 20ml of serum on themselves instead of bringing it back to their countries.</br>
</br>
From the beginning, Jiang Chen knew that once this serum appeared on the market, regardless of the impact on Celestial Trade, its existence would have an unimaginable impact on the existing social order.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't clearly state it, he would never allow them to bring it to Earth and wouldn't allow them to gift this to a "powerful individual" for superficial reasons.</br>
</br>
As a simple example, civilians wouldn't be able afford this life-extending vaccine. Once it appeared on the market, the lives of the rich and powerful would be much longer than that of ordinary people. Wealth would be more and more concentrated. It wouldn't be long before the world's wealth was concentrated in the hands of the 0.1% or even less.</br>
</br>
By that time, it would be the end of the civilization.</br>
</br>
However, everything had two sides.</br>
</br>
As long as it was done properly, the positive effects of "longevity serum" could be far greater than its negative effects.</br>
</br>
For example, it could be used to win over people's allegiance.</br>
</br>
The twenty members of the Earth Defense Alliance were regarded as the elites of the elites in their respective countries. Jiang Chen didn't naïvely think that money or power could make them abandon the concept of country and dedicate their lives to the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
However, people always had weaknesses.</br>
</br>
The more successful people were and the more powerful people were, the more people feared death because once they died, they would lose far more than the average person.</br>
</br>
Life was a good option to allure them.</br>
</br>
As early as the sphere of influence of NAC had expanded to Hongcheng, Jiang Chen learned the secret of eternal life from Dr. Sun and received 100ml of serum. From this 100ml serum, Lin Lin extracted the anti-aging fragments from the DNA and the anti-aging substances dissolved in the serum for further research.</br>
</br>
Although eternal life wouldn't be possible, it was easy to extend a life span by tens to hundreds of years without side effects. The serum also wouldn't cover up the original hidden genetic code. Now with more than 2,000 sisters, her research ability had drastically increased. Perhaps in a few more years, she could really invent an eternal potion.</br>
</br>
But for those committee members, this would be enough.</br>
</br>
Although extending their lifespans would benefit the Earth Defense Alliance, it would also be troublesome if they lived forever. In the future, the Earth Defense Alliance would become stronger and stronger under the oppression of external factors, even to a point where it would replace all countries and evolve into the Earth Federation.</br>
</br>
By that time, if a bunch of old hags occupied the committee seats, there would be rigidity in the decision making abilities of the committee.</br>
</br>
There must be hope for the young.</br>
</br>
Immortality was only an option for himself.</br>
</br>
And also his closest relatives, of course.</br>
</br>
His finger tapped on the touchpad. He raised his hand, made a few strokes against the holographic screen, and called out the meeting minutes from yesterday. He started to scan the summary sections line by line.</br>
</br>
"Project Trench, Project Starship... Although only four words, it's certainly difficult."</br>
</br>
He shook his head, then leaned back with a headache.</br>
</br>
Building a planet fortress or a space fleet would require an astronomical amount of steel and production capability. The current Mars Colony was essentially a planted seed. It would take a long time for it to grow into a towering tree.</br>
</br>
"It seems we must speed up."</br>
</br>
With a long sigh, Jiang Chen closed the summary and connected to the database of the Mars Colonization Project Department.</br>
</br>
Just as he planned to inspect the development of the colony, a report uploaded ten minutes ago that was unread caught his attention...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Taikan Kyohosyugi: The principle of big ships and big guns, a naval tactics used by the Japanese in the Second World War where achieving victory would be dependent upon the effective use of a strong battleship force.</br>
</br>
---</br>
</br>
At the main axis area of the space elevator was the gravity-free section of Celestial City and the port of the city. Since the launch of the asteroid mining program, countless small and medium-sized transport vessels docked against the port, as they waited for the robotic arms to load and unload the ores inside the containers.</br>
</br>
In addition to the transport vessels that carried ores, a passenger ship shaped like a cuboid occasionally flew out from the transfer station and headed for the Moon. Since Celestial Trade announced regular flights between Earth and the Moon, travel between Lunar City and Earth became much more frequent.</br>
</br>
The size of Lunar City had expanded significantly compared to before. Living units circled the central square, connected by graphene pipes. A total of nearly 10,000 people called this place home, and most of them were part of the young labor force with high education levels.</br>
</br>
To meet the needs of the citizens, Celestial Trade also built an elementary school, a junior high school, a senior high school, a community college, a hospital, a police station and other municipal facilities around the central square. Celestial Trade also opened bids for the construction of hotels, bars, cafes, and other entertainment facilities.</br>
</br>
In addition to the resident population, at least 4,000 passengers traveled between Lunar City and Celestial City daily. These people included immigrants to the Moon, tourists, or investors looking for opportunities.</br>
</br>
A series of electrolysis chambers and lunar ice drilling exploratory wells were constructed to produce a steady stream of oxygen and hydrogen for the colony. The rare earth mining stations with robotic arms and a lunar refinery that produced helium-3 supported the economy and industry of Lunar City.</br>
</br>
Sixty percent of the world's iron and aluminum mines and eighty percent of rare earth mines were connected by the 36,000-kilometer elevators.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that there was the 50% defense tax which made the capitalists in the Western Hemisphere ache in pain.</br>
</br>
The decision was a blow right to their chest, and they were forced to be labeled as "scared"…</br>
</br>
In the lift cabin of the space elevator, Wu Changfeng stood quietly at the window and looked out at the dark-colored mega-ship.</br>
</br>
"SS Seagull"—a name not unfamiliar to anyone. The ship equipped with the Red River X1 engine was personally named by Jiang Chen. It was the first 500,000-ton ship of Celestial Trade and the first interstellar ship of the Earth civilization. Since then, any 500,000-ton ship produced by Celestial Trade was named after the Seagull-class.</br>
</br>
The 600-meter-long hull was connected to the main axis of the elevator by a cantilever. It looked massive from the distance and made the spacecraft moving around it look so insignificant.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the eyes of Wu Changfeng, the size of the Seagull-class transport ship was already large enough. It was at least the size of three aircraft carriers connected together. However, even a mighty ship this size couldn't serve as the main force in the fight against Harmony.</br>
</br>
He couldn't help but feel concerned about the future of Earth.</br>
</br>
What kind of enemy are we facing?</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at?" Lu Hao walked beside him and smiled.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao, the former Captain of the Nanning Destroyer, ranked Admiral. He served as a representative on the Hua side.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng turned his head as his colleague started to chat with him, he was about to say something, but when his eyes stopped on his arm, he swallowed his words.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao saw the message in Wu Changfeng's eyes. He sighed, helplessly lifted up his sleeve, and showed him the needle hole on his arm.</br>
</br>
"You also injected?" Wu Changfeng raised an eyebrow. While his expression didn't change, the caution in his mind gradually disappeared.</br>
</br>
"Do you think that if I didn't inject that, they would let us go so easily?" Lu Hao helplessly lowered his sleeve again.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng frowned and quickly understood what he meant.</br>
</br>
A smile formed on the expressionless face as he whispered.</br>
</br>
"We haven't heard of any DNA telomere-modified serum and haven't injected anything."</br>
</br>
"Of course. You didn't think I would've written that in the report?" Lu Hao laughed and shook his head. "I'm not that stupid. It would've definitely caused us trouble."</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng nodded.</br>
</br>
Hua had two seats in the Earth Defense Alliance Committee. What he worried about most previously was that Lu Hao would hand it over to the country.</br>
</br>
If that was the case, he would undoubtedly lose the trust of the organization and even cause some important people to be unhappy. With the state's influence on the Earth Defense Alliance, he might be sacked from his position.</br>
</br>
But based on what happened, he seemed to have worried too much.</br>
</br>
No one could reject the temptation to "live forever", especially for people like them.</br>
</br>
"Do you think we have hopes of winning this war?" Luo Hao said as he looked at the Seagull-class transport ship outside the window.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng, glanced at his colleague, then quietly said, "I have no doubt that we'll win."</br>
</br>
"General Wu is indeed from a political background; your way with words is so beautiful." Lu Hao forced out a laugh awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng raised his eyebrows and just wanted to say: "Worrying about what will happen after defeat isn't what soldiers should do," but this sentence didn't come out in the end.</br>
</br>
If it was before, he could say this as a soldier without any scruples. Considering the short life of humans, he wouldn't see the day when the first battle with the extraterrestrial civilization. However, his life was extended by more than eighty years now. If technology continued to progress, perhaps his life would continue to be prolonged.</br>
</br>
On the day of the final battle, there would certainly be a chance to witness that scene with their own eyes...</br>
</br>
"In your opinion, what is our chance of winning?" Wu Changfeng asked.</br>
</br>
"Less than 30%."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Wu Changfeng raised an eyebrow and laughed. "We still have 30%?"</br>
</br>
"Maybe it's an occupational disease." Lu Hao shrugged. "Now the Earth Defense Alliance is showing signs of favoring big ships, which makes me very worried."</br>
</br>
"Then in your opinion, what route should we take?" Wu Changfeng asked.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao smiled. "Don't forget that I used to be on the destroyer. I naturally prefer the use of carrier battle groups. The high-mobility destroyer can divide the battlefield then the carrier deploys planes to attack the opponent's weakness..."</br>
</br>
"What if the artillery of our 'destroyer' isn't enough to break the defense of the enemy?" Wu Changfeng raised a sharp question.</br>
</br>
Silenced ensued for a long time, then there was a response. "That's why we're all outsiders."</br>
</br>
The doctrine of the modern navy could serve as the theoretical basis for the future Starfleet, but after all, the ocean and the universe were two distinct fields, and everything was still in the exploration stage.</br>
</br>
"I believe in you." Wu Changfeng patted Lu Hao's shoulder and grinned. "By the time we select the commander, I'll vote for you."</br>
</br>
"Haha, then I will thank you now."</br>
</br>
The space elevator gradually approached the gravity-free section, and the SS Seagull from a distant outline was now in front of their eyes.</br>
</br>
However, Wu Changfeng suddenly noticed on the "bridge" between the SS Seagull and the space elevator, a team of soldiers in kinetic skeletons were boarding the ship.</br>
</br>
"What are they doing?" Wu Changfeng frowned.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao took a few steps forward. The tip of his nose was almost touching the window, and a frown also emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
"Orbital Airborne Troops? Is it a military exercise? If my memory is correct, Celestial Trade hasn't been fighting anyone lately..."</br>
</br>
While talking, the transport cabin carrying soldiers was loaded onto the SS Seagull. The robotic arm that clamped the SS Seagull separated from the hull. The engine began to ignite and pushed the giant vessel outwards.</br>
</br>
Just as the two of them wondered where the SS Seagull would set sail, the lift cabin they were in entered the orbit of the space elevator. They could only watch Celestial City and the SS Seagull accelerate away from them…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1108: The Second Group of Colonists</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Five kilometers underneath the Martian colony, they discovered the suspected remains of the Martian civilization.</br>
</br>
It was an incredible piece of news.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen read the report from the colonial captain, Hong Zewei, he immediately called Kevin and dispatched the second group of colonists in advance.</br>
</br>
A new Seagull-class was responsible for this transport mission. The 500,000-ton ship was commissioned half a month ago. With the improved version of the Red River X1 engine, the ship could complete the acceleration and deceleration phase in a shorter time while achieving higher cruising speed within the solar system.</br>
</br>
Based on the calculated data from quantum computers, the trip from Celestial City to the orbit of Mars would only take 21 days with the current relative position between Earth and Mars.</br>
</br>
Because the colonization plan was pushed ahead by three months, the 100 colonists who were being trained had to end the training ahead of time. They boarded the ship inside the hibernation chambers with goods to be taken to the Martian colony. In addition to the colonists, there were ten orbital airborne soldiers equipped with the most advanced Gauss rifles and outer space kinetic skeletons.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen expressed doubts about the existence of Martians, after all, Mars was only habitable more than three billion years ago. Even if they dug their own tombs underground, they probably turned into sand by now, let alone any living creatures.</br>
</br>
However, in order to reassure the colonists, Jiang Chen finally decided to send a force.</br>
</br>
He was aware the extreme behaviors of people in an isolated state.</br>
</br>
At the same time as the second group of colonists set off, the twenty members of the Earth Defense Alliance also returned to the surface, which ended Ghost Agent's surveillance. After Jiang Chen left the office, he went to Future Heavy Industries' shipyard.</br>
</br>
The shipyard was located in the gravity-free section of the main axis of the space elevator, next to the port.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived at the shipyard, the hull of a 600-meter-long Seagull-class transport ship was fixed by more than a dozen mechanical arms and was suspended in space. It occupied almost ninety percent of the shipyard.</br>
</br>
Numerous construction robots surrounded the outside of the transport ship and welded finished parts to the transport ship. At the rear of the ship, four mechanical cantilevers were connected to a wide variety of tools from screwdrivers to laser welding guns. These mechanical cantilevers were performing complex operations, which was connecting the Red River X1 engine to the slot at the rear of the ship.</br>
</br>
The wisdom of working people was unlimited.</br>
</br>
Although the design drawings and key technologies of the Seagull-class transport ship were provided by Jiang Chen, the entire production process was the crystallization of the hard work of 10,000 scientists, technicians, and senior engineers of Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
</br>
This production process wasn't necessarily the most optimal, but it could be renowned as the best in the world</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could proudly announce to the world that Future Heavy Industries was the only company that had mastered the manufacturing process of a 500,000-ton transport ship. Whether it was Russia's Oleg-class, Hua's Changchun-class, or UA's Apollo X1, they were just small fishes in the water in front of his "big seagull".</br>
</br>
Of course, while he fantasized, he didn't come here to look at the magnificent size of the Seagull-class transport ship; he had more important matters to attend to.</br>
</br>
Not long afterward, a middle-aged man in a uniform flowed to him while kicking his legs back, then he skillfully grabbed the armrest and stood still by the window.</br>
</br>
As the shipyard manager of Future Heavy Industries, he was in a meeting with senior engineers at the shipyard. When he heard reports of Jiang Chen's visit, he quickly asked his right-hand man to take over the meeting while he rushed over.</br>
</br>
Dai Zhengming anxiously looked at Jiang Chen while he explained, "Sorry, I was in a meeting with the technicians. I didn't know the boss personally came to the shipyard to perform an inspection. If there are any places where you think can be improved, please let me know."</br>
</br>
"There's no need to be so polite." Jiang Chen let go of his hand on the railing and waved his hand to signal Dai Zhengming to not to take it to heart. He smiled," I just came for a quick tour; I hope I didn't bother your work."</br>
</br>
"No, no." Dai Zhengming quickly waved his hand and laughed, "If there's anything you don't understand, please be sure to talk to me. I know all the answers!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen politely smiled and turned his gaze to the Seagull-class outside the glass window. He paused for a moment then said.</br>
</br>
"In the fleet plan approved by the Earth Defense Alliance, open tender is scheduled for the first million-ton class warship to the enterprises in the member states is schedule for a week later. Currently, only we have the technical capability of the hull welding, the engine, and the ecological warehouse. You are an expert in this area, so I would like to refer to your opinion. Are you sure that this million-ton warship is safe?"</br>
</br>
Dai Zhengming's face turned a little sour as he listened to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Boss, to be honest, you should've seen it. Our shipyard is still too small. The construction space isn't enough. The 500,000-ton class is already at the limit. If it was any bigger, the bow would have to extend to the outside."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He also noticed the space problem of the shipyard. The Seagull-class transport ship had already occupied the construction space of the entire shipyard.</br>
</br>
It should be mentioned here that the entire Celestial City was divided into a gravity-free section and a gravity section, and a low-gravity section in the middle. Due to the problem of the center of gravity of the entire space elevator, in addition to the light industries as well as farming, heavy industries such as shipbuilding and steel-making, which had large resource throughputs, were distributed in the gravity-free section—the main axis of the entire space elevator. Shipyards, ports, and heavy industry factories were stacked together similar to Lego blocks.</br>
</br>
There were many benefits to this, such as maximizing the use of the limited space available and reducing the time spent on logistics and transportation of industrial raw materials. However, the disadvantages were also obvious. One of them was that if there wasn't enough space, expansion was not an option.</br>
</br>
At present, there was a steel mill below the shipyard, and the port was right above, both of which were troublesome to demolish. Extending outwards was an option, but the lack of vertical distance severely limited the scale of the shipyard.</br>
</br>
After some considerations, Jiang Chen looked at Dai Zhengming and said.</br>
</br>
"A million-ton class warship cannot be built at the space elevator. If we separated the entire shipyard out of the space elevator and place it on a synchronous orbit, would this solve the problem?"</br>
</br>
"Separate it?" Dai Zhengming acutely sensed the intention behind the boss's words, and his eyes lit up. He then quickly asked, "You mean, we can build a separate space station outside the space elevator as a shipyard."</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded. "I don't know if there's any difficulty with implementation."</br>
</br>
If the shipyard was moved out of the space elevator and served as the satellite city of the entire Celestial Trade, the space at the shipyard would be much bigger. It would also allow for further expansion based on needs. By that time, one million-ton, or even ten-million-ton interstellar ship could be built.</br>
</br>
As for the current shipyard, it was only enough to build ships lighter than 500,000 tons.</br>
</br>
Dai Zhengming had considered this issue before, but he was only a shipyard manager after all. It wasn't clear how the space elevator worked. Since he was under Future Heavy Industries, and the space elevator was managed by Celestial Trade, even if he voiced his concern, it was difficult to be heard.</br>
</br>
Now the boss mentioned this, he whole-heartily favored this proposal.</br>
</br>
"I will get someone to look after this. You should think about how the space station can be planned?"</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen muttered in his mind: Celestial Trade and Future Group's businesses are getting bigger and bigger. It seemed that the cooperation between the departments needs to be strengthened. I'll have to discuss with Xia Shiyu to see if there is any good way.</br>
</br>
With the joyous Dai Zhengming and a group of employees bidding farewell, Jiang Chen left the shipyard. He was about to call Xia Shiyu, however, she called first.</br>
</br>
"What's up?"</br>
</br>
"Zhang Yaping just called you but he couldn't reach you, then he called the company. The foreign minister of Nippon is in Coro City, and he wants to have a discussion with you."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1109: Is the tax a bit too high?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Kishida sat in the conference room of the Future Building as he thanked the waiter for the tea , but his eyes couldn't stop glancing at the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
It was the tenth time he looked in that direction since he came in.</br>
</br>
After a phone call with Jiang Chen, he immediately cleared his agenda for the afternoon and came over after the meeting with Zhang Yaping.</br>
</br>
When Kishida arrived, Jiang Chen was in the space elevator with an hour's journey before he would arrive in Coro. Xia Shiyu arranged for them to meet in this conference room.</br>
</br>
Several other members of the delegation were also in this room along with him, all of which were members he trusted.</br>
</br>
In order to avoid causing suspicion in the UA, he came under the banner of electricity negotiations. This meant he couldn't stay for too long. As for the purpose of his trip, it was supposedly for the fifty percent defense tax.</br>
</br>
No country in the world had a stronger desire for space resources than Nippon. A lack of resources and strong industrial development was a curse cast on Nippon since the previous century. The slightest turmoil in the economy would cause the Nikkei Index to fall.</br>
</br>
As soon as Celestial City announced the acceptance of foreign capital investment, the capitalists and consortia rushed in, particularly in the rare earth mining projects in Lunar City. They feared Celestial Trade wouldn't accept enough of their money.</br>
</br>
The total investment of Nippon companies in Celestial City ranked third after UA and Hua and was even ahead of Russia.</br>
</br>
Hence why the fifty percent defense tax caused so much pain for them.</br>
</br>
Just when Kishida was starting to speculate the reason for Jiang Chen's late arrival, the door of the conference room was pushed open and Jiang Chen came in.</br>
</br>
Kishida immediately got up, his face full of smiles, and he extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"My pleasure, my name is Kishida, Nippon Foreign Minister."</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, President of Future Group and Celestial Trade. There's no need for Mr. Kishida's introduction. We met at the Outer Space Security Summit." Jiang Chen spoke with a half-smile while he shook hands.</br>
</br>
When Kishida heard the term "Outer Space Security Summit", an awkward expression appeared on his face before quickly disappearing. However, as a diplomat, his skin was naturally thicker than most people. He pretended to not hear the words and enthusiastically began to chat with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Since the T-Virus Crisis in Yoto and the collapse of the previous cabinet , he changed his political stance and leaned to the left. Because of his support for the new prime minister's foreign policy, after the establishment of the new cabinet, he was again nominated to be the minister of foreign affairs. He was the only cabinet minister not replaced by the new prime minister.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was also because of the turmoil in the nation and the lack of talented individuals available to the new prime minister.</br>
</br>
</br>
Aside from those external factors, he could be used as the perfect example as someone who sat on the fence.</br>
</br>
He clearly stood on the opposing side at the Outer Space Defense Summit, but now with the Earth Defense Alliance started to take shape, he immediately pretended nothing had happened.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen would never reject a willing cooperative partner. After they shook hands, Jiang Chen invited him to take a seat.</br>
</br>
"Please."</br>
</br>
After Minister Kishida sat down, the diplomats with him also sat down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went to the head of the conference table and sat down. He gestured to the assistant behind him, and instructed him to close the door. After he heard the door click, he leaned back in his chair and looked nonchalantly at the Nippon delegation.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Kishida isn't just here to chat with me, right? You know that I'm a businessman. There's no need to use formalities here; if there's anything you need, just say it."</br>
</br>
"Since Mr. Jiang Chen said this, I will be straightforward," Minister Kishida said, who coughed before he began. "Is the fifty percent defense tax a bit too high?"</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this, a smile that confirmed his original speculation appeared.</br>
</br>
"This is a decision that was made after internal discussions of the Earth Defense Alliance. All member states voted before the resolution passed. If you disagree with this resolution, you can go discuss with Hua and Russia?"</br>
</br>
Kishida forced a laugh.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is certainly humorous. As far as I know, this fifty percent defense tax is collected by the operating company of Celestial Trade Space Elevator. It's injected into the Earth Defense Fund as a donation. Does the Earth Defense Alliance have shares in the space elevator?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and looked at the old man in his sixties with surprise. He didn't expect that the man who didn't take the Earth Defense Alliance seriously actually went deep into researching its background.</br>
</br>
Having said that, he still had the advantage.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen didn't come up with an excuse and instead played the mankind card.</br>
</br>
"Fighting against the aggression of extraterrestrial civilizations is a common interest of the international community. Since that's the case, it wouldn't be appropriate to let some people stand in the frontlines while other people enjoy the fruits of other people's labor? Either pay or contribute—that's fair, isn't it?"</br>
</br>
Fair my as*!</br>
</br>
Minister Kishida cursed in his mind.</br>
</br>
You used our country's money to support your aerospace companies, then you're using your advanced technology to make money off of us. Is there anything fair about this?</br>
</br>
However, he could only vent his frustration in his mind. He smiled as he continued.</br>
</br>
"You're right; fighting against extraterrestrial civilization is the undeniable duty of all countries. After watching the example you made, we've indeed seriously reflected on our selfishness in this respect. Therefore, we decided to establish a space force in our military to support the war against extraterrestrial civilization!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't speak. Instead, he leaned forward and looked dubiously at Minister Kishida.</br>
</br>
Just as Kishida was about to feel uncomfortable, Jiang Chen spoke up.</br>
</br>
"You're joking with me?"</br>
</br>
Although Kishida knew that what he proposed was rude, he still felt awkward after hearing such a straightforward response from Jiang Chen. But the negotiation must continue.</br>
</br>
"What do you want then?"</br>
</br>
Smiling, Jiang Chen leaned back in his chair again and said with a relaxed tone, "It's easy to avoid the defense tax. Join us."</br>
</br>
When Kishida heard Jiang Chen's words, he jumped up.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible! We're NATO's allies; how could we join a new military alliance treaty?!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't care about Kishida's aggressive reaction and said, "Then just pay the tax and support the 'Earth defense' cause."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1110: Ungrateful</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Nippon is discussing the possibility of joining the Earth Defense Alliance."</br>
</br>
A report was placed on Hill's desk, and Secretary of State Kerry walked to the sofa in the office and sat down. He picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip to soothe his throat. "The issue doesn't only involve Nippon being swayed—the same goes for Australia and New Zealand."</br>
</br>
"Ungrateful." The chief of staff standing next to Hill cursed under his breath.</br>
</br>
"What about our nuclear power assistance project?" Hill opened the document that Kerry tossed on her desk. She glanced at the report with a serious tone.</br>
</br>
Kerry shook his head and said, "It's useless. For now, our nuclear power project isn't attractive to Nippon. Two months ago, the half-year discussion between Exelon Nuclear Power Company and the Eastern Power Company of Nippon was canceled, and it's meaningless to talk about nuclear power at this point."</br>
</br>
"You're right." Hill squeezed her sore eyebrows and said, "Why's Australia trying to get involved? When have they been interested in outer space resources?"</br>
</br>
Australia itself was a big mining country, and its own domestic minerals weren't fully developed. Naturally, it wasn't necessary to mine in outer space. The defense tax of the Earth Defense Alliance had pushed up the average price of the global commodity market to their benefit. They should be the least interested in outer space resources? Instead, they were entertaining the idea of joining the alliance?</br>
</br>
"Because of the Global Grid Plan." The coffee cup was heavily placed on the table. Kerry walked over to Hill's desk and said with a sullen look, "Half a month ago, the Australian Federal Parliament was discussing expanding power imports. The quota was used to replace all thermal power stations in Victoria and New South Wales to achieve the 2019 Carbon Reduction Plan."</br>
</br>
"We must immediately pressure Nippon and do everything possible to prevent them from joining the Earth Defense Alliance," the chief of staff immediately said to Hillary Clinton. "I propose to immediately launch the 2019 Asia-Pacific military exercise and send two more aircraft carrier groups and two Marine Crops divisions to Guam and Okinawa. We must contain the influence of Celestial Trade in that region."</br>
</br>
"That would provoke Hua," Hill said in a deep tone.</br>
</br>
"The situation is different! Xin, or Celestial Trade, has replaced Hua and become the primary threat that may shake our global dominance! If we can't stop them from continuing to expand their regional influence, they're likely to subvert all our efforts since the Vietnam War!" The chief of staff was heated.</br>
</br>
"If this triggers a new Cold War," Hill looked sharply at her chief of staff, "Who will bear this responsibility?"</br>
</br>
The chief of staff opened his mouth, but after he saw Hill's eyes, he quickly closed his mouth.</br>
</br>
Just now, he saw a hint of cautiousness from the president that shouldn't be there.</br>
</br>
</br>
Not cautious about the fate of the country but cautious about her political career.</br>
</br>
The UA had already stood at an intersection, and external pressure had never been more severe. If she made the wrong choice, she might go down in history as the person who brought down the country.</br>
</br>
Her eyes were tightly squeezed together. Hill closed her eyes and meditated for a long time before she slowly said, "We must win back dominance from the Earth Defense Alliance and bring the issue of extraterrestrial civilization back under the United Nations."</br>
</br>
"Contact our allies in Asia and inform them that the 2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise will be held next month. In addition, dispatch the Ford-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Guam under the name of a military exercise." Hill then looked at Kerry. "Also, I must trouble you to go to Xin. We must talk with Celestial Trade."</br>
</br>
"It's useless." Kerry shook his head. "It's not the first time I dealt with that man. He isn't the type to compromise. From the first time I saw him, I knew he would become a threat to our nation."</br>
</br>
"We don't know unless we try. Since they're a company, I believe there's nothing that can't be compromised in the name of personal interests," Hillary said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Of course, there's nothing that addressing their interests can't solve." Kerry was so angry that he actually laughed and exaggeratedly spread his hands. "But they want the crown on our heads and we can't give it to them!"</br>
</br>
After spitting out the last sentence, Kerry quickly left the president's office.</br>
</br>
He slammed the door shut and walked over to the map after he went to the office</br>
</br>
With a gloomy expression, Kerry looked at the red line scattered across Asia that had begun to extend to South America. The red line was like a spider web, spreading from Coro Island and providing nutrients that created the despicable Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
"That stupid wire," Kerry squeezed the words out between his teeth and muttered to himself in anger. "Their hands are reaching in South America! Reaching in our back garden. And our president..."</br>
</br>
Our president...</br>
</br>
Just then, a crazy thought suddenly formed in his mind.</br>
</br>
This idea that had appeared before, but since he won the general election in 2004, the idea never formed in his mind again.</br>
</br>
Once ambition was born, it would grow uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
No.</br>
</br>
This isn't personal ambition.</br>
</br>
This is for the nation.</br>
</br>
He hesitated, and his eyes stopped at the phone at the corner of the desk.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered a phone number.</br>
</br>
That phone number belonged to an entrepreneur who once invested in him in 2004. That person had many titles, such as a well-known investor on Wall Street, such as the chairman of the Morgan Foundation...</br>
</br>
Wall Street should be the most devastated party by the "Defense Tax".</br>
</br>
With that thought in his mind, he reached out to the phone.</br>
</br>
In the Coro Island mansion, leaning on a lounge chair on the balcony, Jiang Chen put his mobile phone on the beach table, and a smirk formed on his face.</br>
</br>
"2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise? It seems they're starting to force their allies to make a choice."</br>
</br>
Just now, he received a message from a Ghost Agent.</br>
</br>
The UA issued the 2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise document to its allies in Asia, which was scheduled to be held next month. At the same time, the 13 billion-US-dollar new-generation nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Ford" would arrive at the Guam military base this month to participate in the exercise.</br>
</br>
Guam was located northeast of Xin.</br>
</br>
There was a silky swimsuit tied around her chest and waist that showed off her petite beauty. Ayesha, who carried a tray with iced orange juice, placed it next to Jiang Chen. She gently swayed her long brown hair gilded under the golden sunshine and she looked at him with her sapphire eyes. "Do you need me to do something?"</br>
</br>
"Can you give me a massage?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Ayesha put her hands around Jiang Chen's shoulders.</br>
</br>
Whenever he had this expression, she knew he had the situation well under control…</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1111: “Feasibility“</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The joint military exercise in the Asia-Pacific region gradually began to escalate tension in the area and the situation in Asia seemed to be hanging on a knife's edge.</br>
</br>
The location of Guam was too sensitive, just on the northeast side of Xin. The UA sent a carrier battle group and the latest Ford-class aircraft carrier to participate in this exercise. In this critical time, a lot of people sensed something was out of the ordinary.</br>
</br>
Nippon, Australia, and New Zealand, which were originally discussing joining the Earth Defense Alliance, began to take cautious attitudes once again.</br>
</br>
The countries that had joined the Earth Defense Alliance naturally stood on the same side as Xin. The dictator of MLL Island, Santos, denounced the move in front of the media to show his support for Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Malaysia and other countries took a more civil approach and used relatively mild rhetoric, but they still expressed doubts and dissatisfaction with the UA holding so-called "routine military exercises" at this critical time "when the world must unite".</br>
</br>
Hua and Russia also showed off the comradeship with both countries by sending foreign ministers to visit Coro Island. They jointly held a press conference to question if the UA's action was an attempt to curb the Earth Defense Alliance, and disregarded the interests of mankind in order to strengthen regional control.</br>
</br>
Not only external pressure, but internal pressure was also building up inside UA. However, the country's hegemony couldn't be challenged. Regardless of the scale of opposition, the position of the Capitol and Congress remained firm. The military exercise must take place.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether the parties involved were willing, an East-West confrontation quietly unfolded.</br>
</br>
At Coro International Airport, a beautiful figure stepped out of the gate with quick steps. In the envious and hateful gazes of male creatures, the beautiful figure was watched as she stepped into a car at the airport.</br>
</br>
Her sunglasses were hung onto her collar, her wavy blonde hair swished in the air, Natasha smiled and looked at Jiang Chen in the driver's seat.</br>
</br>
"Did you miss me?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen grinned as he started the car. "Finally done your sentence?"</br>
</br>
"What do you mean done my sentence?" Natasha rolled her eyes. "You make it sound like I've done time."</br>
</br>
The inspection period of half a year had passed, and now, she had completely separated herself from the Russian Security Service and transferred to the diplomatic system. In fact, she originally intended to resign and immigrate to Xin but later changed her mind.</br>
</br>
Compared to just being a trophy, she wished to be someone who could help him out in her career like Ayesha and Xia Shiyu. Only by being helpful could he be inseparable from her, and that was the advice her father gave her.</br>
</br>
Given the friendly bilateral relationship between Xin and Russia, becoming a diplomat was the best choice.</br>
</br>
</br>
When she saw that Jiang Chen seemed to be in a good mood, Natasha said in a sly tone, "You don't seem to be worried at all? The aircraft carrier is already at your doorstep."</br>
</br>
"What's there to worry about?" With his hands on the steering wheel, Jiang Chen laughed. "Do they really want to go all-out with me? I shouldn't be the one worried; they should be."</br>
</br>
Natasha chuckled, crossed her arms in front of her chest, and mocked him.</br>
</br>
"I like it when you're being arrogant."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's lips curved up.</br>
</br>
"It seems you're not using the right word. This isn't arrogance—this is called confidence."</br>
</br>
"Is there a difference? Right, where is your little follower? How come she's not here? Or is she now being invisible in the back?" Natasha said, looking back at the seat as she waved her hand in the air.</br>
</br>
Obviously, Ghost Agent's optical stealth technology left a deep impression on her.</br>
</br>
"Stop waving your hand; Ayesha's not there. Also, can you use a more normal name for her?" Jiang Chen sighed helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Then what? Your little tail?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Through the mirror, looking at Natasha's expression full of maliciousness, Jiang Chen couldn't help but start to worry about the harmony and stability of the future harem life.</br>
</br>
Although the relationship between her and Ayesha was no longer as stiff as before, the two women still weren't on good terms.</br>
</br>
It had nothing to do with jealousy. Ayesha never learned how to be jealous and Natasha didn't seem to mind much. If there really was a reason, then it must be that their fates were meant to clash…</br>
</br>
The magnetic levitation mode was activated, and the car entered the cruise track. The two quickly flew back to the mansion at the north end of the island.</br>
</br>
Because it was during the workday, when Jiang Chen pushed the door open, Ayesha and Xia Shiyu weren't there.</br>
</br>
Natasha kicked off her high heels and put on slippers. Before she dropped the sentence "I'm going to shower", which filled his imagination, she winked at him then went upstairs.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was debating if he should be a gentleman and bring her suitcase up for her or be a "gentleman" and help her shower, an untimely phone call arrived on his watch.</br>
</br>
"Did I disturb you?" As soon as the call was connected, he heard Xia Shiyu's slightly jealous teasing.</br>
</br>
"How come?" Jiang Chen touched his nose with his empty hand and said without blushing, "I'm planning to unpack her luggage. I'm not as perverted as you think."</br>
</br>
"Hmph, I understand you too well!"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was unconvinced. Obviously, she had timed her call.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen decided to change the topic. He went to the sofa and sat down.</br>
</br>
"Was there anything important?"</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen began to discuss an important matter, Xia Shiyu immediately put on her aloof expression, and said in a serious tone," Under the UA government's diplomatic intervention, Exelon Nuclear Power and Westinghouse received orders for nuclear power projects in Colombia and Peru through non-standard bidding process."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the names "Colombia" and "Peru," Jiang Chen's pupils suddenly constricted.</br>
</br>
As for why, it was mainly because the location of the two countries was too sensitive. One was located above Ecuador and the other was below it. The two countries tightly covered the small mass on the west coast of South America.</br>
</br>
Now that half of the trans-Pacific submarine cable was built, the UA was exporting nuclear power to Ecuador's two neighboring countries at this juncture. There was no doubt that they intended to stop Celestial Trade's Global Grid Plan to reach South America on the beach.</br>
</br>
"What's the attitude of Ecuador now?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"There's no reaction for the time being, but we noticed that Westinghouse is in contact with their government," Xia Shiyu said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned at the words.</br>
</br>
Now the situation seemed to be out of his control.</br>
</br>
In the strategic layout of his Global Grid Plan, Ecuador was a crucial first stop on the west coast of South America. However, South America was, after all, the back garden of the UA. Even though Ecuador's relationship with UA wasn't as close as Colombia and Peru, politics would inevitably be affected by the influence of the UA.</br>
</br>
UA had realized the threat of the Global Grid Plan and made up its mind to block the project. South America was, after all, the home court of the UA. Jiang Chen didn't have the confidence to compete "fairly" with UA companies.</br>
</br>
"Do you have a plan?" Seeing his long silence, Xia Shiyu asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin and said, "Now it all depends who will have the best bid... but the problem is this—we can give them benefits and the UA can give the same benefits or give even more than us. And before the submarine cable is completed, the low cost of electricity is simply not enough to give us an advantage. Unless..."</br>
</br>
A glimpse of realization flashed through Jiang Chen's eyes, and an idea suddenly emerged in his mind.</br>
</br>
If he couldn't t offer them tangible benefits...</br>
</br>
Then he could just draw a cake for them!</br>
</br>
"Release news that Celestial Trade is studying the 'feasibility' of building a space elevator in the Western Hemisphere."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen said this, he had a smirk.</br>
</br>
He heavily emphasized the word "feasibility".</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1112: Aircraft Carrier Battle Group</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Wall Street.</br>
</br>
In the conference room on the top floor of the Morgan Stanley Building, Daniel Morgan leaned back in his chair and listened quietly to the explanation of the company's last quarterly earnings.</br>
</br>
Some time ago, using the "doom-day conspiracy" and the havoc created by the establishment of the Noah's Ark Fund, the space companies in Silicon Valley and Seattle formed one after another and led to a new frenzy of space exploration interest never seen for half a century.</br>
</br>
As the leader of Wall Street investors, Morgan Stanley certainly wished to get its hands on a piece of this pie.</br>
</br>
However, the defense tax introduced by Celestial Trade cooled down the frenzy instantly like a bucket of ice, cold water over the heads of new space companies in Silicon Valley and Seattle.</br>
</br>
Of course, this didn't pain it the most. As a world-class investment bank, it was certainly impossible for its managers to put all the eggs in the same basket. Morgan Stanley not only invested in Silicon Valley and Seattle companies, but it also invested all over the world, and even some aerospace companies listed in Xin have its name on the shareholder list.</br>
</br>
What really pained it was another event.</br>
</br>
The 100 billion US dollars Noah's Ark Fund was forced to be dissolved because of a bill passed by Congress. Morgan Stanley and Rockefeller consortium were forced to withstand the pressure of the elite class and return their principal investment and even lost 5.1 billion in fees.</br>
</br>
The Wall Street indeed had a lot of influence on Congress. Many Members accepted their "donations", but no one could ever say they had absolute control over Congress.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the fallen Jewish consortium or the WASP that was the new leader in the Wall Street.</br>
</br>
It was all politics.</br>
</br>
The separation of powers provided the opportunity for capitalism to prosper, but it would never allow the capitalists to drain all the nutrients from the soil. When everyone filled the streets to protest against the "escapism of the elites", and demanded the government to set an example, even the congress members that accepted money must consider the voters in their own constituency.</br>
</br>
"Let's end here for now." Daniel Morgan raised his hand and interrupted the manager at the bottom of the performance ratings as he was anxiously reporting on his work. "Kevin, go and prepare, HR will talk to you about work."</br>
</br>
The manager's mood immediately dropped to the bottom of the valley and sweat profusely appeared on his forehead.</br>
</br>
Daniel didn't care about the expression on his face, and he waved his hand wearily.</br>
</br>
"That's it."</br>
</br>
Everyone in the room was relieved and left in a hurry, for fear that the boss may pick on them if they stayed a second longer. Everyone knew very well that the boss was not in a good mood, and it was not the best choice to leave an impression now.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of others, they may all be leading six-figure or even seven-figure elites. They sat in the office drinking coffee and managed over tens of millions in funds. However, only they themselves know how careful they had to be to keep this glamorous appearance.</br>
</br>
</br>
Wall Street never lacked talent. Apart from the capital itself, no one was irreplaceable.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, Daniel stared at the financial report on the table, and he felt flustered.</br>
</br>
These days, Carmen's final words had lingered in his mind.</br>
</br>
"You will regret the choice you made today...?"</br>
</br>
Daniel repeated this sentence and muttered. Sometimes Daniel also thought, what if he had helped the Rothschild family at that time, just like what his father did in the "Kristallnacht" of World War II. If so, would everything be different?</br>
</br>
Just then, the phone on the table shook.</br>
</br>
He shook his head and drove the unrealistic thought out of his mind, Daniel picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
A familiar voice.</br>
</br>
Daniel's eyebrows raised, and said with great interest in his voice, "Mr. Kerry? How did the distinguished Secretary of State remember your old friend?"</br>
</br>
In 2004, the Morgan consortium had bet on Kerry, but Kerry eventually lost. This investment was squandered. But Daniel didn't think it was a failed investment, because "betting on both sides" had already been a Wall Street tradition. No matter who was elected, the "War on Terror" in 2006 would not be affected.</br>
</br>
What really made Daniel feel pity was that this promising politician never showed any more interest in the presidency since his failure in 2004 and had embraced the role of a Democratic diplomat.</br>
</br>
"What do you think of the 2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise?"</br>
</br>
Kerry's straightforwardness made Daniel pause for a second, then he seemed to understand something as he asked, "If you are asking me if I support this or not, my answer is of course I do."</br>
</br>
At this point, Daniel suddenly changed the topic, and smiled, "But, is the pressure a bit light?"</br>
</br>
"I think so too. The rise of Celestial Trade has seriously threatened our influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Now, this has already been reflected in the economy. If I choose to appease this time, it means that we are handing over the hegemony we built over several decades," After hearing Daniel's words, Kerry hid all the joy and excitement in his heart and continued, "Hill and her team are preparing for the 2020 election if she is still in power for the next four years..."</br>
</br>
"There is no doubt that the situation will be worse!" His knuckles knocked onto the conference room table, Daniel laughed twice and moved the phone into his other hand. Then he said, full of interest, "Mr. Kerry, I know a good restaurant. If you have time after work, we should have dinner together and talk about the election next year."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The ship speared through the raging waves, and the ten massive figures sailed through the rough sea, leaving milky white ripples behind.</br>
</br>
On the Ford-class aircraft carrier, Captain Hogg stood in the command tower and looked into the horizon in the southwest.</br>
</br>
Although he couldn't see anything, he knew very well that Coro Island was in that direction.</br>
</br>
Even the glaring sun couldn't hide the arrogance between his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
He and his fleet indeed had every right to be be arrogant.</br>
</br>
As the first aircraft carrier designed by the UA using CAD technology, the "Ford-class" equipment was fully networked and computerized. The overall automation level was much higher than that of the Nimitz-class. The carrier personnel onboard was reduced from 3190 to 2,000, but the efficiency of the aircraft increased by 15% compared to the Nimitz, and the overall combat efficiency also more than doubled.</br>
</br>
In addition, an updated power distribution system reduced the cable length, which made it easier to reconfigure for future installation of electromagnetic pulse cannon, laser anti-missile, and anti-ship weapons; there was enough room for modification.</br>
</br>
Although the Ford-class was yet tested in a real battle, it was indeed worthy of the name known as the best aircraft carrier built by human.</br>
</br>
"Report! Celestial Trade's fleet is discovered 100 kilometers away in the southwest, and it is confirmed to be two Guardian-class frigates," the lieutenant commander saluted and reported to him.</br>
</br>
"Two frigates?" Hogg frowned.</br>
</br>
He expected Celestial Trade to be within their range since the aircraft carrier battle group's intent was to put pressure on Celestial Trade A distance of one hundred kilometers showed the other party's cautiousness in reducing the possibility of escalation to a minimum. However, he didn't quite understand why they only sent two frigates after them.</br>
</br>
Is Celestial Trade this confident?</br>
</br>
Or did they completely abandon their sea supremacy?</br>
</br>
"Send aircrafts and see what they are doing!" Hogg ordered in a deep tone.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The lieutenant commander saluted and left with the order.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1113"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1113: Who is the boss</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hogg never would have understood.</br>
</br>
One hundred kilometers, a safe distance from his perspective, was no longer safe in front of Celestial Trade's electromagnetic pulse cannon. It was just the typical crossfire distance.</br>
</br>
After two rounds of upgrades, the ship-borne electromagnetic pulse cannons on the Guardian-class frigate was no longer a modified version of the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon, but an actual anti-ship cannon designed for warships. A shell 50 kilograms in mass could easily shred a ship with the same tonnage into two.</br>
</br>
Even the 2,000-ton frigate could output damage equivalent to a battleship. The Celestial Trade Guardian-class perfectly demonstrated the tactical concept of "small boats equipped with giant cannons" to the extreme. They pioneered the naval warfare to the 22nd-century era where "destroyed upon observation" was the moto.</br>
</br>
Just as the two F-35Cs took off from the Ford-class aircraft carrier deck, the two Guardian-class frigates were already locked onto the hull of the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
If a conflict broke out between the two sides, the seventy-five aircrafts on the carrier would not have the opportunity to take off and would sink to the depth of the Pacific Ocean. As for the two F-35Cs that already took off, they would be taught a lesson by the laser anti-missile system if they dared to approach closer.</br>
</br>
On the frigate leading the way, the captain stood in the bridge and stared silently at the aircraft carrier battle group on the holographic map.</br>
</br>
From the moment the aircraft carrier battle group crossed Hawaii, they were locked on by the "Sky Eye" Observation Satellite.</br>
</br>
It was the reason Jiang Chen did not consider this aircraft carrier battle group a threat because it never left his "sight".</br>
</br>
"Report. Two aircrafts took off from the aircraft carrier and are approaching us in a straight line. The type of aircraft has been confirmed to be F35-C with unknown weapons." The first officer saluted and reported to the captain.</br>
</br>
The captain nodded, and a vicious smile formed.</br>
</br>
"Teach them a lesson."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The first officer saluted again and jogged away with the order.</br>
</br>
Soon, a searchlight-shaped device rose from the middle of the frigate and pointed into the distant airspace.</br>
</br>
If the two F-35s knew they were already on someone else's radar, they would certainly reconsider their choice of approaching the frigates</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, they knew nothing about power.</br>
</br>
"This is Sea Lion-1 (Sea Lion-2), I'm approaching Celestial Trade's frigates. No submarine activity is detected. The enemy has yet to detect us. Requesting further instructions." Celestial Trade's frigates already appeared on the radar as the pilots immediately reported to the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
A hint of ridicule appeared on Hogg's face after he received information from the pilots.</br>
</br>
Earlier, he was worried that Celestial Trade may be playing some tricks, now they seemed to just be bluffing.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Show them who's the real boss," Hogg nonchalantly said. In the end, he didn't forget to add, "Pay attention, don't overdo it."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
The two F-35Cs changed their formation in the air and descended to approach the two Celestial Trade frigates.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of their self-confidence in their maneuverability, perhaps because of certainty that Celestial Trade wouldn't dare to be the first one to shoot, the two F-35Cs entered cruising attitude and even left the cover of clouds. They were about to skid over the top of the frigates to suddenly appear on the enemy radar before vanishing again.</br>
</br>
With the invisibility of the F35, this provocative action was tried and tested.</br>
</br>
Although they only tried this move against second-tier naval forces.</br>
</br>
Giles opened the photoelectric detection pod mounted on the bottom of the aircraft and was preparing to "suddenly appear" on the enemy's radar when he saw a white light on the frigate in front of him.</br>
</br>
Before he could react, the strong glare shrouded his cockpit in an instant.</br>
</br>
Giles closed his eyes out of reflex, the burning pain in his eye sockets reminded him of what had happened.</br>
</br>
"AHHH— MY EYES, I CAN'T SEE! FU*K, WHAT IS THAT THING!"</br>
</br>
There was a hoarse cry from his comrade. Giles wanted to open his eyes to understand what happened. However, the glare blinding him made it all an unrealistic thought.</br>
</br>
The two planes were like blinded flies. Their formation was no longer intact and was close to crashing in air.</br>
</br>
Sweating profusely, Giles used his experience to make several maneuvers in succession, but he still could not escape the blinding light locked onto him.</br>
</br>
The light seemed to be following him and was stuck to his cockpit.</br>
</br>
He could swear he has never seen such a weapon!</br>
</br>
If it was just ordinary glare, it would never achieve this effect. He was convinced that when he was maneuvering in the air, his cockpit was no longer facing the frigate, but he was still blinked by the light, unable to escape.</br>
</br>
There was only one explanation. Celestial Trade must have used some kind of microwave weapon that he has never heard of before, and turned the glass on the cockpit, and even his goggles, into light bulbs...</br>
</br>
"Sea Lion-1, this is the headquarters, what is going on? Please report back... I repeat, please report back..."</br>
</br>
"God, God, God... please, don't do this, please..."</br>
</br>
Giles prayed the deity's name and used his years of experience to barely pull the plane back above the clouds. But even then, he was still unable to escape the light.</br>
</br>
He didn't care if there was no warning for a missile being locked onto him. He fired all the flares and chaff jams equipped on the aircraft.</br>
</br>
He flew in fear for five minutes.</br>
</br>
Even he himself did not know whether he escaped or Celestial Trade just spared him.</br>
</br>
The blinding light on the cockpit finally disappeared. Giles was drenched in sweat. After he confirmed his position on the radar, he went north for more than 20 kilometers before he finally adjusted his course to return to the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
As for the two frigates, he didn't even have the courage to look back.</br>
</br>
"Sea Lion-2, what's the situation on your side?" Switching to the team channel, Giles asked his comrade.</br>
</br>
"This is Sea Lion-2, I need some eye drops... except that, everything is fine."</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem with landing?"</br>
</br>
"No problem... probably."</br>
</br>
After Giles confirmed the safety of his comrade, he let out a sigh of relief and immediately contacted the aircraft carrier to report what just happened.</br>
</br>
Until now, he still didn't believe what had happened.</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the lingering pain in his eyes and the wetness on his back, he would rather believe that everything that happened was a dream.</br>
</br>
A nightmare...</br>
</br>
After he ended his communication with the command center, Giles's tensed muscles began to relax.</br>
</br>
The crisis was averted, and he could soon return to the aircraft carrier.</br>
</br>
Out of curiosity, he reached out and touched the cockpit glass.</br>
</br>
However, just as his hand touched the glass, his expression turned peculiar again.</br>
</br>
Not only the glass but the goggles on his helmet and even the instrument dials in the cockpit...</br>
</br>
Even with his gloves on, he felt his fingertips were being burned.</br>
</br>
What the hell!</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1114: The Form of War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Giles's speculation was indeed correct. It was a microwave weapon that caused them to be temporarily blind.</br>
</br>
The microwave weapon was a prototype from Fallout Shelter 027, a laser array air defense system called "Light Suppression Weapon". It was used by countries as "peaceful" means to repulse fighters trespassing.</br>
</br>
But this form of weapon was short-lived and forgotten in history by the end of the twenty-first century. In future warfare, drones dominated the battlefield. Even if piloted fighters were not outdated, they gradually became the supporting cast in air combat.</br>
</br>
Disregarding everything else, a fighter jet flying at a speed of ten Mach could experience a force over 10G by making a simple turn. If the turn was a little wide, the pilot's eyeballs would be squeezed out. The human reflex was only so fast, and it was far slower compared to AI's responsiveness.</br>
</br>
From identification to locked down for destruction, while the pilot may still be confirming the target, the AI ​​may already have calculated the trajectory.</br>
</br>
However, for the sixth-generation fighters still in the exploration stage, this weapon was simply too effective. It was the same as covering the pilot's eyes during air combat.</br>
</br>
Of course, it served more of a mean of deterrence.</br>
</br>
In actual combat, if the enemy planes already entered the defensive radius of the laser array air defense system, directly attacking the wings, ammunition depot, and fuel tank with high-power lasers would be very effective.</br>
</br>
"It's perfect." In the military base of New Moon Island, Jiang Chen praised as he watched the two F-35Cs in the holographic screen blindly maneuvering in the sky. He then looked at Ivan, who was standing across from him. "Who is the captain?"</br>
</br>
Ivan replied immediately.</br>
</br>
"The Captain of Frigate Ship (FS) Ange is Captain Lei Zheng."</br>
</br>
"Lei Zheng is very talented. He handled this very well."</br>
</br>
While he praised the captain, Jiang Chen already got an idea of how to use the video that they just captured.</br>
</br>
You are planning to conduct a military exercise? Okay! You are planning to flex on your allies? No problem! I'm not going to interrupt anything, but I will actually help you!</br>
</br>
We won't discuss anything about the fighters. First things first, the maneuvers of the two pilots were quite amazing! Celestial Trade can testify that they pulled everything off with their eyes closed! As for why their eyes are closed?</br>
</br>
Oh, that is a long story...</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen was planning on when he should play this card to maximize its effect]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was already more than a week since he returned to Hua. Lu Hao didn't have any time to rest since his return. He was either being pulled into meetings or being asked to make a report. From the employees to the executive council, everyone seemed to be in a tense state, but they couldn't agree on a direction.</br>
</br>
He understood the impetuous and contradictory atmosphere that permeated at the top of the Republic. He also believed that all countries in the world shared the same struggles.</br>
</br>
</br>
Whether to create history or become history, no one was prepared for what would happen next.</br>
</br>
The opponent was an extraterrestrial civilization. Apart from knowing that it possessed powerful biotechnology, the Earth civilization knew nothing more. However, Lu Hao also understood that he couldn't be too demanding in this matter. It was not easy to have the courage to fight against an extraterrestrial civilization capable of intergalactic travel.</br>
</br>
Of course, his exhaustion was not entirely due to meetings, but also due to other things.</br>
</br>
The people above him tried to find a way out, and the people below him tried to gain benefits.</br>
</br>
A semi-state-owned aerospace technology company already saw him twice, as it hoped to learn some insights from him about the future direction of the Earth Fleet. What type of battleship would be prioritized? Would engines be the focus or weapons? Or armors? Or even shields?</br>
</br>
However, it was never this easy...</br>
</br>
Even the Earth Fleet didn't know its future, let alone his future. Perhaps that man saw something further away, but he was not a god after all. He would also be confused about the distant future.</br>
</br>
The once unpopular astronomy and aerospace became one of the hottest disciplines. Not only greedy businessmen came to see him, but many academics have found him to sell their theories. They shoved their papers in front of him, begging him to take a look.</br>
</br>
Some of these people came for the name, while others searched for the benefit.</br>
</br>
In this day and age, professors may not necessarily be good at scientific research, but even graduate students knew how to write papers. Many universities even used SCI papers as a hard indicator for assessing academic performance. In this kind of environment, anyone could offer an opinion.</br>
</br>
For those scholars and experts, if their own thoughts would be agreed on by the members of the Earth Defense Alliance, this meant the opportunity to become a guest of the Earth Defense Alliance Committee, even a technical consultant. Even if they performed poorly in university or at a research institute, they could still become famed within academics and even go down in history.</br>
</br>
However, the root of the contradiction lied here.</br>
</br>
Everyone thought they were correct and even brought evidence to justify their opinions.</br>
</br>
However, it was too easy to falsify evidence. Just look at the science fiction novels of the early twentieth century and look at what authors imagined the year 2000 looked like. It was easy to determine how unrealistic the fantasy of human beings is.</br>
</br>
These days, Lu Hao either spent his time in meetings, or dealt with the piles of papers and research reports.</br>
</br>
Sometimes he really wished he could stuff these papers into the shredder.</br>
</br>
But he knew at this moment, he couldn't make such a decision. In his subconscious, he hoped to see a paper or research report that offered a clear path for the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
To be honest, being in his position, he was naturally a supporter of the carrier battle group theory. However, Wu Changfeng's words on the elevator made him question his previous certainty.</br>
</br>
After he let out a sigh, he leaned back onto the sofa in the living room. Lu Hao massaged his soar temples and tossed the paper onto the table. Then, his sight drifted to the globe on the window sill.</br>
</br>
He heard the sound of a key turning at the door.</br>
</br>
He looked up and saw a clever looking boy and his lips formed a kind smile.</br>
</br>
It was his son who was still in the first grade of elementary school. He just came back from school.</br>
</br>
The little guy ran towards him in happiness after he saw his dad sitting on the sofa. He didn't even take his shoes off before jumping onto his dad's legs.</br>
</br>
"Dad, Dad! Are you working in the Earth Defense Alliance now?" With his innocent eyes, the little guy shook his dad's arm with adoration.</br>
</br>
"You can say that." Lu Hao rubbed his son's head and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
It was not a secret that he joined the Earth Defense Alliance Committee. The state television even created an exclusive interview with him and Wu Changfeng. However, in the interview, he only mentioned the duties and obligations of the Earth Defense Alliance. He also spoke about the plan to create a fleet and intercept the extraterrestrial civilization in the Kuiper Belt.</br>
</br>
As for the issues discussed at the committee meeting, even with his own membership, these sensitive issues were directly averted...</br>
</br>
"Great! Our classmates don't believe it. They said that I'm lying." The little guy excitedly waved his fist and continued to look at him with adoring eyes. "Dad, Dad, will you build a Gundam?"</br>
</br>
A Gundam?</br>
</br>
Lu Hao shook his head.</br>
</br>
A Gundam was absolutely impossible.</br>
</br>
Having said that, he didn't want to dim his son's hopeful eyes, so he said in a comforting tone, "Your father is too old to pilot a Gundam. So, this task will be up to you. Promise Dad that you will study hard."</br>
</br>
"Can I drive a Gundam if I study hard?" His son's pupils flashed with excitement.</br>
</br>
"Of course!" Lu Hao smiled.</br>
</br>
The little guy climbed down from his dad's knees after receiving the confirmation he was looking for. He skipped out of the living room and ran away.</br>
</br>
Looking at his son, his lips formed a curvature that belonged to the kindness of a father.</br>
</br>
Even if it is to protect the smile of the little guy, at least he can't let him down...</br>
</br>
He shook his head and picked up the paper he previously tossed down.</br>
</br>
What will a war in space be like?</br>
</br>
Just as he was feeling puzzled, he suddenly remembered someone.</br>
</br>
A person who might give him the answer.</br>

</br>
Since Natasha moved in, Jiang Chen's mansion no longer felt empty.</br>
</br>
Ayesha and Xia Shiyu were quiet and reserved, but Natasha was the complete opposite. Her voice and action reflected her Slav origins.</br>
</br>
Passionate and unrestrained...</br>
</br>
However, the four lived together harmoniously. Everyone did their best to accommodate each other's habits, and everyone did everything they could to not interfere with others.</br>
</br>
The only fly in the ointment was that every night, the competition for the "ownership" of Jiang Chen was fierce.</br>
</br>
Before Natasha arrived, there was a timetable arranged to determine who would "serve the bed", and even Jiang Chen didn't have much influence on the decision.</br>
</br>
However, the arrival of Natasha broke the balance. The fiery Russian girl not only ruin the "rules of the game" agreed upon by Ayesha and Xia Shiyu but even put up a "refusal to negotiate" stance.</br>
</br>
"Timetable? What is the use of that?" When Xia Shiyu and Ayesha asked about her schedule, Natasha refused right away, and said without thinking, "The person who he sleeps with is his freedom. How can you use a timetable and ignore his wishes? If you're not willing, take him away from me with your charm."</br>
</br>
It was fine if she just expressed her opinion, but she was also holding Jiang Chen's arm and provoking the two girls by straightening her back, exposing the Mount Everest in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
Against the invincible size, even Ayesha who never felt any jealousy felt frustrated and began to pout.</br>
</br>
As for Xia Shiyu, the vinegar jar was completely knocked over and she remained standoffish for several days…</br>
</br>
Well, in fact, Jiang Chen thought he was quite easy-going in this aspect. He didn't disagree with the timetable, or rather, he supported decisions that promoted harmony and stability within the family.</br>
</br>
But at the time he didn't say anything.</br>
</br>
Honestly, it did give him spiritual satisfaction to see the people he loved show jealousy because of him.</br>
</br>
It was fortunate for him that the three girls didn't turn against each other because of "unequal distribution". Other than at night, they spent time together quite harmoniously. However, he clearly felt that they began to compete in on particular aspect.</br>
</br>
For example, Ayesha began to favor just wearing loose pajamas while walking around in the mansion with her legs exposed and Natasha even began treating bikinis as her casual wear at home.</br>
</br>
Even Xia Shiyu joined the movement to save "clothes" while gnashing her teeth and blushing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know how he should feel about this.</br>
</br>
While he was the ultimate "beneficiary", and the appearance and body of the three women were all stunning, nowadays, he felt uncomfortable being home. Even with the genetic vaccine, he began to feel that his body couldn't handle this anymore.</br>
</br>
When he subtly hinted this to Ayesha, the girl nodded and expressed that she would help him.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not see any change at home.</br>
</br>
The only thing that changed was the cuisines on the table.</br>
</br>
On top of the original menu, a pot of delicious turtle soup was added... (1)</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Time was like clockwork, and July passed very quickly.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the microwave weapon left an impressive impression on the pilots of the fighters on the aircraft carrier, the UA aircraft carrier battle group did not conduct any drastic exercises since it entered the Guam military base. Every day, the F-35s took off from the military base, but the route all avoided the air defense identification zone of Xin without exception.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the UA didn't want to cause more misunderstandings during this critical period.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the UA had resorted to its usual tactics, military high-profile actions combined with diplomatic offensives. Secretary of State Kerry frequently visited Asian countries, ostensibly to strengthen economic and trade cooperation, but in fact, was pointing to Xin and planning to blockade the Global Grid Plan.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was extremely stressed over this matter.</br>
</br>
Although the irreplaceability of Celestial Trade's product made it impossible for UA companies to take over, the UA diplomatic approach played a significant role and caused the expansion of the Global Grid Plan in West Asia and South American to almost completely stagnate.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen was not in a hurry. He could allow Kerry to create some chaos in Asia first. By the time the 2019 Asia-Pacific military exercise began, he prepared plenty of ways for UA to lose its face.</br>
</br>
The Ange High-Tech Industrial Park, an industrial park that condensed the cutting-edge technology of the entire Xin, had more than doubled its size compared to six months ago.</br>
</br>
Since Future Military became independent of Future Heavy Industries, CEO Ling Tao built new factories with the budget approved by the headquarters. They built a lab dedicated to weapon development upon Jiang Chen's request.</br>
</br>
At the moment, a giant turret, about 25 meters long and about 12 meters wide, was placed in an empty lab warehouse. The shape of the turret looked like a giant pot. The pot handle was embedded in the pot from the middle and flipped over on the ground.</br>
</br>
Since the barrel was too heavy, it must be suspended by a mechanical arm on the ceiling.</br>
</br>
From the huge volume, it was easy to guess the use of this weapon.</br>
</br>
Other than the starships that flew in the air, it seemed that no warship could carry this massive turret.</br>
</br>
Outside the protective glass of the warehouse, Ling Tao showed and explained to Jiang Chen the latest masterpieces of Future Military.</br>
</br>
"Sirius X-1, a cyclotron-type electromagnetic pulse cannon prototype. The projectiles are launched in two acceleration stages. The first stage of acceleration is completed on the double circular magnetic tracks in the turret, while the barrel begins to charge. After the first stage of acceleration, the maximum speed of the projectile, in theory, can reach Mach 40. After entering the barrel, the projectile starts to accelerate at the second stage, and the theoretical exit speed can reach Mach 67, which is more than 35% of the third cosmic speed!"</br>
</br>
Ling Tao showed heartfelt pride.</br>
</br>
Since a year ago, scientists in Future Military began to study the cyclotron. After countless days and nights of experiments, they finally made a breakthrough, as they raised the speed of the electromagnetic pulse cannon by an order of magnitude. It was no exaggeration to say that this electromagnetic pulse cannon was the masterpiece of Future Military.</br>
</br>
Different from the war in a traditional sense.</br>
</br>
In the war within the stellar system, two crucial issues must be considered, namely the speed of gravity and relative motion.</br>
</br>
Different tracks corresponded to different surrounding speeds. If the spaceship on track A wanted to hit the spaceship on track B, it was not as simple as aiming at the target. If the speed of the bullet was not fast enough, it may fly away and become a meteorite in the solar system or even a satellite of a certain planet.</br>
</br>
In actual combat, even if the speed exceeded the third cosmic speed, it was not enough.</br>
</br>
However, Earth civilization finally gained a fighting chance against the threat outside of the solar system. It was no longer helpless.</br>
</br>

</br>
Below the magnificent brick wall, an Audi A8 moved on the asphalt road and entered the university decorated in green.</br>
</br>
On the solid marble monument, five words were inscribed with fine penmanship - National University of Defense Technology.</br>
</br>
As the first group of universities in the "2110 Project" focused on military, the university had been under the dual leadership of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Education. The school's also held prominence, as it sent over thousands of talents to the military every year.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao was emotional when he saw the stone monument.</br>
</br>
It was his alma mater.</br>
</br>
He hadn't returned to this place for a long time.</br>
</br>
The car stopped in front of a gated faculty and staff district. From the eroded painting on the wall and the fact the building was only five-storey tall, the community was built quite a long time ago. Lu Hao stepped out of the car and looked at the man behind sunglasses as he he sighed.</br>
</br>
"Do you still need to follow me here?"</br>
</br>
The man with sunglasses shook his head.</br>
</br>
"This is my order from the superior. You can just pretend that I don't exist."</br>
</br>
Lu Hao frowned but did not say anything. He turned and walked to the guard room.</br>
</br>
Nothing here has changed in twenty years.</br>
</br>
He still vaguely recalled that when he first arrived at university, he joined the astronomy club out of interest and frequently visited this community.</br>
</br>
The astronomy society at that time was as unpopular as the school of astronomy.</br>
</br>
Not only was there a lack of members, but they couldn't even apply for a room for their activities.</br>
</br>
For a club that could disband at any moment, the school naturally didn't allocate much money. After the initial interest faded, most of the members who had filled out an application gradually stopped participating in activities, and even the club president himself worked on other things.</br>
</br>
Only one person was an exception.</br>
</br>
Even today, Lu Hao still vividly remembered the name of the old man.</br>
</br>
Professor of the Astronomy Club, Professor Nie Changhai. His research direction was a subbranch of astronomy, a topic that at the time couldn't be more unpopular - the theory of galatic defense. Although it fitted with the needs of the National University of Defense Technology, most students, let alone professors, were dismissive of this inexplicable subject.</br>
</br>
No matter how people at that time viewed him and his subject, Lu Hao knew very well that the old man was never bothered by the opinion of other people, but wholeheartedly made his topic a lifelong research goal.</br>
</br>
If he must choose an authoritative representative for the defense of extraterrestrial civilization, perhaps the old professor was the only one who can qualify.</br>
</br>
As the thoughts flowed back to him, Lu Hao walked to the guard room and gently tapped on the window to wake up the guard dozing off.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Is Professor Nie Changhai still teaching?"</br>
</br>
"Hey, why don't you call…" The guard wiped the drool off of his mouth and was about to go off on the person that interrupted his afternoon nap. But when his eyes met Lu Hao's, his chose to close his mouth and the swallowed the curse that was about to come out.</br>
</br>
As a guard for so many years, he didn't learn many skills, but he managed to master how to read a person.</br>
</br>
Fu*k, it's probably a senior leader visiting...</br>
</br>
The guard thought in his mind and forced a smile.</br>
</br>
However, Lu Hao did not take it seriously and repeated what he said patiently.</br>
</br>
"Is Professor Nie Changhai still teaching?"</br>
</br>
The guard stopped to think and quickly scanned the name of each professor in his mind. However, he did not remember the name Nie Changhai. He thought he heard wrong, so he questioned in a quiet tone.</br>
</br>
"Who?"</br>
</br>
"Professor Nie," Lu Hao said.</br>
</br>
The guard revealed a bitter smile and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I have been working here for more than three years and I have never heard of a professor named Nie. Should I call someone to ask for you?"</br>
</br>
"I see..." Lu Hao sighed. "It's okay."</br>
</br>
It's already been twenty years. If he is still alive, he must be well into his seventies.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to turn and leave, he heard a slightly cold female voice behind him.</br>
</br>
"You're looking for Professor Nie?"</br>
</br>
Lu Hao turned around and looked at the young woman behind him.</br>
</br>
She didn't look old, but her vibe didn't resemble an undergraduate student. She must be a graduate student at the university. From her appearance, Lu Hao saw some resemblance of someone he used to know, but he couldn't pinpoint who the familiarity belonged to.</br>
</br>
"Yes, and you are?"</br>
</br>
"I am his granddaughter, Nie Han. Why are you looking for Professor Nie?" Nie Han asked.</br>
</br>
"You are the granddaughter of Professor Nie?" Lu Hao's face showed a touch of joy, and he smiled, "I hope you can help me tell professor that Student Lu Hao is seeking his advice."</br>
</br>
"Lu Hao?" When she heard the name, Nie Han's voice gained some warmth and she no longer gave off an aloof vibe, "When he was still alive, he always mentioned your name. He complimented you for being the best student he's ever taught."</br>
</br>
Lu Hao paused in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"When he was still alive?"</br>
</br>
Nie Han nodded and remained silent as she looked down.</br>
</br>
The branches of the birch tree swayed gently and rustled in the wind.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao's throat moved, and a lot of words were rushing out. But because he couldn't find someone to tell, he only let out a long sigh.</br>
</br>
"Am I?"</br>
</br>
From the expression on Lu Hao's face, Nie Han felt remose, so she whispered, "Professor Nie is no longer here, but his items are still in his office. No one has touched them. If you are interested, I can take you to see them."</br>
</br>
"Thank you very much." Lu Hao nodded.</br>
</br>
"Not at all, you are the hero of Hua." After a pause, a smile formed on Nie Han's face, and then she continued, "What's more, if you can learn what he left behind, he will be pleased even in his afterlife."</br>
</br>
Lu Hao and the bodyguard followed behind Nie Han into the community.</br>
</br>
Through the birch trees and the cement stairs, Nie Han took out a key and pushed open the door before she walked into the room.</br>
</br>
"This is the place. Since he left, this house has been empty. This is his office. He never liked others going through his stuff, so we kept the room in the same state and only cleaned it once every month." Then, Nie Han said apologetically, "I was supposed to clean this place but haven't had the time to yet. It's pretty dusty in here. How about you sit in the living room for a bit..."</br>
</br>
"There is no need!" Lu Hao quickly waved his hand and took the broom from Nie Han's hand. "Speaking of it, Professor Nie has passed away for so long and I have only learned of this today. I never even visited his grave. Let me do the cleaning."</br>
</br>
"You are a guest..."</br>
</br>
"What guest! I'm his student!"</br>
</br>
In the end, Nie Han could not convince the insisting Lu Hao and had to agree to his request.</br>
</br>
The bodyguard saw Lu Hao holding the broom and he rushed forward. "I will help you—"</br>
</br>
"You can wait at the door."</br>
</br>
Lu Hao did not appreciate his gesture. After he firmly said this, he went into the house with cleaning supplies.</br>
</br>
With a sincere heart, it took half an hour before Lu Hao swept the last trace of dust away in the office.</br>
</br>
When he saw the office, and the rows of books on the shelves that his professor purchased with the money he saved up, he seemed to return to the summer of more than 20 years ago. He felt his eyes tear up.</br>
</br>
He wiped the corner of his eye, then walked over to the desk and sat where his professor sat before.</br>
</br>
In his memory, Professor Nie always recorded his thoughts on paper whenever he had an idea, and regularly put it in a notebook that he carried with him. He had seen the notebook before, but because the content was too science fiction for him, he once regarded it as a novel without a plot.</br>
</br>
He was not disappointed. The notebook was still in the drawer on his left-hand side.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao gently wiped off the dust on the cover page, and flipped to the last page of the notebook</br>
</br>
"...only the universe, I can't give you any standard answers. The only thing I can do is to give you an idea and guide you to inspiration."</br>
</br>
He whispered the familiar words, then closed the page.</br>
</br>
His fingers gently swept across the cover that turned yellow due to age and once again examined the old desk, he whispered.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>

</br>
The more Jiang Chen looked at the over twenty meters long barrel, the more he adored it.</br>
</br>
Although the actual value of a pure kinetic weapon in space warfare with a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers was still inconclusive, but huge ships and giant cannons were the romance of men! The scene of a thousand cannons firing simultaneously made him excited.</br>
</br>
Now that the cannon is here, will the ship be such a distant dream?</br>
</br>
"Can we test it?" Jiang Chen looked at Ling Tao.</br>
</br>
"Of course! We'll show you its power." Ling Tao took off the radio on his shoulder and spoke a few words to the engineers of the institute, soon the barrel suspended by the mechanical arm slowly lowered itself by half a meter.</br>
</br>
Ling Tao raised his hand and pressed the touchpad a few times. The warehouse door with the electromagnetic pulse cannon was shut and locked. The sprinkler embedded on top of the roof began to release dry ice into the warehouse. At the same time, the vacuum pumps in the lab began to operate.</br>
</br>
With the enchanting smoke screen, the warehouse quickly became a vacuum.</br>
</br>
"Steel plates" a few centimeters thick were transported one by one with the mechanical arm and placed in front of the groove 500 meters away from the electromagnetic pulse cannon to create a steel wall. But that was not everything. When the steel plates were over five meters thick, a concrete wall more than ten meters thick was placed behind the steel plates.</br>
</br>
The size of the entire vacuum laboratory was limited, and the maximum distance was 500 meters. However, for weapons used in space, there was not much difference between 500 meters and five kilometers. After all, there was no air resistance in the universe, and there was no need to consider the kinetic energy attenuation.</br>
</br>
The barrel of the cannon was pointed at the thick "steel plates". The capacitor inside the cannon began to charge, and eerie blue arcs began to leak from the muzzle.</br>
</br>
When everything was ready, Ling Tao smiled at Jiang Chen and invited Jiang Chen to press the command button on the touchpad.</br>
</br>
"Press the red button to fire."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stepped forward, looked at the turret outside the glass, and pressed the red button.</br>
</br>
There was no warning.</br>
</br>
Blue arcs suddenly flashed, and the glaring white light formed and disappeared in an instant. The fifty-kilogram shell smashed onto the steel plate, accompanied by the tremor of the earth and the roar under their feet.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Words couldn't describe such a shocking state.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as he gained the ability to think again, a thigh-sized fracture formed on the steel plate. The wall of steel formed by dozens of steel plates turned into a "V".</br>
</br>
As for the concrete wall behind the steel, it was shattered...</br>
</br>
Because Ling Tao already witnessed this many time, he didn't find it surprising.</br>
</br>
"The cannon can fire shells up to fifty kilograms in mass. In theory, the rate of firing can reach nine rounds per minute. Should we still test one more shot?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"No need, I have seen its power." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Okay"</br>
</br>
Ling Tao nodded. Then, he stepped forward and pressed the touchpad a few more times. Once the overflowing electricity in the high-energy capacitor slowly dissipated, he immediately turned off the power of the cannon. The blue arcs also went dim and eventually disappeared.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Jiang Chen finally said emotionally, "...I am thinking now, if you put this thing on the Pacific Ocean, is there a ship it can't bring down in one shot?"</br>
</br>
"No warship can carry this turret," Ling Tao thought that his boss was really considering this possibility, so he quickly explained to him, "The electromagnetic pulse cannon on the Guardian-class is already strong enough, no ship can be safe and sound after one shot lands—"</br>
</br>
"I know," Jiang Chen waved his hand. "I'm just saying. I won't use a cannon to kill a mosquito."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a while as he examined the cannon, then he continued, "How much is the cost of this cannon?"</br>
</br>
"Ignore the cost of research and development, this prototype costs about 1 billion New Xin dollars."</br>
</br>
1 billion New Xin dollars!</br>
</br>
When he heard this figure, even as the major shareholder of the Xin Fed, Jiang Chen shivered.</br>
</br>
Even if large-scale production could reduce the cost by half, the price tag would still be 500 million Xin New dollars. If the Earth fleet planned to equip hundreds of the electromagnetic pulse cannons on its ship, it would bankrupt the Earth Defense Alliance!</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen's expression didn't look too good, Ling Tao who guessed his boss thoughts quickly explained.</br>
</br>
"The reason why it is so expensive is mainly because of the manufacturing process. Many parts cannot be produced by the current technology. Only industrial-grade 3D printers can be used as a substitute. Once the production technology catches up, the cannon won't be so expensive."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finally felt better after the explanation.</br>
</br>
In a few days, the Earth Defense Alliance would reconvene once again. The next meeting was to discuss what class of ships should be built as the first million-ton starship.</br>
</br>
In fact, regardless of the class of ship, conventional weapons like electromagnetic pulse cannons would be indispensable. So regardless of the result, orders would go to Future Military. After all, Future Group's advantage on electromagnetic pulse cannons were obvious to the world.</br>
</br>
It was just that the cost of nearly one billion is too expensive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew that if he switched positions with a member of the committee, he wouldn't easily agree on this budget.</br>
</br>
After all, he didn't own the Earth Defense Alliance. The members paid according to a percentage of GDP and the population. Hua contributed three trillion in just one year! How could Hua allow a company from a differnt country spend this money so easily?</br>
</br>
As the executive, he had the decision-making power, but the committee also had voting rights and the authority to do a budget review.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to have a headache.</br>
</br>
How can I fool these committee members?</br>
</br>
It doesn't seem like an easy task...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With August right around the corner, the expectation of the 2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise began to increase. However, Celestial Trade's reaction had been quite mild, as if the carrier battle group parked at their front door didn't seem to cause any concern.</br>
</br>
Above the height of 36,000 kilometers, the spindle-shaped aircraft moved between the steel skeletons several kilometers long. Like sewing needles, they weaved the future of Earth Civilization in electric sparks.</br>
</br>
It was the second shipyard of Celestial Trade, and the current progress of the project was only 15%.</br>
</br>
The new shipyard that covered ​​100 acres and costed nearly 20 billion Xin New dollars, was like a satellite city suspended on the side of Celestial City. The city was connected to the space elevator by a graphene track.</br>
</br>
Six spindles of about three kilometers in length suspended in the synchronous orbit, connected by a titanium alloy skeleton. Just like a narrow and hollow hexagonal prism, it outlined the shape of the entire shipyard.</br>
</br>
Remotely contriolled by human engineers with the help of neural connection technology, nearly a thousand construction robots particiapted in the construction of the space elevator by welding pieces of alloy to the skeleton. The spindle-shaped aircraft moved around the shipyard as they sent materials and construction equipment to the construction robots.</br>
</br>
In the future, all warships with tonnage above 500,000 would be built in this shipyard.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance already held more than a dozen meetings on the the first ship to be built in the shipyard, but it still couldn't come to a conclusion. Some people proposed to develop missile ships, some people suggested to prioritize aircraft carriers and drones…</br>
</br>
The last one to end the debate was a representative from Hua, Lu Hao.</br>
</br>
At the seventeenth meeting, his "functional ship theory" gained support from most members.</br>
</br>
"It is ridiculous to use the 19th-century artillery to fight battleships of the 20th century. However, after a 19th-century warship has been modified by a 20th-century artillery system, then they can still play a role on the battlefield. Rather than the controversy being whether we should arm our ships with bows or spears, it is better to build the ship first and then consider what weapons to put on it."</br>
</br>
The choice of weapons should be considered in the future, but leave rooms of modifications and upgrades. Even if innovation in shipbuilding technology ultimately rendered this ship useless, it could still be repurposed into a construction ship for additional values.</br>
</br>
Lu Hao's proposal also gave Jiang Chen a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
At least for now, he didn't have to worry about how to convince the committee to buy a billion-dollar cannon.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The aim to standarize warships meant that all future warships, regardless of aircraft carriers or battleships, would be based on the first warship. All weapons and functional accessories would also be designed and manufactured around the same standards.</br>
</br>
This was like the current space station; all components were built based on the six by four standard proposed by Celestial Trade. If someone designed a six by five interface, there would be no available interface for it to dock and its only fate would be to float in space.</br>
</br>
Whoever controlled the standards would have the right to control the industry for half a century, or even an entire century.</br>
</br>
It was easy to tell how attractive the first million-ton ship would be.</br>
</br>
Hua and Russia didn't even possess the entry technology to build a 500,000-ton ship, let alone a million-ton ship, or else the first order wouldn't be swallowed down by Future Heavy Industries alone.</br>
</br>
However, only Future Heavy Industries could confidently complete the million-ton ship. Although Hua and Russia both built shipyards on Celestial City, they only received orders for smaller ships.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries was different. Not only did the company successfully build three 500,000-ton "Seagull-class" transport ships, it was in the process of building the the fourth "Seagull". The four Seagull-classs not only helped Future Heavy Industries to accumulate a wealth of shipbuilding experience, but they also allowed the shipyard building process to advance to a new height.</br>
</br>
Although Hua and Russia both eyed the attractive deal, there was very little they could to change the situation. They just regretted that their own space companies didn't have the capability to close the giant technology gap.</br>
</br>
Of course, Future Heavy Industries took away the biggest piece of meat. But there was still a lot of meat and soup left in the pot.</br>
</br>
It was important to know that through the 50% defense tax and the output value contributed by the member states, the Earth Defense Alliance Fund had raised a total of 349 billion New Xin Dollars. Based on the team of professional managers employed by the fund, the fund would raise over 12 trillion New Xin Dollars by the end of 2019 with its current momentum.</br>
</br>
How astronomical was this number?</br>
</br>
To choose a reference for comparison, based on the GDP data released five years ago by Hua, the 12 trillion New Xin Dollar was more than 10% of the annual GDP of Hua in 2015.</br>
</br>
It was 10% of the GDP output from the world's second largest economy!</br>
</br>
Of course, Hua's current GDP was by far higher than what it was five years ago. Especially after the announcement of the asteroid mining program, the GDP of the major aerospace powers saw quite a substantial increase. Even so, the 12 trillion New Xin Dollar still was an astronomical amount.</br>
</br>
Even if they couldn't help building the ship, it was still possible to build the computer, or even worse, at least possible to contribute the screws or the buttons on the spacesuit. The more upstream the industry, the more downstream industries were involved. The construction of the mega million-ton military ship would have far more stimulating effects on the aerospace industry of the member states than the four Seagull-class transport ships.</br>
</br>
</br>
Because of this, everyone wanted a piece of the ship.</br>
</br>
Not only the Earth Defense Alliance coveted this pie, but also the aerospace companies from non-member states.</br>
</br>
Although these non-members also contributed a lot of money in the form of defense tax, when the Earth Defense Alliance chose cooperation partners, it was extremely critical of companies from non-member countries. Even the leading SpaceX only received an order of 1.7 billion New Xin Dollars in navigation projects.</br>
</br>
Out of a total of 12 trillion New Xin Dollars!</br>
</br>
Those aerospace companies in Silicon Valley and Seattle were all extremely envious and countless times arranged their employees and unions to petition the Capitol. They lobbied to join the Earth Defense Alliance, or at least to establish good cooperative relations with the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
It was the first time in the history of the UA where capitalists and unions worked so closely together, unprecedented.</br>
</br>
Nippon was even more direct, the only asteroid mine was operated by several powerful consortia, which provided millions of tons of mineral resources to the Nippon manufacturing industry every year. When the 50% defense tax was introduced, the profits plummeted. Later, when the 12 trillion New Xin dollar fund was announced, they worked together to pressure the Nippon government to join the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Inside Future Building on Coro Island, Jiang Chen was in his office sipping on his coffee, he was carefully writing something on paper.</br>
</br>
The line "Earth Defense Alliance Research Fund Allocation Plan" was written on it.</br>
</br>
The first order for Future Heavy Industries shipyard was an unarmed ship. Lu Hao's proposal ended the nonstop debate at the committee. The Earth Defense Alliance no longer had to worry about which company's weapons to buy, because weapons were no longer a consideration.</br>
</br>
In the short run, it was undoubtedly the best choice to save resources. Instead of wasting production capacity on weapons that are destined to be eliminated, it was better to think long term. However, in the long run, this proposal was still somewhat ill-considered.</br>
</br>
Without enticing the arm dealers who make cannons and turrets, why would they put money into research to upgrade and advance weapons?</br>
</br>
The more weapons purchased, the stronger the weapons. If there were no sales, there would be no competition. Why did military technology on the wasteland recover so fast? Because for most survivor camps, 50% or even 80% of GDP was spent on weapons.</br>
</br>
In that kind of environment, even without proper labs, the Sixth Street used sickle and welding torches to create the T3 Power Armor no inferior to the power armor before the war. After NAC unified the Wanghai area, although Jiang Chen invested a lot in scientific research, the speed of weapon upgrade slowed down.</br>
</br>
After the T4 Power Armor, the Sixth Street didn't manage to create a new power armor. The K1 kinetic skeleton became the standard for the three division. With the kinetic skeleton, the NAC Army could easily sweep through the wasteland, and naturally technology progression was no longer needed.</br>
</br>
Earth Defense Alliance's urgent task was to find a way to stimulate military companies to develop weapons. The best way was to use methods other than orders to give them incentives to do research.</br>
</br>
Money is no longer the problem, but how to spend the money is now the problem.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Sometimes he would exclaim, why he did not transmigrate from the future. Without any precedent to follow, he must explore. Now he only faced the problem of his budget. After the Earth Fleet is formed, there would be many things he would have headaches over.</br>
</br>
"Talents, talents... Earth Defense Alliance is still lacking talents."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1119: Earth Fleet Taking its Shape</br>
</div></br>
</br>
How about building a new military academy?</br>
</br>
Focusing on training military personnel for the Earth Defense Alliance?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes lit up when he thought about this. The more he dwelled the idea, the more he felt he was onto something. He pulled a piece of paper and jotted down a few sentences before adding a few zeros to the end as a budget reference.</br>
</br>
"I'm finally done. This is not a one-person job..."</br>
</br>
He tossed the pen aside and pushed away the thick stack of documents. He leaned back in the chair and stretched his sore neck and arms.</br>
</br>
He hasn't work this hard for a long time and he wasn't used to the workload.</br>
</br>
His beautiful assistant knocked on the door and came in with a cup of coffee.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, who was stretching, she put the cup on his desk and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Boss, your coffee. Do you need me to add sugar for you?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, put a few cubes in."</br>
</br>
The assistant put two cubes of sugar into the cup, and understandingly stirred the cup for him with a coffee spoon before she brought the cup to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sniffed the pure aroma and took a sip of the coffee. The bitterness and sweetness spreaded on his taste buds as he nodded in satisfaction. Not only because of the cup of coffee, but because of the beautiful assistant's excellent service.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, this is the life of a boss.</br>
</br>
The assistant's smile was even more joyous when she saw the smile on Jiang Chen. She raised her hands and moved her fingers.</br>
</br>
"Boss, if you are tired, I can help massage your shoulders. My massage technique is great, and every time I helped CEO Xia massage, she always praises me."</br>
</br>
Most of the work was given to the artificial intelligence "Jean". Rather than being an office assistant, she was more of the life assistant to the president. She really just needed to make Jiang Chen coffee, organize documents, and deliver messages to other departments.</br>
</br>
With so few tasks, it was basically impossible to have any achievements in performance. For her, the only way she could get promoted was to do everything to perfection.</br>
</br>
For this reason, she learned many other "skills".</br>
</br>
"Then please."</br>
</br>
He was indeed a little tired and did not reject this offer. He turned around his chair and gazed out at Coro City from the floor-to-ceiling window. While he relaxed his tensed state, he felt the two soft and gentle hands massaging his shoulders. They felt so good that he almost moaned.</br>
</br>
"Comfortable?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, very comfortable... right, what is your name?"</br>
</br>
"Hehe... boss you are so rarely here that you can't even remember my name?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the second meeting of the Earth Defense Alliance Committee, most of the members stayed in Celestial City, but the executive officer returned to the surface. On the one hand, he was not used to living in space, on the other hand, it was due to an inexplicable sense of lack of security.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the ground, no matter what danger he encountered, he could escape by using his ability. But in Celestial City, he never even attempted it once.</br>
</br>
The reason was very simple. Celestial City was spinning all the time. He could never confirm whether he would appear at the same place or end up drifting somewhere in the vast space.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen had doubted this a long time ago. The position of his travel ability should not be as simple as the three-dimensional coordinates. After all, the Earth itself was orbiting around the solar system all the time.</br>
</br>
Intuition told him that all of this may be related to the mysterious Klein particles.</br>
</br>
The drafted "Earth Defense Alliance Research Fund Budget Allocation Proposal" was scanned into an electronic file. It was passed to Kelvin in the Celestial Trade Aerospace Department through Jean for him to make further improvements.</br>
</br>
After he took care of these matters, it was almost noon.</br>
</br>
After going downstairs with Xia Shiyu for lunch, Jiang Chen estimated it was time, so he drove to the Ange Island Astronaut Training Center.</br>
</br>
At the last meeting, some members brought forth the opinions of their country and expressed their willingness to send their soldiers to join the Earth Fleet. Of course, Jiang Chen would not refuse the enthusiastic proposal of the member states. Now Celestial Trade was extremely lacking in astronauts, the million-ton ship would at least require thousands of crew members. If the member states were willing to share some of the pressure for him, he more than welcomed this idea...</br>
</br>
If that was really the case.</br>
</br>
On the square in front of the main entrance of the Ange Island Astronaut Training Center, a team of burly, sharp-looking men stood under the scorching sun in a neat formation.</br>
</br>
Their skin colors were different. Some were from East Asia, some from Russia, and some from Madagascar - the only African countries decided to join the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Tourists passing by all stopped, they looked at them with curiosity and awe.</br>
</br>
From the vibe of these people, it was not difficult to guess their identity.</br>
</br>
The word "military" was almost written on their faces, infused into their blood and bones.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, it was Jiang Chen in front of this team. When he took the list of names from Wu Changfeng, he had a complicated expression.</br>
</br>
Undoubtedly, all the countries have treated the Earth Defense Alliance matter seriously. When they heard about the formation of the Earth Fleet, they immediately sent soldiers. Moreover, from the resumes in his hands, all the member states sent elites of the army. The type of soldiers that would be favored by any leader.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen knew that this made his work much more troublesome.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could not help but sigh in his mind.</br>
</br>
You guys, I need to form the Earth Fleet. I'm lacking officers who know how to adapt. What is the use of sending me bunch of muscles? Do we need to fight mutants with rifles? What's the use with all of them just knowing how to listen to orders? It's going to take me so long to re-educate them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was even more determined to establish an aerospace military academy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen cleared his mind and said loudly in front of the soldiers.</br>
</br>
"Your mission for the next three months is to accept the basic training necessary for astronauts here. I assure you that the next three months will be extremely difficult. But I also hope that you will remember that your hard work is for the future of Earth! And for the future of your motherland!"</br>
</br>
"DO YOU UNDERSTAND?" Jiang Chen shouted at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
"UNDERSTOOD!"</br>
</br>
Different languages, but the roar resounded in the square and echoed between the buildings.</br>
</br>
The roar was like a long sword being pulled out of its sheath, revealing its sheen to the world. All bystanders were moved, and their blood surged in passion.</br>
</br>
Although the future war didn't just depend on passion, these people would ultimately be fighting, and it would be these people that decide the outcome of the war. These officers would serve as a seed, rooting their thoughts and their will in every aspect of the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly felt that it wouldn't be so bad to have such a group of tough and resilient soldiers as the first group of officers of the Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1120"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1120: The End of the Century</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A total of five hundred volunteers from member states joined the Earth Fleet that was still in its formation stage. Among them, Hua, Russia, and Frankberg accounted for 70%, while the majority of the remaining 30% came from South Asia.</br>
</br>
These volunteers would be trained in the Ange Island Astronaut Training Center, currently recognized as the largest and most professional astronaut training base in the world. They would learn the basics of being an astronaut to adapt and combat in space.</br>
</br>
These  five hundred volunteers were the first group. In the coming year, the member states would also send a total of five thousand volunteers based on assigned quotas to deliver new blood to the burgeoning Earth Fleet.</br>
</br>
After the five hundred volunteers settled down, Jiang Chen parted farewell with Wu Changfeng and left the training center. Instead of returning directly to Future Building, he drove to the high-tech park to visit Future Heavy Industries' factory.</br>
</br>
After signing a power export agreement with Hua Electricity Group last time, Hua's Minister of Transportation made a trip to Xin. After he learned about the cost of the magnetic levitation road, he immediately proposed the idea of introducing the technology to the country.</br>
</br>
At that time, Jiang Chen agreed, but Future Heavy Industries was focused on building the magnetic levitation road network on several islands. The production capacity at the time was not enough to develop the overseas markets. Now that the last island was transformed, Future Heavy Industries could begin to focus on international orders.</br>
</br>
After he arrived at Future Heavy Industries' factory, CEO Yang Guanglei took Jiang Chen for a tour and showed him the newly built magnetic levitation production line.</br>
</br>
"This new production line is an attempt at automation. It uses a supercomputer to coordinate the production processes. From production, processing, assembly to final delivery, everything is done by machinery. Except for several engineers responsible for maintenance and optimization of the production line, this production line can be said to be completely unmanned!"</br>
</br>
Yang Guanglei was quite proud when he made this statement</br>
</br>
It was not a steel ingot or a lead bullet production line, but a high-tech product that included hundreds of links!</br>
</br>
From the drawing of the graphene circuit board to the assembly of magnetic levitation generating devices, it was completely operated by automated machineries. If the automation could be applied to other fields, it would undoubtedly be a great leap for Future Heavy Industries' productivity and cost-savings.</br>
</br>
Although the focus of Future Heavy Industries was on aerospace, the company was still a pioneer in the civilian field. After all, as social animals, economic benefits were often the driving force for technological advances. History has proved countless times that technological breakthrough often starts with civilians.</br>
</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen looked at the black-colored quadrangular pyramidal piles passing through the assembly line, he nodded with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"How many magnetic levitation devices can you produce per month?" Jiang Chen asked Yang Guanglei.</br>
</br>
"With sufficient raw materials, we can reach a monthly output of 100,000!"</br>
</br>
100,000 was already better than the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was quite astounded by the number.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan began to push for a magnetic levitation road in the Sixth Street a long time ago. At that time, Jiang Chen learned from the factory responsible for the production of this magnetic levitation device had only reached 50% automation.</br>
</br>
He didn't know what the productivity levels were before the war, but it wouldn't be too different.</br>
</br>
Many times, Jiang Chen felt that the Future Group in his hand was like a silkworm. It slowly digested the technology he brought back from the 22nd century and spat out white and firm silk threads one at a time.</br>
</br>
One day, it will turn into a cocoon.</br>
</br>
One day, it will break the cocoon and become a butterfly.</br>
</br>
In the shambles of the apocalypse, Future Group would give birth to new glory, bringing the world in a more prosperous and beautiful direction.</br>
</br>
Now, Jiang Chen already vaguely "saw" the shape of the cocoon, and he could even faintly touch the boundaries of the 22nd century.</br>
</br>
At least in the timeline of the apocalypse with the three superpowers, even by 2170, colonizing Mars was still a dream. However, with Celestial Trade, the Mars colony already began the second round of expansion.</br>
</br>
Just then, a sudden phone call interrupted Jiang Chen's imagination for the future.</br>
</br>
It was Ye Qinghua.</br>
</br>
He opened the holographic screen, then he gestured Yang Guanglei to wait for a moment and went to the side to pick up the phone.</br>
</br>
"Uncle Ye? Is there something wrong?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Since the last outer space development forum, Ye Qinghua had stayed in Xin. Although he retired from his position and had no power in his hands, no one could ignore his influence and his family in Hua's political scene.</br>
</br>
The reason why he stayed here largely explained the official attitude of Hua, and the country still valued Xin as a natural ally.</br>
</br>
"Haha, can I not call Mr. Jiang just to chat?" Ye Qinghua said in a half-joking tone.</br>
</br>
"Of course you can," Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Although Elder Ye rarely spoke to him, Jiang Chen knew that the old man didn't just sit around. If it was not for Ayesha, he didn't even know that Elder Ye actually moved beside his parents.</br>
</br>
He didn't just move there. The elder man either played chess with his dad and Elder Xia or went fishing to catch seafood.</br>
</br>
Elder Ye's hometown was in the River South area, strictly speaking, they all came from the same hometown. Meeting a fellow townsman in a foreign country, the elders naturally were very enthusiastic about being acquainted. Elder Ye quickly integrated into Jiang Jianguo's circle.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know why he was so close to his father, but he didn't bother with their interaction. Usually, he just headed back to his parents' house to have a meal, and he seldom talked about work, so Elder Ye wouldn't learn anything about him.</br>
</br>
As long as Elder Ye did not try to persuade his father about the marriage between him and Elder Ye's granddaughter, everything else was negotiable.</br>
</br>
"I heard that the magnetic levitation road that you discussed with the Ministry of Transportations will start construction in a month or two?"</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, he was there to inspect the production line. It was great timing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and said, "Is the Ye family interested in infrastructure?"</br>
</br>
"Hehe, it's the younger generations." Elder Ye laughed, but he sounded serious.</br>
</br>
"Let me tell you the truth. The magnetic levitation road modification project is not a difficult one, and the technical requirement is pretty low. A driller just needs to put the magnetic device into the road," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Elder Ye quickly said, "Then how about this..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and interrupted him, "The key is not with us, but with you. We are only a supplier. The Ministry of Transportations and the provincial transportation departments are responsible for the bidding. If you have the power to take on the project, of course, I don't have any complaints."</br>
</br>
"Haha, rest assured, we have already spoken with the Ministry of Transportations and the provincial transportation departments. Now we are waiting for you to start shipping so we can start construction on there." Elder Ye laughed.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1121: The Concept of Smart City</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Among all the technologies owned by Future Group, Hua was the most interested in the magnetic levitation road.</br>
</br>
Three-dimensional traffic had a significant effect on releasing traffic pressure in high-density cities. Needless to say, the unfriendly policies of limiting plates and limiting the days of driving could be completely eliminated. With the three-dimensional traffic implemented, the traffic load a city could handle would increase exponentially.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this, Hua offered an astronomical figure of 10 billion Xin New dollars to ask Future Heavy Industries to assist in the transformation of the existing road infrastructure in a pilot city.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen certainly wouldn't refuse this proposal, after all, it was a great opportunity to open the overseas market for Luer magnetic levitation vehicles. The more electrified Hua becomes, the more difficult it would be for the country to reject his Global Grid Plan and the more difficult it would be for them to escape Xin's sphere of influence...</br>
</br>
Not satisfied with just this, Jiang Chen used this opportunity to also sell the concept of a "Smart City" to Ye Qinghua.</br>
</br>
"Smart city is to integrate all the public service projects of the city's logistics, transportation, communication, water and electricity, and coordinate the allocation by Artificial Intelligence. Taking the magnetic levitation technology as an example, we will connect every car into the traffic network and maintain a specific speed at a certain height, so that vehicles of the same height remain relatively static, thus completely eliminating traffic accidents caused by vehicle collisions..."</br>
</br>
Ye Qinghua shifted the phone into his other hand. His cloudy eyes flickered, disguising his thoughts.</br>
</br>
Although he did not say anything, Jiang Chen's words have already planted a seed in his heart.</br>
</br>
A seed named future.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At 9:00 pm on July 29th, a bright silver silhouette emerged from the horizon, and the Gulfstream G650 landed smoothly at Coro International Airport.</br>
</br>
Sitting at the seat beside the window, Elon Musk, who had not fully adjusted to the jetlag, opened his weary eyes and looked out through the window. He saw all kinds of airplane models, saw the runway that quickly reversed backward, and saw the brightly lit city in the distance...</br>
</br>
The blue signal on the side of the runway flew backward. Like a glowing snake, it gradually mystified his vision.</br>
</br>
Just then, he felt someone pulling his sleeve. He narrowed his eyes and stopped gazing at the runway that fascinated him to look at the person beside him.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Musk, we are here," his assistant whispered.</br>
</br>
Elon Musk nodded and pressed his hands on the armrests. Just as he stood up, his weary eyes were replaced with a sharp gaze.</br>
</br>
He was a very clear-cut person who is used to seeing the world from the perspective of an engineer.</br>
</br>
When he was in college, he often thought about the real problems the world faced and how those problems affected the future of mankind. He was optimistic about the Internet, sustainable energy, and space exploration. Later, he subsequently entered these three areas and created three companies, PayPal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although the latter two were defeated by Luer and Celestial Trade respectively, neither Tesla nor SpaceX faltered. Now, with the bankruptcy of the Noah's Ark Fund, SpaceX narrowly missed the 100 billion US dollars project and got pushed out of the Earth Fleet program.</br>
</br>
In the long run, even if SpaceX inherited the advantages that NASA has accumulated since the Cold War era, it would be left behind in this ever-changing era.</br>
</br>
Elon Musk's mood was not so pleasant with the thought.</br>
</br>
The primary goal of his trip to Xin was to have a face to face conversation with Jiang Chen. Although he didn't have much hope, what would be the harm in trying?</br>
</br>
After he got off the plane, the airport staff came over and talked to his assistant. Soon, his assistant came back and whispered to Elon Musk.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Musk, Future Group has arranged a special convoy for us outside the VIP passage of the airport."</br>
</br>
"Future Group?" Elon Musk was slightly surprised. "They already know I am coming?"</br>
</br>
But it made sense. The international airport under his foot was funded by Celestial Trade and even the air defense of Xin was contracted to Celestial Trade. Perhaps when the airplane took off from LAX, Celestial Trade already knew.</br>
</br>
Although the feeling of his privacy being invaded made him a little uncomfortable, he did not say anything about it. After all, he hoped to convince Jiang Chen to separate politics from economic cooperation and allow SpaceX to compete fairly in the market.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Should we take the hotel's vehicle, or..." his assistant whispered.</br>
</br>
"Let's use the hotel's vehicle, remember to bring my suitcase." Elon Musk walked in the direction of the airport staff.</br>
</br>
A black car was parked at the exit of the VIP passage. He finally understood why Jiang Chen would send a special convoy to pick him up; the exit of the airport was surrounded by reporters.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the news leaked before he left.</br>
</br>
Among the vans that surrounded the airport exit, he even saw the LA Times.</br>
</br>
SpaceX lost in the bidding for the Earth Fleet program, and many people were eager to see his disappointment. His competitors, especially, would mock at his downfall. It was no exaggeration to say that as soon as he revealed his face in front of the reporters, he would appear on the news the next day with the label of bowing down to Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
With this thought in mind, Elon showed a bitter smile. The dissatisfaction of his privacy being invaded disappeared, and he felt grateful for Jiang Chen's initiative.</br>
</br>
On the vehicle headed to his hotel, Elon Musk gazed at the traffic passing around him and sighed.</br>
</br>
"I originally thought that Silicon Valley is the future of the world. I didn't think that Coro City has already entered the 22nd century ahead of time."</br>
</br>
"Your first time here? You will be more surprised when you get to the city center." With the magnetic leviathan mode activated, the man in charge of driving looked at Elon and grinned. "I don't know if you have seen that movie? The one starring Bruce Willis?"</br>
</br>
"Bruce Willis?" Elon Musk frowned and suddenly a title appeared in his mind, "The Fifth Element?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, The Fifth Element. One of the few sci-fi blockbusters in France." The driver laughed.</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect the American Dream to be realized by Xin," Elon Musk said.</br>
</br>
"It is the dream of all mankind," the driver said with pride.</br>
</br>
"You are not a native of Xin?" Elon Musk suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
"Used to be British, but why does it matter? My wife and I left Europe after the referendum about three years ago. Did you know? That's my most proud decision I made in my life. If you never lived here before, you will never get a sense of how amazing the changes are here."</br>
</br>
Elon Musk gazed at him for a long time.</br>
</br>
Once a person started to feel proud of his new nationality, no matter where he used to come from, it was in the past.</br>
</br>
Xin's assimilation of culture was shocking. This assimilation didn't exist because of institutional or cultural pressures, but because of pure scientific and technological advantages. People living here already felt a sense of superiority compared to people from other countries. This kind of superiority was a feeling of civilized people looking at the more primitive.</br>
</br>
Yes, even the most prosperous city in UA was far less advanced than the city of the future.</br>
</br>
At least no car there could fly on the road.</br>

</br>
At noon the next day, Jiang Chen met Elon Musk, who had traveled across the globe, in the conference room of Future Building. The nearly 50-year-old Silicon Valley legend still looked sharp and there wasn't any sign of time on him.</br>
</br>
"Please feel free to sit." Jiang Chen looked at Elon Musk walking into the conference room as he pointed to the chair and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Elon nodded politely, sat down and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was looking at him, he was also examining Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He had long heard about the young man who started from scratch in his twenties and established a technological empire that spanned across the globe in less than five years. Today, at first sight, he indeed looked extraordinary.</br>
</br>
Involved in industries from the Internet to new energy, and new materials to aerospace, his tentacles spanned almost all aspects of production and life. Anything that could be imagined was turned into reality by the works of Future Group.</br>
</br>
To this day, Elon Musk never understood how Jiang Chen's brain functioned. In a country where a great person was least likely to be born, such an enchanting individual was born.</br>
</br>
"This visit from Mr. Musk today must not just be to chat, right?" Jiang Chen smiled, leaned back in the chair, and crossed his fingers in front of his knees. "You and I are both extremely busy, so why don't we get straight to the point."</br>
</br>
Elon Musk stared at Jiang Chen for half a minute and finally sighed.</br>
</br>
"Before I came in, I was thinking about how to convince you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Oh? You're not thinking about it now?"</br>
</br>
Elon Musk shook his head and went on, "But when I saw you, I know it is practically impossible to convince you."</br>
</br>
"Can I hear the reason?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Because we're the same type of person." Elon Musk looked at Jiang Chen and said seriously, "If we're certain about something, we won't change easily."</br>
</br>
Elon Musk's words made Jiang Chen think.</br>
</br>
However, the thinking only lasted for less than ten seconds. Jiang Chen spread his hands and said with ease, "You're right. If you're here about the Earth Fleet project, I can tell you clearly that you can go back now."</br>
</br>
When Musk heard that Jiang Chen practically gave SpaceX the death sentence, he couldn't help but feel bitter.</br>
</br>
"Can't you give Silicon Valley companies a chance to compete fairly? We have a technological advantage over aerospace companies in other countries, and we will never lose to Russia and Hua companies in cost and quality. The Earth Fleet is the future of mankind. It isn't fair to risk the future of the planet just because of some diplomatic frictions—"</br>
</br>
"Just because?" Jiang Chen chuckled and interrupted Elon Musk. "The UA fleet is in Guam, right at the doorstep of Xin. Is that 'just because'?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Elon Musk, who couldn't refute, then his finger gently tapped the table and he emotionlessly said, "In my opinion, as long as the funds are in place, there's no permanent advantage. You obtained your technological advantage today because of the space race in the Cold War era, so you received a large budget."</br>
</br>
</br>
"We have fifty years or even a century to prepare for this war. In this time scale, the advantages at the starting point are completely negligible."</br>
</br>
"Not to mention, in my opinion, your technical advantage is nothing."</br>
</br>
Nothing…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's understatement just denied the achievements of NASA's half-century of work and negated SpaceX's position as the second-best organization.</br>
</br>
Although Elon Musk was unwilling, he looked at Jiang Chen and not a word could come out. There was only a bitter smile on his face.</br>
</br>
He could blame the fact that the space elevator was built in the western Pacific or he could blame Celestial Trade for grabbing the throats of the world's space companies. With the existence of this large gap, even the technological capabilities of the second-place organization to the one-hundredth place couldn't match Celestial Trade's capabilities.</br>
</br>
Elon Musk shook his head and stood up.</br>
</br>
Since there was no purpose in discussing this, there was no need for him to waste time there.</br>
</br>
While SpaceX and a group of Silicon Valley companies were excluded from the Earth Fleet, Celestial Trade still gave them an opportunity to survive. At least the asteroid mining project could still be profitable, and the companies could still receive contracts for outsourcing projects... However, they wouldn't be able to access the trillion-dollar market.</br>
</br>
Stimulated by trillions of New Xin dollars, even a moron could learn and advance. As Jiang Chen said, in the next few decades, the technological gap would only widen between members and non-members of the Earth Defense Alliance, unless the Capitol had the determination of the Cold War era to invest in aerospace.</br>
</br>
But is this possible?</br>
</br>
The gap between UA and Xin is separated by a 36,000-kilometre space elevator.</br>
</br>
Perhaps there's no way of negotiating an agreement in the first place...</br>
</br>
Just as Elon Musk got up and was about to leave, Jiang Chen suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Of course, there's always room for negotiation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's understatement, like a bomb, was thrown into Elon Musk's heart which had already sunk to the bottom. He turned sharply and looked at Jiang Chen at the conference table.</br>
</br>
However, after he witnessed Jiang Chen's half-smiling expression, his pumping heart quickly calmed.</br>
</br>
He knew that the "so-called room for negotiation" was subject to conditions.</br>
</br>
The expression on his face changed several times, and he asked Jiang Chen: "What do you mean?"</br>
</br>
"There are many UA citizens starting businesses in Xin," Jiang Chen said with a smile. "There's an old saying: people go to high places and the water flows down. Since SpaceX can't find a way out in Silicon Valley, why not consider Penglai and Celestial City?"</br>
</br>
Elon Musk paused, and he had a peculiar expression.</br>
</br>
He originally thought Jiang Chen would demand unreasonable conditions; he didn't expect Jiang Chen to start headhunting?</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is kidding, right?" Elon Musk said, disguising his emotions. "Do you think that a company like us can leave at will? Also, you should be worried about the imminent issue."</br>
</br>
"The imminent issue?" Jiang Chen laughed and spread his hands. "I don't know what the problem is? Can Mr. Musk enlighten me?"</br>
</br>
"The aircraft carrier is at your door. Isn't that a problem?" Elon Musk stared at Jiang Chen right in the eyes. He couldn't tell if Jiang Chen was arrogant or confident, as he tried to figure out the reason for the fearlessness in his pupils. "In fact, if you take a step back, we can all live."</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for a long time before Jiang Chen suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"When did Silicon Valley start to lobby?"</br>
</br>
"I didn't say anything."</br>
</br>
Knowing that his final attempt at persuasion failed, Elon Musk shook his head and stopped wasting time. He pushed open the door and left the room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who didn't look at the departing Elon Musk, opened the holographic screen on his watch. He swiped on his calendar and seemingly muttered to himself, "It's almost time to start."</br>
</br>
Take a step back?</br>
</br>
Taking a step back is the real hell.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1123: Hegemony!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At noon on August 1st, the aircraft carrier battle group stationed in the Guam military base set off. The flag swayed in the sea breeze, and the heroic Marines stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier with their rifles. They gazed to the southwest with enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
Coro City, the capital of Xin stood there.</br>
</br>
Xin became a stone blocking the UA from establishing its hegemony in the region.</br>
</br>
At least in front of these soldiers, the small country Xin was no different from a stone. As soon as they were given the order, they would rush onto the assault boats and re-enact the "Desert Storm" on the beaches of Coro Island.</br>
</br>
As a strong supporter of UA, the Nippon Maritime Self-Defense Force formed a battlegroup west of Guam. The fleet included the second-generation Ford-class aircraft carrier and Nippon's helicopter carrier.</br>
</br>
In addition, the Australian, South Korean, and Singaporean navies participated in the military exercise.</br>
</br>
Other than Country F which had already lost to Celestial Trade, the Asian countries within the UA's sphere of influence all participated in the military exercise. Whether willing or not, the four navies mobilized their most elite forces into the region.</br>
</br>
The entire Western Pacific Ocean was in full swing.</br>
</br>
Anyone could see a storm has been gathering over the peaceful sea.</br>
</br>
About forty modern battleships lined up in battle formation on the high sea to begin the first round of target practice exercises in the 2019 Asia-Pacific joint military exercise.</br>
</br>
Dozens of target ships were pulled to the area. With the flagship's order, shells dragging orange tails bombarded the target waters. In an instant, the fleet of "imaginary enemies" sank and shredded into fragmentations.</br>
</br>
At the same time, dozens of Tomahawk missiles dragging trails of flames lifted off from the missile frigate, accurately hitting targets more than 300 nautical miles away.</br>
</br>
The F-35 and F-22 fighters took off from the deck one after another, leaving behind countless white trails behind to weave a net in the open air. More than a dozen flight squadrons took off to perform mid-range air-to-air combat and anti-ship operations.</br>
</br>
Gunpowder raged in the western Pacific Ocean, and the calm sea turned turbulent.</br>
</br>
The faces of the representatives of the countries standing in the audience all displayed some fear, and they began to doubt their previous decisions.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the power displayed by the UA Navy already exceeded their expectations. Although they gained a lot of benefits from Celestial Trade and although the Global Grid Plan could give a big boost to their economy... power was what mattered.</br>
</br>
Without enough force to protect their wealth, wealth was a sin.</br>
</br>
Iraq and Afghanistan were all examples.</br>
</br>
The representatives of the countries in the audience began to debate if they should reconsider the diplomatic relationship between Xin and the Earth Defense Alliance. Was it a good choice to make such a rash decision?</br>
</br>
</br>
The representative of Ecuador, in particular, felt like a bucket of cold water was poured over his head.</br>
</br>
The signal of the second space elevator released by Celestial Trade made the Ecuadorian government lose any logical sense, so they withstood the pressure of the neighboring countries and the UA. They embraced Celestial Trade and gave the green light to the trans-Pacific submarine transmission cable.</br>
</br>
The choice now seemed to be a dangerous and wrong one...</br>
</br>
At the same time that the representatives were all reflecting on their choices, the joint fleet officers standing on the flagship were proud.</br>
</br>
In the entire aircraft carrier battle group, the aircraft carrier served as the fist of the entire combat formation. Without valuable space to load C4ISR equipment, the flagship was generally served by the missile frigate. The admiral of the fleet was usually the highest-ranking officer.</br>
</br>
Hogg, who served as the admiral of the fleet, handed over the commanding rights of the aircraft carrier to his commander. He was standing on the missile frigate, looking far away at the wreckage in the distance. He couldn't feel more honored about the uniform he wore.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the overwhelming bombardment of missiles awakened his self-confidence, perhaps it was the frightened expressions of the representatives from different countries, or perhaps he remembered the "political mission" the Capitol gave him before the military exercise. He looked to his commander and ordered arrogantly, "Apply for passage in Xin waters; the exercise will now enter the second phase."</br>
</br>
The two orders were issued at the same time.</br>
</br>
In other words, regardless of whether Xin agreed or not, UA's joint fleet would sail through Xin's waters.</br>
</br>
Hogg was very curious how Xin would react.</br>
</br>
He didn't think Jiang Chen would easily compromise, but he also didn't think Jiang Chen would make any rash and inconsiderate decisions.</br>
</br>
After all, it was a joint fleet of five nations comprised of more than forty modern combat ships! Nothing would challenge the superiority of this fleet!</br>
</br>
As for the glorious record of Celestial Trade's two Guardian-class frigates destroying the entire navy of Country F, Hogg chose to ignore that fact. He knew about Country F too well. A police boat retired by Nippon was used as the main battleship of Country F. Some converted fishing ships were used to expand their fleet. Destroying this force couldn't be considered an achievement.</br>
</br>
However, the response of the commander was beyond his expectations.</br>
</br>
"Xin refused our request and designated the northern waters as a military restricted zone."</br>
</br>
After a short glimpse as he just processed what he had heard, Hogg was furious and enraged. His fists clenched and his veins were exposed more than ever.</br>
</br>
A military restricted zone? Do you really consider us as a joke?</br>
</br>
Our navy will go wherever it decides to go! Whether it's the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea or the South China Sea! The great navy of the five oceans and seven seas won't be challenged by a puny country!</br>
</br>
His anger was quickly suppressed. Hogg returned to calmness and placed an order.</br>
</br>
"My order: the course is to be adjusted ten degrees to the south, and the exercise will continue as planned!"</br>
</br>
"Yes, sir."</br>
</br>
The commander took the order.</br>
</br>
Military restricted zone?</br>
</br>
Hmph! I want to see who can stop the freedom of navigation of the UA fleet!</br>
</br>
The joint fleet began to change course and headed towards the territorial waters of Xin. The so-called application for passage was just a formality and was more of a notice. Regardless of whether Xin accepted or not, the joint fleet still changed course.</br>
</br>
The expressions from the representatives gradually became more and more intrigued.</br>
</br>
Previous target practices on the high seas were just a demonstration of force from the UA Navy. Whether the missiles just landed on scrap copper and iron or in the heart of Xin would depend on the reaction of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
And Celestial Trade's reaction was the focus of their attention.</br>
</br>
Although they didn't expect Celestial Trade's frigates to enter the battle and stop in front of the joint fleet, if Celestial Trade really didn't do anything and allowed the joint fleet to freely pass through their waters, then their relationship with Xin would be over.</br>
</br>
Countries weren't enterprises. Economic and trade cooperation was the basis of diplomatic cooperation. However, considering the diplomatic strategy of a country wasn't solely based on economic benefits.</br>
</br>
Not only representatives of different countries on the flagship closely followed the situation, but Hua and Russia also closely monitored the event as they waited for Xin's reaction.</br>
</br>
Taking a step forward would take them into an abyss.</br>
</br>
Taking a step back would bring them into hell.</br>
</br>
An unprecedented situation in the Pacific Ocean was unfolding. The choice facing Xin was also an unprecedented dilemma.</br>
</br>
This step would determine the ownership of hegemony. It would also determine Xin's future.</br>
</br>
The world was waiting for Jiang Chen's reaction.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1124: Only you can“t choose to back down!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The world was waiting for Jiang Chen's reaction.</br>
</br>
At that moment, Jiang Chen was at the military base in New Moon Island where he stood with the officers of the Celestial Trade Armed Forces. He stared at the forty arrows representing the battleships on the holographic screen, and the area of the map was marked with a red cross.</br>
</br>
Everyone held their breath.</br>
</br>
"It seems like they're not going to retreat." Ivan had a stern expression.</br>
</br>
After all, the UA was a superpower in the world not just because of the media, but because of their aircrafts and cannons. Even if their political parties fought inside the Capitol relentlessly, even if the ruling party was berated by anti-war activists, they never held back when they needed to fight.</br>
</br>
The UA Navy always forced other fleets to make way. How could a small country set a border and ask the superpower to make a detour?</br>
</br>
If the hundreds-of-square-kilometers military restricted zones were drawn before the military exercise, the two sides could still both take a step back. If Xin really compromised, the Pacific would still be the peaceful Pacific, except the Global Grid Plan would likely falter.</br>
</br>
However, Xin chose to go head-to-head against the hegemony. They didn't take a step back but rather, advanced forward. They pulled out their sword and drew a line as the boundary, asking: Do you dare to go further?</br>
</br>
The reaction of UA was also expected by everyone. They not only took a step forward, but they also asked: I'm going to take a step further. What are you going to do about it?</br>
</br>
There was no retreat in the assertion of hegemony!</br>
</br>
After all, the UA wasn't Country F. While Celestial Trade Marines bulldozed through City M, the officers present remained calm. The Orbital Airborne Troops might have strength equivalent to ten soldiers, but counting on the power armor brigade, only four brigades served the country. They wouldn't even cause a splash in the vast UA.</br>
</br>
Ivan didn't show any sign of fear. Since Jiang Chen pulled him out of the mud pile in Eastern Europe and gave him this responsibility, he swore his allegiance to Jiang Chen. However, even if he wasn't afraid, his palms were still sweating.</br>
</br>
He wasn't afraid to fight.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade was even less afraid of fighting a war.</br>
</br>
It was just that no one could bear the consequences of this war.</br>
</br>
If the dozens of submarine missiles took off under the sea, the EMP weapons would send the entire UA back to the Stone Age.</br>
</br>
But after this, Xin would cease to exist.</br>
</br>
After all, technology wasn't magic, and even in the distant 22nd century, there was no cheaper and more convenient killing tool than nuclear weapons. The UA had never claimed to not be the first one to use nuclear weapons. The dozen-plus aircraft carrier battle groups and the North Atlantic Treaty definitely didn't just exist for looks. Once the Pandora Box was open, no country could survive.</br>
</br>
</br>
Like a curse, a terrifying word surfaced in every officer's head.</br>
</br>
The Third World War...</br>
</br>
The officers whispered to each other.</br>
</br>
"Only diplomatic meanscan solve this problem."</br>
</br>
"We can't fight this war..."</br>
</br>
"The next step forward is the next world war..."</br>
</br>
Just then, there was scorn in the command center and all the whispers ceased.</br>
</br>
All the officers' eyes centered onto Jiang Chen as they waited for the commander's decision.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression has never been calmer, but the scorn in his eyes showed a tyrannous vibe. From his deep pupils, Ivan saw a lot, but he couldn't see the word retreat.</br>
</br>
"Coincidently, we aren't going to retreat."</br>
</br>
His words were like hammer strikes, slamming into every officer's mind.</br>
</br>
Ivan let out a sigh in his mind. The thing he worried about the most still happened. But he didn't have any regret, nor did he want to persuade Jiang Chen otherwise. Even if Jiang Chen chose to press the button to open the Pandora Box, he would follow Jiang Chen's will without hesitation and execute his orders until the last moment.</br>
</br>
As for the looks of the other officers, Jiang Chen also took everything under his pupils.</br>
</br>
He also understood he shouldn't fight this war.</br>
</br>
But he was never more awake, and this time, there was no retreat.</br>
</br>
The UA realized the threat of Xin and no longer regraded this small country as a stepping stone—it was an actual opponent.</br>
</br>
This military exercise was only the beginning of a signal to other countries. In the future, it would be diplomatic pressure or economic sanctions. Xin could use its technological advantage to expand new markets, but other countries could work together to demand a high price.</br>
</br>
Taking two steps to stand in front of the officers, Jiang Chen looked at all of them at eye-level and swept through the faces of every officer. He said in a peaceful but loud tone, "Everyone here is the mainstay of Celestial Trade. When did you start to worry about performing the jobs of diplomats?"</br>
</br>
As soon as this was said, the officer who had previously whispered suddenly felt embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Without paying attention to the shame on the officer's face, Jiang Chen turned his gaze to the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"They dared to display their arrogance at our doorstep."</br>
</br>
An understatement rang in the hearts of all officers.</br>
</br>
Just as everyone was processing his words, his calm face suddenly smiled, and his words shifted.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade is strong and powerful. Our warships are guarding our territory. Country F provoked us, and I ordered our navy to turn their ships into scraps. The war ended up with more than 10,000 casualties, and in the end, they surrendered to us. I'd like to ask: if we can fight Country F, why can't we fight the UA? Are you all bullies?"</br>
</br>
The officers who had previously showed fear all showed embarrassment.</br>
</br>
The smile faded, and Jiang Chen's expression turned stern and he shouted, "You're the soldiers of Xin. Your backbone is the backbone of the country. Your chest is the frontier of Xin."</br>
</br>
"Their warships have already arrived at our doorstep, and now, they're prepared to run over your chests and destroy the sovereignty we defended with guns!"</br>
</br>
"This war has nothing to do with hegemony; it's about the future of our country and it's about the dignity of our nation! The entire country can fear, but only you can't fear. The entire country can choose to back down, but only you can't choose to back down!"</br>
</br>
Only you can't choose to back down!</br>
</br>
His assertive words echoed in every officer's mind.</br>
</br>
Yes, they were soldiers, not politicians nor diplomats. They only thought about war, and they could only think about the war! Even if the next step was down into the abyss, they must take this step forward!</br>
</br>
Their shame faded, and everyone raised their heads and lifted their chests. There was not a single trace of fear in their eyes.</br>
</br>
Only the courage for war!</br>
</br>
"Ivan!" Jiang Chen shouted.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The veteran straightened his back, and his wrinkled face was cold as the winter breeze.</br>
</br>
"With 'Conquer' as the flagship, all ships are to join the Pacific Fleet. Captain Lei Zhengjun is to be promoted to Major Admiral, temporarily acting as the fleet commander. The fleet will take enemies head-on!"</br>
</br>
"Roger! Ivan shouted.</br>
</br>
A powerful shout rang in everyone's ears. Jiang Chen looked at the officers and used the greatest force of his life to place the order.</br>
</br>
"All officers, listen to my orders. Immediately activate level-one combat readiness alert! All fighters take off! All Marines board the planes! All battleships set sail! All fighting units to their battle posts! If the enemy dares to cross into our territory, they won't return in one piece!"</br>

</br>
The upsurge in the Western Pacific received far more attention than the countries involved.</br>
</br>
Celestial City, Earth Defense Alliance Headquarters.</br>
</br>
With a coffee, Wu Changfeng stood at the floor-to-ceiling window as he emotionlessly watched the blue planet outside the window.</br>
</br>
"What decision do you think he will make?"</br>
</br>
Next to Wu Changfeng, Lu Hao smiled.</br>
</br>
"For someone who can make up his mind to fight against an extraterrestrial civilization, what decision do you think he will make?"</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng also smiled, but he didn't continue on the topic.</br>
</br>
He gazed at the planet outside the window for what felt like an eternity, then his smile faded as he quietly and thoughtfully said, "If a war really starts, what can we see here?"</br>
</br>
Lu Hao's smile suddenly disappeared.</br>
</br>
After a while, he forced a smile and squeezed out a sentence: "I hope... we can't see it."</br>
</br>
What kind of war can be seen even around the synchronous orbit?</br>
</br>
Other than nuclear war, he couldn't think of any other possibilities.</br>
</br>
"I hope so." Wu Changfeng sighed, his eyes focused outside the window.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, in the direction of the space elevator main axis, at Celestial City port, he saw an unusual shadow.</br>
</br>
A Seagull-class transport ship had slowly left the port. Its engine left an eerie blue trail and it moved toward the low-Earth orbit...</br>
</br>
In the western Pacific Ocean, turbulent waves rolled under the pristine sky, as if thousands of tons of lime were mixed in. The representatives of the countries in the audience all shared the same tense expression. Although they hoped for Celestial Trade to compromise and admit defeat, they were all uncertain.</br>
</br>
The leader of Celestial Trade isn't the most rational...</br>
</br>
If he gets hot-headed and starts a war…</br>
</br>
On the flagship of the joint fleet, Hogg stood like a sculpture with his hands behind his back, his eagle-like gaze locked onto the sea in the southwest silently. The command room staff were busy working in their posts, only occasionally exchanging communications.</br>
</br>
"Report! Celestial Trade's Naval Fleet was discovered one hundred and fifty kilometers away!" The officer in front of the radar reported.</br>
</br>
With a frown, Hogg's expression showed a hint of malice.</br>
</br>
It seems that Celestial Trade isn't going to give in.</br>
</br>
"How big is the fleet?" Hogg coldly asked.</br>
</br>
"The entire fleet is composed of six frigates; the number of submarines is unknown."</br>
</br>
When he heard the report, Hogg stopped, and there was doubt in his expression.</br>
</br>
"Six frigates?"</br>
</br>
Relying on six frigates to stop us is just underestimating the power of our fleet!</br>
</br>
"Signal to them and warn them to immediately change course; otherwise, any escalation will result in consequences they can't bear," Hogg said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
At this moment, on the ship bridge, the correspondent received the message from the opposing fleet and immediately reported it to Lei Zheng.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lei Zheng nodded after he heard the message, and his expression was unmoved.</br>
</br>
"Lei… Major General Lei?" The deputy looked at Lei Zheng and asked nervously.</br>
</br>
His eyes still looked straight ahead, and Lei Zheng ordered, "Respond to them that Celestial Trade Pacific Fleet will conduct a routine military exercise in the 970-square-kilometer military restricted zone. The drill is a live ammunition exercise, and if someone accidentally enters our range, they will have to bear the consequences at their own risk!"</br>
</br>
Six frigates were lined up on the high sea, and the guns all aimed at a spot 100 kilometers away, the area designated as the military restricted zone. Under the flagship order, six rounds of electromagnetic pulse cannons launched simultaneously, leaving six orange-yellow trails in the air.</br>
</br>
One hundred kilometers away, the seawater was sent hundreds of meters into the air, creating a temporary rain shower within the area.</br>
</br>
In the Capital's the combat command room, the senior officials of the Ministry of Defense were busy communicating.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by a military adviser, Hill stared at the satellite image on the big screen.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade Navy Fleet fired at target waters and announced it would be conducting regular military exercises in the military restricted zone!"</br>
</br>
The term "routine military exercise" made Hill pause for a second. The shamelessness of Celestial Trade almost made her swear, but the military adviser next to her swore first.</br>
</br>
"Routine military exercise? These third-world b*stards! How is this a routine military exercise?! This is clearly a provocation!"</br>
</br>
Hill didn't speak, but having served the role of secretary of state, she understood very clearly that Celestial Trade used a loophole.</br>
</br>
By international conventions, military exercises in public waters required notification to neighboring countries in advance and required invitation of observers from other countries. However, routine military exercises in territorial waters didn't require notification.</br>
</br>
As for it being a routine exercise?</br>
</br>
Who knows if they really planned this?</br>
</br>
The sudden shelling surprised the joint fleet and scared the observers. No one thought their reaction would be so direct and so intense.</br>
</br>
While the joint fleet was surprised, it immediately responded to the shelling. The aircraft carrier slowed down, but the fleet didn't change course. The two destroyers were at full throttle and accelerated toward the military restricted zone declared by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
The submarine began to sink, and more than forty ships dispersed and entered battle formation. F-35Cs took off from the deck, and in just a few minutes, the aircraft carrier sent more than a dozen squadrons into the air, all headed for the Celestial Fleet.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade also released its force. More than 30 Aurora-20s took-off and formed into ten squadrons in the air. They showed no fear of the approaching fleet.</br>
</br>
The trigger for war was in a fine balance!</br>
</br>
With eyes staring at the big screen, the hearts of Hill and every senior official all pounded furiously.</br>
</br>
The situation seemed to have gone out of their control from the beginning.</br>
</br>
In just a few minutes, it had deteriorated to the brink of war.</br>
</br>
It was just a military exercise!</br>
</br>
Before this, the Capitol and the Department of Defense certainly considered the possibility of war, but no one ever thought this possibility would become reality. They just planned to use the military exercise to pressure Xin, display their power to their allies, disintegrate the Earth Defense Alliance, take back the control of extraterrestrial civilization defense, and finally lift the space blockade of Xin...</br>
</br>
As for the war...</br>
</br>
Who was willing to fight with an equally-matched opponent?!</br>
</br>
Sweat oozed from Hill's forehead.</br>
</br>
Taking one step ahead was hell!</br>
</br>
Now Jiang Chen threw the choice back into their hands again.</br>
</br>
What should I do?</br>
</br>
Just as Hill felt uncertain, the situation took another drastic turn.</br>
</br>
More than a dozen satellite images disappeared.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"Server 091 was attacked..."</br>
</br>
"Check the firewall right away!"</br>
</br>
The staff member who was furiously typing in front of the computer suddenly screamed.</br>
</br>
"Damnit, it's not an attack! There's no problem with the firewall! The server aren't infiltrated! It's our satellite that's experiencing failure!"</br>
</br>
At that moment, Jiang Chen's face replaced the previous image and appeared in the center of the screens.</br>
</br>
"Change course immediately!"</br>
</br>
"That's impossible!" Hill fixed her gaze on Jiang Chen, she didn't back down and righteously said, "The UA is exercising proper freedom of navigation. In addition, I'm warning you to immediately stop interfering with our satellites. Otherwise, the UA will regard it as a provocation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sneered.</br>
</br>
"Freedom of navigation? You want to come and go as you wish? Without my permission, your navy won't cross Xin's territory. I will only say this once—if you cross this red line, dozens of Peacemakers will arrive on your mainland!"</br>
</br>
After that, Jiang Chen gestured to the officer next to him on the screen. A suitcase was immediately taken out by the officer and opened in front of him.</br>
</br>
The moment Hill saw the suitcase, her expression immediately changed.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, her aid also reacted, he stepped forward and placed the black suitcase in front of her.</br>
</br>
Hill reached out her hand subconsciously, and her trembling fingers touched the edge of the lock.</br>
</br>
From the day she started campaigning more than three years ago, she imagined that one day she would be able to grasp the nuclear button which represented the top authority of the president. However, until a minute ago, she never thought about the day she would actually use this button.</br>
</br>
In contrast to her hesitation, Jiang Chen had already entered the password with ease on the screen, opened the suitcase cover, and gently put his finger on the launch button.</br>
</br>
He looked into the camera slyly as he coldly said, "So, Madam President. Are you ready?"</br>
</br>
A chill slowly covered her from head-to-toe.</br>
</br>
From his dark pupils, she saw the fierceness of a wolf.</br>
</br>
Even if she served as the secretary of state for several years, she had never seen such a look. Even the most insane dictator had never been so crazy...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1126: Social Justice Saving the World</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Rolling waves smashed against the ship, as they shattered millions of tiny droplets against the invincible steel.</br>
</br>
The radar and missile launchers on the guided missile cruisers were active and ready, waiting for the command to fire...</br>
</br>
"Sir." The young soldier looked at the officer. He was unsettled, as it was difficult to distinguish whether it was firm or panic in his green pupils. "What should we do?"</br>
</br>
What should we do?</br>
</br>
No one could answer the young soldier who had just left the military academy; even the seasoned veteran couldn't. Since they were standing there, they were soldiers—just negligible screws in the massive war machine. They couldn't make the decision?</br>
</br>
Instead of thinking about this question without an answer, it would be better to think about a more realistic question...</br>
</br>
What will we do?</br>
</br>
Everyone asked the question in their mind, including the new recruits on the warships, including, of course, the one standing on the bridge.</br>
</br>
Hogg showed nothing but malice as his destruction-filled pupils already narrowed into a line, like the Celestial Trade fleet that lined up on the high sea.</br>
</br>
The Pacific Fleet, more than 150 kilometers away, responded affirmatively to the joint fleet with the first round of shelling.</br>
</br>
He made a decision immediately, including forming the attack formation, sending out fighters, and sending out the destroyers...</br>
</br>
He couldn't act weak, not even a bit. Even if he wasn't willing, he could only move forward.</br>
</br>
Representatives of the countries watched him. The Capital, his people, and the world were all watching him. The countless gazes on him were like countless swords pressed against his back.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade fighters are approaching quickly; our radar can't lock onto them..." the lieutenant admiral said nervously.</br>
</br>
"All fighters take off!" Hogg ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The lieutenant admiral gnashed his teeth.</br>
</br>
He already expected this to happen. When Xin and Country F fought previously, they verified that the F-35 was no match for the Aurora-20. However, despite this, he had no fear.</br>
</br>
Although the Aurora-20 was strong, it wasn't invincible. Under the cover of destroyers and missile cruisers, even if a group could only take out a squadron, the final victory would only belong to the joint fleet.</br>
</br>
Although the electromagnetic pulse cannon was powerful, the ship carrying the cannon was still made out of steel. Anti-ship missiles and anti-ship torpedoes would take care of them, even if they could sink a few warships or even the aircraft carrier in the center, but what else…</br>
</br>
As for space-based weapons?</br>
</br>
At a distance of 36,000 kilometers, it would still take some time before those landed.</br>
</br>
Hogg felt a lot more at ease after he issued the orders consecutively.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the war was bound to happen...</br>
</br>
"Twenty kilometers left."</br>
</br>
</br>
Twenty kilometers.</br>
</br>
At the current speed of the destroyers, they would close the distance in just a few minutes. By that time, the joint fleet would've crossed the red line, and the Celestial Trade Pacific Fleet would respond with their electromagnetic pulse cannons. With the war bound to happen, there seemed to be no other alternatives.</br>
</br>
When Lei Zheng received the report, he looked at the red dots that were gradually approaching on the radar. At that moment, his expression remained unchanged.</br>
</br>
The naval fleet of five nations, forty-seven modern warships, and more than a dozen fighter squadrons... In his eyes, they didn't seem to exist.</br>
</br>
"Ten kilometers!"</br>
</br>
The first officer's eyes bulged out, staring at the distant sea. The veins on his arms were exposed as his palms were sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
The two destroyers, one after the other, were marching towards the border.</br>
</br>
At that moment, Lei Zheng suddenly raised his hand and fixed his cap.</br>
</br>
"Five kilometers!"</br>
</br>
Almost as the first officer shouted out this sentence, Lei Zheng took off the radio on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"All combat units, freely aim at all targets of the joint fleet except the aircraft carrier. Prepare—"</br>
</br>
"Look! They-they changed course!"</br>
</br>
An exclamation interrupted his command.</br>
</br>
Lei Zheng's pupils shrank and fixed on the holographic screen, his eyes were filled with disbelief.</br>
</br>
The two destroyers at the forefront almost entered Xin's territory. However, just two kilometers outside the border, they suddenly changed course and made a nearly 90-degree turn.</br>
</br>
Not just the two destroyers retreated, but the joint fleet behind them...</br>
</br>
Hill was crushed.</br>
</br>
Thoroughly crushed.</br>
</br>
She was a wise, strong, courageous, and tactical politician; otherwise, she wouldn't have defeated her competitors to become the president. She had the best think tank, the best cabinet, but she lacked one thing...</br>
</br>
The spirit of a wolf.</br>
</br>
In this peaceful era, it wasn't a quality that could be selected.</br>
</br>
Fighting for social justice might help her gain votes, but that would never win a war for her.</br>
</br>
When the Social Justice Warriors voted with joy and put the nuclear button in her hands, they trusted that she would never press the button to hell, but they never considered the consequence of the button never being able to be pressed.</br>
</br>
If nuclear deterrence didn't have a deterrence effect, could deterrence be called deterrence?</br>
</br>
At the moment when she looked into Jiang Chen's pupils, she felt that she was pulled out of her office and put into a colosseum.</br>
</br>
The opponent standing in front of her was neither a savvy politician nor a great leader but an out-right lunatic, a fierce beast.</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
At that moment, all the tricks, games, and even language had lost their effect.</br>
</br>
What ultimately broke down her psychological defense wasn't Jiang Chen's eyes nor was it his sentence "are you ready?" but the tens of millions of families on the other side of the world and the century-long prosperity of their country...</br>
</br>
It was the stakes in her hands that overwhelmed her.</br>
</br>
She must not let nuclear war break out!</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
In the tenth second of the countdown before the nuclear war, she screamed and pushed away her suitcase, ran to the Minister of Defense, grabbed his collar, and shouted with full strength that the "military exercise is now over," "change course"...</br>
</br>
History changed because of a word.</br>
</br>
The destroyers retreated.</br>
</br>
The joint fleet changed course.</br>
</br>
The nuclear button on the screen also disappeared.</br>
</br>
Staring at the emptiness on the screen, Hill gasped and took two steps back.</br>
</br>
The word seemed to sap out all the energy in her body. If it wasn't for the military adviser and the chief of staff holding her, she wasn't even sure if she could stand.</br>
</br>
After all, the war didn't break out.</br>
</br>
The strategy of returning to the Asia-Pacific and curbing Xin had now backfired along with UA's hegemony.</br>
</br>
From now on, nothing could stop the expansion of the Global Power Grid, and nothing could disintegrate the United Earth Defense Alliance. The entire world witnessed UA's retreat and the rise of Xin. Even the UA Navy that had conquered the seven seas and five oceans couldn't cross the boundary of one place.</br>
</br>
The gate of Xin.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Seagull-class transport ships could easily hijack military satellites in orbit, but it couldn't place cameras in Hill's office.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, Jiang Chen could only hear the sound and couldn't see her last gaffe.</br>
</br>
When he turned off the camera, he closed the suitcase and pushed it to the side.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned back in the chair as he looked at the officer next to him who picked up the suitcase, then took a deep breath, and slowly relaxed his tense muscles.</br>
</br>
Only he knew that his back was completely drenched.</br>
</br>
Just half a minute ago, he was prepared for the worst to happen. If the nuclear war broke out, his first step would be to take his relatives onto the space elevator, take the Seagull-class to the Lunar Colony, wait for Lin Lin to invent interdimensional travel, then move his family to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
As for this world, his only option would be to give it up.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, however, the person on the other side was wise. A wise person would never bet everything in a fight against a beast.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand to the officers next to him, gesturing for them to leave. After everyone left, only one person stayed.</br>
</br>
"Wipe your sweat off."</br>
</br>
Ayesha walked next to Jiang Chen as she spoke softly, handing him a wet towel.</br>
</br>
"From today, will I be considered the most wanted terrorist in the eyes of the CIB?" Jiang Chen took the wet towel from Ayesha hand as he joked while he wiped his forehead. "Like Bin Laden and Saddam?"</br>
</br>
The cool feeling dispelled the heat that irritated him as his nervousness eased and subsided.</br>
</br>
Ayesha held Jiang Chen's back and gently placed her chin on his shoulder, her sapphire-like eyes blinked.</br>
</br>
"I will protect you."</br>
</br>
Her voice was quiet but resolute, her words sneaked into his ear along with her warmth as they gently comforted his mind.</br>
</br>
While he was touched, Jiang Chen felt a bit strange being protected by his woman.</br>
</br>
He lifted his head, then looked at the holographic screen on the conference table.</br>
</br>
The joint fleet in the satellite image had just barely stopped on the border in front of Xin, and a conflict that almost became the fuse of a world war dissipated at the final moment.</br>
</br>
From beginning to end, Xin didn't compromise.</br>
</br>
In the next few days, Jiang Chen took a break.</br>
</br>
He bathed in the sun and relaxed on his private island. As for work, he completely pushed it aside for now. He also dragged Ayesha and Xia Shiyu along, even if she was unwilling to leave her work, to explore everywhere.</br>
</br>
As for Natasha who had only recently moved in, she immediately joined when she heard they were going on an adventure.</br>
</br>
Of course, while he relaxed, Jiang Chen still paid attention to what happened in the world.</br>
</br>
On the first day he left for the sea on his yacht, the Nippon representative came to Xin with its delegation and made an application to join the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was ironic that just a few days ago, their warships were behind the aircraft carrier battle group. Now that the military exercise ended, they immediately took a drastically different stance.</br>
</br>
With this kind of shamelessness... wait, no—choosing the right path—of course Jiang Chen welcomed them wholeheartedly. But because he was still on vacation, he left the work to Zhang Yaping to handle.</br>
</br>
is there dignity between countries?</br>
</br>
In a restaurant near Wall Street, Kerry and Daniel sat opposite of each other. They enjoyed their steak while they casually chatted about the dramatic changes that took place a few days ago.</br>
</br>
"I said earlier that she's not a qualified leader."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Why do you say that?" Daniel Morgan smiled as he cut the fattest, juiciest piece of meat with his knife.</br>
</br>
"The courage to press the nuclear button is different from the willingness to press the nuclear button. See what she did? She pushed our nuclear button away! Oh God, since she didn't want it, then why did she choose it?!" Kerry cut the steak while muttering under his breath.</br>
</br>
He considered himself to have good etiquette.</br>
</br>
However, whenever he recalled Madam President's reaction that day, he always felt enraged.</br>
</br>
"What if it was you?" With a fork delivering the meat to his lips, Daniel Morgan's fork lingered in the air as he raised an eyebrow and asked with curiosity: "Mr. Kerry, what would you have done?"</br>
</br>
"I wouldn't have pressed the button."</br>
</br>
"So, you would've given in?"</br>
</br>
"I wouldn't have given in."</br>
</br>
"At noon on August 1st, five navies formed a joint fleet to begin the 2019 Asia-Pacific military exercise. When the exercise entered its second stage, because of frictions with the Xin naval fleet, the joint fleet was forced to divert..."</br>
</br>
"At present, the Capitol refuses to make a statement on this matter, but an official who doesn't wish to be named said..."</br>
</br>
No matter how turbulent the Pacific Ocean was at the time, the news just casually made a few understatements, summarizing the hegemonic dispute that almost ignited the Third World War.</br>
</br>
The UA media all surprisingly shared the same tone on this incident, and there were no detailed reports on the friction. However, people could still sense the unusual state between the lines...</br>
</br>
In a villa complex, home to one of the richest men of UA.</br>
</br>
The man with a clearly visible beer belly, laid on an extremely luxurious sofa while he sipped his whiskey. He was hugging a stunning model as he enjoyed the nightlife of the vibrant city.</br>
</br>
This TV talk show was one of his favorite shows. He loved the style of the host who made absurd statements. He even spent a lot of money to purchase this show, became its biggest sponsor, and placed his company's name in the most prominent place on the show.</br>
</br>
"That's my show." Unabashedly teasing the beautiful woman in his arms, the man raised his hand holding the glass, pointed at the TV with his pinky, and said arrogantly, "Hotels, squares, retailers, mineral water plants, restaurants, bars, and even universities, golf courses, the Internet—my companies are in the lives of Americans everywhere; the media is only a small part of it. The UA can live without that bit*h, but it absolutely can't live without me."</br>
</br>
Showing off was a great pleasure in life, especially to beautiful women.</br>
</br>
The blond in his arms giggled, hugged his neck and gave him a kiss.</br>
</br>
Just then, the talk show talked about the recent "Changed Course Incident" in the Western Pacific Ocean. In a very timely manner, the screen began to discuss the "bit*h" he had just criticized.</br>
</br>
His drunken eyes glanced at the old woman on the screen, and an undisguised disdain appeared in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"I said earlier that she's not a qualified president."</br>
</br>
"If I became president... burp-"</br>
</br>
If I'm the president...</br>
</br>
The man suddenly turned his neck.</br>
</br>
Wait, speaking of this, I haven't been president yet!</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1128: A “Heartfelt“ Speech</br>
</div></br>
</br>
For most Xin citizens, they only saw the shallowest representation of the confrontation in the Western Pacific.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade fired warning shots and the Joint Fleet evaded. The fighters on both sides all took off and dueled it out in the air. In the end, both parties returned with no gains or losses...</br>
</br>
Of course, people who followed the situation still saw that Celestial Trade gained the upper hand.</br>
</br>
As for the game behind its appearance, no one dug deeper. In particular, both the UA and Xin tacitly remained silent regarding the duel between the leaders in front of the media.</br>
</br>
After all, the nuclear buttons were placed on the table. Jiang Chen didn't want to be labeled as a butcher by controversy, and the UA didn't want to lose the deterrent known as the president's "suitcase". The number of other countries who gained information about this through their intelligence networks was unpredictable.</br>
</br>
In any case, making the boss of the world change course was something worthy of pride.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade Navy not only defended the sovereignty of Xin but it also the national honor and glory of the country. In the next week, the people of Xin walked in the streets with their heads held up high, almost to the point where they looked at people with their noses. Many immigrants from all over the world, from this very moment onward, truly regarded this new country as a nation.</br>
</br>
As for the UA, public opinion showed polarization.</br>
</br>
The leftists praised Hill for her rationality. After all, the Social Justice Warriors never agreed with the military exercise from the start. Xin's Phantom Helmets and high-tech products were so much fun; why are they bullying her?</br>
</br>
In contrast, the right-wingers launched an attack on the weakness of the Capitol on social media, criticizing the government for bringing shame to the country. Even the commander of the Joint Fleet, Admiral Hogg, was targeted by this social media onslaught.</br>
</br>
Admiral Hogg was probably the most innocent individual in this whole fiasco. The Department of Defence gave him the mandate to take a tough stance, but the Department of Defense also made him retreat. He executed every order, yet now, he must take the blame with the bureaucrats. Dear heaven, how is this outcome related to him? Did he not sail his ship with a strong enough stance?</br>
</br>
The anger of the right-wingers not only filled the Internet—it even flooded into the streets. With slogans held up high, they demonstrated in front of the Xin Embassy.</br>
</br>
While these angry young people didn't smash every single new energy vehicle from Xin, they spontaneously joined to boycott "Xin Goods" with the exception of two things: Phantom Helmet and Medical Drone.</br>
</br>
They could live without phones and robots, but without those two items, what would be the point of living...</br>
</br>
The economy was an extension of politics.</br>
</br>
The showdown in the Western Pacific Ocean already determined the situation today.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, although the "anti-Xin" sentiment in North America was growing, Future Group didn't seem too concerned. The Global Power Grid along with the electricity evolution was starting to see its effect, and Future Group was now focusing on opening up the East Asian market.</br>
</br>
Take Wanghai as an example—almost every parking lot was equipped with a wireless charging station. Charging could be completed by scanning a QR code with the phone without even needing to step out of the vehicle. The Logistics Drones replaced couriers, and robot mail was common in everyone's homes.</br>
</br>
Many electrical appliances that previously weren't practical due to high power consumption also become a reality. The Maglev Highway was the best example, although it was only popularized in Xin.</br>
</br>
Coro City already entered the 22nd century ahead of schedule.</br>
</br>
And Asia was advancing toward the 22nd world under the leadership of Xin.</br>
</br>
Regardless of everything else, a very intuitive phenomenon demonstrated the rapid changes in Asia. At night, overlooking the Earth from the geosynchronous orbit, it was easy to tell that the Asian region was much brighter than Europe and the Americas.</br>
</br>
In short, although UA hostility toward Xin created a certain impact on Future Group's market share in North America, the losses were quite limited, so Jiang Chen didn't consider it an area of concern. His foundation was the virtual reality network, and now, he had the addition of the Global Power Grid. As long as these two initiatives remained untouched, Future Group would be unshakable.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"I have money, I'm rich. I'm very rich!"</br>
</br>
"So? I don't care how much money the Wall Street will give me!"</br>
</br>
"I assure you that if you vote for me, at least your vote won't show up in the pockets of Wall Street. Only I can represent your interests; only I can represent the UA dream. Yes, only me!"</br>
</br>
In a park in Nevada.</br>
</br>
People shouted frantically as they cheered and screamed. Countless arms were raised up, slogans of their support were held, flags were waving in the air as supporters repeatedly shouted the same name.</br>
</br>
The eyes of the man on stage were half-narrowed, and his bright orange face had an arrogant and undisguised smile.</br>
</br>
He opened his arms and accepted the cheers of the voters with his chin, but he gained a respect that other candidates couldn't receive from bending down.</br>
</br>
He knew what they needed the most.</br>
</br>
And what they needed was exactly what he could give!</br>
</br>
Choosing the right time to raise his hand and signal everyone to listen, the man fixed the microphone and waved his index finger while speaking with the greatest strength of his life.</br>
</br>
"We shouldn't send Kerry, someone who has no idea how to negotiate at all. He will sign a laughable and irritating agreement with them. Watch them use our money to make weapons and act aggressively on the negotiating table."</br>
</br>
"You know who I'm talking about? That's right! It's him! The person who can match him can only be a man manlier than him, not an old woman without a proper menstrual cycle!"</br>
</br>
"Tell me—will you vote for that old lady?"</br>
</br>
The expressions of many female voters suddenly changed and they immediately lost interest. They not only smashed the signs they held, but they also raised their middle fingers and booed. But the cheers under the stage grew even louder, drowning out their booing amidst the tide of cheers.</br>
</br>
They were fed up with being politically correct and fed up with politicians who only made empty promises. Now, someone finally stood up. Even if he might not necessarily be smart enough, considering what he just said, he shared the same perspective as many who stood there!</br>
</br>
"The UA dream has been shattered! I will reshape the UA dream, make it bigger, better, stronger, and allow it to return to greatness. Thank you."</br>
</br>
The man bowed down and stepped down from the podium amidst thunderous cheers.</br>
</br>
No one noticed this impassioned election speech, and no one even noticed this insignificant candidate.</br>
</br>
Hill was still busy dealing with the aftermath of the event as she desperately tried to reunite the allies that started to pull apart. Accompanied by Daniel Morgan, Kerry collected evidence of scandal of a particular person and frequently contacted members of the party. He quietly prepared for the election in the coming year and prepared to strike his "big boss" at the perfect time.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1129: The Unlucky Kishida</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Coro City.</br>
</br>
At Jiang Chen's mansion door.</br>
</br>
"The weather is nice today."</br>
</br>
"Yeah, the weather is good." Kishida's face squeezed into a smile. Without giving an opportunity for Jiang Chen to change the topic, he quickly showed Jiang Chen a document. "What do you think? We've already joined the Earth Defense Alliance, so the defense tax..."</br>
</br>
"Haha, of course," Jiang Chen, who just came back from Coconut Island, laughed and patted Kishida's slim shoulder. Jiang Chen reached for his pocket then looked around before his expression became disappointed. "You see... I don't have a pen. Why don't you just leave the document here and I will send it to you after I'm done with it?"</br>
</br>
"No need, no need, I have a pen here." Kishida immediately reached into his pocket and took out a pen. He then handed it to Jiang Chen with a smile. "You can have the pen, so now you can sign it."</br>
</br>
"Hmph—"</br>
</br>
Kishida pretended not to hear the sound as he continued to gaze at Jiang Chen with a smile on his face. He was prepared to stay there until the document was signed.</br>
</br>
Since Nippon joined the Earth Defense Alliance, Nippon completely got on the wrong side of UA, so it changed its diplomatic stance and began to lean toward Xin. The previous territorial and historical issues were no longer topics of discussion.</br>
</br>
However, when Kishida happily went to Jiang Chen with the Defense Tax Agreement, he couldn't find Jiang Chen anymore.</br>
</br>
That's right, Jiang Chen disappeared!</br>
</br>
This made him extremely anxious and paranoid! First, he didn't expect Jiang Chen to be such a rogue. Second, the defense tax costed Nippon more than a billion per day, which meant he couldn't wait any longer. Despite being an influential diplomat, he turned into a paparazzi and waited around Jiang Chen's mansion all day long.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, after waiting for a week, Jiang Chen, who just came back from the apocalypse, finally showed up.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen couldn't find any excuses, he sighed and unwillingly picked up the pen. But right then, his eyes suddenly lit up. He looked at Kishida and coughed. "I suddenly remembered that today is Saturday, not a working day—"</br>
</br>
As soon as Kishida heard Jiang Chen making another excuse, he couldn't stand this anymore. His eyes stared straight at Jiang Chen with a tragic look.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, please don't joke with me anymore. I know you've been hiding from me all these days, but we joined the Earth Defense Alliance. In other words, we're now comrades inside the same trench. Why are you giving us trouble? If you're angry with the joint military exercise, I can apologize. I just hope you can relinquish the past and treat us equally."</br>
</br>
But your apology is worth nothing.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen also thought about this. If he really said it, it would damage the relationship between his allies. Since Nippon already joined them, he should relinquish the past.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Haha, Mr. Kishida, I'm not that type of person." Jiang Chen held onto his arm. "I wouldn't make you apologize."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the pen again, and under the staring of the mung bean-like eyes, he signed his name at the bottom of the document.</br>
</br>
After Kishida accepted the signed documents, he repeatedly praised and thanked Jiang Chen. He thanked but refused Jiang Chen's invitation for a few drinks and immediately left. Even with the document signed, it would still take a few days to lift the defense tax. Any wasted time now meant wasted money.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Cehn sent off the Foreign Minister of Nippon, he returned inside.</br>
</br>
As he walked past the entrance, he saw Natasha holding a bottle of champagne in her hand and relaxingly enjoyed the pleasant afternoon.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter? Did you lose money?" Looking at Jiang Chen, Natasha whistled at him and teased.</br>
</br>
"I did lose money." Jiang Chen was very honest and nodded.</br>
</br>
Not only did he lose money, but he lost a lot of money.</br>
</br>
The idea of the few billion flying away pained him. If he knew better, he would've returned a few days later from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Although the money wouldn't end up in his pocket...</br>
</br>
"It's fine, you're rich." Natasha gulped down a sip of champagne and let out a short burp. She rolled her eyes as she said, "It's not like you need that money to survive."</br>
</br>
"Drinking during the day? Aren't you afraid of getting fat?" Jiang Chen mimicked her and rolled his eyes too.</br>
</br>
"Are you? Obviously, you don't seem to mind." Natasha snorted, giggled, and raised her chest.</br>
</br>
"I like it there, but not here." Jiang Chen pretended to be ferocious.</br>
</br>
Not only did Natasha not show any fear, but with a grin, she raised an eyebrow, provoking him.</br>
</br>
"I only gain fat there. Try it yourself?"</br>
</br>
Try?</br>
</br>
I'll try it!</br>
</br>
Since they were the only ones at home, Jiang Chen had nothing to worry about. He turned into a big bad wolf and leaped at her.</br>
</br>
Well, Natasha didn't lie.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could swear that all her fat shifted to her chest. Even if it was said that Slavs were prone to beer bellies, she somehow managed to maintain her great figure. Her well-proportioned vest line on her lower abdomen was more addictive to touch than her chest.</br>
</br>
After they messed around for a bit, Jiang Chen finally let go of the exhausted Natasha while breathing heavily.</br>
</br>
He thought she would have to nap for a bit, but she unexpectedly turned over and her fatigue instantly disappeared. Her two fit legs pinched Jiang Chen's waist as she pushed him down, then she tightened her legs and rode on his lower abdomen.</br>
</br>
Too deceiving! It turned out that she faked everything!</br>
</br>
But since he did everything he wanted to, he'd let her freely dominate for a moment. Jiang Chen let the proud Natasha ride him to regain her confidence as a former agent.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, sometimes I really can't understand you." Natasha's finger circled Jiang Chen's chest as her witty sapphire eyes cast a lethargic vibe and examined Jiang Chen top to bottom. "Sometimes, I feel like you're a vulgar businessman who couldn't be any more vulgar and you always talk about interests. But sometimes, you don't play by the rules and do something completely outside common sense."</br>
</br>
"Not to mention you; even I can't understand myself." Jiang Chen's eyes gazed into the pair of sapphires and he suddenly let out a helpless sigh. "I could just be a landlord who rules a couple plots of land, so why should I bother with so much? Maybe by the time Harmony's space colonization ship arrives, Superman, Spiderman would all appear and I wouldn't need to worry about all this."</br>
</br>
"What are you talking about? How come I don't understand?" For a moment, Natasha didn't understand Jiang Chen's sudden spontaneous change of topic. She looked at him and said: "But if the extraterrestrial civilization really comes, even if you want to protect your land as a landlord, you won't have the chance?"</br>
</br>
"That depends." Jiang Chen shrugged and didn't explain further.</br>
</br>
A century would be more than enough for Lin Lin to invent interdimensional travel technology. At that time, he could just take his family to the apocalypse, and the Harmony Civilization wouldn't be able to find him at all.</br>
</br>
Of course, this would be the last resort.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1130: Welcoming Ceremony</br>
</div></br>
</br>
…August 13th, Sunny</br>
</br>
Wang Qian wrote the date on the header, then he gazed out at the endless sand outside of the window. He let out a sigh and closed his diary.</br>
</br>
There was no beauty here. It was barren everywhere; sand was the only scenery. The uninteresting view and boring life made it difficult even to search for a few hundred words for his diary.</br>
</br>
But it was fine, or how else would he kill his spare time?</br>
</br>
When he looked up at the wall clock on the wall, it was about time. Wang Qiang stuffed the diary into the drawer and headed out.</br>
</br>
When he walked through the corridor, he couldn't see a soul.</br>
</br>
No matter how vast Mars was, it was a relatively closed environment for the twenty colonists living there. After work, everyone returned to their rooms and closed themselves in their closed circles. Some put on Phantom helmets while others dazed in front of a book.</br>
</br>
Sometimes Wang Qiang even wondered if the kitchen could be equipped with a drone, perhaps he wouldn't ever see his neighbors for the rest of his life?</br>
</br>
A closed environment tended to breed more psychological disorders.</br>
</br>
More and more people began seeing the psychologist, and the psychologist was becoming busier and busier to the point that his schedule was always filled. It was even to the point that the only psychologist in the colony almost became depressed due to his heavy workload.</br>
</br>
But Wang Qiang faired okay with his diary, a friend who occasionally played pool with him, and a not-so-boring job.</br>
</br>
After he rinsed in the washroom, he took out his equipment from the closet. After he put on his gear, he went through the buffer room and the air shower room before he headed outside.</br>
</br>
His boots sank into the sand, and the dim light scattered through the cracks in the dust.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang raised his head and narrowed his eyes slightly as he looked at the murky Sun.</br>
</br>
Just as he walked to the rover, a communication window popped out on the lower right corner of the holographic screen inside his helmet.</br>
</br>
When he pressed the bottom, it was the captain's voice.</br>
</br>
"...Today's mission is canceled. Drive the rover back to the garage and immediately gather at Central Square."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang, inexplicably confused, asked, "What happened?"</br>
</br>
"The reinforcements are here."</br>
</br>
The reinforcements are here.</br>
</br>
When Wang Qian heard the four short words, his heart was overwhelmed with uncontrollable joy. It was like a drought had lasted for three years and the rain finally arrived.</br>
</br>
He eagerly hopped onto the rover and parked the rover into the garage. Without stopping for a second, he jogged to the Central Square.</br>
</br>
When he crossed through the gate, he found that the remaining 19 colonists had all arrived. Captain Hong Zewei stood in the middle of the square, and he read a stack of papers in his hand. The rest of the people were beside him all listening carefully.</br>
</br>
</br>
Everyone was full of excitement which oozed from the bottoms of their hearts.</br>
</br>
Reinforcements finally arrived.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang pulled his friend and whispered.</br>
</br>
"What is the captain reading?"</br>
</br>
"The letters from Earth!" the friend said, overjoyed. "Celestial Trade built a column for us and collected about 10,000 greetings from Earth!"</br>
</br>
"Are you sure you received greetings?" Wang Qiang asked strangely.</br>
</br>
Considering the etiquette of the Internet, he didn't believe they were greetings at all!</br>
</br>
"Ahem, of course, all of them were screened. There were over ten thousand letters in total. How can we read them?" The friend looked at Wang Qiang with an expression that said 'You only need to know' then continued to look at the stack of letters in Hong Zewei's hands.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang was truly touched by the envelopes.</br>
</br>
At least the people on Earth still remembered the "Martians". The words of longing made him think of the blue planet, the magnificent sea, and palm leaves swaying in front of his door...</br>
</br>
Sniffing his nose, Wang Qiang suddenly remembered the canceled mission for today and why it was canceled. So he immediately looked around, but he was surrounded by familiar faces.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you say that the reinforcements were here? Where are they?"</br>
</br>
"The letters were brought by the reinforcements and thrown down from the synchronized orbit." The friend grinned and pointed his finger at the sky. "It's almost time."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang looked up and looked beyond the transparent graphene dome above the Central Square.</br>
</br>
"...Let us welcome our new friends—the second group of colonists!"</br>
</br>
Loud cheers filled the square. People popped open the champagne and let the liquid freely ooze.</br>
</br>
Since the day of the landing, a long time had passed since he heard this kind of euphoric cheer.</br>
</br>
Wang Qian had zoned out as he didn't hear what Hong Ziwei said anymore. His eyes were stuck on the turbid sky until the blue light particles appeared. They began to gather, turn brighter, and finally reveal the shape they carried.</br>
</br>
The rectangular colonial cabin looked like a stone monument on its side. The shape design inherited the consistent style of Future Heavy Industries' shipyard. It was dropped from the synchronous orbit by the TS Seagull. With the plasma engine reducing its speed to land, it landed beside the colony.</br>
</br>
A muffled sound that hit the ground came underneath their feet. The base of the colonial cabin was deeply embedded in the sand, creating a gust of wind and sand.</br>
</br>
After the first colonial cabin landed, Celestial Trade made a second footprint on Mars after just a few months.</br>
</br>
Although the cabin carried a total of 110 people, the new landing cabin was much smaller than the original colonial cabin. The newly-launched cabin contained only the tools and materials that the new colonists and the colonies desperately needed. It didn't contain reserved living spaces or a functional cabin with a production workshop.</br>
</br>
Ten bus-shaped rovers came out from the side of the colonial cabin that carried more than a hundred colonists from Earth.</br>
</br>
Among the colonists were engineers who had worked in Lunar Colony, technicians who specialized in industrial automation design, even chefs with the goal of improving the dining choice at the colony, or musicians who decided to devote their lives...</br>
</br>
In addition to these ordinary colonists, there were ten special people.</br>
</br>
They were soldiers belonging to the Orbital Airborne Brigade of Celestial Trade. Nominally, they were sent to maintain the security of the colony, but in fact, they came for the secret five kilometers underground.</br>
</br>
The colonial garage opened, and the large rovers rolled in.</br>
</br>
The old colonists prepared a grand welcoming ceremony for their new neighbors from afar.</br>
</br>
It had been a long time since the colony was so lively, so the welcoming ceremony was particularly grand. It wasn't long before everyone was greeted in the cafeteria. All kinds of food and wine were brought to the table, and the captain, Hong Zewei, gave a toast to start the beginning of the celebrations.</br>
</br>
The welcoming ceremony boosted the low morale of the colony.</br>
</br>
After five bottles of champagne, Wang Qiang burped, tipsy, and his eyes drifted with swinging consciousness.</br>
</br>
At that moment, he suddenly noticed that in the inconspicuous corner of the banquet, a man walked to the captain, saluted, and seemed to say something.</br>
</br>
As for the specifics, he was too drunk to figure them out.</br>
</br>
A friend gave him a shot of whiskey and Wang Qian felt his world turning. Finally, his forehead made intimate contact with the table before his consciousness fell into the abyss…</br>
</br>
This was probably his happiest moment since he came to Mars.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1131: Land Reclamation, Farming, and Steelmaking</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the arrival of the new colonists, the construction of the Mars Colony also entered the second stage.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade had a clear position of the Mars Colony as the solar system industrial base from the beginning, so the development direction of the second stage of the colony had been quite clear. The focus was mining, mining, and steelmaking!</br>
</br>
Steel was the foundation of industry. To produce on Mars, steel production must keep up.</br>
</br>
It wasn't difficult to achieve this on Mars. It was possible to smell rust when one bent down and grabbed a handful of sand. It was just a matter of the amount that was the concern. Also, the development of heavy industry had the added benefit of artificially causing a greenhouse effect that would indirectly change Mar's atmospheric thickness. Perhaps after a few centuries, the atmospheric thickness of Mars might return to the levels three billion years ago with human intervention and become the second paradise of mankind...</br>
</br>
Of course, this was an afterthought.</br>
</br>
In addition to increasing production capacity, the population must keep increasing.</br>
</br>
The labor force was always one of the important factors that restricted industrial development, whether it was the general labor force or educated labor force. Even if automated production could drastically reduce the demand for uneducated labor in industrial facilities, it was unlikely to completely depend on an autonomous process.</br>
</br>
Impossible for at least two centuries.</br>
</br>
In the half-year plan for the Mars Colony, Jiang Chen clearly defined two goals. The first was that the monthly output of steel must exceed one million tons. The second was to expand the size of the colony to a thousand people.</br>
</br>
For this reason, the new colonists who arrived on Mars didn't have time to enjoy the exoticness on Mars. The next day, they had to drag their alcohol-intoxicated bodies to work.</br>
</br>
This Seagull-class transport ship not only brought the colonists, but also brought many production tools such as excavators, cranes, and mining equipment designed for the Mars environment. The original colonial cabin with the square could only provide two hundred living units, and the colonists who arrived later could only live in the rooms they built.</br>
</br>
After all, a colonial cabin that could be deployed by airdrops was quite expensive, and it would be impossible for Celestial Trade to waste all of their budget on buying houses for the colonists.</br>
</br>
All the engineers at the colony started to share the same schedule as they commanded the construction workers to operate construction vehicles. The entire colony turned into a giant construction site, submerged in flying dust.</br>
</br>
The first to start the expansion was the soilless cultivation farm then the spherical water pump, followed by the steel mill...</br>
</br>
Just as the construction machines were working on the sand dunes, an armored car that had been specially modified for the Mars environment left from the garage and went to the distant horizon...</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Celestial City, Space Command Center, Mars Colonization Project Department.</br>
</br>
After learning that the transport ship arrived on Mars, Jiang Chen arrived by space elevator at his earliest opportunity. He found Kelvin, who was performing an inspection in the command center, and asked him about the current situation of the Mars Colony.</br>
</br>
"Our colonists landed safely?"</br>
</br>
"They landed yesterday." Kelvin nodded. "The Seagull-class transport ship escaped Mar's gravity after a week in the synchronous orbit and is now returning to the Earth-Moon system."</br>
</br>
The colony is moving in the right direction.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with satisfaction, then he asked about another item he was concerned about.</br>
</br>
"What about Mine 071? Do we have an update?"</br>
</br>
"It's not this quick of a process." Kelvin shook his head. "Our Marines just departed from the colony and haven't yet reached the mine. Even if they arrived, we can't immediately obtain information five kilometers below. According to the solution provided by Hong Zewei, we will first drill a five-kilometer deep well at Mine 071, then insert a drone to scope out the underground environment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked, "What do you think is there?"</br>
</br>
Kelvin shook his head helplessly. "I don't know; maybe it's really an alien city. But I hope it's the grave of an alien or a fossil. If there are living Martians, then it will absolutely be a disaster for our colony."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know if it would be a blessing or curse to discover relics of "aliens". On the one hand, he was excited to see what the colonists could discover, but on the other, he was worried if this would bring disaster to the Mars Colony.</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen felt conflicted, he suddenly remembered that maybe someone could give him the answer.</br>
</br>
With a stomach full of questions, he took the space elevator back to the ground the next day.</br>
</br>
Coro University.</br>
</br>
Unlike third-rate universities not much better than community colleges, Coro University was now a world-class institution. Whether in academia or enterprise, the university began to grow its sphere of influence. Of course, their influence was mainly reflected in studies of aerospace, new energy, and materials science. As for other professions...</br>
</br>
They weren't worth mentioning.</br>
</br>
When the university was first established, Jiang Chen promised the dean to teach an elective course called Cosmology. It also satisfied his desire to become a university professor. But since he pulled Hawking from his wheelchair, his short-lived interest disappeared and he gave the job to Hawking.</br>
</br>
On the shadowy path among the tall trees, many naïve faces traversed between classes. Students with different skin colors chatted with their friends talking about girls, clubs, professors, where to chill next...</br>
</br>
Because it was a Saturday, the campus as quieter than normal. Whenever this happened, the students often chose to take a stroll in the downtown area or buy boat tickets for a day trip to Penglai City.</br>
</br>
Only hard-working students or students taking public electives stayed in the building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly visited the campus without catching any attention. He made a phone call with Rafael Leif and learned that Hawking was in class, so he drove straight to the school building.</br>
</br>
After waiting for the class to end, Jiang Chen found Hawking, who had just exited the auditorium.</br>
</br>
Hawking was surprised by the unexpected visitor as he paused.</br>
</br>
"...a rare guest."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made a helpless expression. He was about to speak before Hawking said first, "I guess you have something to ask me?"</br>
</br>
This time, Jiang Chen paused. He didn't expect the genius Hawking to have the ability to read minds.</br>
</br>
"Yes, there's a small problem at work... I don't know if this is a convenient time for you?"</br>
</br>
"Of course? If it's inconvenient, I don't know how many scholars would be more than willing to have the opportunity to answer questions from the president," Hawking said good-naturedly, pulling Jiang Chen to the side. "It's lunchtime, so let's talk as we go. The cafeteria at the East Building is quite good—the pancakes there are delicious. I highly recommend them."</br>
</br>
Now that class was over, many students noticed the two people at the door. After they recognized Jiang Chen, some people even took out their phones. He would be surrounded.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't have time to learn about the enthusiasm of university students for the time being, so he quickly followed Hawking and left the building.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1132"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1132: Fermi“s Paradox and The Great Filter</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Although already well into his 70s, mature wasn't the right word to describe the old man. His posture and the habit of looking around reflected the shadow of a 16-year-old teen.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen quickly made sense of it. He asked himself if he sat in a while for a few decades, he would probably be more lively.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen examined the old man from behind, Hawking turned his head and teased him.</br>
</br>
"So, Mr. President, if you have any questions, please ask me soon. You are an important man making hundreds of thousands of dollars per second. You shouldn't waste too much time on campus."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed without denying the statement. After a moment of thought, he asked.</br>
</br>
"3.7 billion years, if you think there are civilizations that existed for 3.7 billion years, what would they develop into?"</br>
</br>
"This is a very interesting question. What do you think dinosaurs would have evolved to if they had a hundred million years?" Hawking did not directly answer Jiang Chen's question, but instead gave him another question.</br>
</br>
"Can you consider dinosaurs a civilization?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Are ants considered a civilization then? Are the bees civilized? Do the birds in the sky have their own society? Maybe there are and they do, but we just can't understand, or have never considered them in these perspectives." Hawking shrugged, "Arrogance is one attribute that belongs to a civilization. Those who are weaker than us, become slaves, those even weaker become food, and those not even considered food are regarded as bugs."</br>
</br>
Hawking suddenly grinned when he made this statement</br>
</br>
"We are very fortunate that at least our civilization has caught the attention of our neighbors. We didn't get ignored by them as dispensable bugs."</br>
</br>
"You call this fortunate?" Jiang Chen smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Rather than those bugs sailing 20.5 light-years to take his life, he would much rather those bugs consider him as a bug too.</br>
</br>
"Of course it is considered fortunate. The Indians have at least a chance to fight back against the European colonists, but do the bugs have that chance? Stop. Look, you almost trampled the little life." Hawking stopped Jiang Chen. In Jiang Chen's peculiar gaze, Hawking pointed to his feet, "That's right, I'm talking about that ant. If I didn't remind you, you wouldn't have even noticed. You won't communicate with it, and you won't care what it thinks, and less about whether they have had a technological breakthrough in the nesting process."</br>
</br>
Hawking with a smile crouched down, picked up a branch, and placed it in front of the ant.</br>
</br>
The little ant was confused by the sudden obstacle, the tentacles on its head swayed back and forth, and finally chose to go around from the side...</br>
</br>
"We are taught a lot of common sense in our life, but common sense is often just synonymous with prejudice."</br>
</br>
Hawking turned his head and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Do you think it will think about why this branch is in front of it?"</br>
</br>
"Do you think I should answer this question from a philosophical point of view, or from a scientific point of view?" Jiang Chen said in a helpless tone.</br>
</br>
I am not an ant; how would I know whether it will know why this branch is in front of it?</br>
</br>
Hawking laughed. He turned his head back and looked at the ant who walked around the branches, then he continued.</br>
</br>
"It has nothing to do with philosophy or science. If you have to put a name on it, it should be cosmology."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen twitched.</br>
</br>
"Cosmology?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. The definition of cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole and extends to the discussion of human status in the universe. It cannot be considered philosophy, and it is certainly not science. However, it is related to both subjects."</br>
</br>
Hawking reached out and picked up the two branches, blocking the two sides of the ant, and surrounded it.</br>
</br>
"If you came an hour earlier, you would be sitting in the classroom and listening to the story of Fermi's Paradox (1) and the Great Filter (2). But unfortunately, you missed the lively and interesting public elective course. However, it's still not too late if you treat me with pancakes. I—"</br>
</br>
"No problem, as much as you want," Jiang Chen quickly replied.</br>
</br>
Hawking smiled and pointed to the triangular cage on the ground that he made with branches. The "masterpiece" he spent three seconds completing.</br>
</br>
"This branch is the Great Filter it faces. If it goes around, then it will survive. If it figures it out, it will become a different ant. If it is blocked..."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Hawking stood up slowly and patted away the dust on his clothes.</br>
</br>
"It will starve to death here."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned after Hawking's words. Suddenly, like a eureka moment, he said thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
"Fermi's Paradox, The Great Filter..."</br>
</br>
As if he just caught something, Jiang Chen's eyes gradually brightened.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he noticed that the ant extended its tentacles to the branches. Trapped in the triangle cage, it could not find a way out. Then, it began to explore another method; as it climbed on top of the branches. However, from beginning to end, it was not aware of who manipulated the obstacle placed in front of it.</br>
</br>
"Now I'll answer your question. You asked me how developed civilization will be after 3.7 billion years. I can't answer you unless you can tell me what they have encountered in these 3.7 billion years."</br>
</br>
"On the scale of billion, the troubles are always endless. Natural disasters, diseases, wars... In fact, these are minor problems. Like this branch, no matter how many more branches are placed in front of it, it will eventually pass them."</br>
</br>
Hawking smiled as he looked at the ant who had successfully climbed over the branch,</br>
</br>
"Of course, it is not always so lucky, especially if it encounters a moody 'God'."</br>
</br>
Hawking raised his foot and stomped down on the ant and the branches…</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After chatting with Hawking, Jiang Chen felt that he gained clarity over a lot of problems</br>
</br>
Not only about the civilization 3.7 billion years ago, but also the extraterrestrial civilization 20 light-years away. He managed to find the answers to all the questions he was uncertain or unsure about.</br>
</br>
After arriving at the cafeteria, as promised, Jiang Chen treated Hawking to two sets of pancakes.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he really didn't understand the appeal of this food that is too sweet. But the old man across from him enjoyed it nonetheless. He could only attribute it to the difference in food culture. In the principle of not wasting food, Jiang Chen had to dismember the pancake in his plate and finish the meal.</br>
</br>
He certainly miscalculated. He didn't account for the fact that Hawking came from the United Kingdom, the pioneer of the art of dark cuisine (3)!</br>
</br>
"You don't have to force yourself to eat it," Hawking said with a smirk as he put another piece of pancake in his mouth. It was obvious he was trying his hardest not to laugh as his wrinkles twisted together.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly felt that the old man's smile was too infuriating.</br>
</br>
"I'm full."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tossed his fork into the plate as he finally gave up on the pancake with more than half left. After he bid farewell with Hawking, he returned his car.</br>
</br>
Because he parked at the building, he had to return the same way.</br>
</br>
However, as he passed through the forest path again, he found a group of students gathered together around a temporary podium that looked extremely lively.</br>
</br>
Out of curiosity, Jiang Chen stopped a passing student, pointed to the other side, and asked.</br>
</br>
"What are they doing there?"</br>
</br>

</br>
"Oh, them..." The student looked at Jiang Chen with a weird expression. He only thought that the person in front of him looked familiar, but he couldn't tell where he had seen him before. "They are probably just pulling for a political party for the upcoming election. There have been more and more of these activities recently."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Almost four years had passed since he overthrew President Edward's regime. In the past four years, the changes in Coro Island could be described as ground-breaking. There were almost no traces of the small fishing village.</br>
</br>
Xin implemented a presidential system with four years between each election, and the election campaign was set to begin at the end of March next year.</br>
</br>
If everything goes smoothly, Zhang Yaping was expected to continue his presidency, and Celestial Trade would continue to be the behind-the-scene ruler of the country. The parties would symbolically compete for the position of president, and then focus their efforts on the parliamentary seats.</br>
</br>
As a revolution that saved the people, it was almost impossible for Zhang Yaping to lose the election with the backing of Celestial Trade unless Zhang Yaping decided to voluntarily withdraw from the election.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen suddenly remembered something.</br>
</br>
The UA election, which always attracted worldwide attention, seemed to be next year too.</br>
</br>
After what happened in the latter half of this year, it was difficult for Hill to be re-elected. It was difficult for her to seek agreement in her own party, let alone gain the support of the people.</br>
</br>
When he thought of this, Jiang Chen couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
God bless Xin, I hope they will choose a more foolish opponent for me next year.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen guessed right, it was indeed a difficult time for Hill.</br>
</br>
The aircraft carrier battle group had never turned around because of the threat of any country. What's more, it was only a small country with a navy of six frigates and thirty fighters.</br>
</br>
Except for those who stood in the Pentagon's combat command room that day, everyone blamed this incident on Hill's weak diplomatic strategy. Even Hill's public relations team released some inside information and said that the madam president was against a lunatic who was not afraid to launch a nuclear war, but obviously not many people bought the story.</br>
</br>
Nuclear deterrence.</br>
</br>
Deterrence.</br>
</br>
How did you know that he was not bluffing? How are you sure that he dared to press the button?</br>
</br>
Hillary really didn't know, but she couldn't bet the country's future on whether the ten seconds after would be heaven or hell.</br>
</br>
Although many people put themselves in her shoes and thought they couldn't do any better, it didn't stop them from attacking her.</br>
</br>
This was politics.</br>
</br>
On Saturday, Hill was in the president's office, listening to the FBA director's report.</br>
</br>
</br>
At this moment, the office door was pushed open, and the FBA director immediately stopped and took two steps back.</br>
</br>
When she saw the person standing at the door, Hill frowned.</br>
</br>
"You forgot to knock on the door, Mr. Bolden."</br>
</br>
"I will apologize for my rudeness, but please wait until I have finished speaking...The second group of colonists from Celestial Trade has reached Mars. We have lost to them on the Moon and are now the gaps are growing wider and wider on Mars," he walked in the door anxiously as he placed a document on Hill's desk. He looked at her seriously and said, "NASA needs a bigger budget! If you still want us to build a space elevator before 2050."</br>
</br>
Hill rubbed the wrinkles at the corner of her eyes.</br>
</br>
"You should discuss this with the Congress, not come to me."</br>
</br>
With a bitter smile, Bolden shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Those short-sighted people are losing faith in Silicon Valley and Seattle. I have written two plans, but they are all stuck with the Budget Committee. You're my last resort... I apologize for being rude."</br>
</br>
After Bolden carefully finished his speech, he left from the office</br>
</br>
"What are the people in Congress thinking?" Hill frowned. She buried her face between her palms and took a deep breath, closed her eyes for a moment, and looked at the FBA director standing next to her, "Help me find out who it is—"</br>
</br>
Hill's words shocked the FBA Director as he quickly waved his hands.</br>
</br>
"This is not in compliance. I won't help you investigate members of Congress."</br>
</br>
"I think someone is behind the scenes," Hill said expressionlessly, "Someone was lobbying the Budget Committee to stop government funding. The Minister of Defense asked me to talk about similar issues in the morning."</br>
</br>
This situation was very common. In order to achieve political goals, certain groups or companies often pressured the Capitol through Congress, and the Budget Committee was only one of the means. For example, the famous K Street between Capitol Hill and the Capitol was a reflection of this phenomenon, it could be regarded as the gray area of ​​the democratic system.</br>
</br>
Hill's words made the FBA Director hesitate for a moment, then he reluctantly nodded.</br>
</br>
"At best, I can help you keep an eye on who those hearing committee members have been with these days--"</br>
</br>
Just then, the door was pushed open again.</br>
</br>
Hill suddenly became angry.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, don't you guys know how to knock on the door?"</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I'm really in a hurry." While Kerry apologized, he quickly walked in and took out the documents under his arm. Then he placed it on her desk with an anxious expression. "Nippon announced that it has joined the Earth Defense Alliance. Our people have just confirmed this news."</br>
</br>
Hill raised an eyebrow, "Just confirmed? What is the CIB doing!"</br>
</br>
"They were very careful. Their Congress has not even discussed this matter publicly."</br>
</br>
"It's not within the rules!"</br>
</br>
"It's not the first time they didn't follow the rules. Asian countries are all like this!" Kerry couldn't refrain himself from cussing out.</br>
</br>
The cabinet bypassed Congress and made a decision. It was indeed not the first time Nippon has done such a thing. It was just that the last time this happened was for the benefit of the UA, and this time it was to prevent the UA from knowing...</br>
</br>
After a pause, Kerry continued with an awkward expression, "The thing that worries us the most still has happened. They are now re-discussing the security treaty with us."</br>
</br>
"How dare they..." Hill suddenly felt a chill down her spine.</br>
</br>
The legal basis for the UA troops stationed in Nippon was the " Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the UA and Nippon" signed on January 9, 1960, which renewed every ten-year period, after which it can be abolished by either party with a one-year notice. After the expiry of the term in 1970, the two countries did not announce the abolition but automatically extended it to this day.</br>
</br>
Today, the UA military forces stationed in East Asia were no longer supervising the defeated countries in World War II but were there to achieve the UA Asia-Pacific strategy. Nippon's willingness to be the pawn of the UA was also an attempt to use its influence as protection for outward expansion.</br>
</br>
It was also the fundamental reason why neither party has mentioned the termination of the treaty for more than 40 years.</br>
</br>
In order to retain the UA troops, the Nippon government paid 5.2 billion dollars each year despite the anger that brewed in the people.</br>
</br>
However, since the T virus incident and since Prime Minister Abe was forced to step down, the right-wing forces were in a slump. Now the rise of Xin and the development of outer space resources completely eliminated Nippon's goal of outward expansion and so, they completely embraced the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
In this way, keeping the garrison in Nippon went from a mutually beneficial relationship to UA's wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
While Nippon mentioned that it would re-discuss the treaty, it was likely just a ploy to remove the UA military from its soil.</br>
</br>
If the weak performance of the joint fleet in the Western Pacific only slightly weakened Hill's approval rate, then the loss of the Nippon military base would become an unerasable stain in her political career.</br>
</br>
This time, Hillary really started to panic.</br>

</br>
Future Building, Coro City.</br>
</br>
They were still in the conference room, but this time Mr. Kishida did not bring his delegation. He came alone. Jiang Chen's assistant poured two cups of tea for the two and then exited out of the meeting room.</br>
</br>
"According to your request, we are discussing reducing the military budget for UA troops stationed in Nippon," Kishida politely said after looking at the door and confirmed that there was no one else in the room.</br>
</br>
Although the purpose of the Earth Defense Alliance was aimed at extraterrestrial civilization, it was ultimately a form of military alliance. Since Nippon joined the Earth Defense Alliance, it naturally should not accept the garrison of other military bodies.</br>
</br>
Since they were all in the same trench, they couldn't wear the same pants as someone from another trench.</br>
</br>
After he discussed this matter with leaders from Han and Russia, Jiang Chen agreed that the issue of UA troops stationed in Nippon should be resolved.</br>
</br>
"Reducing? Why not just cut the budget?" Jiang Chen smiled, sipped on the tea, and said, "Do you still want them?"</br>
</br>
"Not at all!" Kishida's eyes turned bigger as he rushed to explain, "It's just that you know. After all, they are at our doorstep and we are afraid of aggravating them. What's the saying? Boiling the frog with warm water..."</br>
</br>
He certainly changed his stance quickly over the past few weeks.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Kishida describing everything in a vivid voice and faked a smile.</br>
</br>
Although the saying is indeed right, the frog will still jump out once the water is too hot.</br>
</br>
Abolishing the security treaty, or slowly forcing the UA troops to withdraw by reducing their budget are essentially no different to the UA. Just as how 80 degrees or 100 degrees water will still burn the frog.</br>
</br>
But for Nippon, there was a big difference.</br>
</br>
Although the UA military that had yet to withdraw is troublesome, on the other hand, it could also be considered a bargaining chip in their hands to exchange for certain benefits. For example, they could negotiate for an additional asteroid at the negotiating table and win more projects for their domestic aerospace companies...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen never expected Nippon to fully commit to the Earth Defense Alliance. It was expected that they planned to use this as leverage, and the other member states all shared the same perspective.</br>
</br>
It was already a not-so-secret conspiracy.</br>
</br>
While it was obvious, as long as their request remained reasonable, Jiang Chen didn't mind. A small step back would be worth it for the countries still on the sideline.</br>
</br>
They already drunk two cups of tea.</br>
</br>
..</br>
</br>
Kishida quietly glanced at the time. He sensed the opportunity was right and smiled. "If by that time..."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, if they're still there, I will kick them out myself." Jiang Chen waved his hand with certainty.</br>
</br>
The smile on Kishida was extremely bright. Jiang Chen didn't know if it was fake or from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen sent Kishida away, he returned to his office on the top floor.</br>
</br>
He took the coffee from the beautiful assistant and sank into his chair. He then opened his holographic screen and began reading each company department's report.</br>
</br>
He didn't even finish one-fourth of the coffee before Ayesha came in.</br>
</br>
She stood behind Jiang Chen as her two small hands habitually rested on top of his shoulders and began to massage them.</br>
</br>
"The task you have given me has been completed."</br>
</br>
"This quickly?" Jiang Chen said, surprised.</br>
</br>
A rare smile belonging to a girl formed on Ayesha's face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's surprise was an affirmation for her.</br>
</br>
Or a good reward.</br>
</br>
She quickly hid her smile and returned to her emotionless state. Then she reported.</br>
</br>
"According to the intelligence we have gathered, the CIB's penetration of Nippon has reached an alarming level. There is enough evidence to prove that at least 51 members of the Senate and the House of Representatives are directly or indirectly related to the CIB."</br>
</br>
"That many? It seems that the political scene of the country has become ill." Jiang Chen was shocked by the figure.</br>
</br>
It is no wonder that before Kishida reached an agreement with Jiang Chen, he stayed in Xin. It was because he did not dare to go back.</br>
</br>
"Yes, it's already ill." Ayesha nodded with certainty.</br>
</br>
Since the Cold War, the UA never ceased its intelligence operation in Nippon. It continued to support pro-UA candidates to maintain their influence.</br>
</br>
Roger Hillsman, who served as deputy secretary of state during the previous administration, said that until the early 1960s, the CIB provided funding to politicians. Although all activities were carried out in secret, espionage became a vital part of foreign policy in Nippon.</br>
</br>
With the financial assistance of the CIB, some unknown and young politicians became influential members of the country. This included a former deputy prime minister that denied he received financial support but admitted that he was "closely related to CIB".</br>
</br>
Since the showdown on the Pacific Ocean, Jiang Chen issued an order to the intelligence department to expand the number of agents in Nippon and set up a larger intelligence network to remove foreign intelligence networks.</br>
</br>
It must be mentioned here that the intelligence department of Xin is divided into two systems. One was the Xin National Intelligence Agency under the jurisdiction of Celestial Trade Armed Forces; it was an administrative institution of the company. The other was the Ghost Agents directly loyal to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The former was mainly engaged in the collection of international intelligence and national counter-espionage work. The latter not only served part of the functions of the former, but the latter also engaged in espionage activities such as assassinating dangerous targets that must remain in the dark.</br>
</br>
Simply put, the former was the eye while the latter was the dagger.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's focus for the past was to integrate the power of the eye and the dagger with the goal of forming Xin's own intelligence network in Nippon.</br>
</br>
Now with the eye and the dagger already in place, with just one order from Jiang Chen place; they could remove any foreign intelligence network on the island and become the new "master".</br>
</br>
He leaned back, then looked at Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Do you think the CIB is aware of our actions?"</br>
</br>
"They are aware," Ayesha gently rubbed her hands on Jiang Chen's cheek. "They have already begun to move. According to the intelligence from Nippon, they are forging scandal documents of the prime minister. Within two months, the current prime minister will be ousted. The code of the mission is 'Closing Plan', and the ultimate goal is to elect a pro-UA cabinet."</br>
</br>
"Closing Plan?" Jiang Chen smiled, intrigued. "This is forcing us to also come up with a 'Supporting Plan'?"</br>
</br>
After a short pause, Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"What is the stance of the Nippon government now?"</br>
</br>
"Keeping one eye open, but no action yet."</br>
</br>
"Oh, it seems that they are certain that we will help, so they decided not to join the fun." Jiang Chen's smile gradually disappeared, "Since they asked for it, we'll give them a prescription. Get our agents to prepare, it is time for war."</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked shocked.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
"Get all the Mickey Mouses out of the country!"</br>
</br>
"As for the code name of the mission," Jiang Chen paused for a moment as a wicked smile appeared on his face, "let's call it '007'."</br>

</br>
On August 20th, Naya, a CIB agent on her way home from a café got into a car accident. Alcohol was detected in the blood of the victim and the accident was initially characterized as drunk driving. But the local police were confused about why her blood contained alcohol if she were at a coffee shop.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, almost on the same day, a car was removed from the ditch on the outskirts of Yoto. Two UA citizens sitting in the front row of the car had both drowned and fake passports were found in their possession.</br>
</br>
On August 23rd, also in Yoto, a private room in a club in Ginza caught fire. Except for two club staff and three UA businessmen that unfortunately died in the fire, no other casualties were reported.</br>
</br>
August 24th, Naki Shipyard...</br>
</br>
Darkness was about to shroud the city.</br>
</br>
In an express hotel near the embassy district, the UA ambassador anxiously paced around in the room. Two bodyguards stood at the window and the entrance, their muscular figures made them appear like sculptures.</br>
</br>
Just then, someone knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
The three people's expressions all tensed up. The two bodyguards put their hand into their vest, and the ambassador stopped moving and nervously looked at the door</br>
</br>
Knock...knock...knock...</br>
</br>
It was two long knocks and one short knock.</br>
</br>
The ambassador sighed with relief and waved at the two bodyguards.</br>
</br>
"Our own."</br>
</br>
The door opened and a man dashed into the room. His hair was messy, dark circles were under his eyes, and his eyes appeared bloodshot.</br>
</br>
From his weary expression, he hasn't lived a peaceful day in awhile.</br>
</br>
"Burkes and Noosa are dead," while carefully closing the door, his whispered. "Nayo, who is responsible for providing us intelligence, disappeared on the way to work this morning. Mr. Hirata admitted to accepting bribes...Fu*k! Our line is completely broken!"</br>
</br>
"Stay calm, my friend," the ambassador patted him on the shoulder. "Maybe you need to sit for a while and have a cup of hot cocoa."</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! I can swear that it must be the Ghost Agents." When the word "Ghost Agent" came out of his mouth, his throat felt like it was stuffed by a cotton ball. His bloodshot eyes widened, and not a single word could come out.</br>
</br>
"What... what's wrong?" The ambassador looked at him hesitantly.</br>
</br>
"Nothing." The man shook his head and pushed away the ambassador's hand. He held his forehead and sat down on the chair.</br>
</br>
His people were dying of unnatural causes, and he had been pushed to the brink of collapse. The killers, without a trace, were like a dagger against his throat. Just mentioning their name made him fearful.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, they can't get in, I have installed that thing in the entire hotel, you know." The ambassador sighed and poured him a cup of hot water. He comforted the man and said, "I will arrange a plane tomorrow for you to leave. Since your identity has been exposed, it's not suitable for you to stay here."</br>
</br>
</br>
While the optical invisibility of Ghost Agents was terrifying, times had changed. The UA Department of Defense's Advanced Project Research Institute had developed at least ten methods for detecting optical invisibility. From sound wave induction to laser wave path difference sensing; the entire hotel was designed with traps.</br>
</br>
The ambassador was convinced this place was safe.</br>
</br>
The man took the cup and hesitated for a moment as he stared at the rising fog.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he seemed to have made up his mind, and he gnawed his teeth.</br>
</br>
"No, I will leave tonight!"</br>
</br>
"You are in a bad state right now. I suggest you sleep here for one night and then I will arrange transportation to take you to the airport tomorrow..."</br>
</br>
No one noticed that a drone was hidden in the darkness, quietly suspended outside the window. The almost invisible laser pointed onto the window and recorded their conversation.</br>
</br>
Laser monitoring wasnot advanced technology. Including the infrared sensor camera on the drone, it could almost be considered as something fairly common. The only difference about this particular drone was that the drone's technological content is a bit more advanced than the drones available on the market.</br>
</br>
The laser monitoring device retracted and was replaced by a black muzzle.</br>
</br>
Without realizing that doom had arrived, the man was finally convinced by the ambassador to rest and leave tomorrow. The man put down the cup of water, rested for a moment, and prepared to sleep peacefully for a night before returning home tomorrow.</br>
</br>
As long as he could step back onto his home soil...</br>
</br>
Just then, there were gunshots!</br>
</br>
The drone outside the window opened fire without any warning. Twenty bullets unleashed instantly, tearing open the glass and curtains, hitting the man like raindrops. The bullets penetrated the man along with the chair behind him.</br>
</br>
The man hit twitched for a moment in the rain of bullets before his hands and head dropped down. There was not a sign of life in his pupils.</br>
</br>
The sound of shattered glass almost simultaneously matched with the screams of the ambassador. The hot water and hot blood mixed, soaking the carpet.</br>
</br>
The other three people in the room dropped to the ground immediately when they heard the gunshots. Two bodyguards hid behind cover; the ambassador rolled to the bottom of the bed.</br>
</br>
Tensely lying flat, the ambassador didn't even dare to breathe loudly. He desperately tried to shrink his obese body to something as small as possible. Fear was the only emotion he could feel as he watched the man die in front of him.</br>
</br>
He was a diplomat, not a soldier.</br>
</br>
Perhaps those colleagues who work in the Middle East would be a little braver, but not him.</br>
</br>
He had been working in Nippon for more than a decade, and it was the first time a person has died in front of him.</br>
</br>
He screamed at the top of his lung.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Go and inform the guards! Also, get the Marines to come! This group of madmen must have forgotten the Geneva Conventions! How dare they, how dare..."</br>
</br>
A bodyguard gritted his teeth and rushed to the edge of the bed. He took out his pistol and prepared to shoot behind cover.</br>
</br>
Another bodyguard kicked down the cabinet and used the cabinet as cover to move to the ambassador's side.</br>
</br>
"Sir, we must escort you out first..."</br>
</br>
"I'm not going anywhere! I'm not going anywhere before I see the Marines! Take your hand..." The ambassador screamed hysterically as he pushed away the hand reaching for him.</br>
</br>
No one could guarantee that the attacker was not still aiming at this place. No one knew whether that lunatic madman would spare the diplomats...</br>
</br>
What they didn't know was that it was a drone that attacked them, a drone with only one cartridge. After all twenty-five rounds of bullets were fired, the drone retreated.</br>
</br>
Five kilometers away, also in an express hotel.</br>
</br>
A girl picked up the drone that came back through the window, closed her laptop and swayed her beautiful short hair. A subtle smile formed as she calmly stuffed the drone and laptop into her bag.</br>
</br>
She pushed open the door, carried her bag and quickly disappeared into the dark alley. It was as if she was never there in the first place...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1136: Miss Kwai is Very Scared</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Miss Boss is very scared</br>
</br>
On the evening of August 25th, a CIB intelligence chief was shot dead in front of the UA ambassador in an express hotel near the embassy. The war of the spies instantly escalated to an unprecedented level. To ensure the safety of the embassy, ​​the UA deployed two squads of Marine Corps to the embassy.</br>
</br>
The Xin National Intelligence Agency's unexpected move suddenly disrupted CIB's "Closing Plan", CIB was forced to devote all its energy to defending against Xin agents.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, as one of the top three intelligence agencies in the world, the CIB certainly didn't lack experience in espionage activities. They were only caught off guard, and when they reacted, they immediately revealed their sharp fangs.</br>
</br>
On August 27th, two stateless Asians were suspected of being killed by yakuza members in the suburbs of Yoto. The men were shot and died in miserable deaths with more than 20 gunshot wounds. They were agents of the Xin National Intelligence Agency.</br>
</br>
On the same night, an Asian man holding a Nippon passport was shot in a small alley in Yoto. A homeless man spotted the incident. The forensic report detected alcohol and toxins in the blood and the incident was categorized as deliberate murder...</br>
</br>
From the initial car accident, the murder under the cover of accidents, to the more and more explicit shooting and poisoning, the two sides had completely torn off any decency. The state of safety in Yoto deteriorated overnight. The spy war challenged the bottom line of the Nippon government's tolerance countless times and repeatedly refreshed the bottom line...</br>
</br>
The Nippon government simply couldn't intervene due to the nature of the two parties.</br>
</br>
The Nippon Police Force had to clean up after both sides while keeping an eye closed on the events unfolding.</br>
</br>
Withstanding the internal and external pressure, the Nippon Prime Minister even began to question if he chose the right profession.</br>
</br>
Compared with being an official, he felt like he must possess the resilience of a ninja!</br>
</br>
The seemingly fierce and violent incidents were surprisingly rational. Both the UA and Xin have tacitly controlled the battlefield in Nippon and not extended the "war" to other regions. They also did not involve other unrelated people.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the Yoto Metropolitan Police Department, case files began to pile up on people's desks.</br>
</br>
"It's another murder case? There are more and more murders, and they are all aimed at foreigners." The old sheriff pushed up his glasses and looked at the case file in his hand, frowning, he said, "...I'm afraid it is not as simple as it appears."</br>
</br>
Recalling the order issued by his superior, the old sheriff thought for a moment before he wrote a few words and then placed the file on the corner of his desk.</br>
</br>
Three days later, the case file would be sent to the higher up agency of the Yoto Metropolitan Police Department. The National Security Agency of Nippon and the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would jointly archive the document as confidential.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Kwai."</br>
</br>
"Hey!" Kwai, who was organizing documents, immediately put down her work and looked at the old sheriff.</br>
</br>
"Be careful when you go back. It hasn't been really safe lately," the old sheriff reminded.</br>
</br>
Kwai nodded with a smile and politely said that she would be careful.</br>
</br>
But she didn't put much thought into it.</br>
</br>
Even if they're daring, they wouldn't go after the police…</br>
</br>
Go after the police…</br>
</br>
The smile on Kwai's face suddenly froze, and her right eye twitched.</br>
</br>
She did meet someone like that…</br>
</br>
After work, Kwai hesitated and did not return her pistol.</br>
</br>
As the Sheriff said, safety has deteriorated lately. The police department even issued special documents requiring that all police officers above inspector position are allowed to wield a weapon outside of work hours.</br>
</br>
After she left the police station, she headed to the Shinkansen.</br>
</br>
Since the last time she left the mansion under Mount Fuji, Kwai was inexplicably transferred back to Yoto Metropolitan Police Department.</br>
</br>
However, instead of feeling any joy for the promotion, she felt a faint sense of fear. She felt an invisible hand, untouched by the judicial system, controlling her fate in its palm.</br>
</br>
Even though almost half a year has passed, this fear still lingered.</br>
</br>
Her colleagues always spread rumors around her. For example, an important individual is taking care of her… Well, it is true in nature. She was able to transfer back to Yoto because Jiang Chen made the request to Sumitomo.</br>
</br>
She didn't mind the rumors. She had been deliberately trying to fade that memory and to escape the shadow of that man as soon as possible. In fact, she almost did it, at least she thought she did.</br>
</br>
Kwai took a deep breath and walked on the path she always took.</br>
</br>
It was already nine o'clock in the evening, and the shops were all closed. With the high number of murders, there were almost no pedestrians on the street.</br>
</br>
The evening wind blew into the alley, gently swaying by her bang along with some of the summer heat.</br>
</br>
At this moment, from the evening breeze, she suddenly smelled a hint of blood.</br>
</br>
She stopped right away and immediately looked down the alley.</br>
</br>
She was certain.</br>
</br>
It was the scent of blood!</br>
</br>
Recalling the recent safety concerns, Kwai was almost certain something must have happened in the alley!</br>
</br>
Almost without any hesitation, she rushed into the alley.</br>
</br>
As a devoted police, her safety was never her top concern, otherwise, she would never have risked her life to get into the club as an undercover cop.</br>
</br>
However, she stopped after taking two steps.</br>
</br>
A girl in black was standing in the middle of the alley. Her short hair hit her shoulders and drifted in the wind. It looked very unreal and artistic.</br>
</br>
However, the dead bodies in the alley colored the beautiful scene with blood.</br>
</br>
"Are you the boss' little lover?" The emotionless voice floated from the distance, as the girl noticed the person behind her. She turned around like a ghost, then she smiled and nodded with satisfaction, "Nice, you do look pretty."</br>
</br>
Kwai trembled and reached to her waist, but the coldness of the metal did not give her too much security.</br>
</br>
"Who, who is your boss's lover..."</br>
</br>
"I advise you not to do that." The girl noticed Kwai's movement and sighed.</br>
</br>
"Murderer..." Kwai was staring at the girl in front of her eyes and forced out the word from her trembling lips. "Stop, I am a police officer. My colleagues are on their way, I advise you to put your hands up..."</br>
</br>
"Murderer? Police? Surrender?" The girl seemed to have heard something funny and shook her head. "This is not something the police can manage. Don't you see that your Prime Minister is being silent on this matter? This is war. My child, this is war."</br>
</br>
In front of Kwai, the girl's smile gradually faded, and finally, she disappeared into the darkness.</br>
</br>
Kwai's expression turned pale. She pulled out her pistol and pointed it in front of her, shaking with fear.</br>
</br>
Where did she go?</br>
</br>
How did she disappear?</br>
</br>
Could, could that have been… a ghost?!</br>

</div></br>
"Sil, 16 years old; born in a slum in Madagascar; Han and Portuguese mix. She's proficient in five languages, good at camouflage and drone modification. At the age of 12, she was rescued from a smuggling ship by a Celestial Trade patrol boat. After that, she was sent to Ghost Island for military training among the third groups of agents."</br>
</br>
It was good to start early, and training was not an exception.</br>
</br>
Other than the first and second groups of agents, all other Ghost Agents were orphans from underdeveloped areas and war zones.</br>
</br>
The older ones were15 years old while the younger ones were under 10 years old. On Ghost Island, they receive basic education up till high school under closed militarized management, while learning language and the necessary "professional knowledge" of agents. Before the age of forty, they would serve as a member of Ghost Agents. After the age of forty, they could choose to retire or serve in non-field positions of Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
Without Celestial Trade, most of their fates would be struggling below the poverty line or die as a casualty of the war. The people who gave them their second life were their saviors, and Ghost Island continued to instill this belief into them.</br>
</br>
When they leave Ghost Island, their thoughts have been entrenched with loyalty. That's why Jiang Chen never worried about their loyalty.</br>
</br>
At this moment, in the office of the mansion on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the resume and listened to Ayesha's report.</br>
</br>
The Xin intelligence personnel and the UA CIB's spy war in Nippon had escalated to direct and open engagement. Although Xin also suffered casualties, in general, Xin gained the upper hand. While their intelligence personnel was inferior to the CIB, the powerful assassination ability of Ghost Agents regained them some ground.</br>
</br>
"This resume is pretty good. However, is being a Han-Portuguese mix... fine?"</br>
</br>
"Camouflage is one of her best abilities, and she can easily switch between Asian and European appearances with makeup."</br>
</br>
"That... is really an incredible ability."</br>
</br>
"If it were not an incredible ability, it would not have been included in the resume." Ayesha grinned as she saw Jiang Chen's shocked expression.</br>
</br>
"In that case, she can serve as the Intelligence Commander of Ghost Agents in Nippon." Jiang Chen signed his name on the document. "Although, I would have preferred giving Zhu Yu this position. She handled the T vrius Crisis in Yoto quite exceptionally."</br>
</br>
"There is nothing wrong with her abilities. However, her management skill is still a little lacking. It is more suitable for her to engage in anti-espionage work in the country," Ayesha said gently.</br>
</br>
"You are her instructor. You know her best," Jiang Chen said, "Right, there is another task for you."</br>
</br>
Ayesha's sapphire-eyes blinked and she nodded.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of the name Qian Xia?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head and remembered the name.</br>
</br>
"The maid that took care of us in Nippon?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded. "If it's convenient, get Sil to keep an eye on her."</br>
</br>
Although the two sides have remained rationale and haven't involved other people, it would be impossible to ensure that this demeanor would continue. Just in case, it would be best to prepare beforehand.</br>
</br>
Also, he did like the little maid who was so obedient.</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded to signal her understanding, then asked.</br>
</br>
"What about that police?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was a little odd.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen, confused, waiting for him to make a decision.</br>
</br>
"...just leave her be, she should be okay."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded, picked up the document that Jiang Chen just signed, and then left.</br>
</br>
After the door of the office closed, Jiang Chen leaned back into his chair. After looking up at the ceiling for a moment, he closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
In just two weeks, they lost twenty-nine intelligence personnel in foreign countries. In contrast, a total of 37 CIB agents at all levels were executed, and more than half of them were the work of Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
If he wanted to completely integrate Nippon into Xin's sphere of influence, then there was no way to circumvent the CIB. The UA did not want Nippon to renegotiate the treaty, and it was bound to make moves through the CIB. Jiang Chen's only choice now was to tear a few holes out of the intelligence network the UA has been operating since the Cold War era, and then fill in the spaces with the intelligence personnel of Xin with the goal of finally kicking the CIB out.</br>
</br>
Only Ayesha and several senior officials of the intelligence department were aware about this difficult task.</br>
</br>
Although the report placed on his desk that stated twenty-nine for thirty-seven clearly favored Xin, it was because CIB remained in the open while Xin agents as the newcomers hid in the dark. If the spy war continued, then it would be hard to maintain this ratio until the end.</br>
</br>
But then again, with the causalities, it was time to decide a victor.</br>
</br>
If everything goes as planned, UA should contact him soon to discuss a "peace treaty" that will satisfy both parties.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was looking forward to testing Hill's bottom line.</br>
</br>
His bottom line was one hundred people.</br>
</br>
If the war's damage exceeds one hundred...</br>
</br>
Maybe he will stop first and look for other options.</br>
</br>
Of course, maybe he may get hotheaded again and send another hundred agents in.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the intelligence department of Xin obeys his order. War or peace is at the whim of his thoughts. There is no need for any inefficient cabinet discussion or ridiculous voting.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen closed his eyes to meditate, his phone vibrated.</br>
</br>
"The UA? They can't take it anymore?"</br>
</br>
Lifting one eyelid, Jiang Chen lazily reached out and opened the holographic screen. However, when he looked at the IP displayed on the screen, he found himself wrong. It was not from UA but Nippon.</br>
</br>
He put down his legs that were resting on the table, Jiang Chen fixed his collar, cleared his throat, and then picked up the call.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The prime minister holding the phone had a mix of feelings.</br>
</br>
Honestly, he didn't want to make this call.</br>
</br>
With Xin and UA, two countries in the midst of a heated battle, it wouldn't serve him any purpose to intervene. What's more, in his position, it would only benefit Nippon for the war to last as long as possible.</br>
</br>
Only when the two tigers were both tired could Nippon have the opportunity to consolidate their intelligence network, escape the control of the UA and avoid being controlled by Celestial Trade. Slowly, Nippon would become a "normal country."</br>
</br>
As for the recent murders, it won't be a big deal since only spies have died.</br>
</br>
However, now, he was forced to make this call.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade had done something recently where he must intervene...</br>
</br>
Looking at the man in front of him, the Prime Minister tried to make his smile look less rigid.</br>
</br>
"...ahem, Mr. Jiang Chen, I will be straightforward with you. What will it take for you to stop?"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"What I have done recently? Sorry, I don't understand."</br>
</br>
The Nippon Prime Minister's mouth twitched as he looked at Jiang Chen who was obviously playing dumb, but he remained smiling.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, I heard that your country has installed a backdoor program in the 20,000 highway magnetic levitation devices exported to our country. Is this true?"</br>
</br>
"This is an accusation without any basis!" Jiang Chen slapped the table and said with indignation. "We have always been honest in doing business. How can we do something like this? Mr. Prime Minister, I want to know who is accusing us. I will reserve the right to sue!"</br>
</br>
Will I tell you that the CIB told me?</br>
</br>
The Nippon Prime Minister looked at Jiang Chen with suspicion. Obviously, he did not immediately believe his words.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure?"</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Jiang Chen said, full of certainty, "This kind of accusation must be supported by evidence. If you can produce evidence, I will have nothing more to say. But if it's just a few false hearsays, I hope that your country will treat the trade relations between our two countries with caution. It is unwise to be used by someone else."</br>
</br>
The Nippon Prime Minister looked at Jiang Chen silently.</br>
</br>
Indeed, he had no evidence.</br>
</br>
The intelligence was provided by the CIB. Until now, the Nippon intelligence system remained dependent on them. When Jiang Chen mentioned this, he also began to question if he was being used.</br>
</br>
The same device was sold to Hua!</br>
</br>
With this thought in his mind, the Prime Minister smiled.</br>
</br>
"I am sorry to have suspected you. I do apologize..."</br>
</br>
Apologizing immediately indeed fitted the culture of Nippon, but Jiang Chen knew that he didn't just believe his words. The prime minister probably already contacted its agency and began sampling Sumitomo Group's construction site.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen ended the call, he leaned back into his chair and sneered.</br>
</br>
As long as Xin existed, Nippon won't be a "normal country."</br>
</br>
Nippon should just behave like Country F and Moro, as a dependent country of Xin. Xin also happened to lack an electronic industrial base. If Nippon could be obedient, he wouldn't mind boosting their economy.</br>
</br>
As for those magnetic levitation devices, Jiang Chen was not worried about them finding the backdoor program. The backdoor program was designed by Yao Yao. If Jiang Chen personally didn'tleak the information, no one would be able to find out.</br>
</br>
Aside from the magnetic levitation devices, logistics drones, wireless charging stations, Future phones, all electronic products were installed with some method for access. IBM did it before, Microsoft, Google, and Apple have also done it. It wouldn't make sense if Future Group didn't do it.</br>
</br>
All of these electronic products manufactured by Future Heavy Industrials not only exist as products but also as chess pieces that Future Group placed all over the world. The chess pieces would export valuable information using quantum satellites to Coro City's Future Building.</br>
</br>
</br>
Take Nippon for example. In the future, Yoto would make three-dimensional traffic into a reality with the help of Future Heavy Industries. All magnetic levitation vehicles would be incorporated into the city's AI, while coordinated with the help of AI, they would also be monitored by AI.</br>
</br>
The collected data through logistics drones, satellites, and other devices would be aggregated into quantum computers. With the powerful information processing capabilities of quantum computers, the Xin National Security Agency could even create a database of behaviors for every citizen. Of course, only authorized agents would have access to the data in the database.</br>
</br>
To sum everything up in a sentence, once Future Group's products reach over 50% of the country's citizens, then the privacy of the country would be nonexistent.</br>
</br>
The most frightening thing was that people being shrouded by this intelligence network have no idea that they have lost their privacy.</br>
</br>
If this matter wasmade public, it would undoubtedly be the biggest scandal in Future Group's history with significance no less than the PRISM project (1).</br>
</br>
However, the premise was that there must evidence to prove Future Group is undertaking such an initiative.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"This is infuriating!" Henry Wilmot, the CIB director, slammed his fist against the table and gnawed.</br>
</br>
Just now, he received news that the body of another CIB agent was found in the suburbs of Yoto. Since the start of this spy war, this was the 40th CIB agent to die in the hands of Ghost Agents</br>
</br>
Speaking of the CIB director position, this position seems to be cursed. The previous two directors stepped down because of Jiang Chen. The last director was involved in plot that involved Jiang Chen on UA soil, and the one before the last was involved with the incident in Hua...</br>
</br>
"They are provoking us to start a war! Is that lunatic not afraid of starting another world war?" Wilmot stared at the documents on the table, feeling inexplicable emotions.</br>
</br>
Just then, Kerry next to him sighed.</br>
</br>
"You said he is a lunatic, why bother using a normal person's brain to think from his perspective?"</br>
</br>
Kerry indeed understood Jiang Chen's motive after he gained an advantage on the Western Pacific Ocean and immediately began to uproot the CIB intelligence network in Nippon. Since the man did place the nuclear button on the negotiating table, against a thug from the Third World, he couldn't think of a way to deal with him.</br>
</br>
Unless he is the president...</br>
</br>
With this thought, Kerry's fist tightened and he took a deep breath. Then, he looked over to Wilmot and seemingly talking to himself, he said.</br>
</br>
"I went to visit Naomi Madden yesterday."</br>
</br>
A sharp sight focused on him. Kerry's mouth moved subtly, and his hands were tucked behind him, responding to Wilmot's vigilant sight.</br>
</br>
Naomi Madden was his former boss, the unlucky former CIB director who was forced to resign afterward because of his subordinate's plot for the Los Santos Incident. If it weren't because of Naomi's fall, Wilmot wouldn't have been able to sit in this position</br>
</br>
Slightly hiding the vigilance in his eyes, Wilmot tried to act calm and asked.</br>
</br>
"Oh? How is he doing?"</br>
</br>
Kerry smiled and began pacing around the office with his hands behind his back. Then, he stopped by the bookshelf.</br>
</br>
"Paying his bills by offering speeches and living a decent life. It's just a bit quiet in his home."</br>
</br>
"What do you want to say?" Wilmot's eyes moved slightly and he said without a change of expression.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Wilmot, if, I mean, if," Kerry reached out, as if he was searching for a book, and moved his fingers across the edge of the bookshelf. "If the CIB loses the war, do you think you can still sit in this position?"</br>
</br>
The tip of Wilmot's mouth curved up and he said in a slightly mocking tone.</br>
</br>
"Oh? When did the Secretary of State also begin to intervene in the CIB's appointments? Or, is this the message of the president?"</br>
</br>
"Don't get me wrong," Kerry waved his hand and smiled. "I just made a hypothesis. Of course, the Secretary of State does not have this power. The president did not give me any orders. However, allow me to be honest. If your performance is poor this time, it's hard to say the respected president won't use you as a scapegoat."</br>
</br>
Wilmot's eyes flashed with thoughts and he did not respond.</br>
</br>
Kerry took a book from the shelf, patted the dust on the cover, and walked to the desk.</br>
</br>
"The FBA people are investigating the Congressional Budget Committee."</br>
</br>
"This is not within the rule," Wilmot's first reaction was to frown, and then his eyes immediately widened and he looked at Kerry in disbelief.</br>
</br>
It was impossible to be in this position without political sense. When Kerry mentioned the FBA and Congress, he immediately understood the meaning of the Secretary of State.</br>
</br>
Why is the FBA investigating Congress? And in particular, the Congressional Budget Committee with the closest tie to Wall Street?</br>
</br>
Kerry placed the book he removed from the shelf on the table, and gently tapped on the cover of the book. When Wilmot looked at the cover of the book, Kerry stood up, fixed his collar, and smiled at the CIB director.</br>
</br>
"Think about it. It's time to pick your side."</br>
</br>
"You want me to stop the FBA's investigation of Congress?" There was a visible shock in Wilmot's eyes as he saw the cover of the book.</br>
</br>
When Kerry looked at Wilmot, who was fighting an internal dilemma, his smile was cheerful.</br>
</br>
"On the contrary, I need you to help me collect evidence that will prove Hill is using the FBA to investigate the Congress."</br>
</br>
On the thick leather cover of the book in front of Wilmont, a line of gold-colored Latin, written in calligraphy, read – Biography of Harry S. Truman.</br>

</div></br>
The UA couldn't sit still anymore.</br>
</br>
When the death toll of CIB agents reached 51, the UA ambassador headed to Xin for a meeting with Jiang Chen. At this time, the number of casualties on the Xin side just surpassed 40, still far from the 100 casualty limit Jiang Chen set.</br>
</br>
In the office on the top floor of Future Building, Jiang Chen met UA's ambassador Holman. Due to the fact that only Holman was visiting and it was not a formal visit, the meeting did not take place in a conference room.</br>
</br>
There was no small talk or formality, the middle-aged man with a hooked nose just sat down and stared into Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
"What do you want?"</br>
</br>
"Just cleaning up our garden." Jiang Chen shrugged and smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's understatement made Holman take a slight pause; his aggressive expression suddenly froze on his face. His anger gradually began to spread from his mind to the rest of his body.</br>
</br>
Cleaning up your garden?</br>
</br>
Cleaning up your garden!</br>
</br>
When did UA's post in Asia become your garden? 50 lives are just nothing in your eyes?</br>
</br>
However, the sly smile on Jiang Chen's face made Holman's anger dissipate.</br>
</br>
As a diplomat, he would never show his expression. And instincts told him that the man in front of his eyes seemed to be angering him deliberately? Although he didn't understand Jiang Chen's rationale, Holman didn't want to let his plan succeed.</br>
</br>
"It will be meaningless for us to continue this stupid war. I come with peace in mind and to negotiate with you. I hope that Mr. Jiang can cooperate." Holman looked straight into Jiang Chen's eyes and said, "I'm going to be straightforward, what are your conditions?"</br>
</br>
"Our conditions?" Jiang Chen smiled and said unceremoniously, "Tell your people to pack up and leave, then this war will naturally end."</br>
</br>
Even if Holman had the best manners, he was furious.</br>
</br>
His face gradually turned gloomy, and the man with a hooked nose snorted and said in a menacing tone.</br>
</br>
"Do you think just because we made concessions to avoid a war in the Western Pacific Ocean, we will always be humble? Are you taking yourself too seriously?"</br>
</br>
Holman's rhetoric was clever as he described changing the course as "a concession to avoid war." Although it didn't change the fact they backed down, it did add some momentum to the negotiating process.</br>
</br>
It was a pity that Jiang Chen did not take the subtle threat in his words seriously.</br>
</br>
"It's not that we take ourselves too seriously," Jiang Chen smiled and looked at Holman, and responded with directness, "but you are overestimating yourself. My conditions are already on the table, if you want to stop the war, you can withdraw."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at him with a sly.</br>
</br>
"Of course, if you feel that my proposal is unreasonable, let's continue to fight and determine a victor."</br>
</br>
The negotiation broke down.</br>
</br>
</br>
Or rather, Jiang Chen never expected to resolve this issue through negotiations.</br>
</br>
Nippon was the front post of the UA in East Asia. As one of the strategic cores of in Asia, the UA would never give up on the grasp of this location. However, Jiang Chen was not in a hurry to negotiate with them. Now, Future Heavy Industries was working with Sumitomo Group to build the magnetic levitation highway. When the entire Yoto road network became Celestial Trade's network, CIB agents better start praying.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen watched Holman get up and leave, he touched his chin and said thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
"It's very strange. If the UA really wants to negotiate with us, they shouldn't have just sent an ambassador."</br>
</br>
As the office door closed, Ayesha's figure surfaced next to him. She was there from the beginning. Before Holman came here, she was discussing sending additional Ghost Agents to Nippon.</br>
</br>
"They should send the Secretary of State?" Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen, with his hand still on his chin, was thoughtful. "This is very unusual."</br>
</br>
Kerry didn't come, but someone he never heard of did.</br>
</br>
In terms of negotiating, did Holman even have the right to negotiate on behalf of the UA?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Three days after the negotiations with Holman broke down, the situation in Nippo changed dramatically in a peculiar way.</br>
</br>
CIB agents who were originally active in Tokyo seemed to have received some kind of signal, and suddenly stopped their aggressive counterattack and completely went into hiding. Not only did they suspend contact with members of the right-wing party and some pro-UA leftists, but they even stopped tracking Xin agents.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the clues controlled by Ghosts Agents also became dead-ends.</br>
</br>
As if overnight, the CIB agents hid into darkness.</br>
</br>
This peculiar peace lasted for three days.</br>
</br>
The Nippon National Police Agency was finally relieved. Although it didn't know how long this peaceful period would last, it was a good start. Every time the bodies of "foreign friends" were dragged out of dark alleys, it must spend countless efforts to take care of the aftermath...</br>
</br>
Although it was ten o'clock at night, the lights in the office of the mansion on the east side of Coro Island were still on.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced through the report Ayesha gave him, thought for a moment, and then abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"Did something happen in the Capital?"</br>
</br>
Sitting quietly on Jiang Chen's thigh, Ayesha lowered her head and looked ashamed.</br>
</br>
"We... have not received any new intelligence for the time being. Sorry..."</br>
</br>
Xin National Intelligence Agency's penetration into the Capital had been extremely limited. Although Ghost Agents could freely enter and exit the country, it had been difficult to infiltrate into the country's political network. Jiang Chen must admit the UA established powerful anti-espionage capabilities.</br>
</br>
"Don't be too self-blaming, this is not your fault," Jiang Chen gently lifted the porcelain-like face and comforted. "A few days later, when Future Heavy Industries' shipyard is complete, I will stay for a bit in Celestial City and then make a trip to Lunar Colony. Do you want to come with me?"</br>
</br>
The sapphire-like eyes suddenly brightened, but they quickly dimmed.</br>
</br>
Full of regrets, Ayesha whispered.</br>
</br>
"I can't leave."</br>
</br>
Although CIB's actions in Nippon seemed to have subsided, no one can guarantee that this peculiar peace will last. As the chief instructor of Ghost Agents, she must take command in Coro City.</br>
</br>
"That's also true," Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha apologetically. Then gently stroking her hair, he said, "I will bring you souvenirs, is there anything you need?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha just stared at him with her pristine, watery eyes.</br>
</br>
The sensual atmosphere gradually dissipated the silence lingering between the duo.</br>
</br>
After he read the true feeling hidden in her eyes, she immediately understood that she didn't want a "souvenir" at all, but a "consolation." So, he smiled and turned off the lights with the touch of a button on his holographic watch.</br>
</br>
The last light source in the mansion disappeared as the night shrouded.</br>
</br>
The bright moonlight scattered its ray on the pristine body.</br>
</br>
Sweat drenched the desk, wetted the chair, and damped the wooden floor. In this office filled with scholar atmosphere, an unfitting story began to unfold among the books...</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1140: Shipyard Completion!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
September 7th; a day worth commemorating for Future Group and the entire Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
After more than a month of hard work, Future Heavy Industries' shipyard was finally completed. Like a satellite city for Celestial City, it floated quietly in the synchronous orbit. From the distance, the entire shipyard looked like two capital "U"s.</br>
</br>
The shipyard would accommodate 10,000 workers, 20,000 construction robots, and thousands of small shuttles. With the support of giant robotic arms on both sides of the shipyard, they would produce ships with a size of more than 500,000 tons.</br>
</br>
The completion of the shipyard marked the starting point for Earth's first million-ton battleship.</br>
</br>
The groundbreaking ceremony of the first battleship of the Earth Fleet would be held simultaneously with the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the shipyard.</br>
</br>
At this moment, in the middle section of the shipyard, the invited members of the Earth Defense Alliance states formed into a semi-arc. In the middle of the crowd, an old man in a fancy suit stood in front of a giant steel plate.</br>
</br>
"...may God bless us with His glory and give us a victory..."</br>
</br>
The bishop holding the cross, in a sad, sorrowful voice with his poetic tone, mourned unknown verses. He made a cross with his finger on the cold steel.</br>
</br>
This piece of steel that was "blessed" would be loaded with the ship that is about to begin construction.</br>
</br>
When the blessing ended, there was applause.</br>
</br>
The steel plate was then carried away. Another old man in a robe came forward holding a cross with three horizontal crossbeams and repeated the previous ceremony...</br>
</br>
Religious people were invited to participate in the shipyard ribbon cutting and to give their blessings to the battleship of the Earth Fleet, mainly to meet the requirements of certain countries. Frankberg first proposed the idea in the name of its people and asked the Catholic pastor to bless the battleship.</br>
</br>
Russia was a bit unhappy when they heard the proposal. Why do Catholics get to bless the Earth Fleet and not the Eastern Orthodox Church! Without the Eastern Orthodox Church, how would history be written? The Earth Fleet defeated the powerful extraterrestrial civilization under the blessing of God from the West?</br>
</br>
This will become gloating material for the next hundred years!</br>
</br>
Hua respected their opinions and just expressed their concern to avoid extravagance...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw the conflicting opinions between the two major member states, he quickly mediated, saying that with so many steel plates on the battleship, there was no point fighting over a single one! Since everyone expressed their desire, why don't we do it together!</br>
</br>
Fortunately, with the secularization of the world, all the religions agreed to send their blessings together.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance Committee then voted to pass a regulation that, as long as the member states apply, all member states were permitted to send blessings with the religion of their choice on the first battleship. As for how history would be written, it would be based on their preference.</br>
</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this, the religious ceremony took place as part of the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind the presence of the religious leaders that sent their blessings as long as they didn't leave engravings that stated their visit at his shipyard. Xin advocates for atheism and allows for the freedom of religion. Jiang Chen himself is a complete atheist that is neither a sincere heart nor in awe of a spiritual figure.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen half-heartily applauded and thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
God can't save the Earth civilization, but I can. You should worship me rather than God...</br>
</br>
The ribbon-cutting ceremony soon came to an end.</br>
</br>
As the executive director of the Earth Defense Alliance, Jiang Chen stood in front of everyone, read the remarks from the executive and the goals of the Earth before concluding the entire ceremony.</br>
</br>
In the middle of thunderous applause, Jiang Chen nodded to the camera with a smile, walked down the temporary stage, and let out a long sigh in his mind.</br>
</br>
This is finally done!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"TS Seagull will enter the Moon orbit in five minutes. Please return to your seats as soon as possible..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his eyes, slightly turned his face, and his eyes met with a pair of bright eyes.</br>
</br>
"You're awake?"</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen, who has just woken up, Xia Shiyu's aloof state melted into a blooming smile. Xia Shiyu was already up half an hour ago. Because she had nothing to do, she stared at Jiang Chen out of boredom, and half an hour quickly passed.</br>
</br>
With sleepy eyes, Jiang Chen yawned, sat up, and stretched, then he looked out the window.</br>
</br>
"We're already here?"</br>
</br>
"The crew said there is still ten minutes..." Xia Shiyu looked at the Moon near the window, as she felt her fantasy came true. "This is my first time being so close to the Moon."</br>
</br>
"You'll be even closer in a bit, and you will eventually stand on it," Jiang Chen teased.</br>
</br>
Because they were in first class, only the two of them sat in the compartment. However, the entire passenger compartment consisted of two thousand passengers. The normal cabin was still relatively tight.</br>
</br>
Yesterday, after attending the party succeeding the ribbon-cutting ceremony, he and Xia Shiyu rushed onto the flight to the Moon.</br>
</br>
Four seagull-class transport ships served Celestial Trade. One of which operated the route between Mars and Earth and another operated for the Space Defense Forces. Only two flights operated each day between Celestial City and Lunar City. If they missed it, they would have to wait another twelve hours.</br>
</br>
After a total of ten hours, TS Seagull finally entered Moon's orbit.</br>
</br>
The entire Lunar City resembled a bright silver medal from this position, embedded in the center of a large crater. Although it was not the first time Jiang Chen saw the panoramic view of the city, it was his first time witnessing this spectacular scene with his own eyes.</br>
</br>
If he sat in the regular cabin, he would definitely hear the marvel of passengers.</br>
</br>
Of course, he would be marveled by the passengers as well.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyes were filled with amazement as she gazed out the window.</br>
</br>
As their line of sight gradually moved from the colony to space, she suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"Why don't we build a space elevator on the Moon?"</br>
</br>
"Because the Moon has no synchronous orbit," At the colony apporached closer and closer, Jiang Chen smiled, "But it's a good idea to build an elevator that leads to the orbit. It's only 200 kilometers, only one hundred and eighth of Earth's synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
The Moon's gravity was only one-sixth of the Earth's, and the "moon elevator" would require far less cable strength than the "space elevator". Even the high-strength, high-heat-resistance composite fiber called "Zylong" could be used as a material for the "moon elevator".</br>
</br>
The company that designed Zylong had requested countless times for Jiang Chen to contract out the moon elevator project for Lunar City to them. However, Jiang Chen completely disregarded their request.</br>
</br>
This is Future Heavy Industries' job, not yours.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's words reminded him of this as he became deep in thought. After he arrived in Lunar City, he should take a close look at the port cargo throughput and the floating population. If necessary, he would ask Kelvin to establish a project to build the moon elevator.</br>
</br>
The gravity of the Moon itself was minimal compared to Earth and because the lack of atmosphere, even without a synchronous orbit, the spacecraft won't have much trouble landing on the Moon's surface. An aircraft with a capacity of fewer than 100,000 tons could directly land on the surface. A transport ship with a carrying capacity of more than 100,000 tons could directly drop its cargo.</br>
</br>
That's right, just drop its cargo.</br>
</br>
After the rectangular cargo cabin separate from TS Seagull, two small propulsion jets would reduce the speed as the cargo lands. Four cabins dropped onto the surface; there was only one passenger cabin while the other three were cargo cabins.</br>
</br>
The passenger cabin landed steadily on the airport strip. An enclosed escalator with a length of around ten meters and a width of two meters extended to a rectangular transfer station next to the airport. As the signal light illuminated, the passengers loaded onto the escalator and moved towards the transfer station.</br>
</br>
From there, an underground tunnel directly connected the passengers to a light rail track that was destined for Lunar City two kilometers away.</br>
</br>
It was many people's first time visiting the Moon. When they were on the escalator, they peaked excitedly at their surroundings. They took out their phones, took photos and videos, and shouted at the craters. The tour guides of the tour groups held their flags calmly, reminding everyone to tie on the magnetic belts and follow the group.</br>
</br>
The floor of Lunar City was made of alloy steel. When disembarking from the transport ship, everyone received a magnetic belt. For people yet to master the essence of moonwalking, the most sensible choice would be to remain on the ground.</br>
</br>
When all the passengers disembarked, Jiang Chen took Xia Shiyu's hands and took her to the transfer station.</br>
</br>
As the owner of the city, he certainly wouldn't squeeze onto the light rail. As soon as he sat on the Seagull, a lunar rover had stopped at the transfer station, waiting for his arrival</br>
</br>
On this lunar rover the size of an armored vehicle, Jiang Chen saw the former Lunar Colony Chief, now the mayor of Lunar City, Tang Weijie, and several other senior executives of the city.</br>
</br>
"Welcome to the Moon, President Jiang and CEO Xia..."</br>
</br>
Tang Weijie respectfully bowed and politely greeted.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1141: Moon Specialties</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The lunar rover moved smoothly on the crater-filled Moon surface. After it passed through a tunnel on a slope, it entered the interior of a mountain and Jiang Chen's vision suddenly cleared up. A silver-white city silhouette appeared in front of him.</br>
</br>
"The Lunar Colony is in the front. Of course, it has now been renamed to Downtown of Lunar City. All the municipal buildings will be built around the downtown square. The surface is only a small part of the city. Once you're underground, it will be even more shocking." Beside the window of the lunar rover, Tang Weijie pointed to the silver-white outline outside the window as he chatted with Jiang Chen. "We have prepared a welcoming ceremony for you and CEO Xia."</br>
</br>
"I hope it won't be too much trouble." Jiang Chen smiled and looked at the entrance of Lunar City outside the window.</br>
</br>
"Haha, believe me, it is definitely not."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had never been a fan of been fixated on small details. Compared with flattering and sucking up on the surface, he preferred to see tangible results. The experience of living in Hua in the early years made him well aware of the low efficiency of a bureaucratic system.</br>
</br>
The advanced technology products didn't please him the most, but rather, the vitality and energy of a start-up even inside this massive company. Future Group's innovation was not corroded by the management's thinking.</br>
</br>
The culture at the top determined the performance on the bottom.</br>
</br>
Tang Hanjie, the mayor of Lunar City, knew the style of his boss, so when he was preparing the welcoming ceremony, he made it grand but not too long.</br>
</br>
After the welcoming ceremony on the colonial square, Tang Hanjie personally acted as the guide for the duo. He took the duo to the elevator next to the square.</br>
</br>
Once they were on the elevator, they descended about 500 meters.</br>
</br>
When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, a fresh and dry gust of air blew onto their faces.</br>
</br>
Outside the elevator was a circular hall with more than 30 identical elevators inside. Here, the elevators served a similar purpose as a subway station on Earth, connecting the underground living space with the mining stations and factories on the surface.</br>
</br>
The circular hall was bustling with people, from those in Celestial Trade uniforms to passengers in all kinds of outfits. Tang Weijie took Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu to the special tunnel on the side, and directly entered the underground city.</br>
</br>
"This place used to be an underground glacier. Later, after the ice layer was mined, we found a lava tunnel formed by the ancient magma activity below the ice. The surrounding rock is a glassy black volcanic rock, which is even stronger than concrete, so we decided to seal the space with aluminum and transform it into the colony's living space."</br>
</br>
"The temperature difference on the surface of the Moon is high, but the underground temperature is stabilized at around 25 degrees Celsius, and it can also effectively reduce the impact of harmful rays and meteorites. A total of more than 27,000 people now live here and the elevator has become the main form of transformation in the city."</br>
</br>
</br>
Tang Weijie described the city's changes to Jiang Chen as they moved forward.</br>
</br>
Although the city was built under his inspiration, when he finally stood in the city, he still felt moved by its magnificence.</br>
</br>
No one had thought that the small colony with only 200 colonists would expand to this size in the span of a year.</br>
</br>
"Only half of the city is developed, and the other half is still being built. Later, we will use the lava tunnel of the extinct volcano to double the area of the volcano cave. By that time, the city will easily fit over 100,000 people." Looking at his boss's touched expression, Tang Weijie was proud.</br>
</br>
As they continued to tour the city, Xia Shiyu looked around and gently pulled on Jiang Chen's sleeve. She whispered.</br>
</br>
"Is there water here? I'm a little thirsty."</br>
</br>
The assistant behind Tang Weijie immediately stepped forward and took out two new stainless-steel cups from her bag, she smiled and handed them to the two.</br>
</br>
"This is one of the specialties of the Moon, Moon Brand Functional Beverage." Tang Weijie took the opportunity to introduce the product to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"There shouldn't be any Moon soils inside right?" Xia Shiyu joked.</br>
</br>
"Haha." The assistant lady chuckled.</br>
</br>
"What is this? It doesn't feel like plastic." Jiang Chen examined the bottle.</br>
</br>
"A new type of PVC material. It is an anti-rust, lightweight steel that weighs only 1.2 times that of plastic with the same volume. Its surface material has a germicidal effect similar to that of activated carbon. The most important thing is that the production of steel on the Moon is much cheaper than plastic. Right, this is the work of the Material Science Lab," Tang Weijie explained.</br>
</br>
"Really? I didn't expect this small cup to have such a long story." Jiang Chen smiled, unscrewed the lid, and sucked on the straw.</br>
</br>
It tasted a bit strange. It tasted like herbal tea, but much sweeter than herbal tea. Jiang Chen felt energetic after he took a sip, he felt even better than after drinking coffee or Red Bull.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the end of the corridor, Tang Weijie led them through an arch door. They passed through the air shower and entered a factory.</br>
</br>
Rows of culture racks stood in the factory and were distributed on the factory floor. Dozens of culture tanks were placed on each culture rack, and ultraviolet lamps were mounted on the top. Through the glass wall, Jiang Chen saw the seedlings growing prosperously.</br>
</br>
"Is this a farm?" Jiang Chen looked at the nearest culture tank.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but this farm mainly produces cash crops, or the raw materials of this drink, such as potatoes, radishes, and pumpkins." Tang Weijie walked to Jiang Chen and pointed, "Ninety percent of the food in Lunar City is imported from Celestial City. It's not technologically difficult to farm on the Moon, just other factors make it almost impossible."</br>
</br>
At first, the farms were all built on the surface of the Moon. However, due to the cosmic ray, even with lead plates installed as covers, the crops would still mutate during its germination stage.</br>
</br>
Later, it was discovered that the soil on the Moon effectively absorbed harmful cosmic rays and solar wind particles. Therefore, they simply moved the farm underground, leaving only one small plantation used for breeding selection. Other infrastructures on the surface were mines and factories.</br>
</br>
"What is the daily average traffic volume in Lunar City?" Jiang Chen reached out and touched the sprouts of the potato seedlings in the culture tank.</br>
</br>
"The average daily passenger throughput was 3,417 last month," Tang Weijie immediately replied.</br>
</br>
"What about cargo throughput?"</br>
</br>
"The cargo throughput last month exceeded 900,000 tons!"</br>
</br>
This figure would likely exceed ten million tons annually considering the continuous expansion of rare earth production in 2019.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did the math in his head, and after a moment of indulging, he smiled at Tang Weijie.</br>
</br>
"I plan to build a 200-kilometer elevator in Lunar City. I want to hear your opinion."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1142: The concept of Moon Elevator</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A moon elevator?</br>
</br>
When Tang Weijie heard Jiang Chen's proposal, he first took a moment to digest this information, then joy was his immediate reaction.</br>
</br>
"A moon elevator? I don't have any opinions. It'll be great for Lunar City! I have discussed this with people from several other departments a few days ago. If it is possible to connect the surface with the orbit with an elevator, the cargo handling efficiency of the city will at least double!"</br>
</br>
Even without the efficiency gain, an elevator would save a countless amount of energy.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries already accumulated a wealth of experience in the construction of Celestial City. The construction of the elevator only 200 kilometers long could easily be completely even without the wreckage from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
After the tour, Jiang Chen strolled around the underground city while he discussed the construction of the moon elevator with Tang Weijie.</br>
</br>
The elevator's specifications would not need to be as large as the one on Earth. Even living spaces could be omitted. Only four rotating counterweights would be needed at the end with space for docking. The Moon still had a countless amount of space for development, so development in space wouldn't be necessary.</br>
</br>
What's more, because there was no synchronous orbit, the elevator couldn't rely on the inertial force to maintain its balance. Hence, a project too large would drive up the cost. For Lunar City, with the goal to save costs, it would not be worth the trouble.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the first day of the visit, the group took the elevator back to the surface. With Tang Weijie leading, Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu went to the hotel.</br>
</br>
Although living spaces in the city were mostly concentrated underground, this was only the case for the average citizen.</br>
</br>
After all, a trip to the Moon was difficult and rare. If it were possible, no one wants to live in a narrow "tunnel" and stare at a cold ceiling.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this, as well as the high maintenance cost of the building on the surface, that the land price on the surface of the city was comparable to gold prices. Only the millionaires could afford to live inside a hotel on the surface. And those independent houses with lunar rovers, garages, and saunas were reserved for the wealthiest individuals.</br>
</br>
As for private properties...</br>
</br>
Sorry, there were no plans for building residential areas in Lunar City. All the properties for sale were underground at a depth of 500 meters and the price was often too high. The most peculiar thing was that… there was no supply even with at such outrageous prices.</br>
</br>
Inside the steaming bath, Jiang Chen was enjoying a bath on the Moon while gazing at the distant blue planet, letting his mind drift off.</br>
</br>
Bathing didn't feel too different on the Moon. How much of his body is exposed is only dependent on the difference between body density and water density; it has nothing to do with gravity.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen was zoned out, he heard clothes being taken off.</br>
</br>
The clothes were placed in a basket and gentle steps were heard on the tiles. With the footsteps gradually approaching, a smile formed on Jiang Chen's face. And soon through the mist, a smooth foot tapped on the surface of the water.</br>
</br>
"It's not hot, just come in," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's face turned into the color of a ripped apple. She quickly sat in, covered her chest. She looked at Jiang Chen sitting across from her, biting her lips, and then whispered.</br>
</br>
"I thought you were already asleep."</br>
</br>
"Almost fell asleep," Jiang Chen smirked. "Now I can't sleep at all. How do you plan to compensate me?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu rolled her eyes as she saw the sly written on his face.</br>
</br>
After she hesitated for a moment, she finally overcame her shame and obeyed her heart. She slowly moved her thighs and sat closer to Jiang Chen. The moment she pressed her face against his chest, she felt as if her pounding heart was about to escape her body.</br>
</br>
It took a while before her pumping heart gradually calmed down.</br>
</br>
A meteorite pierced through space and landed not far away from their window.</br>
</br>
Holding Xia Shiyu's slender shoulder and gazing at the dust floating outside due to the meteorite's impact, Jiang Chen was emotional.</br>
</br>
"Only if I could move the Holy Shield."</br>
</br>
"The Holy Shield?" Xia Shiyu moved her head and did not understand.</br>
</br>
"Accurately speaking, it's called the Holy Shield System. There were some important cities in the apocalypse such as Wanghai and Shangjing projected by this system. It is like the shield outside a spacecraft in sci-fi movies. Pan-Asia Cooperation was invested in defensive technology, but so far, the scientists that I have raised have not been able to fully understand the technology." Jiang Chen sighed with regret.</br>
</br>
Perhaps she was teased by a particular word but Xia Shiyu began to giggle. She buried her face against Jiang Chen's shoulder as she began to shake.</br>
</br>
"Raising scientists... hahaha..."</br>
</br>
Hey, this is not that funny...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a helpless expression on his face as he watched how difficult it was for Xia Shiyu to contain her laughter</br>
</br>
"I'm raising them. When I pay them their salary each month, I always ask if they want money or food. However, they usually don't say anything. Instead, they just pick up the bag of rice and the box of canned meat and then go home happily."</br>
</br>
With Project Garden of Eden, even survivors in slums occasionally enjoyed delicate flour food, but food remained one of the most heavily sought-after commodities on the wasteland. Even with the occasional depreciation of the credit, the amount of food consumed rarely changed.</br>
</br>
It was better to sell the extra food at the Sixth Street than to directly accept credits as a salary.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After he soaked for more than an hour, Jiang Chen's exhaustion disappeared.</br>
</br>
He took a long time in the change room before coming out while stretching.</br>
</br>
It was 7:00 at night in Xin and there was a banquet waiting for him.</br>
</br>
Entrepreneurs with a total investment of more than 1 billion New Xin dollars in Lunar City would be present, as well as top figures of the city. The purposes of this banquet were to celebrate the permanent population of Lunar City reaching more than 30,000, then to celebrate the construction of the first battleship of the Earth Fleet, and lastly to welcome "Lord" Jiang Chen's visit to the city.</br>
</br>
No doubt, the last reason was the most important one.</br>
</br>
For those capitalists chasing behind Celestial Trade, Jiang Chen's existence could be compared to a breathing gold mine. The capitalists would be extremely satisfied to have a chat or a drink with him to make this trip worthwhile.</br>
</br>
If he casually pointed to a direction on the Moon, revealing the next area of expansion of the city, the move alone would create a few millionaires.</br>
</br>
Naturally, when he walked into the banquet hall with Xia Shiyu, they immediately became the focus of the entire banquet...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1143: An Unexpected Gues</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"This is my business card and please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the chairman of the Siberian Mining Company and the Russian Asteroid Mining Company. It's an honor to meet you..." An old man in a tuxedo politely handed Jiang Chen his business card with both hands, then warmly shook hands with him.</br>
</br>
"Are, are you really Jiang Chen? Ah, sorry, because my idol is standing in front of me, I'm a little shaken by the excitement. Are you free tonight? Do you want to have a drink together?" A blonde celebrity in a low-cut evening dress looked at Jiang Chen seductively, completely disregarding the warning smile Jiang Chen's date was giving her.</br>
</br>
"Please allow me to have a toast with you, the executive of the Earth Defense Alliance, the commander of the Earth Fleet, the hero of human civilization..." A Hua entrepreneur smiled, revealing his shining white teeth. He then raised the champagne glass in his hand. "I wish you victorious and that you bring victory and glory back to the place we call home."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Melodious music changed the mood in the banquet hall and saved Jiang Chen from the enshrinement of flattery.</br>
</br>
The male and female guests all put down the glass in their hands and joined hands together to enter the middle of the hall. Tang Weijie and his wife led the banquet to the next stage.</br>
</br>
"This glass is really interesting. Is it magnetic underneath?"</br>
</br>
Because he didn't know how to dance, Jiang Chen took Xia Shiyu's hand and walked to the resting area. After he drank the red wine in the glass, he turned the glass over to examine the bottom of the cup and felt that it was metallic.</br>
</br>
To prevent the wine glass from flying around in a low-gravity environment, a magnet must have been installed under the long table covered with red cloth. Not just wine glasses, but also the trays that hold food.</br>
</br>
Although life on the Moon was full of inconveniences, the creativity of people was unlimited. From the smooth and elegant moves on the dance floor, everyone was enjoying the party.</br>
</br>
"Did you like the banquet?"</br>
</br>
At the end of the banquet, Tang Weijie, holding a glass of wine, brought his wife to greet Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I enjoyed it. I'm m so relieved to see how relaxing the life of Lunar City's citizens is." Jiang Chen clinked his glass with Tang Weijie.</br>
</br>
Tang Weijie's wife looked young; probably about twenty years old. From her reserved and elegant temperament, she should come from an influential family. It didn't take her long to start a conversation with Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
After the men began to talk about business, she and Xia Shiyu went to the side and began chatting about topics reserved only for women.</br>
</br>
"I wouldn't say relaxing," Tang Weijie laughed, sipped the wine, and humbly said. "I think it's exploring a lifestyle that suits us. I remember when I first came here, we stayed in the gravity room all day after we completed our tasks. Before the underground city was built, there was really no entertainment on this barren land."</br>
</br>
</br>
"It must have been hard." Jiang Chen raised his glass. "I will remember your contribution."</br>
</br>
"Not at all. It's my duty, not a contribution," Tang Weijie responded modestly.</br>
</br>
"Lunar City's model can be applied to other colonies, such as the Mars Colony, and the Himalia (1) in the near future. You have provided a template for the space colonization plan of Celestial Trade, how is this not a contribution? Modesty can be boring." Jiang Chen patted Tang Weijie's shoulder as he put down the wine glass.</br>
</br>
Just as the two of them chatted, an older man in a tuxedo entered the banquet hall quite late. He searched around the room before his eyes lit up and he walked toward his target.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen and Tang Weijie chatted about the colony, he saw a familiar face.</br>
</br>
Before he could speak, the man smiled and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"We met again, Mr. Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
It was when the man shook hands with Jiang Chen did he finally remember he had seen this face. However, to be truthful, after so long, he almost forgot about him.</br>
</br>
"You are... Mr. Loki?"</br>
</br>
"It seems that you haven't forgotten me," Loki said jokingly and didn't seem to mind that Jiang Chen didn't recognize him.</br>
</br>
It was quite amazing for Jiang Chen to remember him considering that he was a behind-the-scenes person who rarely appears in front of the public. People also have difficulty recognizing people of different races.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was ready to introduce himself again.</br>
</br>
"...but why are you here?" Jiang Chen was surprised by his visit, frowning slightly. "I mean, shouldn't you be in B City now? How are you..."</br>
</br>
"Precisely speaking, I was in Celestial City eleven hours ago. As a result, when I was planning to meet with you, I learned that you have left. Very coincidentally, there was one final flight leaving for Lunar City, so I came here." Loki laughed. "Our consortium has invested in a rare earth mining company in Lunar City, otherwise I would have to worry about how to get an invitation."</br>
</br>
"Right? What a coincidence," Jiang Chen said without much fluctuation in his emotion.</br>
</br>
The B City Consortium then must have a prophet. A flight happened to leave Lunar City, and he managed to obtain a ticket in such a quick span of time? Although it is not tourist season, buying a ticket wasn't that easy?</br>
</br>
The ticket must have been bought a few days in advance.</br>
</br>
"It seems that you two have something to talk about. Now, if I may excuse myself." Seeing that he wasn't needed in their conversation, Tang Weijie understandingly left with his wife.</br>
</br>
As Loki watched Tang Weijie leave, he smiled. Then he looked at Jiang Chen again and said politely.</br>
</br>
"Is it convenient to step out for a moment?"</br>
</br>
"It's not a gentleman's move to leave your date alone at the banquet. Mr. Loki, what do you think?"</br>
</br>
Loki heard the subtle refusal in Jiang Chen's tone as he raised his eyebrow.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen and just wanted to tell him that she would not mind, but Jiang Chen stopped her with the look in his eyes.</br>
</br>
When the Rothschild family existed, he did not like the "WASP" on Wall Street.</br>
</br>
The two sides formed an alliance long ago against the Freemasonry led by the Rothschild family. However, the capitalists of Wall Streets are cunning and clever. When Celestial Trade and the Freemasonry clashed, they didn't contribute any effort but took the opportunity to benefit.</br>
</br>
After the fall of the Rothschild family, several WASP consortia such as Morgan and Rockefeller immediately began to snatch up assets from the fallen giant. They took the two most prized possessions – the Brazilian Vale and the BHP Mining Group.</br>
</br>
These spoils should have belonged to Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Under such circumstances, it would be odd if Jiang Chen treated them with respect.</br>
</br>
Loki didn't seem to be surprised by Jiang Chen's aloof attitude. He smiled, took a sip of his wine, and sighed.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Even if I want to talk about the CIB?"</br>
</br>
(1) Himalia - Himalia, or Jupiter VI, is the largest irregular satellite of Jupiter. It is the fifth largest Jovian satellite, after the four Galilean moons.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1144: There is No Permanent Alliance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After Loki said this, Jiang Chen finally understood why he chose to meet him at this place.</br>
</br>
Indeed, it was absolutely safe here.</br>
</br>
Due to the distance, the communication channel between the Moon and Earth was completely under Celestial Trade's control. He didn't need to worry about the CIB's presence. Although Jiang Chen felt that he was being overly cautious, Loki still insisted that it was necessary.</br>
</br>
After the banquet, Xia Shiyu went back to the hotel and Jiang Chen went to the lounge next to the banquet hall with Loki.</br>
</br>
After they sat down, Loki took out the cigar box from his suit pocket, pulled out a cigar and put it in his mouth. He was just about to take out his lighter when he suddenly stopped and looked to Jiang Chen, "Do you mind?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Grinning, Loki grabbed the cigar cutter and skillfully cut the cigar head. After he lit the cigar on fire, he blew out a ring, fully satisfied. He raised his eyebrow and offered, "Do you want one?"</br>
</br>
"I'll pass." Jiang Chen shook his head, leaned backed on the chair, and then looked at the old man enjoying himself. "Let's get to the point—"</br>
</br>
"Kerry is preparing to participate in the 2020 election," Loki said nonchalantly as he also leaned back into his chair.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took three seconds to digest his sentence and then raised his eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"So?"</br>
</br>
"It seems that you aren't informed of the intelligence from the Capitol." Loki grinned and shrugged. Through the smoke clouds, his eyes were filled with mysteriousness, "Do you know who is supporting Kerry?"</br>
</br>
"Who else other than Wall Street?" Jiang Chen laughed. "This question is just as boring as asking why Zhang Yaping can be re-elected year after year."</br>
</br>
"No, no, no," Loki swayed the cigar between his fingers. "There are a lot of companies on Wall Street. You can't consider Wall Street as a whole. My question is, who do you think is the main supporter behind Kerry?"</br>
</br>
You can't consider Wall Street as a whole.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes flickered as he carefully pondered the meaning behind this sentence.</br>
</br>
Loki looked at the silent Jiang Chen and didn't seem to be in a hurry. He continued to enjoy his cigar, waiting for Jiang Chen's answer with the same mysterious grin on his face.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted another five minutes before Jiang Chen spoke up.</br>
</br>
"Obviously, you can tell me."</br>
</br>
"Yes, I can tell you." Loki straightened his back, extended his finger and wrote on the table. After Jiang Chen looked over, it was an uppercase "M".</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned as he looked at the movement of his hand,</br>
</br>
"...Morgan?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not surprised by Wall Street's manipulation of the election since it didn't just happen once or twice. The existence of K Street and political contributions exist exactly because of this. As for why Kerry decided to run for the election, Morgan's decision to invest, while he was somewhat surprised, it was nothing astonishing.</br>
</br>
</br>
What surprised him was that Loki told him all these things.</br>
</br>
"Yes. I can tell you, Kerry has already got the CIB on board," Loki leaned back against the chair again, crossed his fingers over his knees, and then continued. "The FBA is investigating members of Congress, and the CIB is closely watching the FBA. It's interesting, isn't it? I bet that the 2020 election will be the most exciting one in history."</br>
</br>
"The most interesting thing is that you gave this information to someone who is not friendly with the UA." Jiang Chen's smile seemed to be embedded with a deeper message. He looked at Loki with intrigue, "Can you tell me why you are doing this?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, you and I are all businessmen. Do you think that nationality is something very important to us? If you really care about such an identity, you wouldn't have created a new one for yourself."</br>
</br>
As Loki explained, he took out a photo from his suit pocket and threw it on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the photo and was just about to ask when Loki began to explain.</br>
</br>
"Joseph Kennedy."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Except for the surname Kennedy, I have never heard of someone named Joseph."</br>
</br>
"Why does that matter? Many successful candidates were unknown to the masses before they took part in the election." Shrugging, Loki blew out another smoke ring. "The election is like a horse race. You have to find a prospective candidate with potential and as long as we are willing to bet on them, there is always a chance. For example, the dark horse in 2008, who knew about him before 2007?"</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then why do you think I will participate in your gambling?" Jiang Chen laughed. "To put it blatantly, these are your issues."</br>
</br>
"Because I will give you enough benefits," Loki stared into Jiang Chen's eyes. "If Kennedy is elected, we can consider giving you Nippon, or even join the Earth Defense Alliance."</br>
</br>
"I have to say, this proposal is really attractive, but your credit history is not convincing," Jiang Chen looked at Loki with a sly smile. "To be honest, I don't trust you. What can do you do to make me believe that you will fulfill your promise? There are only a handful of people in the world that can guarantee a 50% chance in any election. If you can't even guarantee it for yourself, how can you guarantee it for me?"</br>
</br>
When Loki heard Jiang Chen's words, he smiled and took the photo back.</br>
</br>
"Let's not worry about Mr. Kennedy for now. Have you considered the consequences of Kerry being elected?"</br>
</br>
"Do you think Celestial Trade is still the Celestial Trade two years ago?" Jiang Chen spread his hands, "Even if Roosevelt climbed out of his grave, do you think I would care?"</br>
</br>
More than two years ago, in order to open up the desalination market in the Middle East, High Tech Freshwater was forced to go public on NASDAQ to reduce the UA's vigilance. At that time, Celestial Trade was just like an ant in front of the UA. Any of the free world's aircraft carrier battle groups could give the Pannu people democracy.</br>
</br>
However, now, even if the UA sent all of its aircraft carrier battle groups to the Western Pacific Ocean, at most, it would be a lose-lose situation for Celestial Trade. Even if Kerry does get elected, what could he do?</br>
</br>
"Well, I believe that you are strong enough to ignore the military power of the entire NATO," Loki shrugged and stretched out the hand holding the cigar. "But now there are better choices in front of us, why don't you consider it? Mr. Kennedy will put more emphasis on the space industry than all previous presidents, advocate for erasing the prejudice between the two countries, abandon the new Cold War mentality, and fight against the extraterrestrial civilization... everything I'm talking about will be included in his speech. These are not empty promises."</br>
</br>
After Loki said all this, he pressed his hands against the armrests and slowly stood up. He threw the burnt cigar into the ashtray and looked at his watch.</br>
</br>
"I will stay here for two more days. I hope that you can seriously consider our offer. If we join hands, we may be able to avoid an unnecessary war."</br>
</br>
After that, Loki walked to the door.</br>
</br>
"There is still a question that I don't quite understand," Jiang Chen watched as Loki head to the door, and abruptly said. "Aren't you part of WASP?"</br>
</br>
Loki let go of the door handle, turned around, and said in a ridiculing tone.</br>
</br>
"When Mr. Rothschild was still alive, weren't we all allies in the same trench?"</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"...we are facing the worst depression since 2008. However, our president doesn't seem to be aware of this. Or rather, she has noticed the problem, but she hasn't been treating this problem with seriousness. Enterprises and families are facing a credit crunch, our pension and wallet are shrinking, wages have fallen to their lowest point since the 2008 economic crisis, yet our cost of living has reached the highest its been in history!"</br>
</br>
"Look at what our president has done for us. In order to let us temporarily forget about the pain of not being able to repay our credit card, she stressed that she would return to the Asia-Pacific region, escalate regional disputes, divert our attention, and even send the aircraft battle group for a stroll in the West Pacific Ocean... The result was that she fooled no one but herself, and almost pushed our country to the brink of a world war."</br>
</br>
"Maybe she thinks our life is not miserable enough. I heard that she is now discussing with her cabinet about restricting the import of medical drones. My only suggestion is to spend more time with the cute little angels, maybe they will be taken away by the FBA tomorrow, and no drones will ever fly into the window to save you. Thank goodness, we will return to the era of calling to make an appointment with the doctor. Perhaps this will save us a lot of money. After all, in that era, we didn't take medicine when we had a fever..."</br>
</br>
In the holographic screen, the man in the suit stood in the middle of the supporters and had a bright smile on his face. Unlike the aggressive speech, he was not speaking at a fast pace, he could even be described as gentle, but the words he said were as sharp as the best knife.</br>
</br>
From the art of this speech alone, Mr. Kennedy was indeed worthy of his name.</br>
</br>
"What are you watching?" Xia Shiyu slipped into the blanket, held her chin up with her hands, and lied beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Joseph Kennedy's declaration for the presidential election." Jiang Chen dragged the holographic screen toward Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"Kennedy?" Xia Shiyu was surprised and confused by the name, "The fabled Kennedy?</br>
</br>
"Yes, the cursed name," Jiang Chen looked at the man who waved to his supporters on the holographic screen; a sly smile suddenly formed on this face. "What do you think if I pushed this cursed man onto the president's throne, will it be interesting?"</br>
</br>
"As if you have a cote." Xia Shiyu rolled her eyes, turned around, and muttered, "you can keep watching, I'm going to sleep first."</br>
</br>
"Hey, wife, it's not good to sleep so early." Jiang Chen sent a message to the Ghost Agents, turned off the screen, and extended his arm to surround her smooth shoulder. As he looked at the earlobe that gradually turn red, he whispered into her ear. "Didn't we agree that we were going to continue what we didn't finish in the bathroom."</br>
</br>
The redness extended all the way to her neck, the word "wife" poked into her soft spot as Xia Shiyu turned soft.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although she knew that the word didn't just apply to her, at least for now, even if it was only now, he only held her...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
If the nightmare of long-distance travel was jet lag, then the nightmare of a trip to the Moon was never knowing if the time difference was right. Of course, compared to the stunning view of the trip, this nightmare was only a small inconvenience.</br>
</br>
A day on the Moon was equivalent to 27.3 Earth days and a day and night were two weeks long. Looking at the Sun that just rose into the sky, Jiang Chen yawned and wondered if he should create a new calendar for Celestial Trade's colonies.</br>
</br>
For example, all Celestial Trade colonies, regardless of the orbital period, must use the Earth calendar and Xin time zone. Or adopt a double-time format…</br>
</br>
Today, he must make a trip 100 kilometers north of Lunar City.</br>
</br>
After a one-and-a-half-month training period on Coro Island, the recruits of the Earth Defense Alliance arrived on the Moon by transport ships. Half of the three-months training period passed, and the remaining one and a half months would be spent on the Moon for low gravity environment adaptation training.</br>
</br>
Although without any weapons, these volunteer soldiers were also combatants, and certainly couldn't be stationed in Lunar City.</br>
</br>
In order to house the future officers of the Earth Fleet, Celestial Trade built a military base to be used as the training facility.</br>
</br>
The military base on the Moon was not completed until a month ago. At present, in addition to the 500 volunteer soldiers in the military base, another 1,000 reserve crew members were also stationed here.</br>
</br>
The purpose of Jiang Chen's trip was to greet the future officers of the Earth Fleet while he inspected the military base.</br>
</br>
Simply put, a military parade.</br>
</br>
The tires lifted the Moondust. Jiang Chen gazed at the unchanged crater outside the window and yawned in boredom. At first, he thought the scenery on the Moon was very fascinating, now, he was already bored of it.</br>
</br>
Two hours passed since departure.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu sat next to him. She was also bored with the same scenery outside and began to inspect the inside of the car. When her eyes stopped on the thermometer on the armrest of the seat, she gasped in shock.</br>
</br>
"It is already 90 degrees outside?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled at Xia Shiyu's reaction.</br>
</br>
"It's not that bad. This is not the hottest time of the day. At noon, the surface temperature on the equator line can reach 127 degrees."</br>
</br>
"That hot?!"</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Why else do you think the building of Lunar City is painted white?"</br>
</br>
"...I thought it was for appearances." Xia Shiyu blushed, then she whispered, "If we get off the vehicle, we'll be roasted."</br>
</br>
The term "roasted" almost made Jiang Chen laugh out loud.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect this unserious term to come out of Xia Shiyu's mouth.</br>
</br>
"127 degrees is the surface temperature," looking at Xia Shiyu's boots, Jiang Chen said, "As long as you don't lose your boots, you don't have to worry."</br>
</br>
Of course, they still must change into professional gear before they exit the vehicle.</br>
</br>
The three-hour drive was finally over, and the lunar rover parked outside the military base.</br>
</br>
In the locker room inside the rover, Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu changed into heavy spacesuits. After confirming the spacesuit's functionality, under the guidance of the staff, they entered through the hatch and stepped onto the surface of the Moon.</br>
</br>
The moment when Xia Shiyu feet stepped on the Moon, she seemed to have forgotten her identity as CEO and like a child, she jumped up in excitement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he watched Xia Shiyu enjoy the amazing moment.</br>
</br>
Such childish behavior was certainly a rare scene.</br>
</br>
However, as she enjoyed "flying" on the Moon, she lost control and flipped in the air. She then landed face first and rolled onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu's tragic fall and chuckled.</br>
</br>
He was not gloating, he just thought the fall was too… too cute.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hopped up and extended his legs straight to drift by her, then he grinned and pulled her up from the ground.</br>
</br>
"I told you to be careful. Now you just made fun of yourself."</br>
</br>
Although he couldn't see Xia Shiyu's face through the dark mask, based on his understanding of her, she must be blushing, biting her lower lip, and feeling embarrassed...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1146: 50 Million Dollars Compensation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The hexagonal fortress, quietly located in the middle of the small crater, was like a medal embedded into the surface. The sturdy Moon soil was its first wall, and a tunnel was carved on one side of the crater; it was the only entrance to the entire military base.</br>
</br>
The entire military base located in the crater covered a total area of ​​9,000 square meters with three floors above and below. Each floor was five-meters high, with the highest point parallel to the outer edge of the crater and the lowest point 20 meters underground. The roof was made of concrete and covered with soil about 2-3 meters thick.</br>
</br>
The wall was divided into two parts. The outer wall was 1.5 meters thick, the inner wall was 2 meters thick, and 0.7 meters of soil was sandwiched between the inner and outer walls to protect against cosmic rays, solar wind, and meteorite impact.</br>
</br>
Due to the insufficient width of the tunnel, the huge lunar rover was parked outside the military base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu did not wait for a long time before the door of the military base opened. Two officers who had spacesuits on skillfully leaped out and floated in their direction.</br>
</br>
The two officers stopped in front of Jiang Chen, saluted, then led the two into the base.</br>
</br>
The officer leading was Hou Zhengwen, a former Celestial Trade Navy frigate captain. Now, he served as a Earth Fleet reserve officer and the head of the Moon military base. When he led the group into the base, he reported to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The soldiers have gathered in the central square and are ready to be reviewed. Do you want a tour of the base first, or would you like to head to the square now?"</br>
</br>
"Let's go to the square first, we don't want to let our boys wait too long," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the outline of the entire military base as he followed closely behind.</br>
</br>
The interior of the building was designed as a partition. An air lock was built between the partitions. If the building was damaged and air leaked, the air lock can be dropped to isolate the damaged area. Those who didn't have time evacuate could enter the hibernation chambers designed on both sides of the safety tunnel to wait for rescue.</br>
</br>
This kind of design was similar to the design of Lunar City. Before the shield technology made any more advancements, this was the most feasible option.</br>
</br>
One thousand and five hundred soldiers gathered in the central square of the military base, and they were arranged in a uniform square.</br>
</br>
The elites from all member states were indeed better than the reserve of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen did military training in school, he always thought that even with the best posture, a bullet was the same to everyone. However, now he wholehearted felt that a good posture was the most intuitive embodiment of a soldier.</br>
</br>
Even with only one-sixth of the gravity, these soldiers were as steady as sculptures. Just this alone was enough to impress Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
The two months of training was not wasted.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen inspected the future soldiers of the Earth Fleet, it was late into the night in the Capital 400,000 kilometers away.</br>
</br>
In the center of the bustling world, a man in a suit walked quickly across the street. He stopped under a bronze streetlight, took a note out from his pocket, and confirmed the address again. He then turned into the side alley and entered an ordinary coffeeshop.</br>
</br>
He was on K street.</br>
</br>
If the eye of the storm of the 2008 Financial Crisis was Wall Street, then K Street was the ever-changing international political center.</br>
</br>
This street was home to a large number of think tanks, lobby groups, and public relations companies. International headquarters, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund were also here. There were a large number of lobbying groups and well-known lobbyists with limitless power gathered on this street and conducted political trades every day. Thus, K street was renown to all.</br>
</br>
Or infamous.</br>
</br>
"The information you want," the man took a document from his coat and threw it on the table as he took a deep breath and sat across from the woman. "All the candidates are listed on it. From their political views, to their license plate number. If you want to know the probability of winning for each person, I have a dedicated team to serve you. Of course, the payment must be calculated again—"</br>
</br>
"The payment is next to you." The woman raised her chin slightly and used her eyes to point in the direction of the money.</br>
</br>
The man paused and followed her eyes to the right-hand side of the seat. A black suitcase rested by his feet. The man grabbed the suitcase as his expression suddenly changed and he looked at the woman with strangeness.</br>
</br>
"I guess it won't be Zimbabwe..."</br>
</br>
The woman lifted her glass and gracefully sipped the red wine. After she put down the glass, she reached for the documents on the table and nonchalantly said.</br>
</br>
"You can open it."</br>
</br>
The man hesitated for a moment, then he picked up the suitcase and opened it. After he saw the green, he quickly closed the suitcase.</br>
</br>
It was enough.</br>
</br>
Not Zimbabwean dollars, nor Walmart coupons, there was at least 200,000 in dollars in the suitcase, and maybe even more.</br>
</br>
What made the man puzzled was why she chose to pay in cash.</br>
</br>
In UA, only two types of people carried so much cash.</br>
</br>
Drug dealers and fugitives.</br>
</br>
Either way, never a good person...</br>
</br>
"Okay, actually..." The man hesitated, and finally decided to continue to promote his business. "In fact, you can find these things online, other than Hill who delayed her speech for some reason, other candidates all have already finished their election speech. I mean, if you just want to figure out their license plate number, there is absolutely no need to find me. My ability is far more than that—"</br>
</br>
"Is it?" The woman looked at the document in her hand and responded nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
The man opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the customer was not interested in his ability.</br>
</br>
Just when he had given up and was ready to get up and leave. The woman who sat across of him took a piece of paper from the document and gently dropped it in front of him.</br>
</br>
"I need you to do something for me," the slender fingers tapped on the photo. "Investigate him. I need to know everything about him. The more interesting the information, the better. You know what I'm referring to."</br>
</br>
"Joseph Kennedy!" When the man recognized the man in the photo, his face suddenly changed into hesitancy.</br>
</br>
"I remember you said," the woman looked at the man, and her red lips formed a mysterious smile. "Your ability is far more than just figuring out their license plate number."</br>
</br>
"You don't know," the man showed a hint of struggle laced with a hint of fear. "The Kennedy family is part of the B City Consortium. There is so much going on behind all of this and it is so deep that it can drown anyone who dares to test their depths..."</br>
</br>
When the man said this, he suddenly noticed a faint disdain in the woman's eyes.</br>
</br>
Yes, it was disdain.</br>
</br>
He was sure he was not mistaken.</br>
</br>
Expressed disdain for the B City consortium, who was she on behalf of? Morgan? Rockefeller? Russians? Or Hua? Or, the fabled...</br>
</br>
He hesitated for a moment before he finally gritted his teeth.</br>
</br>
"If the price is right..."</br>
</br>
In any case, he should listen to the price first. If the price was not suitable, then it was not too late to refuse.</br>
</br>
The woman opened her left hand and put up five fingers.</br>
</br>
"...500,000 dollars?" The man tried to propose a number.</br>
</br>
"50 million." The woman said in an understatement.</br>
</br>
50 million dollars!</br>
</br>
His heart jerked. The man took a deep breath, and his expression changed several times before it formed a bitter smile</br>
</br>
It was a price he could not reject.</br>
</br>
Even if he knew this money would bring danger to his life.</br>
</br>
"Your answer?" The woman raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
This question was completely redundant.</br>
</br>
No one could refuse such a generous reward on K Street.</br>
</br>
Even if the bet was his own life, he would willingly gamble it.</br>
</br>
The man took a deep breath, stood up, and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"Richard Meyer, that is my name. I don't know if I am lucky enough to know the name of my employer?"</br>
</br>
"No," The woman looked at the document in her hand and replied in a whisper.</br>
</br>
Even the refusal was so elegant that Meyer, who had his right hand in the air, couldn't be angry.</br>
</br>
"...well, it doesn't matter," Meyer retracted his right hand, shrugged, and looked around, then he tapped on the table and lowered his voice, "wait for my message."</br>
</br>
The woman nodded, without looking up at him at all.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, go now."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1147: Returning to Earth</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the blink of an eye, three days had passed since Jiang Chen arrived in Lunar City.</br>
</br>
During these three days, the mayor of Lunar City, Tang Weijie, took Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu on a tour of the city.</br>
</br>
From the ice exploration wells, to the mining station that collected helium-3, to the nuclear fusion power station that transported electricity to half of Asia, and the wireless power transmission station over a hundred square meters in size, Jiang Chen was able to gain a clear view of Lunar City's development.</br>
</br>
In general, Lunar City had a strong mining industry with a growing tourism industry. The city was a giant mine with complete mining facilities, ground transportation, power supply, communication scheduling, production management and living service facilities.</br>
</br>
According to Tang Weijie, to fully develop the potential of the city, at least 50,000 permanent residents would be needed. Before the living space issues could be solved, the limit of the permanent population of the city would be this number.</br>
</br>
The shield technology must be dependent on the progress in Wanghai of the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought.</br>
</br>
It's time to return to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With all officials of Lunar City's best wishes, Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu boarded the returning spacecraft.</br>
</br>
After they returned to Celestial City, the first thing he did was to convene experts of Future Heavy Industries and Celestial Trade and held a seminar on the Moon elevator.</br>
</br>
Under the guise of the group of experts, the engineering plan for the Moon elevator was quickly developed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately discussed this matter with Kelvin and delegated the work after the feasibility of the project was confirmed,</br>
</br>
With the boss personally instructing this matter, the Moon elevator project began to move. Future Heavy Industries immediately dispatched engineers to Lunar City for site inspection. The graphene plant in Ange Island Industrial Park began to operate at maximum capacity. The capacity that was originally idle due to the completion of the space elevator started to ramp up again.</br>
</br>
The total length of the entire Moon elevator was 200 kilometers with a budget of 3.7 billion New Xin dollars. The project of course was still executed by Future Heavy Industries and was expected to be delivered to Celestial Trade in the first half of next year.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen delegated all the work on hand, it was already the 13th.</br>
</br>
After he stayed in space for so long, he finally returned to the surface. When his feet stepped onto the soft soil again, he had an illusion of long-lostness.</br>
</br>
The seagulls soared in the air, the dolphins jumped out of the water, the warm and hazy sunshine scattered on his face, and the sea breeze that blew in his face was mixed with the fragrance of coconut... these ordinary things on Earth just felt like home.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went straight home when he returned to Coro Island by helicopter.</br>
</br>
</br>
As early as three days ago, when he worked to develop the plan for the Moon elevator in Celestial City, Xia Shiyu had already returned. She should be working today. Natasha also shouldn't be home since she "checked in" at the embassy from Monday to Friday.</br>
</br>
In this case, there was only one person who could open the door for him...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen knocked on the door of the mansion, a stunning figure leaped into his arms.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen spun Ayesha in the air, stroked her dark brown hair, and whispered to her.</br>
</br>
"Did you miss me?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded with force, buried her face in his chest, and rubbed her nose against him. Finally, a smile blossomed from the usually expressionless face.</br>
</br>
After Ayesha took the suitcase from Jiang Chen's hand, she ran upstairs</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung his coat at the door, then went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he opened the door again, a change of clothes was placed in a plastic basket. Looking at the neatly folded clothes, he felt her meticulous care to detail.</br>
</br>
The clothes smelled like sunlight.</br>
</br>
After he changed into clean clothes, Jiang Chen wiped his hair with a towel and returned to the living room.</br>
</br>
Looking at Ayesha, who sat on the sofa in the living room, he sat next to her.</br>
</br>
"Has anything happened in Nippon while I was away?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head.</br>
</br>
"The CIB suspended their espionage activities in Nippon, at least they stopped their contact with the Nippon politicians. We are basically in an armistice with the CIB, although I don't know how long this can last... Also, on another note, why did you ask us to pay attention to Joseph Kennedy? Is there anything special about him? If it's just because of B City Consortium—"</br>
</br>
"Guess who I met in Lunar City? I met Loki," Jiang Chen said. "He discussed forming an alliance. He said that if Joseph Kennedy becomes president, they will give Nippon to us and also join the Earth Defense Alliance."</br>
</br>
"Did you agree?" Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Jiang Chen shrugged. "This piece of meat is too fat and I'm afraid it may taste bad."</br>
</br>
No matter from which point of view, the B City Consortium's proposal was considered generous. If there was a problem, then it was probably because the proposal was too generous. It was generous to the point that Jiang Chen couldn't trust them.</br>
</br>
Obviously, Ayesha also shared the same perspective.</br>
</br>
"According to your instructions, we have begun to investigate Joseph Kennedy."</br>
</br>
"Who is responsible for this mission?"</br>
</br>
"Penny."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
The name rang a bell in his head. Zhu Yu and she were the first batch of graduated agents, a veteran in Ghost Agents. She should be able to take care of the matter with no mistakes.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance was headed on the right track, but there was still a long way to go to integrate resources around the world. The biggest obstacle to this was the ruler of the old world. As the leader of the world's largest military body, as long as the UA still existed for one day, the sphere of influence of the Earth Defense Alliance could only stay in the Eastern Hemisphere.</br>
</br>
However, the issue was that both sides controlled the switch to destroy the world.</br>
</br>
The two sides could only test away from the opponent's bottom line.</br>
</br>
Although the two sides still maintained high-standard economic and trade cooperation, the signs of the Cold War had quietly emerged. If this balance could be maintained, the situation would be fine. However, if the fine balance was broken by one side, then the situation may deteriorate to the point of no return.</br>
</br>
Who was the most likely to tip the balance?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's answer was undoubtedly the UA.</br>
</br>
He thought he had a theoretical basis.</br>
</br>
After all, the country changed its president every four years!</br>
</br>
Without considering the differences between the two parties, the differences within the same party alone were visible enough. If a madman was elected without any common sense, the results would not be certain.</br>
</br>
In this case, whether or not the promise of B City Consortium would be honored, it would not be a bad choice to push Joseph Kennedy to the position of the president. After all, Future Group still has close cooperation with B City Consortium in the areas of desalination and VR finance.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen would not be without reservation.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents in North America had started to collect Joseph Kennedy's scandals. Jiang Chen believed there was no politician without stains. With further digging, there must be something hidden underneath the surface.</br>
</br>
"I will go back to the apocalypse in a few days. I'll leave everything here to you." Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's hair.</br>
</br>
Ayesha put her hand over his and docilely nodded.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1148: North of the Great Wall</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was still the middle of autumn, but a hint of winter's chillness already lingered in the air.</br>
</br>
The Badaling Checkpoint was a tourist attraction more than 30 years ago. Today, more than 30 years later, it had been transformed into a military outpost. With this ancient wall as the boundary, the north was the wilderness, the world of mutants and the south was the ruins, the world of survivors.</br>
</br>
In general, survivors in Shangjing were much more fortunate than the survivors in Wanghai. Although both cities were in ruins, many landmark buildings survived. These well-preserved buildings became the base of survivors and provided shelters for survival.</br>
</br>
In addition, as the political center of Pan-Asia Cooperation, the necessities here were more than ten times that of Wanghai. The necessities here were not just food, clothing, medical supplies, but also raw materials and energy such as steel, rare earth minerals, oil, helium-3, and even well-preserved industrial machine tools.</br>
</br>
The industrial machine tools here were different from the hand-built machine tools built by engineers of the Sixth Street through 3D printers. The former was the crystallization of technology, and the latter was the knowledge of the working people.</br>
</br>
It was evident how much of a lead the survivors of Shangjing gained in the early days.</br>
</br>
Before the establishment of NAC, there were more than a hundred large and small settlements in Wanghai. In Shangjing, more than a thousand settlements were scattered across the city with hundreds of large survivor camps like the Sixth Street and Liuding Town.</br>
</br>
The survivors never unified here. They had made their own rules, such as determining the safe area within the Third Ring Road and prohibiting murder, robbery, and theft. Offenders would be wanted by all survivors.</br>
</br>
Another example was the outpost in the Badaling scenic area. In order to prevent extreme mutants with a crystal index of 300 or more from migrating from the north, the survivors of Shangjing jointly contributed to the modification of the city wall of Badaling. They repaired the guardhouse and machine-gun bunker and each settlement took turns guarding.</br>
</br>
Even in the harshest winters, this iron law never changed.</br>
</br>
"It's September."</br>
</br>
"Right."</br>
</br>
On the guardhouse, two soldiers stood at each end, leaned against the wall, and gazed into the gray wasteland.</br>
</br>
Automatic rifles dangled around their waist and magazines were tied against their body. From their appearance, they were from different survivor camps.</br>
</br>
"What date is it?"</br>
</br>
"The 15th."</br>
</br>
The one in the blue scarf didn't seem to enjoy chatting. Only when the survivor next to him asked a question would he respond in a concise manner. Most of the time, he stood there in silence, not moving, and gazed into the distant horizon.</br>
</br>
Or dozing off...</br>
</br>
"It's only been fifteen days? Fu*k." The unshaven man spat out of the guardhouse and grinned. "Do you believe it in another two months, if I spit down, it will turn into ice?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The man in the blue scarf barely moved the corner of his mouth and did not speak.</br>
</br>
This state continued, and time quickly passed by.</br>
</br>
The sky gradually darkened, and the distant horizon was covered with a layer of foggy tulle. With the gust of the northern wind, the fog writhed its enchanting curve and gradually climbed over the wasteland. It rose above the guardhouse and covered the concrete-reinforced wall...</br>
</br>
"Fog," the unshaven man said, raising his head and looking into the sky. He then muttered to himself. "The weather is going to change."</br>
</br>
The fog gradually thickened and formed another wall on the distant horizon.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, in the heavy fog, a black outline gradually emerged.</br>
</br>
The blue scarf man seemed to notice the anomaly in the fog as he frowned. He reached for the binocular on his chest and examined that direction.</br>
</br>
"Did you see something?" The unshaven man also noticed something at this moment, but when he reached for his binocular, he did not find anything. Then he remembered that he left it in the barracks.</br>
</br>
"...the fog is too thick to see anything." The man wearing a scarf pressed his eyes against the binocular as he responded. At the same time, he pressed the intercom on his shoulder and spoke. "Something is going on outside."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Four or five soldiers with rifles left the barracks as they yawned and headed to the guardhouse. At the same time, a drone flew out and slowly flew toward the wilderness outside the city wall.</br>
</br>
The blue scarf man tossed the binocular at the unshaven man, then he kneeled down and took out a shell about the size of an adult thigh. He picked up a rag and wiped the ash on it before he walked to the deployed cannon.</br>
</br>
"If you have seen enough, come and help."</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, the big guy is being loaded. Are we overreacting?" The unshaven snorted and took one last peak with the binocular. Just as he was about to go help, he seemed to catch a glimpse of a bright red emblem from behind the thick fog.</br>
</br>
A sickle?</br>
</br>
A... hammer!?</br>
</br>
The binocular dropped to the ground, and horror immediately overwhelmed him. His lips trembled for a while before he finally squeezed out two words from his trembling lips.</br>
</br>
"The... fu*k?"</br>
</br>
The earth shook and the steel roared.</br>
</br>
The torrent of steel rolled from the boundless wasteland, and the endless roar swept across the wall, swept over the guard tower, and swept through the continent...</br>
</br>
That was not fog!</br>
</br>
That was the dust picked up by tank tracks!</br>
</br>
The moment they recognized the shadow, the expression of everyone in the guardhouse changed. The stones in the corner began to jump in uneasiness. Even separated by a kilometer in distance, everyone could feel the tremor of the earth.</br>
</br>
"CCC...P?" Their teeth trembled, and the soldiers in the bunker loaded their weapons while cursing in fear. "CCCP tanks? No, impossible, didn't the former regimes all get out?"</br>
</br>
"Push up the cannons! QUICK!"</br>
</br>
"Idiot! Use AP bombs! That one in red paint!"</br>
</br>
The entire military outpost began to mobilize like boiling water after they noticed the strange situation outside. The soldiers rushed to battle positions with automatic rifles, and with the cannons loaded, they pushed it to firing position. These fortifications were originally prepared for mutants. No one ever thought that one day it would be used against the polar bears in tanks.</br>
</br>
A speaker was extended out from the guardhouse.</br>
</br>
"Listen! Whatever you are doing, stop immediately!"</br>
</br>
The armored flood continued its advancement with no response.</br>
</br>
The commander repeated the same statement in Russian.</br>
</br>
It was still silence that responded to them, and the roar of the tank tracks flattened the earth.</br>
</br>
The commander smashed the speaker against the ground, took off his intercom, and a glimpse of heroicness quickly appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"FIGHT!"</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
Five cannons responded to his roar.</br>
</br>
The infantry artillery shells fired and made five orange trajectories in the air. However, against the roaring steel torrent, they were as insignificant as toothpicks.</br>
</br>
POOSH!</br>
</br>
The shells scraped against the front armor of the tanks and plunged into the mud. It left only a shallow dent.</br>
</br>
The unshaven man looked at the tank formation outside the guardhouse and was in so much despair that he even stopped moving.</br>
</br>
The cannons invincible against mutants were useless. They couldn't even make the roaring steel monster pause for a second.</br>
</br>
The five cannons on the wall seemed to ignite a certain signal.</br>
</br>
Above the rushing steel torrent, a row of icy barrels slowly lifted and pointed in the direction of the guardhouse.</br>
</br>
Without the slightest omen, the barrels ignited.</br>
</br>
The unshaven man used the last glimmer of light to spot the concrete wall collapsing backward...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1149: Ceremonial Ship Launching</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A long time ago, the apocalypse only gave Jiang Chen the feeling of despair… and despair.</br>
</br>
The streets were blocked by zombies and mutants, the raiders and the cannibals raged, and the mutated humans occasionally ravaged the land. In order to explain the origin of his food, he must carefully weave lies and then create his own bloody road among the bloodthirsty mutants and cruel robbers.</br>
</br>
Only when he returned to the modern world did he get an opportunity to breath.</br>
</br>
From the leak of the X2 bacteria to the later mutant flood, from the Supreme rebellion to the subsequent war with the Northern Alliance Area, troubles forced him to move forward. He must protect the home he created, protect the people that loved him, and those that he loved...</br>
</br>
Now, the situation seemed to be reversed.</br>
</br>
Zombies had disappeared from Wanghai, and mutants migrated away to the wilderness without survivors. There were no complicated international relationships. There were no regional conflicts that must be handled with care. On this ruin, NAC was a well-deserved king, even something as strong as the Northern Alliance Area, left behind from the previous world, must surrender to NAC's might.</br>
</br>
The apocalypse became his peace.</br>
</br>
Only in the apocalypse could Jiang Chen temporarily put down the fatigue accumulated in the modern world and enjoy the rare leisure...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the east bank of Wanghai, next to Liuding Town.</br>
</br>
The bright steel hull was pushed down into the sea water, and a brand-new destroyer floated beside the rusty Bohai.</br>
</br>
The flag of the New Pan-Asia Cooperation (NAC) swayed in the sea breeze. The magnificent steel ship stood firmly in the rolling waves. The three electromagnetic pulse cannons were arranged in a stepped manner. They neatly pointed to the sky and highlighted their fierce firepower.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood on the dock and examined the warship not far from him.</br>
</br>
The waves rolled against the coast and his heart rolled with it. The launch of the electromagnetic destroyer meant that the NAC Navy finally took its first step. Although there were still many shortcomings compared to the Beluga Station, NAC made a monumental breakthrough.</br>
</br>
NAC had conquered the land and was destined to conquer the ocean and bring the world under its banner...</br>
</br>
"Our first warship." Cheng Weiguo walked to Jiang Chen's side and looked at the brand-new destroyer, emotionally he said, "It is finally built."</br>
</br>
Under the name of building a dock for the maintenance of the Bohai Aircraft Carrier, the shipyard was built. The bottom line of the Beluga Station was slowly eclipsed, and the destroyer finally entered the sea. This was only the first one. There would be many ships in the future. Not only destroyers, but NAC also developed submarines and built the navy based on the standards of pre-war PAC.</br>
</br>
"Is there a name for her?" Jiang Chen raised his chin toward the destroyer.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Not yet, General, please give her a name."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment and then looked up.</br>
</br>
"Let's call it Destroyer Ship Qingpu."</br>
</br>
The Fishbone Base built itself in ​​Qingpu, Wanghai. Qingpu was the birthplace of NAC and was a fitting name for the first destroyer of NAC.</br>
</br>
"DS Qingpu?" Cheng Weiguo nodded. "I will tell people to engrave this name."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo paused and asked, "I don't know which army the destroyer belongs to..."</br>
</br>
"I will establish a new navy division, independent of the Army system. Just like AS Order, it will have its own system and will directly obey orders from the Central Military Department." Jiang Chen looked at DS Qingpu and said, "The NAC trade route has been in the hands of outsiders for too long. It's time to take it back."</br>
</br>
When Cheng Weiguo heard the General's words, he solemnly straightened his back.</br>
</br>
As the head of the First Division, he was the confidant around Jiang Chen from the very beginning. Of course, he knew the foreigner the General referred to.</br>
</br>
"The next step is to build anti-aircraft cannons along the shore, echoing the electromagnetic pulse cannons of Chongming Island. We are currently not a threat to the Beluga Station at sea, so we must start from land infrastructures. Although we are on good terms with Beluga Station, you can never forget that this is the wasteland."</br>
</br>
"Roger," Cheng Weiguo shouted.</br>
</br>
"Good. I'm going to head back now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, turned, and walked to the armored car behind him.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo looked at the back of the armored car and watched it disappear at the end of the street.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived home, the aromatic smell of cooked meat lingered in the mansion.</br>
</br>
Every time he came back, the mansion was always bustling.</br>
</br>
Not only the NAC granary was filled, but the fridge in the mansion was also full. Although they never lacked food, items such as seafood which can't be stored for long, could only be enjoyed during Jiang Chen's return.</br>
</br>
Today was no exception.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen passed through Coconut Island, he brought a fridge-full of fresh seafood with him.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the girls voted unanimously to eat hotpot for dinner that night</br>
</br>
Yao Yao prepared her original hotpot soup base in the kitchen. Sun Jiao, who only knew how to serve the plates, helped to bring the hotpot to the table.</br>
</br>
All eyes stared straight at the bubbling hotpot soup. Lin Lin's little hand squeezed her fork tightly as she swallowed.</br>
</br>
Xiaorou held her face with her hands and smiled while she swayed her slim legs under the table. She was hymning her favorite song that she wrote.</br>
</br>
"... beef rolls, mutton rolls, and delicious cuttlefish, which one to eat first~"</br>
</br>
Hotpot was really more delicious with more people.</br>
</br>
The soup boiled, and Lin Lin who couldn't wait tossed a plateful of mutton roll into the boiling hotpot, and soon the fragrance spread over the house. All eyes stared at the meat rolls rolling in the soup, and even Jiang Chen couldn't wait for the meat to boil.</br>
</br>
Amongst the cheers and laughter, the family ate hotpot and left a mess on the table.</br>
</br>
After everyone cleaned the dishes together, Yao Yao returned to her room to read, Lin Lin went to the "Lin Institute." As for Xiaorou, she went to the backyard. Every night, she practiced her ability to detonate crystals in the backyard as she tried to unlock her the third hidden gene code.</br>
</br>
It was already her habit.</br>
</br>
A habit that cost a lot of crystals.</br>
</br>
There weren't really many things for entertainment in the apocyalpse.</br>
</br>
Other than enjoying food, there didn't seem to be many interesting activities. Most people chose to spend their extra time at work. Even if they don't have a job, they often found something to do, such as practicing shooting and learning.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen also thought about unlocking his hidden genetic code, except he couldn't find a suitable way to practice his "Fury" ability. He couldn't just lose his temper everyday. He thought his temper was pretty mild...</br>
</br>
"This year, six hundred babies were born."</br>
</br>
After Sun Jiao entered the office, she grabbed two cans of beer and walked to Jiang Chen. She handed him a can and leaned against the bookshelf.</br>
</br>
"Does this count as a lot or too little?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao smiled and said with a sly voice, "This is considered a small baby boom. Four years ago, it was rare to see a few babies at the Sixth Street. Thanks to this, the Sixth Street has recently opened a baby goods store and has started to sell things like diapers."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he showed a pleasant smile.</br>
</br>
"This is great. It indicates that our survivors have settled –"</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter what happens to other people," Sun Jiao interrupted. She stared at her toes and whispered, "I mean, I'm thinking, we should also have a child..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed slightly, and after a moment of silence, he whispered, "Let him be born in the last days?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's lips were closed, and her eyes showed a hint of confusion.</br>
</br>
She also knew, perhaps it would be better to wait just a bit longer, but just watching more and more children in the base strung a string in her heart that was never tough before.</br>
</br>
Yes, this family was very big and warm, but she always felt like something was missing.</br>
</br>
If she must say what, it may be a little life full of joy. Although she did not have the confidence to become a qualified mother, she vowed that she would work hard, give the maternal love she has never experienced before to her child, give her child a childhood that she has never enjoyed, and find all the irreparable things in that little life that she regretted before…</br>
</br>
"Let's wait." Jiang Chen rubbed her soft hair.</br>
</br>
"How much longer?" Sun Jiao pouted, her mood seemed to be down.</br>
</br>
"When everything is over," Jiang Chen looked at Sun Jiao and looked at the yellowish-green sky outside the window and sighed softly. "Someone must inherit all of this."</br>
</br>
Of course, maybe this was just his excuse.</br>
</br>
It was just that he also didn't have the self-confidence for the time being, to take up the responsibility of being a father...</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1150"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1150: Harmonious Scene</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was just daybreak when Jiang Chen opened his eyes and slightly moved his shoulders, only to find that his arms were firmly pressed.</br>
</br>
As if Sun Xiaorou sensed Jiang Chen's movement, she muttered while she changed into a more comfortable position and continued to use his arm as a pillow</br>
</br>
"Sister, sister... Xiaorou can't eat anymore..."</br>
</br>
With her cherry-red lips slightly pouted, Sun Jiao turned around and put her arm around Jiang Chen's neck. With a sweet smile, she whispered in her dream.</br>
</br>
"Just sleep for a bit longer."</br>
</br>
Looking at the peaceful sleeping beauty, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
No wonder they are sisters. The way they look in their sleep is exactly the same.</br>
</br>
But because he was observing too closely, he noticed the unnaturalness of Sun Jiao's face.</br>
</br>
"Hmmm... you're awake, right?"</br>
</br>
Just as he said those words, he saw Sun Jiao's long eyelashes move.</br>
</br>
Although her trick was spotted, Sun Jiao didn't plan to just let him escape. Her lips slightly opened and exaggerated snoring drifted out between her lips.</br>
</br>
This girl…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Get up, there is still something we must do. Don't stay in bed too long."</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen tried to tickle Sun Jiao, Sun Xiaorou on the other side began to move.</br>
</br>
"Hey, you noticed."</br>
</br>
She rubbed her sleepy eyes and wobblingly sat up. Sun Xiaorou, still not completely awake yet, smiled at Jiang Chen with blushed cheeks. Her messy hair did not interfere with her beauty. Nor did the loose pajamas on her body. Instead, they added a unique charm to her.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou watched Jiang Chen stare at her and she tilted her head. Then she smiled with a bit of confusion and a bit of shyness before she put her finger on her lips.</br>
</br>
"Before saying good morning... don't you want to do something first?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Although he really wanted to do something, rationality ultimately won.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen snuck out from the bedroom, took some winter clothes from the bedside table, and got dressed. He leaned down and kissed the two on the forehead before he left the bedroom. When he went downstairs, Yao Yao, who was yawning, had already put delicious breakfast on the table.</br>
</br>
As for the foodie Lin Lin, she already began to eat...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen moved a chair over and sat next to Yao Yao who happily pressed her little head against his shoulder and her pair of feet swayed in happiness.</br>
</br>
With how sleepy Yao Yao looked, Jiang Chen couldn't help but feel a little distressed.</br>
</br>
Her symptoms of lethargy never went away despite her nutrition improving and her anemia being cured. There were even signs of aggravation. Her explanation was that the inhibitors used for the hibernation chambers had side effects similar to allergy symptoms, but Jiang Chen always suspected that it may be not as simple as the inhibitor's side effects...</br>
</br>
"Sister Sun Jiao and Sister Sun Xiaorou are still sleeping?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"You don't have to wake them up, let the two sleepy heads sleep for a bit longer," Jiang Chen said while he rubbed Yao Yao's fluffy hair.</br>
</br>
"Hmm."</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing." Yao Yao shook her head and began to pout.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao, slightly confused.</br>
</br>
It may be his illusion, but he felt that the little girl's emotion seemed to be low.</br>
</br>
Is it because she didn't sleep well?</br>
</br>
"If you feel like you didn't sleep enough, don't force yourself, or... go back to sleep for a bit longer?"</br>
</br>
"No need, Yao Yao has already woken up." The small head shook back-and-forth as she clearly tried to act strong.</br>
</br>
"It's all because you are here, that's why Yao Yao is getting up so early. If it's normal days, I'm usually the one who prepares breakfast," Lin Lin chewed on an egg roll and glared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Not at all! Obvi...obviously I just happened to get up today..." Yao Yao blushed and eyed Lin Lin, but her eyes didn't show any fierceness.</br>
</br>
"Humph," Lin Lin swallowed the food in her mouth and spat out her tongue. With a tone of preaching, she began to lecture, "The delicious egg roll cannot fly into my mouth. If you don't let some big bad guy know, he will take your efforts for granted. If you just watch in silence, your presence will be lower and lower. Until in the end, your feelings will be like your height, always so little."</br>
</br>
After leaving these words, Lin Lin did not give Yao Yao a chance to respond. She quickly put the last piece of egg roll into her mouth, took her plate, and headed to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
"It won't happen..." Lin Lin's words seemed to pull a string in Yao Yao's mind. Yao Yao pouted while her hands gently dragged onto Jiang Chen's sleeves and tightened. She lowered her head while she muttered, "Humph, why are you acting cool, obviously you... you... can't grow taller too."</br>
</br>
Grow taller?</br>
</br>
Yao Yao should still be able to grow taller?</br>
</br>
Lin Ling shouldn't be able to grow taller. After all, the bones were replaced with titanium alloys. If she can grow taller, then that's an issue.</br>
</br>
Without understanding the conversation between Lin Lin and Yao Yao, Jiang Chen sat there, completely lost with half of an egg roll still stuffed in his mouth.</br>
</br>
What's happening today?</br>
</br>
After he finished breakfast, Jiang Chen forcibly stopped Yao Yao from doing dishes and even picked up her up to send her to bed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw the little girl blush as he tucked her in, leaned down, and kissed her on her forehead before he left the bedroom.</br>
</br>
Back in the kitchen, Jiang Chen was about to clean up the plate, only to find that everything was cleaned.</br>
</br>
He quickly realized what happened and smiled at the sight.</br>
</br>
Although he always bantered with Lin Lin, he always knew that contrary to her bad mouth, Lin Lin was actually a very gentle person, just unable to express her feeling, or expressed it in the oddest way...</br>
</br>
As he pushed open the door, the icy wind gusted into his face. He moved his stiff limbs passed the door before he ventured into the wind.</br>
</br>
It was mid-September, but the wind brought on the resemblance of winter.</br>
</br>
With Cheng Weiguo, Zhao Guang and several guards, Jiang Chen stepped onto the wall of the Fishbone Base</br>
</br>
After the soldiers on duty saw him, they turned to face him, straightened their back and saluted. Their pupils were filled with respect and pride from the bottom of their heart. In NAC's territory, and even to the more distant south, California, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean... The NAC General was a fabled name.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the rundown high-rise buildings outside the city wall and suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
"Where did the wind blow from?"</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo quickly thought about it and replied immediately.</br>
</br>
"It should be from the north."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and set his eyes to the far north and spoke to himself.</br>
</br>
"Did the northern wind already start to blow?"</br>
</br>
It's getting colder and colder</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

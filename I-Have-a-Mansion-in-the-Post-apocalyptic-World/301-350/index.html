</div></br>
</br>
"Boss, I beg you, please don't play like this in the future." After moving the busted power armor, Cheng Weiguo looked at the torn left arm and said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
"I am okay right? Haha." Jiang Chen forced out a few laughs.</br>
</br>
Although he knew he was being too reckless, he would never admit it to his subordinates.</br>
</br>
A truck drove back and picked up the body of the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
A few soldiers who worked in a hunger team before skillfully dug out the crystals in the back of the monster's head.</br>
</br>
After scanning the almost black, green crystals with the special device, they concluded there were a total of 290 crystals. In terms of energy, the Mother of Death Claw was at the top of the food chain, among the dangerous mutants. If it was above 300 crystals, then it must be categorized in the extreme mutant creatures category.</br>
</br>
To normal survivors, 290 crystals were a sizable amount of wealth. But to Jiang Chen, these crystals were not enough. The half-scraped power armor cost more than 10000 crystals.</br>
</br>
As for the body of the Mother of Death Claw, it will be taken back to the Fishbone base, submerged in Formalin for an entire month before being plugged up, and injected with concrete. The body will become a statue and will forever bow its head in the square in front of the community center. With its head being stepped under the foot of Jiang Chen in his power armor, it will be used to worship the bravery of the Fishbone leader.</br>
</br>
Even the most dangerous species, the Mother of Death Claw, was defeated by our leader. What other hardships would hinder our march forward?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had always put an emphasis on the spiritual civilization of the base. While slavery chip could control the life and death of people, it could not control their thoughts…</br>
</br>
Fine, he didn't have such lofty thoughts, he only wanted to show off.</br>
</br>
The body of the shredded soldier could no longer be found. The strong acid in the Death Claw's stomach would dissolve the prey, including its bones, in less than an hour. A few soldiers gritted their teeth and dragged some clothes out of it, as well as a glided knight emblem; the only two things that remained.</br>
</br>
The torn uniform and emblem will be placed in a wooden box and buried in the Fishbone cemetery, the final destination of all knights. As to his relatives, they will be recognized as martyrs, the Fishbone base will provide for them until his children become adults.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was morning when he left and already past noon when he returned.</br>
</br>
He returned to camp 27 with the force. Jiang Chen didn't bother with anything as he ran to the cafeteria to ask the chef to cook something simple.</br>
</br>
Although he asked for something simple, the chef definitely didn't make it simple. He used the giant pot to cook three dishes and personally put it on Jiang Chen's table.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he smelled the aroma of food, Jiang Chen stomach became hungrier. After three consecutive battles, it certainly tired him out as he immediately started to devour the food.</br>
</br>
When he was halfway through his meal, Jiang Chen saw Cheng Weiguo walk over so he waved at him.</br>
</br>
"Did you eat yet?"</br>
</br>
"Not yet, I am seeing if there are any leftovers." Cheng Weiguo forced a smile.</br>
</br>
He dropped his chopsticks while eating as he came to Jiang Chen's rescue on an empty stomach.</br>
</br>
"Come, lets eat together." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo was flattered and didn't reject as he carried a bowl and sat across from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The two chitchatted for a moment before they returned to more serious topics.</br>
</br>
"Did you search near the Like Mall?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"We did, but we only managed to find two small sized survivor groups… No nest of the Death Claw." As he said this, Cheng Weiguo was also puzzled.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it should still be in hibernation. Additionally, the Mother of Death Claw doesn't normally leave its nest. Although it was powerful, it didn't really hunt prey on its own. Due to its massive body, a few swings would cost it a lot of energy. The basic pattern of this species was to take the preys that were gifted by countless of "pursuers" in exchange for mating rights. Although genetic analysis showed that the Death Claw may be some kind of mutated lizard caused by the radiation, its ethnic structure was more similar to ants.</br>
</br>
However, near the Like Mall, no Death Claw nest existed. The Mother of Death Claw seemed to have appeared out of thin air.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, this was abnormal.</br>
</br>
"What did the survivors say?"</br>
</br>
"Most of them lived in the area for over ten years, they said they never saw the Death Claw before." Cheng Weiguo said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows as he didn't think it was as simple as it looked.</br>
</br>
He speculated that the Mother of Death Claw must have been lured by someone. Though he might not have be the target since it was just a coincidence he appeared there. In that case, the Death Claw must be targeting Lin Chaoen or people from the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, but he just happened to kill them first and bumped into the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
But there was not enough information. Nothing would come to fruition just by thinking. At least he had to wait to crack the password on the EP chip before he can gain some more clue.</br>
</br>
The only thing he was certain about now was that the two parties were fighting over something.</br>
</br>
The Crimson Chamber of Commerce, Digitalized human, Defender, mutated human…and the Dusk, and possibly the Northern Alliance area.</br>
</br>
Wanghai City was a place of trouble, what was hiding here?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head. "Let's put this aside for now, is the result of that drug out?"</br>
</br>
When he left in the morning, when Jiang Chen told Cheng Weiguo he was heading out, he also left the drug for it to be taken to the fallout shelter for analysis.</br>
</br>
He was curious what the drug actually was.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen ask about the drug, Cheng Weiguo's face also turned stern.</br>
</br>
"The analysis results are out, it is a hallucinating agent, a banned substance before the war ."</br>
</br>
"Banned substance?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, it is said that it posed a huge threat to society. This is the report." Cheng Weiguo took out a folded piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Jiang Chen. "Something pretty weird."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to scan the paper.</br>
</br>
"Happy Times. Just like the name of the drug, the person taking the drug will receive a day's length of Happy Times. The symptom was to develop hallucinations, completing taking on a role at a certain time and enjoying a happy life that didn't belong to them.</br>
</br>
The drug gained popularity in 2151 among the low to medium income population, following the economic recession. Because the drug was not addictive in nature, it didn't draw the attention of the government agency. Until one incident, where a depressed middle-aged man was standing in the middle of the street collecting garbage cans and blocking off traffic, did it finally draw the attention of the government. Mentally addictive substances were first added into controlled substance rule…"</br>
</br>
No wonder Meng Qian was waiting for the bus, he really was "rushing to work".</br>
</br>
After he read to the end, Jiang Chen threw the report on the table.</br>
</br>
"I have seen it before." Cheng Weiguo shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Arrest them if you see people selling it. Let them know… Whatever, I will do it myself. Come back with me to the Fishbone base tomorrow." After eating, Jiang Chen cleaned up the bowls.</br>
</br>
"Boss..."</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"Are you just going to let Fallout Shelter 027 sit around?" Seeing there was no one around them, Cheng Weiguo hesitated for a moment before he made up his mind and asked the question.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Do you have better ideas?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"The energy rod is already transported to the camp, but I haven't handed them over yet… We can definitely use the opportunity during the handover, replace the staff with soldiers, destroy the motor in the door and capture the fallout shelter." Cheng Weiguo lowered his voice as he whispered to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began laughing when he heard his words.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo looked at Jiang Chen feeling lost as he didn't know what was the flaw in his plan.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped right away as he looked at Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
"What's the probability of success?"</br>
</br>
"50%." After hesitating for a moment, Cheng Weiguo gave a conservative estimate.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Give them the energy rod, and we will leave this place. In less than a month, this fallout shelter will be mine."</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo was stunned, he didn't know where his boss found the confidence.</br>
</br>
But from his expression, he didn't look like he was joking…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 302: Duty</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen provided the fallout shelter with ten crystal energy rods.</br>
</br>
This type of energy rod followed a similar design to the 100mm nuclear fusion core, except that the contents are not 1 gram of tritium used for nuclear fusion reactions, but rather 1000 crystal shards. This was also the enhanced version of the energy rod used in the power armor. The output was similar to the nuclear fusion core, but the energy input was only one-tenth of it.</br>
</br>
These ten crystal energy rod could maintain a month of energy consumption for the fallout shelter, Jiang Chen personally sent it to the ground.</br>
</br>
"I won’t give you the hope to store energy to pass the winter. Also, if your research speed slows down, I will decrease the energy supplies."</br>
</br>
While handing over the ten crystal energy rods, Jiang Chen also gave them his research expectations.</br>
</br>
Design a light armor, high mobility, and strong firepower of the self-propelled artillery, as an improved version of the Tiger. With the truck pulling the cannon, it was rather outdated. Since they have the opportunity now to upgrade to a better armor, Jiang Chen naturally would not let this opportunity go.</br>
</br>
"Without rules restraining us, this is the most logical choice." To Jiang Chen’s threat, Han Junhua only nodded indifferently.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to fight for more benefits?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"There is no need." Han Junhua shook her head. "Threats can make people remain alert."</br>
</br>
Especially since she knew that even if she demanded more, Jiang Chen would not give ground on this point.</br>
</br>
"Haha, smart choice. But seriously, this is my first time meeting such an interesting opponent." Jiang Chen laughed before turning around and going to the elevator.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn’t oppose the word opponent. She looked at Jiang Chen and calmly blinked her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Am I really interesting?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, not everyone can escape the shackles known as human nature and use rationality to think. I have to say, you have a talent. Are PAC’s colonels all at this level?" Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
If that was the case, then PAC was too scary.</br>
</br>
"Does it have to do with ranking?" Han Junhua retorted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment before he smiled. "Of course not. In other places, I have seen colonel ranked officers, and their brains are not at all this smart. Some drawn to technicals, some arrogant… I am only curious."</br>
</br>
"Where?" Han Junhua asked a different question.</br>
</br>
"In my backyard." Jiang Chen laughed as he said a truth that was easily misinterpreted.</br>
</br>
Then your backyard definitely would not need to worry about survival," Han Junhua said as she automatically interpreted the backyard as the Fishbone base, and the colonel is only a rank that he freely gave out.</br>
</br>
"You are not wrong. Although there are concerns, they are not serious." Jiang Chen nodded, but he was referring to the events in the other world.</br>
</br>
</br>
He didn’t experience the irreconcilable economic crisis caused by the energy crisis in 2150, nor was he a social scientist that had to imagine when the two countries would become under high tension and what the situation would evolve into.</br>
</br>
"It certainly makes people envious," Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Can I ask you another question?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Go ahead," Han Junhua said concisely.</br>
</br>
"What is motivating you to go against me? The honor of a soldier? Or loyalty? But without human nature, would you need these boring things? Especially now that PAC no longer exists?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn’t answer directly.</br>
</br>
"Do you understand the word responsibility?"</br>
</br>
"I see, makes sense."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he didn’t say goodbye. He then went up the elevator.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua watched the elevator ascend as she discretely frowned.</br>
</br>
After returning to the surface, Jiang Chen left the defense of the base to Cheng Weiguo's support, Wang Zhaowu. He urged him to constantly maintain an eye on the fallout shelter, including communicating with the representative every other day to ensure Xu Lu and other staffs were safe.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu was first puzzled by Jiang Chen’s order, because as of now, the troops stationed here lived rather harminously with the blue skins. But Jiang Chen didn’t explain the situation as he repeatedly cautioned him.</br>
</br>
"If the elevator malfunctions or anything unusual happens that prevents the surface from contacting the underground, contact me directly…"</br>
</br>
"Yes, general!" While still puzzled, Wang Zhaowu didn’t ask any questions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he was pleased with his attitude.</br>
</br>
"Keep an eye personally, don’t let other people know."</br>
</br>
After those last words, Jiang Chen left the command center of the troops stationed at the camp and walked to the empty ground.</br>
</br>
One-fourth of the wall’s construction had been finished and an estimate of one week before the main structure could be completed. The Fishbone base soldiers had searched the entire Songjiang terrain in the past few days and didn’t find any strong raider groups.</br>
</br>
Although there were three unknown military forces with sizes similar to the Huizhong Mercenaries they wiped out, the current force of the Fishbone base no longer needed to worry about those small fishes. Based on the consideration of decreasing possible things from going wrong, before the wall is completed, Jiang Chen had already notified Wang Zhaowu not to bother with them.</br>
</br>
After he ordered the soldiers already lined up in the middle of the camp, Jiang Chen and Cheng Weiguo walked to the gate.</br>
</br>
"Old Cheng, let’s make a bet?"</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen got in the car, he abruptly said as he looked at the camp 27's gate.</br>
</br>
"Haha, boss, you are funny. Other than the few packs of cigarettes, I have nothing to bet with you." Cheng Weiguo laughed.</br>
</br>
Food, everyone knew Jiang Chen didn’t lack food.</br>
</br>
When he heard his subordinate’s words, Jiang Chen paused before he started to laugh along.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, speaking of this, I have been considering a problem recently.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo immediately put on a serious face when he heard his leader discuss serious matters.</br>
</br>
"You don’t need to be so serious, I am only asking you for your opinion." Jiang Chen shook his head as he took out two cigarettes from his pocket and passed one to Cheng Weiguo while he lit one for himself. "What do you think about the living conditions of the survivors in the Fishbone base?"</br>
</br>
He had been considering, now that the Fishbone base has been growing in size, if he should open a market? For example, providing salary and use the salary to purchase food from the base.</br>
</br>
But Cheng Weiguo didn’t think that far. He just thought the boss was so considerate of the subordinates and replied gratefully.</br>
</br>
"Everyone is warm and full, they are living a great life."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he realized the question from his perspective would yield the same answer from anyone, so he didn’t ask anymore.</br>
</br>
"Boss, what is the bet that you wanted to make?" Cheng Weiguo asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed, stuck the cigarette out the window, and dusted the ash off in the direction of camp 27’s gate.</br>
</br>
"Within one month, without firing a single bullet, this fallout shelter will belong to me."</br>
</br>
.....</br>
</br>
After finally sending away the "Plague god", she returned to the fallout shelter. Han Junhua felt relieved.</br>
</br>
She didn’t know if it was her illusion, but she felt that the way he looked at her was different.</br>
</br>
Weird, it didn’t feel like hostility.</br>
</br>
But rather, mockery?</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head as she passed through the arch door and walked to her office.</br>
</br>
Without surprise, a discontent middle-aged man stood at the door.</br>
</br>
"Since we already acquired the power, why don’t we immediately restore the supply levels back to normal?"</br>
</br>
"The supply levels will be restored to normal gradually, but it will favor the researchers," Han Junhua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Why?" Wu Yaguo questioned.</br>
</br>
"Because we are working for other people." Han Junhua didn’t stop as she walked around Wu Yaguo and opened the office door.</br>
</br>
When the fallout shelter was closed, everyone’s work was relaxed. A lot of people didn’t even need to work. The production system was highly automated, as long as there was energy, there would be food and water. In an enclosed society there was no competition. The sluggish work habit has become rooted in everyone in the past twenty years. Although a lot of people were highly intelligent, it would be hard for the knowledgeable but lazy people to meet the research speed required by the base.</br>
</br>
Since the energy stored in and the amount consumed by the fallout shelter was clear, the Fishbone base’s energy source was not without a price. With their previous egalitarian ways, it would allow everyone to "die" in their lazy ways.</br>
</br>
"Who made all this!" Han Junhua’s indifferent attitude triggered Wu Yaguo. He angrily reached out his hand to grab her shoulder.</br>
</br>
But before his hand could touch her should, a sharp pain came from his leg as his vision blurred. He was slammed to the ground.</br>
</br>
A gun was pointed at his head as Han Junhua casually let go of the hand holding onto his arm.</br>
</br>
"From now on, the fallout shelter assembly is dissolved. I use the power of the leader to retract any of the permissions given to the residents by the former leader.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Miss Han Junhua."</br>
</br>
A robotic voice came from the speaker above. The control terminal of fallout shelter 027 granted her decision.</br>
</br>
"You, you can’t do that." Wu Yaguo’s face turned pale.</br>
</br>
"But I can." After putting away her pistol, Han Junhua walked into the office and closed the door.</br>
</br>
The energy crisis was solved, and the residents’ mood returned to normal. It was time to clean up the mess.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua saw Academician Qin standing in front of her desk.</br>
</br>
"Is there something you need?" She said concisely as she sat back in her chair.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I heard… You sent leader Zhang’s daughter as the ambassador to be stationed at the Fishbone base," Academician Qin hesitated for a moment and said slowly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yuzhu, that seemed to be her name. The baby that the former fallout shelter leader made an exception for.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, she is righteous, and her personality is bright. Since she was born in the fallout shelter, she has no impractical thoughts, and is fitted for this job." It was enough to make a mistake just once, she already made the mistake of sending Shi Yongtian to the surface as the communicator.</br>
</br>
The people that experienced the prosperity from before the war, when they see the survivors suffering among the ruins, it was hard to ensure they won’t sprout the mentality of feeling superior. But for the people that were born in the fallout shelter, they truly longed for everything on the surface, they won’t mind if it was all in ruins or not.</br>
</br>
If they could gain the friendship of the Fishbone base and peacefully integrate fallout shelter 027 while maintaining a certain status, it would be the best scenario Han Junhua could think of.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Academician Qin didn’t leave, Han Junhua stopped working and raised her head.</br>
</br>
"What else?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, here is a letter… My old friend asked me to give it to you." Academician Qin gave her the slightly crumped letter.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua glanced at the name as she took it.</br>
</br>
"Why do you give it to me now?" As she opened it, she said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Because I think it is more appropriate now…"</br>
</br>
The hands holding the letter trembled. Han Junhua took a deep breath as she hid the grief behind a mask.</br>
</br>
The grief to duty.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 303: It's only an illusion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In a place three thousand meters below Wanghai city, an odd-shaped fallout shelter was buried.</br>
</br>
The reason why it was odd was that there was no living area, nor ventilation equipment. Only the mechanical parts that sparkled occasionally and the light that came on and off.</br>
</br>
And because of this, in the surrounding five hundred square meters, it was filled with ozone.</br>
</br>
Along the outskirts of the room was a ring of hibernation chamber devices. However, a closer examination would indicate that it was not a traditional hibernation chamber because there was no sign of ice shards on the glass surface. Inside the chamber was not ultra-low temperature, but inert gas. It was obviously not preserving humans, but robots.</br>
</br>
A central computer stood in the middle of the room. Under the black screen was a cylindrically shaped culture tank and a human brain was floating inside of it. The bottom of the central computer was connected to various wires of different sizes, which led to each facility inside the fallout chamber.</br>
</br>
The brain was like a spider in the middle of the spider web, controlling everything attached to it.</br>
</br>
The fallout shelter was not the property of the PAC because it was not included in the serial code. Precisely speaking, it didn’t belong to any government organization, it was a completely privately funded personal fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Lin fallout shelter was its name.</br>
</br>
Before the war, the rich building a fallout shelter for themselves was nothing surprising. Although this fallout shelter was strange.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the light below a hibernation device lit up and laminated the dormant enclosure.</br>
</br>
"No. 04 lost… activate backup parts."</br>
</br>
"Pshhh-"</br>
</br>
The sound of gas leaking diffused from the edges of the hibernation chamber, and the door slowly opened.</br>
</br>
A man slowly opened his eyes, waking up from hibernation.</br>
</br>
The dim light reflected on his face.</br>
</br>
That man was Lin Chaoen, the one that got his head pulled off.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the screen of the central computer also lit up.</br>
</br>
A white-haired, kind but authoritative face appeared in the middle of the screen. He looked at Lin Chaoen as the elder man in the screen slowly said, "Do you know what to do now?"</br>
</br>
"Of course," Lin Chaoen’s one knee was on the ground as he said respectfully, "Father."</br>
</br>
The elder man nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then go."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen got up. "Father, a group known as the Dusk entered Jia city. With their disturbance, the coalition of rebels we built suffered heavy losses, should we do anything about this?"</br>
</br>
"No need to bother about the escapist, they are just grasshoppers," the elderly man said.</br>
</br>
No matter how high they jump, they are still only grasshoppers. Although they have some foresight compared to ordinary survivors, that’s all.</br>
</br>
Even if those fools hindered his plan, to a cold machine, it had no concept of "revenge". The iron law of the machine was to choose the method with the highest efficiency.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about that Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
When he heard the name, the old man had a rare silence.</br>
</br>
"Keep an eye on him."</br>
</br>
"Yes." Lin Chaoen nodded before he left.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The tightened supply policy finally ended as all the residents of fallout shelter 027 felt relieved.</br>
</br>
It was an insufferable time that no one should ever experience. They couldn’t take a shower, couldn’t eat till they were full and were only able to receive one hour of light a day. There was good news, but also certainly bad news.</br>
</br>
First, a research team was formed.</br>
</br>
All the talents specializing in military technology and mechanics were gathered together. They said they were going to select a group of researchers to design a tank called Tiger II.</br>
</br>
No one was willing to do it. Research cost a lot of energy. Their work schedule before was only an hour a day, but once they participate in the research, they would have to work more than eight hours. It was torture! Only fools would do it.</br>
</br>
But soon after, they were all fighting for a spot.</br>
</br>
Because the newly enacted supply policy started to favor researchers. Only the people on the research team could enjoy organic food. Not only that, the soilless farm in the fallout shelter would start producing coffee, tea, and other luxuries, but these luxuries will only be available to researchers.</br>
</br>
There was a finite amount of supplies.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the supplies given to people with no work were starting to become limited.</br>
</br>
At the same time, current positions in the fallout shelter will start to execute a cruel performance elimination system.</br>
</br>
The researchers were immediately motivated to work. There were a lot of talents in the fallout shelter, no one wanted to lose such a nice job.</br>
</br>
But on the contrary, negative public opinion became apparent.</br>
</br>
Since there were limited work positions, before the fallout shelter can earn more research projects, only a few people can enjoy the benefits. The majority of the people at the shelter can only conduct labor-intensive work or no work at all.</br>
</br>
No one wanted to drink plain nutrient supplies every meal, such food made their stomachs upset after having too many. Of course, such lavish thoughts would only exist in fallout shelters.</br>
</br>
The residents were extremely discontent, but immediately Han Junhua did another horrifying thing.</br>
</br>
She removed the resident representative and dissolved the resident assembly!</br>
</br>
It was no different than announcing a dictatorship.</br>
</br>
"That bit*h had no rights to that! Performance elimination? God, the person that should be eliminated, is her! Look what she did after she took over!" A rather muscular resident wiped off the sweat from his forehead, opened up, and complained to the resident who was also wiping the floor.</br>
</br>
He selectively ignored the fact that as the leader, she could only distribute the existing supplies, not create supplies out of thin air.</br>
</br>
"Shh. Don’t let the security team hear this." The resident eyed him as he lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
It would be impossible to say they don’t miss the old leader. At least the old leader didn’t make them wipe the floor four times a day. What’s the purpose of this? She was not a clean freak before.</br>
</br>
"Who cares? That bit*h always has a bit*hy face. Do you think she would care how the skunks like us at the bottom view her?" The person cursed.</br>
</br>
At this time, a girl in a white dress walked over.</br>
</br>
"Are you thirsty?"</br>
</br>
Xu Lu smiled at the two as she leaned down shaking the bottle in her hand.</br>
</br>
The two men were lost for a moment before an awkward expression appeared on their faces.</br>
</br>
They were supposed to display their noble gesture in front of this lady, but they were cursing "bit*h" constantly.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu saw through the awkwardness, smiled, and magically took out two cups and poured some water for them.</br>
</br>
"Here, drink some water."</br>
</br>
"Ah, th…thank you." The two thanked her with embarrassed faces as they took the cups quickly.</br>
</br>
After chugging all the water in the cup, the muscular man was stunned as he had a shocked expression on his face. The other person drinking coughed as he almost choked.</br>
</br>
"This, this is… honey water?"</br>
</br>
"That’s right, does it taste good?" Xu Lu grinned.</br>
</br>
"Ye…yes." The thinner man wiped his mouth with his sleeve and graciously looked at Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"There is more. Drink slowly, there's no need to rush… You are labor workers and spend a lot of energy working, it is good for the body to drink something sweet," she said softly as she poured more honey water.</br>
</br>
Just like an angel.</br>
</br>
The way the two looked at her was filled with admiration.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, this is troubling you too much." The muscular man couldn’t stop thanking her.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, I have seen you at the embassy office." The thinner resident straightened his back and looked at Xu Lu, puzzled, "I remember that supplies on the surface were not ample…"</br>
</br>
"Yang Lin, what do you mean?" The muscular resident stared at the thin man.</br>
</br>
"Brother Hao, I don’t mean anything, I am just curious." Yang Lin forced a smile as he comforted Zhao Hao’s attitude.</br>
</br>
This guy was drawn to her at first sight.</br>
</br>
Compared to the more straightforward friend, while Yang Lin was grateful, he was a bit more rational.</br>
</br>
"These are all misconceptions," Xu Lu lowered her head as she said with pity. "This is the purpose of me being here. I hope through my work, it can resolve the misconception between us."</br>
</br>
It seemed to be the case since no one actually went to the surface before and were all listening to the elaborate stories told by Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
Who knows if she is just using the outside being dangerous as an excuse to create class conflicts in order to solidify her dictatorship?</br>
</br>
As Yang Lin thought about this, he began to question himself.</br>
</br>
He previous maintained a neutral attitude towards Han Junhua. However, now he began to lean towards the opposite side.</br>
</br>
Did the Fishbone people really come with the purpose of war? Did the energy in the base fall to the point where they had to limit supplies? … The leader never explained any to the people.</br>
</br>
As to the details of the negotiation, they only knew the result.</br>
</br>
Different from the perplexed mind of Yang Lin, Zhao Hao was simply cursing the dictator in his mind.</br>
</br>
Compared to this angel, she was bad to the bone…</br>
</br>
"Sorry to take so much time for you, my free time is now over." Xu Lu put away the bottle, smiled, and waved at them.</br>
</br>
"No, no bother at all," Zhao Hao rushed to say.</br>
</br>
But before his voice died down, the door at the corner opened.</br>
</br>
"People inside, what are you doing!"</br>
</br>
The security force walked in, in quick steps. They stood in front of Xu Lu as they scanned the three of them.</br>
</br>
"What did she ask you?" The security force looked at Yang Lin.</br>
</br>
Before Yang Lin opened his mouth, Zhao Hao began to ridicule coldly.</br>
</br>
"She asked if our work is difficult or not. She did the job of what your boss is supposed to do."</br>
</br>
The security force stared at him, didn’t say a word, and then looked at Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"Please make your surveying along with us, please cooperate with our work."</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Xu Lu smiled. Then she let the soldier follow behind her as she walked to the other end of the hall.</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy? If you get on the wrong terms with the security force, are you not afraid you may lose your job?" Yang Lin dragged his friend closer as he lectured in a low voice.</br>
</br>
But Zhao Hao didn’t say a word as he blankly watched Xu Lu leave.</br>
</br>
"Yang Lin, do you believe in angels?"</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"She is my angel."</br>
</br>
"Is your brain not working?" Yang Lin ridiculed him.</br>
</br>
Although he said that, Yang Lin couldn’t deny the beauty of the ambassador.</br>
</br>
Her beauty came from not only the surface but also the soul.</br>
</br>
Especially in contrast with a particular person, her beauty was blinding.</br>
</br>
But what the two didn’t know was.</br>
</br>
It was only a façade…</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 304: The Snow of Dusk</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When the fleet returned to the base, it was already dusk.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t go with Cheng Weiguo to eat in the community center cafeteria. Instead, he returned straight to the mansion.</br>
</br>
Right after he put his winter suit on the clothing rack, Sun Jiao walked up to him with complaint written on her face.</br>
</br>
"Why do you have a straight face, don’t you miss me?" Jiang Chen with a smirk on his face put his arms around Sun Jiao’s waist and his lips near her ear.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao’s face turned red, but then she quickly raised her eyebrows as she gently bit Jiang Chen's ear in revenge.</br>
</br>
"What did you do outside?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I promise to god I didn’t do anything bad in the past three days," Jiang Chen said exasperatedly.</br>
</br>
He was becoming more and more courteous.</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen’s words, Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at him.</br>
</br>
"I am not talking about that," as she said this, worry returned to her face, "Can’t you be more careful… You are the leader of a force. This is not the stone age, no general led the charge."</br>
</br>
She was talking about that.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen face looked rather embarrassed as he looked away scratching his nose.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I will be careful."</br>
</br>
The battle with the Mother of Death Claw was in a dire situation. If he knew it was a hornet's nest, he would not find trouble himself.</br>
</br>
"You said that last time to me. A fight with the Mother of Death Claw, are you crazy? If you die…" Sun Jiao bit her bottom lip as tears began to swell up.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed her deep care as he felt warm on the inside. He hugged Sun Jiao apologetically as he comforted her.</br>
</br>
"Don’t say something so ominous, I am fine aren’t I?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao let Jiang Chen hug her as she pouted her mouth and put her chin on his shoulder. Then she spoke into his ear.</br>
</br>
"Then absolutely be careful next time."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen said sincerely as he hugged the warm figure.</br>
</br>
"Also…" As she spoke, her face suddenly turned a burning red as she displayed a rare coyness.</br>
</br>
"Also?"</br>
</br>
"It is nothing, but you always do such dangerous things…" Sun Jiao buried her head.</br>
</br>
"How about…" The red lips trembled because of her shyness. Her faint voice played a seductive mumble, "How about, next time when we do that, let’s not use the contraceptive needle…"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao clearly didn’t know the impact those words would have on a man as Jiang Chen’s stomach immediately felt heated.</br>
</br>
"Honey, I…"</br>
</br>
"Don’t say anything."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With a finger on his lips, Sun Jiao opened her mouth and drew out the silent but seductive words, "Kiss me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn’t hold back any longer. One hand held onto the long and athletic leg, while the other hand wrapped around her waist as he pinned her against the sofa in the living room.</br>
</br>
But then, Jiang Chen was stunned as an awkward expression crept onto his face.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the second floor, Sun Xiaorou, sitting in her wheelchair, grinned at the loving couple.</br>
</br>
"Haha, don’t mind me." The devil-like smile was too similar to Sun Jiao's.</br>
</br>
How would he not mind?</br>
</br>
With her sister seeing the embarrassing scene, Sun Jiao couldn’t stand it any longer as she instantly jumped out and escaped from Jiang Chen’s hug.</br>
</br>
"Sorry for making you replace my sister in accompanying me." Sun Xiaorou sitting in the wheelchair, turned her head, and naughtily blinked her eyes.</br>
</br>
The dusk light stretched out their shadows.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed Sun Xiaorou along the small road in the back garden of the mansion.</br>
</br>
After Sun Jiao ran away, he was about to run away too because he didn’t know how to face her. The her now was obviously different from the her before, and he did take her first time away from her… It may be confusing to explain it this way, but the emotions in his mind perhaps were more confusing than this.</br>
</br>
But Sun Xiaorou stopped him as she asked him to help her down the stairs.</br>
</br>
Because he could not say no to the cute and impossible to refuse eyes, the soft-hearted Jiang Chen came back and brought her downstairs.</br>
</br>
Then we got to this point where Jiang Chen has replaced Sun Jiao, who ran away, and was taking her for a walk in the backyard.</br>
</br>
Although Sun Xiaorou herself could walk with this voice-controlled wheelchair, in a complex environment, it was more convenient to have someone beside her. Especially since it was not easy to explain the direction she wanted to go in the first place.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently breathed out a cloud of mist. After hesitating for a moment, he said, "It’s okay… I have always wanted to apologize to you."</br>
</br>
"Why do you need to apologize to me?" Sun Xiaorou blinked her eyes. "I almost killed you and the person you love. Then because of your anger, you took revenge as I didn’t want to confess. Or rather… I should thank you for not killing me.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a second and after a while, he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Whether or not she really meant it, when he heard she didn’t hate him, it made Jiang Chen feel better.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou gently blinked her eyes as she didn’t continue on with the conversation, but quietly stared at the snow along the tiny path.</br>
</br>
"Are you better now?" Jiang Chen stared at the peacefulness shown on the side of her face as he gently asked.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou’s mouth curved up. "What area? If it is the body, I can’t move below the shoulder."</br>
</br>
Based on what Lin Lin has said, with her current condition, the brain damage was more problematic than nerve damage. The nerve on her back did not suffer any damage nor was there any abnormalities in her body condition; she just couldn’t move her body parts below the shoulder. It felt as if she has "forgotten" how to use her arms and legs.</br>
</br>
It was a problematic condition. Whether it was in the Fishbone base or the Sixth Street, there was no medical equipment could conduct brain repair surgery. But Jiang Chen already used the Fake Legs Bar to put up a reward. Whoever obtains a complete set of surgical equipment would receive 5000 crystals.</br>
</br>
With such a high reward, eventually, this problem will be solved.</br>
</br>
"Uh, spiritually."</br>
</br>
It was a weird way to ask this question. As to why he asked the question, Jiang Chen was also not quite sure.</br>
</br>
Her black hair fell to her side as Sun Xiaorou titled her head, "Why would you ask that?"</br>
</br>
"Because your memory returned right? … Ah, it is too intrusive to ask this in such a way, just pretend I didn’t ask the question." Jiang Chen forced a smile.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Sun Xiaorou only smiled.</br>
</br>
"How do you think I should be?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was about to say 'Remove the brainwashed part and become the sister of Sun Jiao', but that sentence was stuck in his throat.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou watched the sunset in the distance as she continued.</br>
</br>
"There have been two figures fighting in my mind to take control of my body. One being the religious me, the other being the sister me. It’s weird to say it this way right?" Sun Xiaorou turned around to look at Jiang Chen as she timidly smiled.</br>
</br>
"No… Not weird." Jiang Chen shook his head and stared into her eyes while waiting for her to continue.</br>
</br>
"To be honest… I have been thinking a lot in the past few days. Regardless which me it is, they are all me."</br>
</br>
"But that you was brainwashed-" Jiang Chen couldn’t help but state.</br>
</br>
"What exactly is being brainwashed?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn’t interpret the meaning behind those words. He didn’t answer as he just looked at her, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"For humans to live in this world, they are constantly receiving an external signal. A ray of sunshine, a breeze of wind, the occasional snowstorm, words of advice... How do you determine what is brainwashed?"</br>
</br>
"Then you are…"</br>
</br>
"Perhaps the two personalities meshed together. Maybe that is easier to understand."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou blinked as she said playfully.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine, as the victim, she could have such a bright smile.</br>
</br>
"Do you hate those people? Since they were the ones that used the chip to lock your memory," Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou shook her head and once again looked at the sunset in the distance.</br>
</br>
The deep red was no longer blinding, it looked like a torch about to extinguish.</br>
</br>
"What’s after dusk?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed the direction Sun Xiaorou was looking as he gazed at the orange color. He thought for a moment as he gently said.</br>
</br>
"It’s night."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou nodded and said while gazing at the setting sun.</br>
</br>
"That’s right… They are just a bunch of petty people."</br>
</br>
The religious firmly believed in the doomsday of the earth’s civilization. The promise to stay away from the fallen sun, the effort of spending their entire life creating the ark that will carry the new civilization away from the wasteland, into the endless night.</br>
</br>
Even if the mission they had given their all to was successful, would the future waiting for them be the dawn?</br>
</br>
Pitiful people. Why hate the pitiful people.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After pushing Sun Xiaorou back into the mansion, the sun had already gone down.</br>
</br>
The adorable Yao Yao finished cooking the dishes, and she and Lin Lin brought the delicious dishes to the table. Sun Jiao, on the other hand, carried the heavy burden of searching for people.</br>
</br>
But she was not as successful as she had thought. Sun Jiao searched through the mansion without finding the missing Sun Xiaorou and Jiang Chen. She even went into the basement. Perhaps because the withered leaves blocked her vision, but, through the window, she didn’t see the two people in the backyard taking a walk.</br>
</br>
Seeing the two people harmoniously show up in the living room, suspicion flashed across Sun Jiao’s face as her eyes moved between the two.</br>
</br>
"What… happened between you two?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, can you not ask this so weirdly?" Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Uhh, I just feel the air between you two is a bit odd," with a hand on her chin, Sun Jiao said.</br>
</br>
"Then it must be your illusion," Jiang Chen ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"We only took a walk in the backyard, chatted for a while, and there is nothing more to the story," Sun Xiaorou blinked and told her sister.</br>
</br>
Although still suspicious, to her own sister, Sun Jiao had complete trust.</br>
</br>
Since she chose to believe her sister, Sun Jiao nodded and spoke to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Okay… Let’s not talk about this, for now. Go eat. I’ll send Sun Xiaorou upstairs and feed her the nutrient supply, and then I’ll come down."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao walked to Sun Xiaorou as she was about to take over.</br>
</br>
"Sister, are we going to sleep together tonight?" Sun Jiao blinked her eyes as she asked her sister with a pure face.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao thought about Jiang Chen and how she was going to have "unprotected sex". She was about to say no when she realized the joking smile on her sister's face.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao’s face immediately turned red as she gave her a dirty look.</br>
</br>
"You are making fun of your sister. I am not going to feed you."</br>
</br>
"Wooo, sister, I’m sorry. Spare me," Sun Xiaorou batted her eyes as she jokingly acted coy.</br>
</br>
"Beg your brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao made a fierce face before she returned to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
Watching Sun Jiao leave, Jiang Chen had a joyful smile.</br>
</br>
From that night on, she was a lot more cheerful.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh… I accidentally made sister mad, so I’ll have you trouble you in bringing me to the second floor." Looking at Jiang Chen, Sun Xiaorou naughtily stuck out her tongue.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile. He held onto the wheels as he easily lifted the wheelchair and Sun Xiaorou on top.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, you sisters have a really good relationship," Jiang Chen said after putting the wheelchair down on the second floor.</br>
</br>
A red hue appeared on Sun Xiaorou’s face as she lightly closed her eye.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! That’s because… we are the only family left. Therefore…"</br>
</br>
Then, she opened her eyes as she naughtily looked at Jiang Chen. "Therefore, please make my sister happy."</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen laughed, he rolled her back to her room.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was the first person he met in this world and the first woman of his life. Regardless, he will make her happy.</br>
</br>
After going into Sun Xiaorou’s room, under her direction, Jiang Chen took out a box from the top drawer.</br>
</br>
Compared to the E-level nutrient supply that most survivors drink, the A-level nutrient supply made with fruit, vegetable and animal proteins didn’t taste too terrible. But to use fresh food to create nutrient supply, only Jiang Chen could be this lavish.</br>
</br>
"Are you really not going to eat with us? Yao Yao’s cooking is great," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Although she couldn’t use her hand, if someone fed her, she could still eat.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou smiled, "If I eat, it is going to be really troublesome. I would need a urine straw when I need to go to the washroom if I want to do number two... it would be really inconvenient."</br>
</br>
Towards the end of her sentence, Sun Xiaorou’s face was burning.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also looked embarrassed as he looked away.</br>
</br>
He seemed to have asked an inappropriate question…</br>
</br>
After taking out the tubular nutrient supply, Jiang Chen opened the cap, but then, his hand froze in midair.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou gently closed her eyes with her slightly opened red lips raised. The red vibrancy could be faintly seen through her lips.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to feed me, brother-in-law?" Seeing that Jiang Chen hasn't moved, Sun Xiaorou opened one eye and playfully giggled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped as he put the test tube beside Sun Xiaorou’s mouth.</br>
</br>
Maybe because Jiang Chen had no experience in taking care of people, or he ignored the thickness of the nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
The speed he poured the nutrient supply was faster than the speed Sun Xiaorou could drink. Her eyebrows were slightly raised as her frail throat made a feeble gulping sound.</br>
</br>
"Cough, cough-"</br>
</br>
"Are you okay? "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately stopped.</br>
</br>
But then he noticed the thick liquid dripping from Sun Xiaorou’s mouth, her throat gulping, and the pure expression…</br>
</br>
This is too evil! Jiang Chen felt embarrassed for his sick minded thoughts.</br>
</br>
"It’s okay. Brother-in-law’s action was bit aggressive…" Finally gulping down the thickness in her mouth, Sun Xiaorou smiled.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I’ll go get your sister to feed you." To hide himself from being hard, Jiang Chen closed his legs discreetly as he awkwardly smiled.</br>
</br>
"No." The pouted mouth immediately turned up. Sun Xiaorou used her coy eyes to look at Jiang Chen. "Brother-in-law, I am hungry."</br>
</br>
This devil…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suppressed himself as he fed the remaining nutrient supply to her. With a conflicted but turned on mood, Jiang Chen was about to leave.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen’s back, Sun Xiaorou gently said, "Can I tell you a secret?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Of course…" Jiang Chen stopped and turned his head.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou motioned for him to come closer. [Was it necessary? There is no one here.]</br>
</br>
Even if he thought that, Jiang Chen still followed her wish and put his ear beside her mouth.</br>
</br>
Feeling the gentle breath beside his ear, he felt a tingling sensation.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou’s face was burning, she took a deep breath as a smirk appeared on her face, "If sister becomes pregnant, I can help you. Although I can’t move my body…"</br>
</br>
When she was in the living room, she heard the conversation between Jiang Chen and her sister. Whatever was going on in her mind, she said these words naughtily.</br>
</br>
Like she had expected, Jiang Chen’s expression immediately froze as he was in dismay.</br>
</br>
"Girl, what are you thinking." Jiang Chen didn’t know what to say as he pinched her nose before escaping in panic.</br>
</br>
Watching the door close, the corner of Sun Xiaorou’s mouth curved up as she softly closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
She savored the sweetness in her mouth as her face flushed red.</br>
</br>
"Such a gentle person…"</br>
</br>
Although she knew it was not right to tease the person her sister liked.</br>
</br>
But such a good character made people...</br>
</br>
The urine straw below the wheelchair had one centimeter of transparent liquid come out.</br>
</br>
From its color, it was definitely not urine.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came downstairs to the dining room, Sun Jiao and the rest had already started to eat.</br>
</br>
Just from the dishes on the table, he did not feel the atmosphere of the apocalypse at all. Especially the dark red pig trotters, just from the looks of it made Jiang Chen eager to eat as he walked to the table.</br>
</br>
Perhaps she had been used to Yao Yao’s delicious cooking, Sun Jiao’s etiquette was more delicate compared to when she first met Jiang Chen. Looking at her eating calmly in small portions, Jiang Chen could not see the old bold girl that would not even leave behind the soup in the can.</br>
</br>
But Lin Lin, on the other hand, was devouring through the dishes without any signs of decency. She completely ignored the late Jiang Chen. The way she ate was as if she wanted to make up for all the food she missed over the last twenty years.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen walk over, the nice Yao Yao filled Jiang Chen’s bowl full of rice and poured him a bowl of steamy lotus roots and pork ribs soup.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed Yao Yao’s hair as he smiled. "I can do it myself."</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen’s big hand rubbing her head, a soft smile appeared on Yao Yao’s adorable face.</br>
</br>
"The lotus roots soup is great. Also, if you drink it in the winter, your stomach will feel warm."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Yao Yao’s cooking is great," Jiang Chen praised her.</br>
</br>
The small loli timidly smiled as she buried her blushed face down.</br>
</br>
"Loli lover," Lin Lin and Sun Jiao focusing on their food both murmured in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
These two ridicules obviously didn’t escape the suspect’s ear.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen helplessly looked at Sun Jiao and Lin Lin as he defended innocently in his mind.</br>
</br>
[Am I that much of an animal…]</br>
</br>
After dinner, Jiang Chen went to Yao Yao’s room as he gave the task of cracking the EP memory chip to the little girl.</br>
</br>
When she heard she could help big brother out again, Yao Yao energetically took over the memory chip in Jiang Chen’s hand, raised her not so full chest, and promised Jiang Chen she would complete the task.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased when she saw the enthusiasm from Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Compared to the Lin Lin, who constantly demand pudding, the willing Yao Yao was almost like an angel.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The night was dark. Sun Jiao sneaked out of bed.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao looked at her sister’s peaceful face as a proud smile appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
She wore thin as veil pajamas. Sun Jiao quietly walked to the door, sneaked out of the bedroom. and gently closed the door.</br>
</br>
But not long after, the door opened again.</br>
</br>
A figure clearly not Sun Jiao sneaked inside.</br>
</br>
With the creek of the door waking Sun Xiaorou up, she opened her eyes and watched the man walk beside the bed.</br>
</br>
"Where is your sister?" With excitement, Jiang Chen lowered his voice and asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
"She is sleeping in her own room," with lips unnoticeably curved up, Sun Xiaorou mimicked Sun Jiao’s voice.</br>
</br>
It has to be mentioned that the sisters’ looked really similar. The slight difference was faded by the blurry night. What was more troubling was that they were not only similar in appearance, but also in voice.</br>
</br>
As long as she lowered her voice and added a hint of maturity to the light and soft tone, they didn’t sound very different.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard Sun Xiaorou was not there to disturb them, Jiang Chen was naturally ecstatic.</br>
</br>
With a smirk, he approached her ear and gently breathed in while using an intimate tone.</br>
</br>
"Tonight, I will c*m in you until you are pregnant."</br>
</br>
With face burning, Sun Xiaorou’s lips trembled as she couldn’t say a word.</br>
</br>
The sheet was lifted as she felt something sneak inside. At the same time, she felt something press her chest tightly.</br>
</br>
She lightly moaned as she felt the warmness on her chest. However, Sun Xiaorou slightly frowned.</br>
</br>
When he usually did it with her sister, was he always so direct?</br>
</br>
For some reason, she impulsively wanted to play with fire.</br>
</br>
If she didn’t remind Jiang Chen and continued to pretend like this, when would he figure out that she was not her sister?</br>
</br>
The thing that happened in the basement, followed by the fusion of her memories made it fade out of her mind. She just faintly remembers that with rough force, he took away her first time.</br>
</br>
The intimate thought circled her mind as it lured her. Since my first time was taken away by him, a second time would be okay…</br>
</br>
But just as she closed her eyes, preparing to let the story develop further, the warmness surrounding her chest retracted.</br>
</br>
"You… are not Sun Jiao?" He pulled his hands away as he asked awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Although it was impossible to tell with the lights off.</br>
</br>
But the chest was clearly not right!</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao was at least a 36D, but those seemed to be only a bit bigger than a B.</br>
</br>
Seeing she could no longer pretend, Sun Xiaorou giggled. "That’s right, brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Someone knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
With bear pajamas, Yao Yao rubbed her blurred eyes and walked to the door in her rabbit slippers.</br>
</br>
"Woo? It’s late, is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao suspiciously scanned Yao Yao’s neat clothes a few times.</br>
</br>
"Is Jiang Chen not here?"</br>
</br>
"I wish he was here." Yao Yao pouted her mouth as she threw a small tantrum.</br>
</br>
To Sun Jiao "occupying" big brother, the small loli was never too happy about it. They had discussed before that they must "feed" the big bad guy to make sure he stays on this side. But now, the delicious "ribs" were all "eaten" by sister Sun Jiao. As the small animal, she couldn’t even drink the soup.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn’t realize Yao Yao’s tantrum as she tilted her head in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Where did he go? Could it be… Lin Lin? Eh? Where are you going?" Looking at the small loli suddenly going downstairs, Sun Jiao was puzzled.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao turned around and nodded seriously. "Just in case, let’s go check Lin Lin’s room."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn’t know why Yao Yao all the sudden was more keen on this than herself as they went downstairs.</br>
</br>
Not long after, the furious roar of Lin Lin being woken up came from downstairs.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao pushed open the door, yawned, and returned to her bedroom.</br>
</br>
In the end, the three people that searched the entire mansion concluded that Jiang Chen may have returned to sleep in the modern world. Therefore, concluding the unrest caused by Sun Jiao sneaking out of her bed.</br>
</br>
As she quietly climbed into bed, Sun Jiao confirmed the peacefulness on her sister’s face as a gentle smile appeared on her face. She lightly combed the hair strands in front of her forehead and kissed her on the forehead.</br>
</br>
"Sister, you are still not asleep?" Sun Xiaorou opened her eyes as she blinked her bright eyes at her sister.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Are you awake?" Seeing her sister suddenly wake up, Sun Jiao slid back, embarrassed.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, just woke up."</br>
</br>
"Uhh, sorry, did I wake you up?"</br>
</br>
When she heard her sister’s words, Sun Xiaorou shook her head and giggled. "No, I just had a dream."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao caringly held on to her sister’s hand, "Dream? Did you have a bad dream?"</br>
</br>
But Sun Xiaorou shook her head again, "No, it was a sweet dream."</br>
</br>
Then, a red hue appeared on her cheeks.</br>
</br>
"He is a really gentle person."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Ten days have passed by since Jiang Chen withdrew most of the soldiers.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere at Camp 27 was like any other day, but inside Fallout Shelter 027, the atmosphere was peculiar.</br>
</br>
There was not a single person inside the four resident areas. The hallways connecting each area was also empty, no one was wiping the almost shining walls and floors anymore.</br>
</br>
Where did everyone go?</br>
</br>
Contrary to the deserted residential areas, the industrial area was jam-packed with people. Standing on the stairs looking down, there was a sea of people. With a rough estimate, excluding the one hundred residents that moved up to the surface already, the remaining sixteen hundred residents in the fallout shelter were all here.</br>
</br>
Because of the high density of the people, the environment was terrible here.</br>
</br>
There were children crying and enraged conversations. There were people sitting in the corner with their luggage, and someone people even made a bed on the ground with the intention fo staying long term.</br>
</br>
The twenty people security force stood on the high ground as they were on high alert with their weapons ready.</br>
</br>
They never faced a situation like this. Nor did they know how to deal with it. The saving grace was, the residents' emotions remain restrained as they didn’t show any aggressive gestures.</br>
</br>
At that time, the door opened.</br>
</br>
With two soldiers beside him, Tian Feng walked in.</br>
</br>
Because of his work in obtaining the nuclear fusion core, he was appointed by Han Junhua as the chief commander of the security force and replaced the previous commander assigned by the old leader. He was responsible for the security and defense tasks in the fallout shelter. When he heard the gathering happening in the industrial area, he immediately rushed over.</br>
</br>
Seeing their commander walk in, the twenty soldiers stood up straight and gave him a standard PAC salute.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng returned one as he passed the row of soldiers and walked beside the barrier on the stairs. He began to frown looking down at the enraged crowd.</br>
</br>
"What do they want to do?" Tian Feng asked the soldiers beside him.</br>
</br>
"They are protesting," the young soldier heard the commander’s question as he replied truthfully.</br>
</br>
"Protest?" Tian Feng frowned. As he was just about to ask what they were protesting about, he heard a roar from the crowd.</br>
</br>
"We demand an explanation!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! Get Han Junhua to come out."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Tian Feng looked at the angry faces. Although he was puzzled, he immediately realized the situation was odd.</br>
</br>
"What are they protesting about?" With voice lowered, he asked the young soldier.</br>
</br>
The young man had a glimpse of hesitation, but he gritted his teeth and spoke.</br>
</br>
"Someone said… The leader established a program in her EP and connect the lock permission of the fallout shelter door with her life signal."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Is that it?" Tian Feng was confused.</br>
</br>
"Also…" Since he already started, the young man was not afraid the commander may be angry as he spilled out everything he knew. Including Han Junhua used the leader’s permission to take all the residents’ life as a hostage, the resident assembly being dissolved, and the residents demanding an explanation for all her actions.</br>
</br>
When he heard the entire story, Tian Feng gasped for air.</br>
</br>
One, because he was shocked by the amount of information revealed behind the rumors, and two, because there was a conspiracy hidden behind the spread of these rumors.</br>
</br>
Seeing the silent commander, the young man hesitated for a moment and said, "Commander."</br>
</br>
"What is it?"</br>
</br>
"What they are saying… Is It true?"</br>
</br>
From his eyes, Tian Feng saw a hint of confusion.</br>
</br>
That confusion made him feel an inexplicable fear.</br>
</br>
"Don’t trust the rumors. Control the situation here. I’ll report to the leader."</br>
</br>
He hastily assigned the task to the soldiers as he was about to turn around to go to Han Junhua’s office.</br>
</br>
But then, Wu Yaguo came out of the crowd and stood in front of him.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng noticed there was a bruise on his face.</br>
</br>
"The residents demand an explanation," Wu Yaguo fearlessly stared into Tian Feng’s eyes as he said loudly.</br>
</br>
"The leader of the fallout shelter had no need to justify her actions, but I trust that leader Han will give you a satisfactory response." Because he was still lost about the situation, Tian Feng gave a procedural response.</br>
</br>
But obviously, no one was pleased with his response.</br>
</br>
"Yeah? I hope so," Wu Yaguo sneered.</br>
</br>
"Could you guys go back first?" Tian Feng knew that Wu Yaguo was reputable among the residents, so he lowered his voiced as he tried to persuade him.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo locked his eyes on Tian Feng. "After knowing the truth behind this event, do you think that’s a possibility?"</br>
</br>
Tian Feng couldn’t say a word. His throat moved before he turned around walking away.</br>
</br>
As he watched Tian Feng leave, the rage in Wu Yaguo’s eyes was tinted with a hint of hatred.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Someone leaked the news and revealed all the details of the negotiation.</br>
</br>
The entire fallout shelter was a mess. No one dared to sleep in their bedrooms anymore. No one was willing to be the sacrifice, the betting chip for someone else’s survival. Therefore, everyone gathered in the industrial area and slept together on the ground.</br>
</br>
But Han Junhua quickly controlled the situation as she ordered the security forces to forcefully remove the protestors and have everyone return to their duty within an hour.</br>
</br>
But during the process, someone shouted.</br>
</br>
"She is a dictator! She is trying to use everyone’s life to maintain her evil reign!"</br>
</br>
Immediately, everyone responded to that voice.</br>
</br>
"That’s right! The future of Fallout Shelter 027, should be determined by all the residents!"</br>
</br>
"He is right!"</br>
</br>
"The people from the Fishbone base is not as despicable as she described! She is a liar!"</br>
</br>
Shouting and screaming echoed between the cold steel walls as it unleashed the anger and suspicion in everyone’s hearts.</br>
</br>
When a situation has evolved to this point, a simple explanation will certainly not resolve it.</br>
</br>
The situation could no longer be controlled.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua was decisive with her plan. She ordered soldiers to use smoke bombs to forcefully evict the residents in the industrial area. To the people defying her order, Han Junhua used the leader’s permission to release sleeping mask to the industrial area and thrown all the unconscious people into detention for ten days.</br>
</br>
At the same time, she ordered to temporarily limit the freedom of Xu Lu as well as the five staffs as she tried to hide the internal turmoil inside the fallout shelter deep in the ground. Then, she sent out the security force to investigate the people who spread rumors, at the same time establishing a curfew. Any residents outside of the residential area after the lights were out will be thrown into detention for no less than five days.</br>
</br>
But not long after, the prison was full...</br>
</br>
Five hours later after the incident.</br>
</br>
The information from Camp 27 was sitting on Jiang Chen’s desk.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo was standing there as he looked at Jiang Chen in admiration.</br>
</br>
"Boss, you are too… How did that proverb go? Yes! Think like a god!"</br>
</br>
To the subordinate’s praise, Jiang Chen laughed without being humble at all.</br>
</br>
"What thinking like a god? I made people spread the news."</br>
</br>
Before she left, he orders Xu Lu to maintain a good relationship with the residents inside the fallout shelter. She must establish an image opposite of what Han Junhua was portraying. Therefore, the residents inside the fallout shelter will become suspicious of Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
Immediately, he used the mouth of a soldier at camp 27 to "unintentionally" leak the information of the negotiation.</br>
</br>
Once a third person knew about the secret, it was no longer a secret.</br>
</br>
Very quickly, the news spread from the surface to under the earth and spread like a virus inside the fallout shelter. At the same time, with rumors being exchanged, many different versions took form.</br>
</br>
The most widespread one –</br>
</br>
The leader of the fallout shelter, Han Juahua, used the permission granted by the fallout shelter terminal to take all the residents’ life as the hostage to force the peace-loving Jiang Chen to stay away from the fallout shelter. Or, she will execute the residents by batches until only herself is left in order to force the 'kind Jiang Chen’ to give up ground.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua, of course, clarified this and used the announcement system to notify all residents in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
But once trust has collapsed, it would be hard to establish. To Han Junhua’s clarification, with Wu Yaguo leading as the ex-residents representative, he demanded Han Junhua display the terminal use history but was rejected. Because she did something similar to the rumors, it would be impossible to clarify her actions.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Fallout Shelter 027 was a complete mess.</br>
</br>
But what Jiang Chen didn’t expect was for this moment to come so rapidly.</br>
</br>
It only took ten days before the relationship between Han Junhua and the residents got to the freezing point.</br>
</br>
How deep was this grudge…</br>
</br>
"Boss, do we need to send troops now to support the resident assembly, help them uprise against Han Junhua, and then use this opportunity-" Cheng Weiguo passionately suggested.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he signaled not to rush things.</br>
</br>
"No need to rush. It is because we have left that they dare to be in the process of transitioning. If we return, they would no longer be a mess."</br>
</br>
"But those residents without any weapons, would they have the ability to overthrown Han Junhua’s regime?" Cheng Weiguo was puzzled.</br>
</br>
The fallout shelter leader possessed all permission to the fallout shelter, including the ability to release sleeping gas, control sentry guns, control any of the doors, and most importantly the rights to control the security force. Cheng Weiguo who had stayed in a fallout shelter before knew this point clearly.</br>
</br>
In this case, without external help, the residents stood no chance at all.</br>
</br>
"Old Cheng, how many years did Fallout Shelter 027 exist for?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Twenty years," Cheng Weiguo answered without hesitation.</br>
</br>
"Yes, twenty years. So the people that were twenty at the time would be forty now right?"</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo looked at Jiang Chen, unsure of what he was alluding to.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen continued in a lighthearted voice.</br>
</br>
"The security force inside the fallout shelter, it is no longer the security force formed by PAC soldiers. At least, the new recruit would make up more than half right?"</br>
</br>
"What’s the problem with that?"</br>
</br>
"Would the new recruits point their guns at their parents for Han Junhua?" Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 308: Decoding the Password</br>
</div></br>
When Jiang Chen came out of the community center, the sun had already set.</br>
</br>
The past few days, he has spent the day in the community center and with the help from Wang Qin, became familiarized with the specifics of the base. Following the expansion of the base, the weaknesses in the existing foundation of the base were starting to show.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, the major infrastructures of the Fishbone base were two warehouses. Thus, a warehouse manager was more than enough to control the supplies of the base. The cafeteria was looked over by Zhou Jiexi, and a big pot of porridge along with some leaves was enough to feed everyone. The base's thirty survivors' primary duties were building things. Lu Huasheng was responsible for the construction of the base and also took on the responsibility of managing the survivors.</br>
</br>
The simple management system was effective in the small-scale base, but once the population increased, flaws were exposed.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen certainly made some changes, such as the pyramid-shaped citizen structure and the establishment of a standalone logistics department to manage the supplies of the base, following the two population explosions, (Shenxiang town colony and Qingpu survivors), the existing organizational structure was chaotic and unsustainable.</br>
</br>
The base had encountered a lot of things either "no one knew who should be responsible for it" or "there were not enough people to take care of it". During these times, Jiang Chen also happened not to be around, and so Sun Jiao made most of the decisions. As the "Duchess of the leader" and "formal well-known lone traveler", her ability and reputation could certainly handle the small problems. But once the base grew bigger, the casual decision-making process would obviously not work.</br>
</br>
Therefore, two imperative tasks were placed in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Establish law or change the structure.</br>
</br>
Law is the basis of rules. The reason why the Fishbone base had no security problems as of now was mostly because of Jiang Chen's personal influence as well as the honorary chip's absolute constraint on the "knight class". These constraints would weaken with time and as the population continues to grow, therefore creating laws was imperative.</br>
</br>
It was also simple to understand a change in structure. It comprised of creating a concise and effective organizational structure that managed all survivors in the Fishbone base as well as its jurisdictions.</br>
</br>
The sooner these tasks were completed, the better it was for the Fishbone. Therefore he had been working until sunset every day before returning to the mansion.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Just like before, when he returned to the mansion, Yao Yao had already put the steamy dishes on the table. Sun Jiao and Lin Lin also sat around the dinner table, waiting for Jiang Chen before they started to eat.</br>
</br>
</br>
After dinner, Yao Yao excitedly dragged Jiang Chen to her bedroom.</br>
</br>
The ten days of hard work finally paid off. The small loli finally cracked the password and copied all the information from the EP memory chip to a graphene chip.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen took over the chip as he rubbed Yao Yao's head lovingly.</br>
</br>
"Eh, hehe." She timidly smiled as she buried her head. While enjoying Jiang Chen's compliment, her hands played with her dress.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the cards. Due to his eagerness of wanting to read the information inside, he was about to leave. However, as he turned around, he felt a weak force tug at his shirt.</br>
</br>
"Hmm? Is there something wrong?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao who was holding onto him and was quite puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Hmm… Can… Can I demand an unreasonable request?" Her cheery like mouth opened, and her adorable face blushed as if blood was about to drip out.</br>
</br>
While looking at Yao Yao shy expression, Jiang Chen already knew what was on her mind.</br>
</br>
With a smirk on his face, Jiang Chen held the cute face in his hands as he kissed her lips.</br>
</br>
"Wooo! Wo…"</br>
</br>
Just like a startled rabbit, Yao Yao's body tensed up. She feebly moved a bit before her entire body was paralyzed in a warm hug and she obediently closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
As if all her strength followed the sweet liquid and was extracted by her loving big brother…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen who possessed all control sniffed the fragrance wafting from her hair as he freely conquered her softness and drawn in the savory juice.</br>
</br>
Lips parted.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen drew a transparent silk from the petite tongue.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao who escaped from Jiang Chen's hug feebly gathered her breath. From the lighting of the room, there was a hint of silvery liquid on the tip of her soft lips. Her face revealed her embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Are you satisfied?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's face became redder.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Jiang Chen put his ear beside Yao Yao's mouth.</br>
</br>
"I just… wanted a hug."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After returning to his bedroom, Jiang Chen inserted the graphene memory chip into the full sensory computer and waited to read the encrypted files.</br>
</br>
The folder was surprisingly empty. It didn't contain a large number of secret files as he had first imagined.</br>
</br>
An EP ability report, an electronic map, a mission brief, as well as a note.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only scanned the ability report with a medium to high ability rating. After he confirmed that the bearded man was called He Wenhu, he closed the document.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen pressed on the full sensory screen and selected the electronic map.</br>
</br>
Just from the appearance, this map didn't look too different compared to a normal survivor's map. However, after some close examination, he found some odd signs on the map. On the outskirt of the city center, near Songjiang area, there was a red question mark.</br>
</br>
"Question mark?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Normally, survivors would not run to a city center. It was just a nuclear crater there. Not only were the zombies and mutants dangerous, but the radiation level was also shockingly high.</br>
</br>
If people really ventured there, then there was only one possibility. Something must be there!</br>
</br>
Because of the limited intel, Jiang Chen couldn't think of a logical explanation, so he turned his attention to the mission brief and note.</br>
</br>
&lt;Cooperate with Lin Chaoen and assist him in entering Fallout Shelter 027. Then take back the "happy times" drug ingredient list. That thing is critical to our business. A lot of fools will want to experience the happy times before the war.</br>
</br>
Additionally, think twice when you do things. Try to figure out what that guy is up to. You know it is better for the drug's ingredient list to be in the hands of one person.&gt;</br>
</br>
From this point alone, the people from Crimson Chamber of Commerce and Lin Chaoen seem to have their own agendas. But regardless of their plot, Jiang Chen will not give away fallout shelter 027.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the mission brief and opened the note.</br>
</br>
The note seemed to only be jot notes of information. However, within them, he found some useful information.</br>
</br>
&lt;01. Whenever he drank nutrient supplies he would always hide from us. Is this something that needs to be kept a secret?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;02. He still won't say what is actually inside Fallout Shelter 027.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;03. This is terrifying. I saw with my own eyes that he used the surgery table to dissect a living human into bones, and then replace it with machine parts. Is that a digitalized human? I feel there is a difference compared to the descriptions from before the war.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;04. Sometimes he is extremely abnormal. Of course, instincts are telling me what he is trying to do has no conflict with our business… But just in case, I still tracked the coordinates of his signal.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;05. He seems to look down on me? Not only me… regardless, it is hard to feel positive towards him with the contempt in his eyes.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;06. I have a feeling… I am being serious, he gives me a weird feeling. Sometime I would constantly think about the problem, this guy… is he really human?&gt;</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When he saw the last line, Jiang Chen's face looked rather odd.</br>
</br>
The bearded man had certainly guessed right, Lin Chaoen was not a human at all, but a machine.</br>
</br>
Different from the digitalized human, Lin Lin, he had no traces of cells in his body. Jiang Chen confirmed multiple times. Even the "meat" on the mechanical skeleton was made by silica gels replicating the feeling of skin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened that map again to confirm the red question market located on the outskirt of the city center.</br>
</br>
"Is there something here?"</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, Jiang Chen also marked the location on his EP.</br>
</br>
After putting away the full sensory computer, he immediately left the mansion.</br>
</br>
Returning to his office in the community center, Jiang Chen called Cheng Weiguo who just finished eating.</br>
</br>
Not long after, Cheng Weiguo appeared in front of Jiang Chen's office desk.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned on his EP map and showed Cheng Weiguo the marked area.</br>
</br>
"I want to send people to explore this area, do you have any good recommendations?"</br>
</br>
"The city center?" Cheng Weiguo stared at the location as he rubbed his chin with his eyebrows raised. "That place is not Qingpu, the mutants and zombies are more dangerous there. Oh, is it okay if we just get an aerial view?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was dumbfounded before he came to a sudden realization.</br>
</br>
Right, the Fishbone base has a helicopter. Although it had been modified to a helicopter gunship, it was still capable of performing a reconnaissance mission.</br>
</br>
"How's pilot training?"</br>
</br>
Chu Nan was acting as his representative at the Sixth Street, the mission of operating the helicopter would naturally fall to other people.</br>
</br>
"We have two fully trained people who were personally taught by Chu Nan. They just flew the helicopter from the Sixth Street a few days ago. Based on his description, while the two pilots are still a bit lacking in experience, their knowledge base is there." Cheng Weiguo smiled.</br>
</br>
"Ok, keep an eye on this. Report to me immediately if there are any results."</br>
</br>
"Yes." Cheng Weiguo saluted.</br>
</br>
But then, the phone on the table began to ring.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo stopped.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, as if he had been expecting something, had a glimpse of joy on his face. He grabbed the phone and put it by his ear.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"General! The elevator, the elevator stopped!" Wang Zhaowu's alerted voice came from the other side.</br>
</br>
In Jia city, thirty kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The Dusk along with the mutated humans at the Seventh Area conducted a coordinated attack on the Defenders in Jia city.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans like ogres walked out of a sci-fi movie walked through the shambles. They were equipped with steel armors, heavy machineguns, as well as the magazines around their waste, displaying a daunting light as they moved steadily towards the Defenders area of control.</br>
</br>
</br>
Behind the troops, a mutated human, as well as a human, stood side by side on a hill piled up by broken concrete pieces as they gazed at the fires not so far away.</br>
</br>
The mutated human, Troy, was the leader of Seventh Area. The man, Bo Yu, was the leader of Dusk.</br>
</br>
"I have never imagined that a mutated human and a human could walk together in unity." Troy cracked a smile on his hideous face towards the human in a fur coat.</br>
</br>
With his hands behind his back, the Blood Lion's mane swayed in the winter breeze as the corner of Bo Yu's mouth also carved into a smile.</br>
</br>
"Based on common sense, it is hard to understand. But as long as a small perspective is changed, we can all live together."</br>
</br>
Just like the smart dog and human.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, both sides shared the same thought.</br>
</br>
The mutated human needed the supplies and firearms provided by Dusk, and Dusk required the fearless warriors of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
The victor in the distant battle had already been decided. Although the remaining human survivors used the bunker to fire back at the mutated humans, the defiant's fire was quickly extinguished by the hoard of mutated humans.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, what is that on your finger?" While looking at the bloody red gem on Bo Yu's finger, Troy asked casually.</br>
</br>
"Guess." Bo Yu smiled.</br>
</br>
"It is definitely not diamond. It is similar to a crystal, but I have never seen a red crystal before," Troy said.</br>
</br>
"It is a nuke." Bo Yu used a joking voice to state the not so funny reality.</br>
</br>
Troy cracked a smile as he obviously didn't think what he had said was real.</br>
</br>
At the same time, an unexpected blast from ten meters away sent concrete debris into the air.</br>
</br>
"Go die! Traitor!"</br>
</br>
Followed by a thunderous roar, a survivor with blood all over his face leaped out of the shambles. His expression was grim and the wound that stopped bleeding burst again due to his angry outburst.</br>
</br>
But in his hands was just an outdated assault rifle!</br>
</br>
Troy just glanced at the person expressionlessly as he put out his hand to guard Bo Yu behind him. But the hand was surprisingly pushed away by Bo Yu.</br>
</br>
Troy did not have time to be shocked before bullets began to be fired at Bo Yu.</br>
</br>
The reality soon proved that he had time to be shocked.</br>
</br>
The dark green veil formed a net beside him. The orange bullets, like mosquitos, were trapped within the spider web.</br>
</br>
The expression on the person's face froze.</br>
</br>
Unable to react, he saw a crystal fly across his vision.</br>
</br>
The green light suddenly contracted before expanding as it blew into a field of green particles.</br>
</br>
"This is an odd ability." Troy looked at the mist of blood that has splashed everywhere and smiled grimly at Bo Yu.</br>
</br>
"We just walked further along on this path," Bo Yu said nonchalantly as he put his hands back into his pocket.</br>
</br>
The Klein particle was connected to the warp drive.</br>
</br>
As a firm escapist, Dusk was further on the path of warp drives.</br>
</br>
"On another note, I remember you initially didn't plan to attack Wanghai city to find Fallout Shelter 005 at Qingpu? Why did you suddenly change your mind and decided to help us solve our trouble in Jia city." Troy asked.</br>
</br>
"Because a problematic force is blocking Qingpu," Bo Yu said.</br>
</br>
He was naturally referring to Fishbone base. Troy also knew this.</br>
</br>
Troy remembered the heavy casualties he suffered in front of Zhufeng Highway as he also was angered.</br>
</br>
They didn't lose on force, but rather on underestimating the enemy.</br>
</br>
But he still didn't recognize the essence of the problem. They didn't lose just on underestimating the enemy, but rather on intelligence. If they built the camp more scattered, they would not be in the situation where one bomb would send half of the camp up into the sky.</br>
</br>
"When would we push back?" A grim smile appeared on Troy's face.</br>
</br>
That smile was filled with the desire for revenge.</br>
</br>
"Once you use the survivors of Jia city to create a two thousand mutated human force. The supplies from the north would also arrive around that time," Bo Yu said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Just like Troy, the name also annoyed him, but he was used to not displaying his emotion on his face.</br>
</br>
Not only did two hundred thousand crystals go down the drain, now he had to invest in more supplies to help the mutated humans in Jia city to replenish their "population".</br>
</br>
But what pained him the most was Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
Ten something years ago, the organization used all of its efforts to obtain a "sample" from Fallout Shelter 071, and they just lost one.</br>
</br>
The last few fires died down on the battlefield, just like the life of the Defenders.</br>
</br>
When the battle ended, Bo Yu looked in the direction of Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen?" Murmuring to himself, he narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Inside the dark pupils, a dangerous light shone.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The riot occurred at night.</br>
</br>
Although the fallout shelter without sunshine had no concept of night.</br>
</br>
It was only five hours after the security force forcefully removed the residents from the industrial area before the detention room inside the fallout shelter was stuffed full of protestors.</br>
</br>
No one could bear that while they slept, a sharp sword could fall down anytime and hang above their heads. The ventilation that no one had paid attention to for twenty-something years has now become a gun pointed at them.</br>
</br>
A gun sprouted in people's hearts.</br>
</br>
Reality had proven that when everyone could not stand the same question, people become more courageous than they imagined.</br>
</br>
The security force was comprised of less than one hundred people and was limited in power. Additionally, most of the soldiers were born in the fallout shelter. They didn't feel the obligation of the PAC. Compared to the emotionless and distant Han Junhua, they missed the kind and warm old leader. To the residents that protested, they not only felt compassion, but they were also supportive of their cause.</br>
</br>
Compassion in breaching the rules would never occur in a PAC force, but they were not a force to begin with.</br>
</br>
The resident assembly was re-establish again. Although they didn't receive permission from the fallout shelter terminal, they received support from all the residents. Under the leadership of ex-representative Wu Yaguo, in the name of justice, a mission detail was spread among the residents.</br>
</br>
An hour to overthrow the dictatorship! An hour to renegotiate!</br>
</br>
When the rumor of the mission started to spread, a few people already started to plot. But to the events occurring among the residents, Han Junhua was not clueless.</br>
</br>
The external threat was already there.</br>
</br>
This would be one move to eliminate the internal threat.</br>
</br>
First, it was to shatter the sword.</br>
</br>
The power system was temporarily out, which triggered the emergency protocol to use the backup battery. Although the power outage during this transition only lasted for a short ten minutes, the short ten minutes was enough for a lot of things to happen.</br>
</br>
The entire fallout shelter was in sudden darkness.</br>
</br>
The elevator was stuck underground which prevented any interaction between the underground and the surface. The mechanical engine of the fallout shelter door was also destroyed by maintenance workers which eliminated the possibility of Han Junhua closing the door. Due to part of the security force joining the rebellion, all the residents joined forces in the grand hall of the fallout shelter. Therefore, even if the power had returned after ten minutes, Han Junhua releasing the sleep gas to the entire fallout shelter would be futile.</br>
</br>
The sword that hung above everyone's head was completed eliminated.</br>
</br>
Then, there will be discipline!</br>
</br>
</br>
80% of the security force chose to join the temporary assembly. 20% of the previous PAC security force swore to protect. Both parties engaged in intense gunfire along the major hallways as they pushed towards the fallout shelter leader's office.</br>
</br>
The residents first occupied the armory and opened the detention room. Just like the conquering Bastille, the united residents released the imprisoned warriors. The warriors cheered as they armed themselves with the weapons.</br>
</br>
Two hundred residents in gas masks and automatic rifles joined in the battle as the scale tipped towards the fallout residents' side.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng led the last remaining ten soldiers in the valiant fight. They were the first group of soldiers that entered the fallout base. Twenty years ago they were just young men who recently joined the army, now they were at the age where they should have retired. They had planned for the worst, such as encountering NATO soldiers that would break into the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
But what they didn't expect was, during their last call, they had to face the residents they protected.</br>
</br>
It was a suffocating feeling.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng fiercely fired back as he tried not to remember the names that belonged to the faces in front of him.</br>
</br>
But he couldn't.</br>
</br>
Within the crosshairs, he saw the child from his neighbor. He still remembered the teen had said he wanted to be a botanist when the day the fallout shelter opened. He wanted to look at the grass grow. Wanted to see how resilient the radiation-contaminated grass was.</br>
</br>
But he had already died, he had fallen in the pool of blood yet to be cool.</br>
</br>
And him, and him, and even her…</br>
</br>
"Ahhh!"</br>
</br>
Finally, someone couldn't resist the mental torture. A soldier ran out of cover and frantically fired with his rifle.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! Come back!" But Tian Feng didn't manage to stop him as he watched a few blood holes appear on his own comrade's body with his own eyes.</br>
</br>
He died, but there was no agony on his face.</br>
</br>
Tian Feng smashed into the wall and ducked into cover. His chest pumped violently up and down while he tried to regather his breath.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! Cough, cough!" Spit mixed with blood splashed on the wall.</br>
</br>
He didn't know who to curse, or who should be cursed.</br>
</br>
The noise of bullets was all that could be heard.</br>
</br>
At that moment, everyone was mute.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Within the leader's office, through the bulletproof glass, Han Junhua silently watched the battle inches away from her.</br>
</br>
Too weak.</br>
</br>
Not even considered a small regional conflict.</br>
</br>
Pre-war, she had commanded a battalion of mechanical paratroopers to suppress a riot planned by NATO on the PAC border. The gore she had seen, a hell far bloodier than this, she had seen them too many times.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, she felt her heart ache.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin stood beside her as he silently gazed out the window.</br>
</br>
The shaking figure along with the young figure created a vivid contrast.</br>
</br>
Just like father and daughter.</br>
</br>
Long after, Han Junhua spoke, "Are you not going to stand on the side of the residents?"</br>
</br>
Academician Qin shook his head. "I stand by the truth."</br>
</br>
"is that so?" Han Junhua looked surprisingly at the elderly man in his final remaining years.</br>
</br>
"Because the truth is always the most difficult to accept, the people searching for the truth is always the most lonely."</br>
</br>
"That's really disappointing." Han Junhua looked out the window emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
The sparks from the bullets jumped between the cold steel walls, reflected among the angry pupils. The soldiers still loyal to her constantly suffered defeat, they had no more backup.</br>
</br>
"Human nature is the burden of survival, but without this burden, civilization would not be born."</br>
</br>
"Do you want to say, I am wrong?" Han Junhua was straightforward.</br>
</br>
"You are not wrong, but not correct."</br>
</br>
Not wrong, but not correct? Han Juahua repeatedly chewed on those words in her mind, even though she knew there wasn't any purpose in thinking about it.</br>
</br>
After moments of silence, Han Junhua asked, "You know in the beginning that this would be the result right?"</br>
</br>
He was always more silent compared to anyone else, but he always knew the situation better.</br>
</br>
She began to be suspicious.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin didn't deny it, but his smile was bitter.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I don't deny it."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Han Junhua didn't look at him as she still used an emotionless voice to ask.</br>
</br>
"I thought you had realized a long time ago." Academician Qin sighed.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua was waiting for the elderly man to continue, but he didn't speak anymore.</br>
</br>
"Even in the last moment, you can't tell me the reason?" Han Juahua asked.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin only used silence to answer her.</br>
</br>
"I have been thinking about a question for a long time. The candidate for the leaders of the fallout shelter, is it based on careful consideration?"</br>
</br>
"You can think of it that way," Academician Qin said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"I used the supercomputer at the fallout shelter before to recreate the mathematical model of the population growth curve and the energy consumption speed, but the result I received surprised me… From the start, the energy of the fallout shelter was not enough. Right?"</br>
</br>
Academician Qin did not answer.</br>
</br>
But in a situation like this, silence was admitting by default.</br>
</br>
Looking at the expression on Han Junhua, he knew that she had already guessed it.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin let out a sigh as he gently said.</br>
</br>
"Could you not serve your duty until the final moment?"</br>
</br>
The voice carried a hint of pleading.</br>
</br>
"Okay," Han Juahua said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin asked in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Are you not afraid?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
"It's only death."</br>
</br>
Outside the window, Tian Feng had already fallen.</br>
</br>
With one hand against the wall, blood dripped from his arms.</br>
</br>
He struggled as he raised the pistol to aim with his blood covered left eye.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the clip was empty, no bullets came from the dark muzzle.</br>
</br>
In that instant, a rioter dashed in front of him, he swung the fire axe and chopped off his head. Blood dripped along the axe as the "hero" enjoyed the crowd's cheers and hugs.</br>
</br>
He swung the axe dripping with blood up with his strong arm. It was like the torch of the statue of liberty.</br>
</br>
Throwing the bulletproof vest away, Han Junhua silently watched the last scene.</br>
</br>
She noticed the person with the axe smiling insolently at her.</br>
</br>
As if it was the smile of the statue of liberty.</br>
</br>
Human nature is the burden of survival, but if it were not for this burden, civilization would not exist. But once civilization is born, it must be accompanied by the gruesome brutality.</br>
</br>
She seemed to have understood something, but in the attempt to prolong a civilization, an individual's realization would not change anything.</br>
</br>
"At the end of the mission, can I ask you a final question?" Han Junhua gazed at him as she said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin was silent.</br>
</br>
"I will just assume you have agreed by default," Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
She walked to the window as she put her hand gently on the bulletproof window. The axe smashed onto the window where she had placed her finger in an aggressive act.</br>
</br>
She felt the light tremble from the tip of her finger as she slowly said.</br>
</br>
"Is the window specification of this room built to the lab's standard?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Although it was only a single word, it made Han Junhua's cold heart feel a trace of comfort.</br>
</br>
The rioters outside the window saw that they could not open the office door, so they brought the welding gun. From the crowd, she saw Wu Yaguo's face and the bruise on his face.</br>
</br>
"If you release the explosive gas, you have a chance at killing the people outside the door," Academician Qin abruptly said.</br>
</br>
"Is this part of the experiment?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
He didn't speak anymore as he gave the final choice to her.</br>
</br>
Like a pale experimental report was placed in front of her.</br>
</br>
Hypothesis: The rationale dictator in the final moment before she is overthrown. Would she choose the lunatic choice to die with everyone?</br>
</br>
Han Junhua closed her eyes as she carefully considered for a moment.</br>
</br>
"I will not do that."</br>
</br>
Experimental result: False.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Academician Qin nodded as a smile with a trace of comfort appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
At the end of the smile.</br>
</br>
The door collapsed.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 311: Naive</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The rioters broke into the room.</br>
</br>
The gun barrel smashed onto Han Junhua’s face as the single blow was enough to knock her unconscious. Then someone kicked her in the stomach and made her drop to the ground.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn’t feel surprised, she didn’t even feel frightened because she knew, the pain she was about to receive would far surmount these.</br>
</br>
Then, the "hero" ran up.</br>
</br>
He raised the ax, with a grim smile, and was about to cut off her limbs.</br>
</br>
But then, Wu Yaguo walked up and stopped the reckless "hero."</br>
</br>
"Wait, everyone. Calm down and listen to me!"</br>
</br>
When they heard Wu Yaguo’s shout, everyone stopped what they were doing.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua was on the ground with her face covered in bruises and blood, just in one minute, she was almost beaten to death by the angry rioters.</br>
</br>
She silently looked at Wu Yaguo as she knew he was not there to defend her. If that was the case, he should have come in first.</br>
</br>
"We are victorious, we are finally victorious!"</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo raised his arms as he used a passionate voice to shout.</br>
</br>
The celebration began to echo in the fallout shelter, people watched him as if he was the reason why they were victorious.</br>
</br>
"We used our hands to overthrow the despicable dictator’s reign. We will use our hands to create a brighter future. Yes, we will!"</br>
</br>
He desperately searched for the best phrases in his head as he tried to paint a bright future for the people. People watched him as if they were worshiping God. The "hero" also dropped his ax as he looked at him religiously.</br>
</br>
"…But before we can paint the picture, we need to put this criminal on trial."</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo looked at her.</br>
</br>
Everyone looked at her.</br>
</br>
"Kill her."</br>
</br>
"With fire."</br>
</br>
"No, her body should be hung."</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo silently listened to the voices by his ears as he looked at Han Junhua. He wanted to read fear from her eyes.</br>
</br>
But he was disappointed, he only saw calmness.</br>
</br>
The glimpse of anger quickly hid the mask of mercy.</br>
</br>
"Quiet everyone. Everyone calm down for a moment."</br>
</br>
He raised his hand as he signaled the crowd to quiet down.</br>
</br>
He pointed his finger at Han Junhua on the ground as he said in a loud voice.</br>
</br>
"I hate her. I want to kill with the cruelest way possible to express the anger in my heart…"</br>
</br>
The bruise on his face made the words that much more convincing.</br>
</br>
The "hero" on the side ripped off a piece of his broken shirt as he tied it on his bloody left arm, he then weighed the ax in his hand and smiled grimly at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
He was only waiting for an order. An order to chop her head off.</br>
</br>
But Han Junhua didn’t look at him from the beginning, she was just waiting quietly for something.</br>
</br>
"But I choose to forgive her."</br>
</br>
People looked at him in confusion.</br>
</br>
</br>
"We are the just, we are using the name of justice to uprise. We will punish her for her crime, but everything must be done through law, and not our emotions. I forgive her, but the law will punish her for her crime…"</br>
</br>
Listening to Wu Yaguo’s charismatic speech, Han Junhua smiled. Although her smile was undetectable under all the blood.</br>
</br>
The ability she couldn’t master – manipulating people.</br>
</br>
Without the need for technology, all can be done with a mouth.</br>
</br>
The bruise became a symbol of his, demonstrating his kindness and forgiveness. People trust that under his leadership, fallout shelter 027 would become a brighter tomorrow and put him on the "throne."</br>
</br>
As to Han Junhua, her permission was taken away.</br>
</br>
A few rioters with weapons walked off and forcefully dragged her up. Using her EP, they deactivated the order she had set and "granted" the permission of leader to Wu Yaguo. And Wu Yaguo put the handcuff on her and pushed the wounded her out the door.</br>
</br>
People stared at her in anger, people spat at her, and people attempted to throw garbage on her face.</br>
</br>
But the merciful new leader stopped all of this.</br>
</br>
"She will be punished but before that, we must make her live to the day when she will be punished."</br>
</br>
On the side, Academician Qin silently watched everything. No one troubled the respected elder as they courteously asked him to go back to his home. But before that, they demanded he sends his congratulatory words to the new regime. He did and the people supervising him left.</br>
</br>
Just like the wheels of history, inside the dark underground shelter, a familiar scene repeated itself.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Within the integration room.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua sat on the cold bench and stared at the ceiling blankly.</br>
</br>
Half a day has passed since the coup.</br>
</br>
No one interrogated her, no one treated her wounds, and no one fed her.</br>
</br>
But that was fine. Humans can survive for a few days without eating. As long as she still has a breath left, they were already being kind to her. Not to mention they were letting her spend the last remaining hours of her life in peace.</br>
</br>
But then the door opened.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua lifted her weary eyelids and she murmured in her mind: Finally here?</br>
</br>
But she was disappointed, it was someone she was familiar with.</br>
</br>
Feng Hui, the chief engineer of fallout shelter technology, responsible for the power infrastructure of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Feng Hui was afraid to look Han Junhua in the eyes, and so he lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"It was me… I removed the energy rod by one centimeter."</br>
</br>
Half of the success of this coup was attributable to him.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Sorry…"</br>
</br>
"Why do you need to apologize to me?" Han Junhua asked calmly.</br>
</br>
"I just feel, how should I say it, we should have a different leader… Maybe everyone’s life will be good?" Feng Hui scratched his head as he tried to coordinate the scattered words in his head.</br>
</br>
Just a feeling?</br>
</br>
Han Junhua ignored him as she continued to blank out.</br>
</br>
Feng Hui took out a nutrient supply from his pocket and started to gulp it down before he hesitantly looked behind him. He then walked in front of Han Junhua, frightened</br>
</br>
"Can you drink this."</br>
</br>
"Is the trial over?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
"No…"</br>
</br>
"This is not worth it." Han Junhua didn’t take his nutrient supply and closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
At the moment of victory to feel sympathetic to the dictator on trial. If it was not for the speech that Wu Yaguo had prepared beforehand, the anger of the residents may be passed onto him.</br>
</br>
But Feng Hui had a pleading expression.</br>
</br>
"I beg you, please drink this… At least, this will make me feel better."</br>
</br>
He may be sympathetic towards people’s uprising, but when he saw how miserable Han Junhua was being beaten by the crowd that had lost its rationality, his heart felt the torture of guilt.</br>
</br>
"I can’t."</br>
</br>
Just as Feng Hui wanted to try again to convince her, footsteps suddenly came from outside of the door.</br>
</br>
As he hurriedly put away the nutrient supply in his hand, two people walked into the dark detention room.</br>
</br>
It was the new leader Wu Yaguo, and the ambassador Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"Feng Hui? What are you doing here?" Wu Yaguo looked at Feng Hui beside Han Junhua as he slightly frowned.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu looked at Han Junhua with a smile on her face, she said, pleased.</br>
</br>
"Not bad, she is still alive."</br>
</br>
"Of course, we follow the law, and are not as reckless as this woman," Wu Yaguo said proudly.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? That’s perfect then." Xu Lu smiled.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo was happy, and Feng Hui also felt relieved.</br>
</br>
It was indeed a friendly signal, at least the Fishbone base maintained a supportive attitude to the new regime they had been established. This would make the negotiation more favorable for them. At least it yielded a positive result. This slightly comforted Feng Hui.</br>
</br>
Only Han Junhua was indifferent.</br>
</br>
The instant she saw the woman, she knew everything was over.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu walked in front of Han Junhua. Then using two fingers to hold up her chin, she gently turned her head to face her.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn’t resist, but her eyes were peaceful.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen wants to see you."</br>
</br>
When he heard Xu Lu’s words, Wu Yaguo had to warn her.</br>
</br>
"But, she is waiting to be put on trial…"</br>
</br>
"This is the pretense to maintain our friendship." Xu Lu straightened her body and looked at Wu Yaguo. "She threatened my leader before and used his mercy as the excuse for her dictatorship. She should be punished."</br>
</br>
When Wu Yaguo heard it was the pretense of their friendship, he was immediately conflicted.</br>
</br>
After half a minute of silence.</br>
</br>
"Will you punish her?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Xu Lu smiled.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo glanced at Feng Hui, "…Leave."</br>
</br>
Feng Hui felt relieved. Although he still felt guilty, he was happy he managed to dodge the bullet. He immediately escaped the place in quick steps.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo’s action was no different than when Feng Hui came in. He turned around to scan the door of the detention room. After ensuring that no one was listening, he lowered his voice to speak to Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"It will be hard to explain to the residents…"</br>
</br>
"You will earn an additional 30 energy rods for your residents in the upcoming negotiation, I believe that these energy rods will be enough for you to live prosperously for the next year. You know, our leader hates her. If he has the opportunity to personally punish her, we don’t care about this small price." Xu Lu smiled at Wu Yaguo as she painted a bright future for him.</br>
</br>
When he heard her words, Wu Yaguo’s eyes shone with an obvious ecstasy but he quickly calmed down.</br>
</br>
"Ahem. If it was 40, I believe the residents will understand Mr. Jiang Chen’s anger and they will make the necessary exception to the law. Since… it is shameful to deceive-"</br>
</br>
"35 rods. This is the furthest we will go." Xu Lu had a trace of frustration in her eyes.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was necessary to haggle. If they were too casual, it might cause him to be suspicious.</br>
</br>
35 energy rods per month. It was more than three times what Han Junhua has earned and it was more than enough to demonstrate his "wisdom".</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, Wu Yaguo nodded in "pain".</br>
</br>
Just like selling pork with a price on the shelf, what will be the final fate of the "wise" queen?</br>
</br>
Han Junhua quietly watched the two discuss. She was still expressionless.</br>
</br>
Before he left, Wu Yaguo looked at her for the final time with mockery.</br>
</br>
The eyes seemed to say. Unfortunately, I can’t enjoy the pain on your face.</br>
</br>
But Han Junhua’s expression was indifferent.</br>
</br>
"You don’t seem to be scared?" Xu Lu smiled.</br>
</br>
"When will we head out?" Han Junhua asked calmly.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu paused for a moment before the saint smile returned to her face.</br>
</br>
"Now would be good."</br>
</br>
Then, she turned around and headed for the door.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 312: This place has always been mine</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was only an hour drive between the Fishbone base and camp 27. However, because it was already the end of February, the snow on the ground was beginning to melt. Because of this, the zombies and mutants on the street began to feel unsettled.</br>
</br>
They encountered two Roshans on the streets which slowed the fleet down momentarily. Jiang Chen spent double the time to arrive at the camp.</br>
</br>
Standing on the outskirt of the concrete wall and looking up, Jiang Chen was impressed. Within less than fifteen days of construction, the camp had been developed to this point.</br>
</br>
When they saw it was Fishbone base’s fleet, the soldiers on the wall immediately opened the door and allowed the vehicles to pass.</br>
</br>
When they were inside the camp, Jiang Chen jumped out of the car as Xu Lu had been waiting for him.</br>
</br>
"We had some delays along the way. You didn’t wait for too long did you?’ Jiang Chen stood in front of her as he smiled.</br>
</br>
"Not at all, it is my pleasure to wait for you." Xu Lu shook her head as she naughtily nodded.</br>
</br>
"Haha, don’t be so uptight, briefly explain to me the situation… Let’s walk as we talk."</br>
</br>
"Okay, boss."</br>
</br>
The two of them walked to the center of the camp. Along the way, Xu Lu began to tell him the sudden changes underground.</br>
</br>
From the initial protest to controlling the embassy to the uprising…</br>
</br>
"How did boss know that the residents of the fallout shelter would become a mess on their own?" As she walked beside Jiang Chen, Xu Lu smiled joyfully at him, her eyes were filled with traces of worship.</br>
</br>
It was an enjoyable thing to be worshipped by such a beauty. Especially since Jiang Chen knew that with how clever Xu Lu was, she already knew the answer.</br>
</br>
"Instinct."</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen’s brief response, Xu Lu paused for a moment before her mouth carved up. "You are very comical."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In the middle of the camp, there was only a two-meter high concrete building. It was the command post for the Fishbone base at Camp 27.</br>
</br>
When they saw Jiang Chen walk inside, the two soldiers on patrol immediately saluted and opened the door for him.</br>
</br>
Just as the door opened, a wave of heat brushed across his face.</br>
</br>
"It is quite warm inside, there is no need to wear so many layers." Xu Lu smiled as she took off her winter suit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung his winter suit on the wall as he scanned the window while speaking in shock.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
The distributed but gentle temperature didn’t feel like it was a furnace, but rather the controllable heated walled in the mansion.</br>
</br>
But what was off was that along the supplies transported from the base, it didn’t include heating devices. Even in the Fishbone base, only Jiang Chen’s mansion was installed with this luxury device, the normal survivors only used an electric furnace.</br>
</br>
</br>
"An electromagnetic nitrogen heating device. The residents of the fallout shelter gave it to us to express their gratitude for providing them with safety." Xu Lu walked beside a round metal ball as she began to explain to Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
The nitrogen composition of the base was approximate 78%. The device can use the special electromagnetic interaction to heat the nitrogen in order to achieve the uniformed heating results.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the round heating device as he walked up to touch it.</br>
</br>
It was hard to believe that the device used to heat the entire building was only warm.</br>
</br>
"What about electricity consumption?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Only two third of the traditional electric furnace."</br>
</br>
"Looks like there are a lot of good things inside the fallout shelter." Jiang Chen nodded pleasingly.</br>
</br>
Although winter was about to end, it would be nice to equip the Fishbone base with a set.</br>
</br>
"It would immediately belong to you, right?" Xu Lu naughtily blinked her eyes.</br>
</br>
"It always belonged to me." The corner of Jiang Chen’s mouth carved up.</br>
</br>
Looking at the confident, frivolous smile on Jiang Chen’s face, Xu Lu grinned covering her mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shifted his frivolous expression as his face became serious. He cleared his throat and said.</br>
</br>
"Let’s talk about the matter at hand. Wu Yaguo has already proposed to renegotiate with us right?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. Following your instructions, I painted a bright future for them." Xu Lu nodded.</br>
</br>
"Did the embassy staff retreat?"</br>
</br>
"Under the disguise of transporting Han Junhua, they all returned to the surface."</br>
</br>
Hearing that Han Junhua had already returned to the surface, Jiang Chen had a dubious smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Good, they lost all the stakes on the table. Make them surrender."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
With a charming smile on her face, Xu Lu bowed and departed with her mission.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Happiness and joy filled every corner of the fallout shelter. People celebrated their victory, intoxicated in formulated alcohol, feasting on molecular delicacies as if they were in the middle of a festival.</br>
</br>
The bloodstains on the walls had been removed by cleaners; the bullets mark was filled in by dissolvers.</br>
</br>
On the table of the leader's office, the conference table was filled with all kinds of molecular food. It became the celebratory table of the resident assembly.</br>
</br>
"To celebrate our victory, cheers!" Wu Yaguo stood up as he proposed a toast to all the assembly members. Then he began to drink the alcohol in his hand.</br>
</br>
The technology in the fallout shelter was highly advanced. With such an ample amount of supplies, they could almost live in the happy times no different from before the war. Just make the ugly and disgusting scavengers on the surface pick up their garbage for them. Then, at the right opportunity, spare the scavengers some of the technology they dreamed off, and enjoy the worship expression on their faces. Finally, they will enjoy the energy rods in their hands.</br>
</br>
35 energy rods a month, it was more than enough for them to live in festivity every day.</br>
</br>
"Haha! Cheers!"</br>
</br>
"For freedom! For victory!?</br>
</br>
Between glasses, the feeling of intoxication began to spread on everyone’s faces, as if it was a dream that they would never be wakened up from.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, where did that b*tch go? In this happy moment, how can we miss her?" A drunk representative said.</br>
</br>
Dissolving the resident assembly, they made the politician who usually doesn't work go mop the floors as no one sitting there had a positive opinion about her.</br>
</br>
"Gulp-, before we punish her, why don’t we do something fun with her?" Someone suggested in drunkenness.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, for example… Make that old virgin strip dance for us, haha!"</br>
</br>
"I am really curious to see the ashamed expression on that bit*h’s face that had been ruling us for three years."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo listened to the derogatory words of the representative out of drunkenness as his expression was rather embarrassed.</br>
</br>
It was not because he was embarrassed by those people’s thoughts, he didn’t mind torturing that woman to make this more entertaining, but Han Junhua had already been brought to the surface by Xu Lu…</br>
</br>
"Ahem, friends, that bit*h have already been brought to the surface, as a gift for peace." Wu Yaguo coughed as he decided it was better to explain this sooner rather than later.</br>
</br>
The voice began to die down as pairs of intoxicated pupils looked over.</br>
</br>
A cold sweat rolled across his forehead as Wu Yaguo instantly sobered up. His head spun at rapid speed to formulate a not so disappointing excuse.</br>
</br>
"You know, because she threatened our partner, that man called Jiang Chen wanted to personally punish her. Think about it, the once ruthless queen perhaps is under a bunch of angry hobos… I think, for that bit*h, that is the best punishment!"</br>
</br>
The representatives thought about it as they all agreed.</br>
</br>
"That makes sense. There is no more humiliating punishment than that, those lucky scavengers." Shi Yongtian sitting in the corner burped while he snapped his finger.</br>
</br>
"That’s right, burp-, why don’t we guess how that bit*h is being tortured."</br>
</br>
"Hahaha!"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
"What’s going on? Why so rushed."</br>
</br>
"Sur…Surface." The man couldn’t form a sentence while stuttering.</br>
</br>
"Surface?" Wu Yaguo raised his eyebrows as he confirmed.</br>
</br>
The man gritted his teeth and scanned all the representatives around the table. Then, he got closer to Wu Yaguo’s ear and whispered.</br>
</br>
The wine glass in his hand splattered onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Just like the morning bell that has awakened the dream, the vibrant red alcohol flowed on the floor.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo widened his eyes as his pupils shook in fear.</br>
</br>
"How, how is that possible…"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 313: You have two choices</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Wang Zhaowu, who was responsible for the camp, knew Jiang Chen would be staying for a few days, he personally cleaned out a comfortable office and bedroom for him. He also told Jiang Chen to let him know if he had any concerns.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn’t bother the camp staff nor did he interrupt the normal operation of the camp. When he was bored, he sat in front of the table and began writing.</br>
</br>
"Your message has been sent to the underground." Xu Lu walked into the command office as she smiled looking at Jiang Chen writing at the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dropped the pen in his hand as he stretched and stood up from his chair.</br>
</br>
"Wu Yaguo’s response?"</br>
</br>
"They rejected it and expressed their shock to our decision."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t look surprised at all. "That’s expected, what’s their answer?"</br>
</br>
It was expected. Whether it was their rejection, or shock.</br>
</br>
"They locked the elevator and closed the door of the fallout shelter. They want you to examine the friendship between the two parties calmly." Xu Lu smiled.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen burst out laughing and shook his head.</br>
</br>
Too naïve.</br>
</br>
"Boss, what if they follow Han Junhua’s strategy?" Xu Lu asked in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Lock the door? Haha, that’s impossible."</br>
</br>
Looking at the confident expression on Jiang Chen’s fae, Xu Lu was slightly puzzled. With her intelligence, she could think through the strategy to make the residents of the fallout shelter start a coup, but she was unsure why Jiang Chen was so confident with them not locking the door.</br>
</br>
A hint of confusion naturally didn’t escape Jiang Chen’s eyes, but he only smiled and didn’t explain.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, what’s the maximum capacity of the elevator?"</br>
</br>
"Based on its design, 20 tons," Xu Lu was more confused as she answered. She did not understand why Jiang Chen asked such a question.</br>
</br>
"20 tons? Okay. From today on, every noon, send people to dump two tons of sand down to the ground.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu thought for a moment before a sudden realization smile appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"As you wish, boss. Any other things you need?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the regulation still yet to be completed on the table as he felt slightly wary. He then thought for a moment before responding.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… Where is Han Junhua?"</br>
</br>
"In the basement of the camp."</br>
</br>
A dubious smile spread on the surface his face.</br>
</br>
"I am tired now, take me to see her."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Han Junhua’s current condition would disappoint the representatives and Wu Yaguo.</br>
</br>
After Xu Lu had taken her to the surface, the torture and humiliation she imagined didn’t come. In fact, she didn’t receive any inhumane treatment.</br>
</br>
Or rather, the Fishbone base was treating her too nicely.</br>
</br>
She was surprised, but when she asked Xu Lu, she only received a mysterious smile.</br>
</br>
</br>
The medical professional treated the wounds and bruises on her face and connected her broken ribs. With their current medical condition, it was easy to treat these types of injuries. However, what surprised her was that the survivors on the wasteland possessed such technology.</br>
</br>
Immediately, she was taken to the basement.</br>
</br>
The bed was soft, and there were a table and chair. Although thick chains hung on the wall, no one cuffed her.</br>
</br>
Once it was time for food, a young female soldier would bring in steamy dishes for her. If she wanted to go to the bathroom, the same female soldier would put her in handcuffs, point at her with a taser, and send her to the washroom.</br>
</br>
This confused her. Did he only want to lock her up?</br>
</br>
Just like this, two days passed.</br>
</br>
The metal door to the basement opened, a male and a female walked in.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen's’ half-smiling face, Han Junhua was surprisingly calm.</br>
</br>
Just like the day she stood in front of the type 50 electromagnetic pulse cannon and faced Jiang Chen with a pistol to her head while she counted with her emotionless voice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pulled up a chair in front of the former fallout shelter leader. Xu Lu stood beside him and smilingly looked Han Junhua in the eyes without saying a word.</br>
</br>
"What are your thoughts?" Jiang Chen looked at the calm Han Junhua as he said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Her luscious black hair dropped to her shoulder, under the two delicate eyebrows were a pair of peaceful eyes. The bruises could still be seen, but after treatment will disappear in no time. Her uniform was changed into regular fallout shelter clothes. The tight-fitting clothes drew out her lithe figure.</br>
</br>
He heard that she was beaten in the fallout shelter, but she looked alright now.</br>
</br>
"Are you here to mock me?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not. But you don’t seem to be afraid? You have nothing to threaten me with now." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn’t say a word as she just quietly looked at him, just like during their initial meeting.</br>
</br>
Seeing that she didn’t speak, Jiang Chen continued, "How does it feel to be betrayed by the citizens you protected? Despair? Hatred? Disbelief-"</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, none." Han Junhua shook her head, "What is your plan for me?"</br>
</br>
None?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows. "What do you think my plan is with you?"</br>
</br>
"Vein injection."</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
"A humane way of dying. Of course, if you find it troublesome, a bullet is enough too."</br>
</br>
"No, I think you are mistaken. It would be a waste of god sent if I execute you." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Although she had flaws in her personality which made her unfit for a management role, after some tweaking, she would be great for a role in the military.</br>
</br>
Till the current stage, the Fishbone base didn’t lack talent in any other areas except for commander talent.</br>
</br>
When they fought, it was just raindrop-like bombs, then an infantry charge. This type of battle strategy would be enough for small-scale battles but followed by the growth of the Fishbone base, he couldn’t expect his enemies to continue to be weak.</br>
</br>
From their initial countering, Jiang Chen had plans to recruit her. The colonel of PAC, although he didn’t know why she became the leader of the fallout shelter, to be able to control a divisional level of battle was nothing to scorn about.</br>
</br>
"My loyalty only belongs to the PAC," this girl was clearly not cooperative as she said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"But that doesn’t exist anymore."</br>
</br>
"Do you really think so?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as he thought she has yet to learn the reality of the surface.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he contemplated before speaking.</br>
</br>
"PAC? Go find them lightyears away. You have two choices in front of you, join me, or-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a pistol from his pack, with a "clang" sound he loaded the gun. Before smashing the pistol on the table in front of Han Junhua, he provocatively looked her in the eyes.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu worriedly looked at the pistol on the table, and then at the expressionless Han Junhua. She gently dragged Jiang Chen’s arm, "Boss…"</br>
</br>
She was worried that Han Junhua would do something that endangers Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry, go for now." Jiang Chen waved his hand as he signaled to her not to worry.</br>
</br>
Although she was worried, Jiang Chen’s order for every "knight" was absolute. Xu Lu gave a look of warning to Han Junhua before she closed the door behind her.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua glanced at the gun on the table and looked at Jiang Chen questioningly.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen only responded with three concise words.</br>
</br>
"Live, or die."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua was silent, and then she picked up the gun.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen calmly looked at her.</br>
</br>
Then, she pointed the pistol at her temple, just like when they first met that morning.</br>
</br>
"You… Why bother?" Jiang Chen used a helpless voice.</br>
</br>
"My mission has already been completed. To die as a soldier is my glory."</br>
</br>
Is every PAC official so stubborn?</br>
</br>
"It’s hard to understand." Jiang Chen looked at her as if she was a monster.</br>
</br>
"You didn’t belong to that era, you wouldn’t understand."</br>
</br>
As she said this, she pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
The sound of the striker being hammered diffused into his ear-</br>
</br>
</br>

Ding-</br>
</br>
The sound of the striker echoed through the room, but the sound of the exploding didn’t.</br>
</br>
There were no bullets in the clip.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua’s eyebrows jumped.</br>
</br>
A moment later, she slowly opened her eyes as she put the pistol on the table.</br>
</br>
"Are you teasing me?"</br>
</br>
"Not at all." Jiang Chen let out a sigh and put away the pistol on the table.</br>
</br>
He had many hypotheses.</br>
</br>
She could grab the pistol and attempt to threaten him by forcing him to go inside the fallout shelter and save the people that abandoned her. If she really did that, it would mean that she still pedantically cared about those people’s lives. Therefore, it would be easy to force her to conform as Jiang Chen would just use their lives to threaten her.</br>
</br>
If she couldn’t pull the trigger, that meant that she didn’t want to die in such a meaningless fashion. Therefore, a slavery chip was enough to control her.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn’t think that she would make, what Jiang Chen saw as the worst decision.</br>
</br>
To the people unafraid of death and without attachment, he couldn’t think of a way to control her.</br>
</br>
Slavery chip? It was just a more elegant and more straightforward way of threatening people compared to gun against the head. Although it could monitor heart rate levels and hormone activity, it could not control people’s thoughts.</br>
</br>
"I sincerely hope you can join me in my cause." Jiang Chen used his last ditch effort.</br>
</br>
"Cause? You call this a cause?" Han Junhua’s mouth carved up into what looked like a contemptuous curvature, it was the first expression she gave Jiang Chen on her expressionless face. "I am a PAC soldier, I hope I can still be one when I die."</br>
</br>
A trace of enragement flashed across Jiang Chen’s face, Jiang Chen deeply inhaled as he tried to calm his mood.</br>
</br>
"Looks like negotiation has failed." He dubiously smiled and stood up.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua used an "obviously" look to respond to him.</br>
</br>
"Great."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only left that one word before leaving.</br>
</br>
Gone?</br>
</br>
Han Junhua watched Jiang Chen leave as she felt relieved.</br>
</br>
But to her surprise, the door opened again.</br>
</br>
It was Xu Lu who walked in. The woman with a smile so pure that it made her extremely comfortable.</br>
</br>
"I don’t understand, why do you have to reject our leader." Xu Lu looked at her with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Are you willing to die for him?" Han Junhua asked emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Of course." An unhealthy red flush appeared on Xu Lu’s face before it faded away. Then her face returned to the same smiling expression.</br>
</br>
"Then you should understand me. The ideology of PAC is my life."</br>
</br>
When ideology becomes spiritual, it is not fundamentally different from a religion. The only difference is, religion is god while ideology is philosophy.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu neglected her description as she responded, "You are a lucky woman."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Is that so?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, because leader said, he will personally train you, until you conform."</br>
</br>
"…" Han Junhua thought she heard wrong.</br>
</br>
Is that considered lucky?</br>
</br>
She could only say that there are all kinds of people in this world… Han Junhua muttered to herself in her mind.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu's smile began to turn cold as she overlooked Han Junhua in her white dress and used a cold voice.</br>
</br>
"Until you wake up and realize your place, your three meals a day will become two meals of nutrient supply."</br>
</br>
"That’s fine." Han Junhua’s response was only two short words.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu looked dubiously at her, the eyes seemed to say: I will see how long you can last.</br>
</br>
A few female soldiers walked inside and took away the bed and all the other furniture.</br>
</br>
"Enjoy your time in the darkroom."</br>
</br>
After leaving those words, Xu Lu left the room.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was lucrative to hope that everything would go according to plan. Han Junhua lasted until the end without conforming. But the more she acted this way, the more Jiang Chen became interested.</br>
</br>
One sentence to describe the situation, she needed more lessons!</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, he had plenty of time to give lessons.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen temporarily left Han Junhua’s task aside as the development of Fallout Shelter 027 was rather smooth.</br>
</br>
Based on Jiang Chen’s order, every noon at 12, the Fishbone base would drive an excavation truck and slowly pour around two tons of sand down to the horizontal elevator tunnel.</br>
</br>
The sand was poured slowly, but falling from a thousand meter height, the sound of sand smashing against the elevator was still deafening.</br>
</br>
The half an hour of deafening sound was like a curse that twirled around every resident of the fallout shelter as it tortured their mental defense.</br>
</br>
Right now, the fallout shelter no longer held a celebratory atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Fear, suspicion, and confusion hung on every resident’s face.</br>
</br>
The ground piled with garbage, the empty space in the industrial area was filled with the smell of vomit-inducing alcohol. People gathered there while they waited for Wu Yaguo’s explanation.</br>
</br>
"What’s going on? Wu Yaguo, you said you have negotiated with them already!" A resident who stood in the front angrily pointed at his nose.</br>
</br>
Three days ago, he had just put him on the throne.</br>
</br>
"You, you can’t blame me for this, it’s those primal people that don’t have any credibility," In the midst of the crowd’s skepticism, Wu Yaguo explained with cold sweat rolling down his face.</br>
</br>
He saw from those people’s eyes, the color he had seen before.</br>
</br>
This made him fearful. He didn’t want to become the second Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
"Stay calm, friends. If we are listless, that will make their plan come true," Wu Yaguo gulped as he desperately tried to calm the mood of the crowd.</br>
</br>
"Calm? How are we supposed to remain calm? Let them bury us alive?" Someone screamed.</br>
</br>
"They wouldn’t do that, they still need our technology. Including the unfinished Tiger II blueprint, they still need us, they are only pretending," a representative tried to suggest.</br>
</br>
"The elevator’s maximum capacity is only twenty tons, after this limit, we can never go back up."</br>
</br>
"They are pouring sand, if we move the sand, the elevator would still be usable…"</br>
</br>
"What’s the purpose? Go up and surrender?"</br>
</br>
"Dammit, these primal people without credibility!"</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo gulped as sweat continuously rolled down his forehead. He wanted to say something.</br>
</br>
But at this time, Feng Hui walked up on the stairs as he started talking without permission.</br>
</br>
"Everyone… I don’t know if I should be the one saying this, but… with the current consumption speed, the fallout shelter’s energy can only last for five more days."</br>
</br>
Five days!</br>
</br>
Compared to the sand, they had more critical things to worry about.</br>
</br>
Once the energy is consumed, this would become a city of death in ten minutes.</br>
</br>
Wu Yaguo furiously stared at Feng Hui, the latter shrunk his neck, but had no regret at all.</br>
</br>
Feng Hui thought if he brought this question up now, if they could do something, the fallout shelter could still be saved… Although his feelings have never been right before.</br>
</br>
The energy shortage was like a spell that lingered in every resident’s mind.</br>
</br>
The celebration in the past few days had spent the already short energy to almost nothing.</br>
</br>
"If it was Han Junhua…"</br>
</br>
Someone started the sentence but then realized his words as he immediately closed his mouth before finishing.</br>
</br>
When everyone hated on one person, it was dangerous to defend that person.</br>
</br>
But he obviously didn’t know because his perspective surprisingly did not get rebuked.</br>
</br>
"Yes, if it was her…"</br>
</br>
"Maybe, pay attention to my dictation, I’m just saying maybe, we went over the line?"</br>
</br>
It is funny to say, but the collective is always forgetful.</br>
</br>
Until now, they finally remembered everything that person did for them. When they carefully thought about it, all of her actions were for them. As a dictator, she didn’t use her power for personal gains.</br>
</br>
The criticism began to shift to compassion for Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
As Wu Yaguo heard the chatter, he knew he couldn’t wait any longer.</br>
</br>
If he continued to hesitate, he would become the criminal of the entire fallout shelter!</br>
</br>
How would the crowd generate confidence? How would he freely escape his responsibility?</br>
</br>
He did an expected, but foolish action.</br>
</br>
"Everyone! Listen to me, listen to me! Now, we are facing the most critical challenge that Fallout Shelter 027 has ever faced since its inception!"</br>
</br>
With his shouting, people stopped discussing again, they looked at him while waiting for the next step.</br>
</br>
"I admit, my vision is short-sighted, my knowledge is limited, and I express my deepest apology to my lack of ability." Wu Yaguo lowered his head as he gave the most profound bow to the residents.</br>
</br>
Chatting began to sprout, but Wu Yaguo didn’t bother with it. He raised his head, lifted up his arms and shouted.</br>
</br>
"But I believe, the crowd’s intelligence is glorious, the vision is with foresight!"</br>
</br>
As he faced the pairs of skeptical eyes, Wu Yaguo opened his EP and entered a few lines of code.</br>
</br>
Everyone’s EP shook, people shockingly looked at the message on the EP.</br>
</br>
"Now! I grant the power of the fallout shelter leader to all the residents! Everyone, technology allowed for absolute democracy to exist. Anyone could start a proposal, anyone could cast their sacred vote to any proposals, the absolute, just terminal will recognize everything. History will remember this moment, we just created history. Thank you for the continuous support, thank you…"</br>
</br>
After he finished, Wu Yaguo fled from the stairs.</br>
</br>
The decision making power was distributed to everyone’s hands. The fallout shelter no longer needed a leader, everyone was a leader.</br>
</br>
The instant he had escaped down the stairs, he used the corner of his eyes to see that the skepticism among the pupils was replaced with the excitement of power.</br>
</br>
Shortly after, the first proposal was introduced regarding if a power cut was necessary…</br>
</br>
Academician Qin stood in the corner of the empty ground and let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
The same sigh was heard a few days ago.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, no one listened.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the last wave of Klein particles was sent lightyears away as it carried an experiment report stained with blood.</br>
</br>
As of now, the purpose of Fallout Shelter 027 was fulfilled.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 315: Taking Over the Fallout Shelter</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what kinds of interesting proposals the fallout shelter residents, immersed in their fantasies, had proposed. However, he knew what the last proposal was.</br>
</br>
On the fifth day, the fallout shelter door opened.</br>
</br>
They chose to surrender with all votes supporting the notion.</br>
</br>
After the proposal had passed, everyone felt relieved. Because a lot of people among them had not eaten for the last twenty-four hours.</br>
</br>
The elevator locked underground began operating again as it moved the sand and a trembling fallout shelter resident onto the surface. Under the guidance of the Fishbone base soldier, he saw Jiang Chen and expressed anxiously the will to surrender.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gladly accepted their surrender, and the man felt relieved.</br>
</br>
The man was Wu Yaguo.</br>
</br>
Under the supervision of one hundred Fishbone base soldier, the one thousand five hundred residents underground initiated a new proposal to pass the leader permission to Jiang Chen. At gunpoint, just like the day they forced Han Junhua to surrender her leader permission, everyone voted in agree under humiliation.</br>
</br>
Unanimously passed, Jiang Chen was the new leader of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the door of the fallout shelter was non-existent to the Fishbone base. The permission to open the door or not was now controlled by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Immediately, the one thousand five hundred residents were forcefully moved to the surface as they were packed into the crowded temporary shelter, waiting for Jiang Chen's order. The residents were like shaken hamsters. Even when they faced Han Junhua, they stood up valiantly. But in the face of the "ruthless" Jiang Chen with military power, they had no courage to resist at all.</br>
</br>
Human nature was a delicate phenomenon.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen gave them disheartening news as he quickly planned their future.</br>
</br>
The entire fallout shelter 027, including the residents that moved to the surface in the beginning, nine hundred out of the one thousand and seven hundred people were elites from different industries. Of the remaining eight hundred people, four hundred were twelve or below, and the rest were all useless garbage.</br>
</br>
The four hundred useless individuals were dragged to Shenxiang Town colony where they will be planting the Carm tree and processing the mutated fruits necessary to produce nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
Of the remaining thirteen hundred people, they were divided by family. Part of the group will be living on the surface of camp 27, while the remainder will return to fallout shelter 027 to enjoy their happy life.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, even with so many shortcomings, the fallout shelter was still the happiest place on the wasteland. There were only two hundred individuals granted a return to the fallout shelter, and the number of people will change based on Fishbone's project. The two hundred research individuals will be divided into five projects as they continue to enjoy their life. They were permitted to bring a spouse along with children less than 18 years old to enjoy the same life.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, there were plenty of talents in the fallout shelter. If their efficiency is too low, they would be kicked out. People would gladly take their spot and bring their family to enjoy the heaven-like life.</br>
</br>
As to the families forced to stay on the surface, Jiang Chen didn't give them any trouble. Instead, he treated them as a talent reserve. For the people influential in virtual reality development, Jiang Chen moved their family to the Fishbone base and gave them to Du Yongkong to develop the virtual reality MMORPG.</br>
</br>
Speaking of Du Yongkong, he certainly felt left out. After he had developed Future 1.0, Jiang Chen had almost forgotten about him.</br>
</br>
A lot of people that had joined the Fishbone base around the same time were all tasked with important duties, while he was stuck with a bunch of machines, writing codes. If he had nothing to do he would just try to waste the day away. But now that he had people, he finally had an opportunity to display his skill.</br>
</br>
However, he was still confused about why he was developing Future 1.0. He didn't understand the purpose of developing an outdated virtual reality that required a helmet. It was the kind of feeling where people already had consoles, but they still wanted to play the original Gameboy.</br>
</br>
But he didn't voice his thoughts.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Standing at the gate of the camp, Jiang Chen looked at the row of trucks leaving the camp.</br>
</br>
Five hours ago, the eight trucks hauled a total of 120 tons of concrete. This C-grade concrete produced from the concrete plant in Shenxiang would be used to build the new homes for the fallout shelter residents.</br>
</br>
Now, the trucks transported away 421 fallout shelter residents. During the ability assessment, they were determined to not possess any research ability. They were incorporated into the Fishbone base with a citizen level of "slave". While working in the plantation to feed themselves, they will also be working towards becoming a "lower citizen" one day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know since when Xu Lu stood beside him, but he suddenly heard her exclaim in a light voice.</br>
</br>
"It is hard to believe that the hard to chew on fallout shelter defeated themselves like this."</br>
</br>
"This is normal." Jiang Chen gazed at the shadows disappearing at the end of the highway as he grinned.</br>
</br>
"You are always so wise." Xu Lu watched Jiang Chen's back with a smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as he didn't imagine people would describe him as wise as he began laughing out loud.</br>
</br>
"It is not wise, not at all… Only some experience with society."</br>
</br>
Xu Lu didn't continue on this topic.</br>
</br>
"How are the resident assembly representatives going to be treated?"</br>
</br>
"I have already arranged for them to go on the truck."</br>
</br>
Including Wu Yaguo and Shi Yongtian. The Fishbone needed all forms of talents, but it didn't need politicians who only knew how to speak and point fingers. It would require months if not years of labor for them to interrogate into the new life on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Hearing that Jiang Chen had already made the arrangement, Xu Lu smiled and nodded before she started to discuss her next step.</br>
</br>
"Now that this side of things is over, do you need me to return to the logistics department immediately?"</br>
</br>
"No need, we need management talent here. Wang Zhaowu is not bad at commanding an army, but it would be disastrous if the same techniques used to manage an army were used politically. You are exceptional in this field, you'll be in charge of the affairs at Camp 27."</br>
</br>
"Okay, boss." Xu Lu bowed.</br>
</br>
"Wang Qin will organize the research projects before transitioning them over to you. Your primary responsibility will be ensuring that the research needed is being done. Other than that, the rest will be up to you. You can do it!"</br>
</br>
As he said this, Jiang Chen patted her shoulder, trying to motivate her before leaving.</br>
</br>
"Also, one more thing." Xu Lu seemed to have remembered something as she stopped Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"An elder man wants to see you. He said he is an academician from the Pan-Asian Corporation Academy of Social Sciences, his name is Qin Xuehai…"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 316"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 316: Light Years Away</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Tents of various sizes were built around the outskirt of the camp. Although they were simple and crude, they were enough to weather the harsh external conditions. These tents were all hauled from the Fishbone base and will be used before Camp 27 apartments are built. Therefore, the residents forcefully moved to the surface must settle for them.</br>
</br>
The tents formed a distinct contrast with the one hundred homes in the center of the camp as if it was the ghetto versus the rich.</br>
</br>
The situation was rather comical. They had previously mocked the two groups of residents that first moved up to the surface stating that they would rather live in the harsh conditions of the surface than the comfort in the fallout shelter. But now the situation seemed to be reversed as the people they mocked now became someone they envied.</br>
</br>
After passing through a few tents, Jiang Chen walked to a tent at the corner of the camp. He saw an elder with white hair who seemed to be waiting for him.</br>
</br>
"You are Academician Qin?"</br>
</br>
The elder kindly smiled at Jiang Chen who stood in front of him as he got up.</br>
</br>
"Yes, and you must be Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Your body condition doesn't seem to be too well."</br>
</br>
The elder waved his hand as he said something that surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I am a digitalized human."</br>
</br>
Digitalized human? Digitalized humans can also age?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes but quickly returned back to normal.</br>
</br>
"I heard you have something important to tell me, is it just this?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Academician Qin shook his head. "There is one thing I want to give you."</br>
</br>
As he said, he picked a baseball-sized black sphere out of his pocket.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the sphere as he frowned. It felt like he had seen this somewhere before.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, his pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple?" Jiang Chen whispered.</br>
</br>
Academician Qin paused a moment before shaking his head. "Is that how you refer to this thing? But you'll be disappointed. It is only a communication device based on Dr. Klein's research on Klein particles, it is referred to as galactic cellphone. Of course, the energy for this has been completely consumed, it can only provide you with a coordinate."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took over the black sphere as he carefully examined it in his hands. The appearance was no different than the one he obtained in U-235, but this was clearly lighter.</br>
</br>
Also, this must be the real "Golden Apple", not the counterfeit "Golden Apple" the Third Reich mimicked. This thing was not meant to broadcast to other time dimensions, but rather to conduct communication across time.</br>
</br>
"Can this thing… Speak to the past?"</br>
</br>
Academician Qin smiled when he heard Jiang Chen's question, "In theory, yes. However, just like the Shronginder's cat, even if you spoke to the past, you can't verify if someone heard it, and you can't verify if they understood or not."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Is that so? I heard that this thing is made with brain extract-" Jiang Chen mustered to himself as he was deep in thought.</br>
</br>
"That is false." Academician Qin smiled. "That's right, the brain extract can detect Klein particle activities, but how is it possible to use the brain to create this?"</br>
</br>
In a parallel world, someone certainly did that… Jiang Chen said in his mind.</br>
</br>
After a momentary pause, Academician Qin put on a stern face as he continued, "To be honest, this thing had lost its purpose already. The reason why I am telling you this is only because I'm trying to explain a fact to you."</br>
</br>
"What fact?" Jiang Chen observed the metallic ball in his hand.</br>
</br>
"This is an experiment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's action stopped as he looked at Academician Qin.</br>
</br>
"Experiment?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, the experiment is to research under the circumstance of extremely limited resources, how would the human society evolve," Academician Qin calmly told a shocking truth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was in shock, or in disbelief.</br>
</br>
But he quickly realized something was odd.</br>
</br>
It was too much of a coincidence. The PAC government was that useless? The fallout shelter was a civil defense structure and built based on the international political situation deteriorating. Would it really be problematic to store more nuclear fusion cores? It was set for 50 years, but it had to open in 20 years. And that Han Junhua, she was clearly not meant to be a politician.</br>
</br>
But he didn't manage to think that the entire fallout shelter was just an experiment, every single person inside was a white rat.</br>
</br>
"From the beginning, there was not enough energy. Even the choice of leaders, the kind Zhang Qiming as the first leader and the cold Han Junhua as the second leader, they were both not ideal choices for leadership, but can be researched as classic personalities."</br>
</br>
"The experiment's result is sent to the Zhenghe Space Colonization Ship lightyears away using this device."</br>
</br>
The elimination of sources of error, and investigate into key subjects were typical of an experiment.</br>
</br>
It was just that, the experiment to be conducted on a group of people was too cruel.</br>
</br>
"Although it is just a small fallout shelter, don't you think this is the reflection of society?"</br>
</br>
"Why are you telling me this?" Jiang Chen stuffed the metallic ball into his pocket as he retorted.</br>
</br>
He was not part of the PAC, nor did he have anything to do with the dissolved World Alliance Organization. He was not bored enough to think of the people lightyears away.</br>
</br>
"I am only providing you with a thought process. If you happen to encounter such a choice, I believe you will learn something from it."</br>
</br>
[Thought process? That choice?]</br>
</br>
"Thought process?" Jiang Chen didn't understand.</br>
</br>
"That's right, as a researcher who lived in the fallout shelter for 20 years, other than being responsible for the experiment, I have been thinking about another question."</br>
</br>
"What question?"</br>
</br>
"You should have heard of reproductive separation."</br>
</br>
It was not a complicated subject, even in the biology textbook from the 21st century it was mentioned. Jiang Chen only recalled briefly before he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Because of geographical isolation and other factors, different groups of the same species reproduce in different habitats. Due to the inability to carry out gene exchange, to withstand the natural selection of different environments, it would eventually lead to the formation of two completely different species. "</br>
</br>
Academician Qin nodded in praise as he looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Although there are still some flaws with the theory, that's mostly the case. With geographical separation, after thousands of years' of evolvement, the same species would evolve into two completely different species. Geographical separation is the pretense for reproductive separation. But have you considered another possibility? If for some reason humans were forced to create geographic separation, what kind of possibility would that create?"</br>
</br>
"Reproductive separation?" Jiang Chen paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
"No, it's ideological separation." Academician Qin shook his head as he threw out a concept that Jiang Chen never heard of before.</br>
</br>
"How you noticed, in only 20 years, the people living underground and the people on the surface have been separated into two kinds of people. What would happen if 50 years passed? Or even longer time."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to ponder on the idea as he waited for him to explain.</br>
</br>
"Under different environment, the civilization making an adjustment to the environment is known as evolvement from a social science point of view. Just like how although reproductive separation didn't exist between the ancient and modern people, there exists a huge gap between them ideology wise."</br>
</br>
"If we look at the deep space light years away, is there a gap created between the space colonization ship and us?"</br>
</br>
"The instant when the space colonization ships accelerated to escape the solar system, they were no longer humans from earth. Or rather, the ship who have gathered the elites of the human civilization had already evolved into something higher."</br>
</br>
"So what? Whatever they evolve into, they are no longer on earth," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's words, Academician Qin only laughed.</br>
</br>
"In the 16th century, what did the Europeans bring to UA?"</br>
</br>
"Slaughter?"</br>
</br>
"No, civilization."</br>
</br>
Was there a difference? Jiang Chen just wanted to ask, but he all of the sudden stopped.</br>
</br>
That's right because there was no difference…</br>
</br>
"The rebirth of the civilization must be accompanied by bloody brutality," Academician Qin said gently.</br>
</br>
"You mean… They will be back?"</br>
</br>
"Regardless if they will be back or not, they will do something. And to us as the "natives" the process must be accompanied by pain. Blood? Sacrifice? But what is truly terrifying is that these actions will be justified through their perspective."</br>

</br>
Supreme, Harmony, and Purity.</br>
</br>
Supreme, the fusion between human and technology. It was simple to understand. The digitalized human would be considered part of the supreme philosophy.</br>
</br>
Harmony, the combination of human and nature. It was using genetic engineering to modify humans to adapt to harsh conditions. The example would be the mutated humans who could feast on the mutants meat. They were definitely the group who enjoyed the wasteland the most… Although no one would classify them as human.</br>
</br>
As to purity.</br>
</br>
"Purity is nothing will change."</br>
</br>
"Nothing will change? Is that considered evolution?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"It is considered evolution." Academician Qin nodded. "The activity of civilization expanded from earth to space, it is a great chance to make no change to the form of existence. They don’t abandon any parts of being human and use foreign objects to strengthen themselves, protecting the body itself. This requires no fewer sacrifices than the first two. The only thing we can guess now is that the new human who chooses this path is the most likely to be friendly to us, and at least better than those who chose supreme or harmony. "</br>

After listening to Academician Qin's explanation, Jiang Chen remained silent.</br>
</br>
He let out a sigh after a long while.</br>
</br>
"Regardless, these are all too distant."</br>
</br>
"It is indeed too distant. The formation of a new civilization would take tens, hundreds, and even thousands of years. But regardless the length of time, civilization would have to make the decision on how it chooses to continue its existence. As an elder man who is about to step into the coffin, the only thing I can do is tell you what I know. If you can learn something from it, and make the right choices, it will be the pleasure of civilization."</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
"The pleasure of civilization? That is a daunting recognition. But unfortunately, Jiang Chen didn’t have any interest in becoming the next savior, nor did he have the capability to become one. But if he thought about carefully, if he had to cast a vote in terms of the direction of the entire civilization, he would lean more towards the route of purity.</br>
</br>
As to why? Naturally, asides from purity, would the humans coming from the two other routes still be considered human?</br>
</br>
Under a bold assumption, the end to harmony would be humans fusing with mutants, and the end of supreme would most likely be advanced artificial intelligence and internal hard discs. Regardless of which one, the pleasure of being human would be abandoned.</br>
</br>
After leaving Academician Qin’s tent, Jiang Chen threw the "authentic golden apple" into the storage dimension and walked to the gate of the camp.</br>
</br>
An armored vehicle was parked in front of the gate, and from the cigarette butts on the ground, the vehicle had been waiting for a long time.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen walk over, the driver who was killing time smoking a cigarette immediately threw it away and saluted to him with a straight back.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded to the driver as he sat in the passenger seat.</br>
</br>
"Let’s go back to the base."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
It only took a moment of zoning out before the vehicle arrived at the mansion in the base.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen walked inside, he hung his winter suit on the wall and bumped into Sun Jiao who was coming down the stairs.</br>
</br>
"…Are you okay?" Sun Jiao asked caringly when she saw Jiang Chen's’ face.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Jiang Chen looked at Sun Jiao, dumbfounded. He scratched his face. "Is there something on my face?"</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen’s action, Sun Jiao covered her mouth as she began to giggle.</br>
</br>
"Yes, there are two bugs on your forehead almost twisting together."</br>
</br>
Bugs?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his forehead, but he felt his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
When he saw the mocking expression on Sun Jiao’s face, he immediately realized that the girl was teasing him.</br>
</br>
"You dare to tease your husband?" Jiang Chen pretended to be angry as he leaped toward her, but Sun Jiao dodged with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Regarding body conditions, Jiang Chen would never be able to catch up to Sun Jiao without special abilities. But Sun Jiao obviously didn’t try too hard as they fooled for a minute before she was tackled onto the sofa by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, breathing heavily, looked at Sun Jiao who he finally managed to catch and grinned.</br>
</br>
With a slightly flushed face, her full breasts bounced up and down. Her crystal eyes covered by a layer of mist, staring straight into Jiang Chen’s eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen who was about to "bully" her stopped.</br>
</br>
"What’s going on? Honey."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen used his finger to gently lift up the rumpled hair on her forehead and said gently.</br>
</br>
He could feel her hesitation. She had her own thoughts.</br>
</br>
The audacious face rarely displayed a trace of fragility. Sun Jiao hesitantly looked at Jiang Chen as she whispered.</br>
</br>
"How about this. Why don’t you go take a break on the other side?"</br>
</br>
When he heard Sun Jiao’s words, Jiang Chen was surprised. Sun Jiao always wanted to keep him on this side, but this time she brought this up on her own.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao read the surprise on Jiang Chen’s face. Then with a blushing face, she continued.</br>
</br>
"Didn’t you say… Compared to the other side, this side is more depressing? I’m scared…"</br>
</br>
She bit her lips before quickly letting go.</br>
</br>
"All in all, I can’t allow you to dislike this side."</br>
</br>
Although the voice sounded capricious, Jiang Chen could still clearly feel the love.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I promise." Jiang Chen looked into Sun Jiao’s eyes as he sincerely promised.</br>
</br>
After gazing with Jiang Chen for a while, Sun Jiao suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"What are you laughing at." Jiang Chen pretended to be angry as he slapped her butt.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao cried out in slight pain as she rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I can’t think my husband is adorable?"</br>
</br>
"I think you should think your husband is strong." Jiang Chen with a smirk as his hands began to move around.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao felt the coldness that moved around her waist as her face began to burn. She rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen and joked.</br>
</br>
"In the living room again. We've never successfully done it in the living room…"</br>
</br>
It was Jiang Chen who blushed this time.</br>
</br>
He remembered the first time when Sun Jiao was like an untamed cat that jumped onto him. However, before they could do anything, Yao Yao who came downstairs saw him completed exposed.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, why don’t we continue in the bedroom?" Jiang Chen subconsciously glanced at the empty stairs as he awkwardly retreated his hands.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao seductively rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen as she swiftly escaped from Jiang Chen’s hug and sat on the sofa.</br>
</br>
With two fingers, she demandingly lifted Jiang Chen’s chin.</br>
</br>
"Come to my room tonight."</br>
</br>
The red lips naughtily breathed a breath of warm fragrance.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen with black circles under his eyes, walked out of Sun Jiao's bedroom yawning.</br>
</br>
As he reminisced the intimacy that happened last time, he couldn't help but smile. Perhaps because they haven't done it for so long, last night Sun Jiao was particularly demanding as she only let him sleep after midnight while she drifted to sleep as well like a well-fed cat.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen thought about this, he stretched his back with a delightful smile-</br>
</br>
"Ka."</br>
</br>
The pleasant smile froze on his face as a drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, my back! Ouch, ouch, ouch]</br>
</br>
At the same time, the still sleepy Yao Yao walked into the hallway.</br>
</br>
She looked at Jiang Chen who froze in place as she tilted her head in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Hmm?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, Yao, Yao Yao, come help me…" Jiang Chen with his thick skin finally squeezed out these words.</br>
</br>
He felt humiliated…</br>
</br>
The nice Yao Yao immediately walked up to help him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the innocent eyes as he didn't know how to explain what caused his stiff back.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was already early March; snow was barely visible in Wanghai City now. Followed by the stabilization of the situation on the wasteland, it was time to return to the modern world as events have also been progressing along there.</br>
</br>
Of course, before he returned, Jiang Chen still had to take care of some urgent matters.</br>
</br>
After eating lunch at the community center, Jiang Chen rode the helicopter to the Sixth Street as he headed immediately to the Zhao Corporation Headquarter within the Inner Circle.</br>
</br>
After months of repair, the traces of the civil war were no longer visible in the Inner Circle. Including Zhao Corporation's building almost penetrated by the electromagnetic cannon, from the outside, it was impossible to tell that a bloody civil war erupted here.</br>
</br>
Just as he stared into the Zhao Corporation building, Jiang Chen felt countless eyes focus on him before fleeing away.</br>
</br>
He smiled as he didn't bother with their looks and he headed straight to the elevator.</br>
</br>
The new security guard in the front saw Jiang Chen's back and was prepared to stop him because he didn't notify the reception desk.</br>
</br>
The old security guard with sharp eyes immediately dragged the new colleague back by the collar.</br>
</br>
The new security guard tilted his neck and looked at the old security in shock. When he saw that the elevator doors had already closed, he complained in frustration, "What are you doing? Didn't the boss say that without going through the front desk, all visitors should be kicked out."</br>
</br>
"Bullsh*t, did you not see who he was? If you dared to stop him, your boss would stuff your head into the toilet."</br>
</br>
The old security guard spat all over his face as he remained completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Who, Who is he…"</br>
</br>
Seeing how stupid his new colleague was, the old security let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Sigh, you just came from Hang City so you might not know, the Sixth Street now is not what it was before. Did you see the newly built casino in the Inner Circle? A few months ago a nuke blew up there."</br>
</br>
"Nuke?!" The new security's eyes widened.</br>
</br>
"Tactical nuke. Although it was not a big one, it did wipe out half of the Inner Circle."</br>
</br>
"Is that the person…"</br>
</br>
"No, but things changed here. The Group of Ten council collapsed after the civil war. And that man, the only victor out of the war, is the general of the Sixth Street." The old security let out a sigh as he said melancholily.</br>
</br>
It would be impossible to say he didn't miss the old times, back then the status of being a security guard of Zhao Corporation was envied by many.</br>
</br>
The new security guard's eyes were about to pop out as cold sweat began to roll down, he felt scared.</br>
</br>
He was thankful that the old guy dragged him. It would be less of a deal if he lost his job, but if he offended someone of power, it would a question of if he could walk out of the door or not.</br>
</br>
Other people would need an appointment to see Zhao Chenwu, for Jiang Chen, the process was not so problematic.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen walked into his office, the previous ruthless leader was already waiting in front of the desk.</br>
</br>
"A rare visitor, what brings you here?" When Jiang Chen walked in, Zhao Chenwu stopped the work in his hands as he stood up smiling.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that his mood seemed to be a lot better. He didn't have the same expression of despair that was present when he passed on his power.</br>
</br>
"How have you been?"</br>
</br>
"Haha, great, thanks to Mr. Jiang. Let's go talk in the room next door."</br>
</br>
With the food business blooming, although he lost part of his power, he had significant gains in other areas. Under the direction of Jiang Chen he created the trade fleets, not only did he extend the business up to Luzhou, he even opened the market for tea and coffee. The green crystals flooded to him. In less than a month. He had already recovered nearly a third of his losses from the civil war.</br>
</br>
While they caught up, the two walked to the guest room next door as they sat around a table. Not long after, his assistant Su Lei walked inside as she poured hot tea for both of them before leaving.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed her right hand was switched into mechanical prosthetics. It must be because of the civil war.</br>
</br>
After some small talk, Jiang Chen began to discuss the issues at hand. When he asked about the status of the ten T-3 power armors he has ordered. It was already March; it was around the time the order should be completed.</br>
</br>
"It is already done! I went to examine it in the military factory, the technicians have completed the last stage of program testing, do you need me to take you there for a visual?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand. "There is no rush, I will send people to transport it back tomorrow. The 88000 crystals can be deducted from the food business' income. Also, how's your production capacity for your military factory?"</br>
</br>
When heard Jiang Chen ask about the military factory, he gave a brief thought before he gave a conservative estimate.</br>
</br>
"With the newly added production line, the production capacity increased by sixty percent."</br>
</br>
"Sixty percent? Let me try a different question, how many power armor can the factory produce in a month?"</br>
</br>
"At most three."</br>
</br>
"That's too little." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was unhappy with his work, Zhao Chenwu had a helpless expression on his face. "It is not little at all. Power armors are not bullets, and the process can't be streamlined. It takes half a month with ten technicians around a skeleton with blueprints to make them. Also, these are all skilled workers."</br>
</br>
"Why can't the production be streamlined? Is the power armor before the war manufactured one by one?"</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen ask this, Zhao Chenwu forced a smile. "It is not that simple, there are thousands of parts inside. Without a complete industrial process, it is impossible to streamline the process for a massive thing like this. The power armor is one of the better products. If it is the spider tank, at best it would be one unit per half a year."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu paused for a moment before he continued.</br>
</br>
"I am serious, with the increasing number of factories, the cost of steel, bronze, and aluminum have all increased. The profit margin of the firearms is no way near as high as the food business…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finally understood when he heard Zhao Chenwu say that.</br>
</br>
The key point was, he had no interest in developing the military factory. The profit of the food business would bring in millions of crystals, and the power armor had a cost of nine thousand crystals, to begin with. With a sale price of eleven thousand, it would only be a profit of two thousand. The work an entire winter would only net twenty thousand which would be equivalent to a trip down to the neighboring city.</br>
</br>
He developed the military factory before to equip his private force. Now that Jiang Chen had put a restriction on the private force, and even injected them with the "honorary chip", he didn't have the motivation to develop the military factory.</br>
</br>
But since the military factory was not his, Jiang Chen couldn't demand him to continue to expand if Zhao Chenwu was unwilling, so he spoke after thinking for a moment.</br>
</br>
"How about this, sell the military factory to me, including those workers, give me a price."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu was ecstatic when he heard Jiang Chen was willing to take over the not so profitable military factory.</br>
</br>
"No problem. The military factories used to produce spider tanks, and power armors cost a total of eight hundred seventy thousand crystals. I will sell it to you at cost."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 319: Purchasing Firearms</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the end, the transfer price of the military factories was lowered to six hundred thousand crystals before they agreed on the deal.</br>
</br>
[Eight hundred and seventy thousand? You think your military factories have a stable source of income? Ordinary people would be unable to afford this, combined with the already limited distribution channel. Especially with the formation of the Sixth Street Bank, the wealth generated from the last two crusades completedly ignited the industrial fire of the Sixth Street. Workshops and factories appeared like bamboo sprouts. With the lucrative food business in place, it would be insane to use the money to expand the military factories.]</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu debated with Jiang Chen for a while before he settled on a price. He was satisfied with a price of six hundred thousand crystals. With these crystals as liquid assets, he could further expand the trade fleets and expand the business further beyond the horizon.</br>
</br>
But for Jiang Chen, compared to crystals, as the general of the military government, needed to consider the military aspect.</br>
</br>
"Also, how is the development of the T-4 power armor?"</br>
</br>
Regarding development, Zhao Chenwu's expression was rather awkward.</br>
</br>
"Part of the technical problems are yet to be resolved; it is primarily related to the engine. The request I sent out to the two mercenaries groups to retrieve technical support has yet to progress…"</br>
</br>
"Transfer me the research team as well then," Jiang Chen said straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
Since he recently incorporated fallout shelter 027, to the problem Zhao Chenwu couldn't solve, maybe it would not be a problem at all for the scientists that inherited the technology before the war.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu nodded. "Okay, the research team is already part of the military factory. But to be honest, research is a bottomless pit. Other than the armor being a bit weaker, the T-3 power armor is superb in mobility as well as firepower, there would not be a lot of room for improvement…"</br>
</br>
"Is it not weaker, but too weak." Jiang Chen shook his head. "Other than the armor in front of the chest, the other parts would be busted by a few scratches of the Death Claw."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu forced a smiled, "You can't compare this thing to a Death Claw, the defense is not the strong suit of the airdrop type of power armor. If the Death Claw is in close range, even the land type power armor would not be able to hold out."</br>
</br>
"Land type power armor? Speaking of this, is there a military factory that produces the land type at the Sixth Street?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu shook his head, "No, or rather no need."</br>
</br>
"No need?" Jiang Chen was slightly surprised.</br>
</br>
"Compared to the cumbersome land type power armor, the airdrop type with high mobility and short range flight capability obviously are more fitted to explore the wasteland. For example, if a group of zombies surrounded the power armor, the airdrop type would be able to use the turbine engine to fly out, the land type would be stuck there being squeezed to death," Zhao Chenwu patiently explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
While zombie's claw and teeth could not break the power armor steel, it could use its size to squish the power armor flat.</br>
</br>
[I see, so it comes down to practicality after all…]</br>
</br>
The tea on the table was already cold.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen deep in thought, Zhao Chenwu took a sip of the tea and signaled Su Lei to add more hot tea.</br>
</br>
"No need for the trouble, it is pretty late." Jiang Chen glanced at the clock on the wall as he stood up smiling.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu also stood up and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to leave? I will send you down."</br>
</br>
"Oh, also, something else… I need another batch of firearms. Do you have any firearms dealer you can recommend to me?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu paused for a second, "What type of firearms?"</br>
</br>
"Anti-armor weapon, heat sensor grenade, and sniper rifle, the more, the better."</br>
</br>
"Haha, you found the right person!" Zhao Chenwu was ecstatic. "One of my old friends happened to visit me from Su City and asked me if I was interested in absorbing a batch of firearms. But I am not even in that business anymore, so he was troubled by how to get rid of his batch. If you are interested, I will help you contact him right now."</br>
</br>
"Then what are we waiting for?" Jiang Chen laughed, "Just take me to him, I want to get this done as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu noted a few things for Su Lei and asked her to contact the merchant from Su city.</br>
</br>
Then he and Jiang Chen came downstairs and headed to the industrial area at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Not long after, the car was parked in front of a warehouse.</br>
</br>
A middle-aged man with wrinkles all over his face stood in front of the warehouse. From the half burnt cigarette, he only arrived momentarily as well. When he saw Zhao Chenwu's car, his eyes immediately lit up as he stubbed out the cigarette and stuffed it back into his pocket. Then, he walked to the two people that just got off the car.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhao, I heard you are interested in my firearms?" With the wrinkles on his face squeezed together, the man smiled while exposing his yellow teeth.</br>
</br>
"It is not me that's interested, it's this important individual." Zhao Chenwu looked at Jiang Chen as he began to introduce, "The Sixth Street Military Government General, Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
"It is General Jiang? My pleasure." The man's face was obviously shocked as he immediately extended his hand to shake Jiang Chen's. At the same time, he introduced himself, "I am Hu Youde, a merchant from Su city. It's a great pleasure to finally meet Mr. Jiang."</br>
</br>
Hu Youde? (Homoyom for bullsh*t) that's a great name.</br>
</br>
"You know me?" Jiang Chen let go of his hand as he was quite surprised.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is a humorous person. Which merchant in this region doesn't know you?" Hu Youde scratched his slightly dirty nose as he laughed.</br>
</br>
"Since you know him, then you should know what kind of people shouldn't be bullsh*ting." Zhao Chenwu told Hu Youde with a half-smiling look.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, of course. Even if I have one hundred guts, I won't dare to bullsh*t Mr. Jiang. But with Mr. Jiang's reputation, you won't do anything like not paying right?" Hu Youde's muddy eyes shifted as he tried to test the water.</br>
</br>
Now that the Sixth Street was no longer controlled by the Group of Ten Council, the merchants without force dealing with dictators were worried. If Jiang Chen didn't pay, he would have nowhere to seek justice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to laugh.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry. I won't do anything like not paying, just take me to the firearms."</br>
</br>
When he received the promise from Jiang Chen, Hu Youde immediately started to smile as he bowed, exaggeratedly.</br>
</br>
"Then I have to thank General Jiang, I will take you right now.'</br>
</br>
Hu Youde turned around as he walked to the warehouse first.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to go along?" Zhao Chenwu asked.</br>
</br>
"No need, I will go by myself."</br>
</br>
"Okay, I will head back then… Also, this guy is mischievous, don't be tricked by him. Do everything you can to lower the price. The batch of firearms has already been here for half a month, he would have to sell even if he had to sell at a loss."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was puzzled by Zhao Chenwu's words.</br>
</br>
"Is it hard to sell firearms here?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu shook his head.</br>
</br>
"The market is already saturated with a small population. Now with countless factories and workshops emerging, this market saturation would become the norm. Needless to say the merchants from Su city, even the local factories, are starting to be troubled by their sales channel… Three months ago, this was hard to imagine."</br>
</br>
During that time, people with crystals were all wealthy. The increase in quality of life reignited the survivors desire to hunt. Therefore, the mercenary groups and lone travelers eager to switch equipment even lined up at the door of the military factories. The firearms dealer without the worry to sell obviously did everything to increase productivity.</br>
</br>
But people only have two hands, weapons were not easy to break either. After the period of "equipment switching" was over, the excessively produced firearms obviously were stored in the warehouses unable to be sold.</br>
</br>
Excess production was a severe problem.</br>
</br>
Without proper measures, after a short period of prosperity, the newly opened factories and workshops may be on the brink of bankruptcy again. Not only in the firearms industry, with the gradual increase in general productivity, other industries will also experience a similar problem.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the ragged back as he became thinking about this issue.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 320: The Mine Pit and Slaves</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The metal gate opened as the smell of desiccant dirt blew in his face.</br>
</br>
Hu Youde searched for the button on the wall as he turned on the lights to the warehouse.</br>
</br>
The dark space instantly lit up. The thick wooden boxes almost stuffed the entire area to its max capacity.</br>
</br>
Inside the open boxes were baseball shaped heat sensor grenades, and bowl sized rockets. On the wall directly facing the door were rows of ghost sniper rifles, and by crude estimation, at least another hundred in the boxes on the side with changeable scopes. As to the barrels along the other side of the wall, without a doubt, must be launchers to the rockets.</br>
</br>
"Ghost sniper rifle, heat sensor grenade, "Python" anti-tank rocket, reaper rifle, along with some other reliable gadgets. I trust you will definitely be interested." While Hu Youde laughed, he signaled a satisfied gesture to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked up and picked up a "Python" and tried to scope.</br>
</br>
"Is this thing good."</br>
</br>
"One round would bust a power armor," Hu Youde immediately added, "The land type too."</br>
</br>
"Is the quality reliable?"</br>
</br>
"I can guarantee it with my head." Hu Youde promised while pounding his chest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, pleased. As he put down the rocket launcher in his hand, he strolled around the warehouse to try out a few things to ensure the quality of the other weapons.</br>
</br>
"If you don't mind me asking, is Mr. Jiang planning something big?"</br>
</br>
"Oh? Why do you think so?" Jiang Chen played with the ghost sniper rifle in his hands as he said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
The small cunning eyes spun as Hu Youde cracked a smile. "Everyone knows that it is almost impossible to sell firearms at the Sixth Street now. Mr. Jiang is in the food business so obviously not interested in the small profit. This batch of firearms, it is going to be used to equip an army?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at him as the tense Hu Youde immediately rushed to explain, "Ahem, don't be mistaken, I have no intention in collecting information."</br>
</br>
"Then your intention is?" Jiang Chen asked him dubiously.</br>
</br>
"I just want to know if Mr. Jiang is interested in people," Hu Youde said with a flattering look.</br>
</br>
"People?"</br>
</br>
"To put it simply, slaves. Ones who are already trained with the electronic collar around their necks so you only need to push them forward during the war."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was flabbergasted. "You are not only in the firearm business, but you also do slave trade?"</br>
</br>
When Hu Youde heard that Jiang Chen seemed to be interested, he immediately became more energetic as he started to explain to Jiang Chen, "Slave is a specialty to Su City. The mine pit at Su City has over seventy thousand slaves registered for sale. Although I don't have stock on hand, if Mr. Jiang is interested, I will immediately go back and haul you a batch."</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was astonished. "Seventy thousand? What kind of damn place is the mine pit."</br>
</br>
Seventy thousand? Including the shadow population and nearby survivors, the Sixth Street only has fifty thousand people. Slaves registered for sale alone were over seventy thousand, that was insane!</br>
</br>
Although Hu Youde was a bit confused when he heard Jiang Chen didn't know what the mine pit was, he thought that it might be because Jiang Chen had never left Wanghai City and without second guessing it, he began to explain the origin of the mine pit.</br>
</br>
The reason why it was called the mine pit was not necessarily because it was actually a mine pit, but because there was a crystal mine pit worth one hundred thousand crystals or above there! Jiang Chen had heard about crystal mines from Sun Jiao a long time, but he had never seen one. Based on Hu Youde's description, it was a biological mine bed attached to the rock surface and it was in diced meat shape with similar behavior to moss. Although it looked disgusting, crystals could be produced from those diced meat.</br>
</br>
The slaves at the mine pit had to wear protective suits to walk into the mine and pick up the sand-sized crystals from the disgusting and corrosive diced meat.</br>
</br>
Because the owner possessed a huge "gold mine," he hired a bunch of raiders specializing in slave capture as he formed a force of four thousand to become a strong survivor force in Su city. Because they had a special relationship with the raiders nearby, other than outputting crystals, the mine pit also conducted slavery trade.</br>
</br>
The dead parts of the diced meat could be cut and used as a prime ingredient for nutrient supply. Therefore the cost to feed slaves was not high. Hence the slave's population naturally increased.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment. "How many can you haul?"</br>
</br>
"That depends on the type Mr. Jiang wants." Hu Youde smiled. "Right now it is the tail of the winter, it is not too dangerous on the road. The cheapest kind of slave, I can haul you more than one thousand, but that kind can only be used to boost the number without much use. The type with good body conditions, I can also haul you around one hundred. Then it would be the more expensive kind, because of the limited supplies, I'll have to go back before I can give you an accurate response."</br>
</br>
"The expensive kind? What expensive kind?" Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"For example, powerful lone travelers, special talents. Of course, the most expensive is the ice coffin." Hu Youde mysteriously smiled.</br>
</br>
The smile looked perverted.</br>
</br>
"What on earth is an ice coffin?"</br>
</br>
"It is a great thing. Mr. Jiang has heard of hibernation chambers before right?"</br>
</br>
"I have." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
The ultra-low temperature technology allowed humans to pass through an extended period of time with the body's functionality reduced to a minimum. For the people who are using it, fifty years would be the difference of a blink of an eye. Some fallout shelters were even made entirely of hibernation chambers, for example, Yao Yao came out of this type of fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"Imagine this, to have been a top celebrity, or princess before the war, you'll get to enjoy them crying, screaming, and shouting for security and begging for mercy while you tell them the world is hopeless, and then watch their whimpering face turn into despair-"</br>
</br>
"That's enough," Jiang Chen interrupted his psychotic words.</br>
</br>
It was a waste of talent for him to not write erotics with such vivid description.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen didn't look pleased, Hu Youde immediately shut his mouth.</br>
</br>
After a brief pause, Jiang Chen spoke again, "The type of slave with a healthy body, how much would they cost."</br>
</br>
"Twenty crystals for one."</br>
</br>
"Okay, I need one thousand, can you do that?"</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen stated he needed that much, Hu Youde was overjoyed as he immediately agreed.</br>
</br>
"Of course, of course, I can do it, just leave this to me!"</br>
</br>
The slave trade was a lucrative industry. By simply making 10 crystals per slave, it was much more profitable than the firearms business. He didn't even negotiate the price of the firearms as he sold it to Jiang Chen at the eighty thousand crystals cost.</br>
</br>
After finally getting rid of the firearms burden, he couldn't wait as he headed back to Su city immediately. He wanted to transport the slaves before the hibernation of the mutants ended as it would save a lot of costs. March was prime time for trade and it only comes once a year!</br>
</br>
But before he left, he mysteriously stuffed a small wooden box in Jiang Chen's hands, saying it was a gift to the general from the merchant.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen asked what it was, he grinned and lowered his voice, "Do you know the secret behind how the mine pit trains female slaves?"</br>

</br>
It was already the third day. The woman named Xu Lu didn't do anything to her.</br>
</br>
If she had to compare between the past three days and a few days ago, it would just be that the three meals a day were changed to two nutrient supplies per day. If she wanted to go to the washroom, no one would let her out. Instead, a cup would be stuffed under the door.</br>
</br>
As long as she withstood the initial embarrassment, it was not inconvenient at all.</br>
</br>
To the fallout residents who lived a prosperous life, nutrient supply may be unbearable pig food. But to Han Junhua who was a soldier, nutrient supply was a convenient military food. Needless to say, she drank that in the fallout shelter every day. She didn't even have a few hot meals since the war started. Jiang Chen thought a few nutrient supplies would make her surrender? That was too naïve.</br>
</br>
As to being lonely…</br>
</br>
She was used to being lonely for a long time.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua stared at the black wall as he continued to zone out like her usual routine. She had spent her time this way for the past few days as time passed by under such circumstances. She just didn't why that face would occasionally surface in her head.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, it was irregular to have this type of feeling towards the enemy, but she still couldn't resist being curious.</br>
</br>
She was curious about the man who used the weakness of human nature to conquer fallout shelter 027. What kind of method would he use to force her to conform?</br>
</br>
Of course, she thought regardless, it would be impossible.</br>
</br>
Then, the door opened. A ray of light shone into the dark room.</br>
</br>
She narrowed her eyes and looked at the light source. She saw Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"What day is today" She took a tube from Xu Lu's hand as Han Junhua casually asked.</br>
</br>
"Why do you ask?" Xu Lu didn't answer, but instead, she asked back smiling.</br>
</br>
"For you would personally send this to me."</br>
</br>
Xu Lu only smiled at her.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to watch me drink this?"</br>
</br>
There was no response. Han Junhua didn't speak anymore.</br>
</br>
She twisted open the cap as she chugged down the thick liquid expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
Frp, the corner of her eyes, the smile on Xu Lu's face was more and more visible. For some reason, her smile made Han Junhua feel slightly uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
Although she couldn't tell what the reason was, it made her uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, her head became clouded as her vision began to blur.</br>
</br>
Anesthetic?</br>
</br>
As she quietly thought, her consciousness fell into the abyss.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After putting on his pants, Jiang Chen looked at the Han Junhua who had fallen on the ground as an evil smile appeared.</br>
</br>
Although he didn’t take her first time from the front, from the back, however…</br>
</br>
All in all, Han Junhua mindlessly sat on the ground. She looked as if her spirit had escaped her.</br>
</br>
"The training has just begun, you have to last through the whole thing."</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen’s words, Han Junhua’s body visibly twitched, her cold face reflexively displayed a trace of despair.</br>
</br>
The metal door was slammed shut.</br>
</br>
Until the light gradually turned dim before disappearing, what was left to the female PAC colonel was the endless darkness and the joy of climaxing.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen walk out, Xu Lu waiting at the door to greet him.</br>
</br>
"Is it over?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… Umm, I may have gone over the line." Until after the fact did Jiang Chen start to realize how wicked he was.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu was a girl after all. When she heard Jiang Chen say that, her face uncontrollably turned red before quickly recovering.</br>
</br>
"Maintain the status quo?"</br>
</br>
"Maintain the status quo; I will drop by from time to time to… persuade her."</br>
</br>
Xu Lu nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Okay-"</br>
</br>
But at the same time, a "boom" explosion sounded outside of the command center!</br>
</br>
The window glass began to buzz due to the vibration as it scared Xu Lu enough to duck onto the ground with her hands over her head.</br>
</br>
Fires erupted as Camp 27 was in disarray. The survivors all ran towards the elevator while the soldiers ran to the tent area where the explosion had occurred.</br>
</br>
When he heard the explosion, Jiang Chen immediately ran out of the command center; he happened to meet Wang Zhaowu, who was responsible for camp defense.</br>
</br>
"General, I-" After bumping into Jiang Chen, cold sweat began to roll down.</br>
</br>
He was responsible for the defense of the camp. Now that something like this has happened under Jiang Chen’s eyes, he was drenched in cold sweat.</br>
</br>
"Don’t say anything. Go to the explosion scene and figure out what has happened!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew it was not the time to determine who was responsible. The most critical thing was to investigate the reason behind the explosion!</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Wang Zhaowu clenched his teeth as he shouted at the top of his lungs before he ran off to the explosion area.</br>
</br>
The ground was burnt black as the high temperature melted through the concrete brick on the square.</br>
</br>
The fortunate thing was that the explosion occurred at the corner of the camp. Although the erupted flame was daunting, it didn’t cause massive casualties.</br>
</br>
After the soldiers created a zone of separation around the explosion, two soldiers in protective suits ran inside as they quickly searched the explosion area. After confirming that there were no radiation or remaining explosives, they signaled other people to come up.</br>
</br>
</br>
"General, just leave this to us. This place has just blown up and is unsafe." Seeing that Jiang Chen was about to walk up, Wang Zhaowu stopped him.</br>
</br>
"Our soldiers already searched the area; there should be no explosives left on site. It is better to have an extra pair of eyes, so we don’t miss any details. "As Jiang Chen said this, he brushed away Wang Zhaowu’s hand, and he walked to the tent area that was now in shambles.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen could not be convinced, Wang Zhaowu didn’t know what to do as he decided to follow along.</br>
</br>
The tent in the middle of the explosion had already been blown up to dust. Jiang Chen kicked away the fried clothes as he saw a broken face.</br>
</br>
It was Academician Qin.</br>
</br>
When he was beside Jiang Chen, Wang Zhaowu looked at Academician Qin on the ground and said "Poor elder."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the aged face as he gave it a moment of thought before he squatted down.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu looked at Jiang Chen dig through the rocks as he took out a fist-sized mechanical heart from Academician Qin's chest. His eyes were wide open, "Digitalized human?!"</br>
</br>
"That’s right, digitalized human."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t say anything as he stuffed the mechanical heart into Wang Zhaowu’s hand.</br>
</br>
"Investigate the cause of the explosion; I will be waiting in the office."</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen silently left the scene.</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that it was murder, and the target was Academician Qin Xuehai.</br>
</br>
But why?</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Kill confirmed." Lin Chaoen muttered as he put away the controller in his hand and walked away from Camp 27.</br>
</br>
Any experimenter of the fallout shelter must die. It is father’s direction to wipe these experimenters out.</br>
</br>
If they were close, he would personally do it. If they were far, then he would hire raiders or mercenaries.</br>
</br>
The results were the same; the experimenters must be eliminated!</br>
</br>
As to why he didn’t know.</br>
</br>
As an intermediate artificial intelligence, he possessed the ability to think, but he didn’t understand the behavior.</br>
</br>
It was not logically thought through, but more like a belief?</br>
</br>
It was comical to make a machine think from the perspective of a human. Just like it was comical to make a human think from a rock’s perspective.</br>
</br>
After passing through a street, he suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
Bell-shaped eyes were locked upon him, and the shadow of ten claws swayed. Its shaking tail seemed to be telling him that it was ready to make a move.</br>
</br>
There was no Death Claw nest in this area. If a Death Claw appeared, there was only one reason.</br>
</br>
It was targeting him.</br>
</br>
"Death Claw? To finish me, at least send a Mother of Death Claw." Lin Chaoen expressionlessly took out his light sword as he swung it a few times in the air.</br>
</br>
What he didn’t know was, Jiang Chen already killed the Mother of Death Claw.</br>
</br>
"Roar-!"</br>
</br>
The deafening roar created a shockwave, the Death Claw charged at him.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Lin Chaoen moved.</br>
</br>
A trial of data flashed across his pupils as every movement of the Death Claw's muscles were captured by the digitalized eyes before being sent to the central processor. It completed the reaction analysis in 0.0001 seconds.</br>
</br>
He kneeled down with the sword retracted. The fierce wind from the sharp claw cut by his head.</br>
</br>
The light sword brightened and was followed by the scream of the monster in pain. Lin Chaoen’s sword blinded the Death Claw’s eyes before he lowered his body, appearing behind its body.</br>
</br>
With its eyes damaged, the Death Claw stumbled and crashed into the shops on the side of the street.</br>
</br>
It listlessly swung its claws and tail. Concrete pieces scattered everywhere.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen put away the light sword. He took out the particle vibration dagger and strolled to the blinded Death Claw.</br>
</br>
He kicked the right leg of the Death Claw and stepped to the other side of the Death Claw.</br>
</br>
The Death Claw immediately turned around as it swung to where Lin Chaoen had stood, smashing the concrete ground into pieces, but its entire back was exposed.</br>
</br>
With dagger over his head, he effortlessly penetrated its weak spine.</br>
</br>
"Roar-" As it made its last sobbing sound, the Death Claw straightened its back as if it was electrocuted.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen didn’t stop as he swung the dagger down again, cutting its spine in half like he was cutting tofu.</br>
</br>
Blood and organs spilled everywhere, the Death Claw crashed onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Drawing out the dagger, the blood on the blade began to fade. The high vibration frequency had vibrated the dark blood into a fine mist. A path of light bloomed under the sea with the Dindal effect.</br>
</br>
An evolutionary road paved with blood.</br>
</br>
"No improvement at all?" He put away the dagger and walked across the Death Claw's body as one foot stepped out of the half-destroyed shop.</br>
</br>
But then, his footstep stopped.</br>
</br>
Zombies had already surrounded the shop. Pairs of hollow eye sockets locked onto him. In stumbling footsteps, the zombies moved in his direction.</br>
</br>
"Win by numbers? So problematic."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen spoke to himself as the light sword reappeared again.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, zombies would not attack the mechanical him, but these zombies were apparently not typical. The zombies howled and leaped at him.</br>
</br>
The light sword drew a few circles before disappearing into the sea of zombies…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 323: A Murder?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The explosion in the tent area had caused the camp to panic. A lot of people were yelling that they wanted to return to the fallout shelter and there were even signs that it would evolve into conflict with the patrolling soldiers.</br>
</br>
But Wang Zhaowu was rather decisive as he led the camp soldiers to defend the elevator entrance. He fired machineguns into the air to suppressive the signs of unrest and controlled the situation with his forceful action.</br>
</br>
As the director of the camp, Xu Lu didn't sit around. She used her charisma and positive image among the fallout shelter residents to gradually stabilize the residents' emotion.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the investigation for the cause of the explosion was rapidly in progress.</br>
</br>
Not long after, a report was placed on Jiang Chen's table.</br>
</br>
21 wounded, five died, 17 tents destroyed.</br>
</br>
The center of the explosion was close to Academician Qin; only two to three meters away. Further away, the soldiers managed to find the wreckage of a drone. Based on the pieces of evidence, it could be concluded that someone controlled a drone with a bomb towards Academician Qin's tent before remotely detonating it.</br>
</br>
It was a blatant murder, and the murder came from outside the tent.</br>
</br>
But why?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes were closed shut as he went into deep thought.</br>
</br>
He couldn't understand what would make an elder, who was already half a step inside his coffin, so hateful. Especially an elder that just came out of the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he seemed to have caught onto something as he took out the black metallic sphere Academician Qin gave to him.</br>
</br>
"Is it because of this?"</br>
</br>
With a bomb, the person obviously didn't want this thing. Someone wanted to destroy the communication coordinate with Zhenghe Ship? Of course, that was only a possibility. Another possibility was based on the consideration of Academician Qin's identity. Someone wanted to eliminate the experimenter at Fallout Shelter 027...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Someone knocked gently on the office door.</br>
</br>
After throwing the "golden apple" into the storage dimension, Jiang Chen said, "Come in."</br>
</br>
Xu Lu pushed open the door and walked inside.</br>
</br>
"The residents' emotions have all been stabilized. New tents and supplies were provided to the residents that suffered losses. To the residents that suffered more severe wounds, they are transported to the fallout shelter for medical aid."</br>
</br>
"Great, you did well." Jiang Chen nodded, validating her work.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu humbly smiled as she waited for further instruction from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Where is Wang Zhaowu?"</br>
</br>
"He is personally patrolling with the team. Do you need me to find him?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head, "No need. Tell him there is no need to be so anxious. I won't blame him on this since no one would have thought of using a drone to detonate a bomb. However, I hope the same thing won't happen a second time."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Okay." Xu Lu nodded and left the office, gently closing the door behind her.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned on his chair again as he tilted his head to face the ceiling. Slowly closing his eyes, he tried to sort through the listless evidence inside his head.</br>
</br>
To be honest, if it were just a few irrelevant fallout shelter residents who had died, he wouldn't be bothered by it at all. What made Jiang Chen unsettled was the feeling of being in a bigger conspiracy.</br>
</br>
Someone killed people in his territory and used an unexpected method. However, he had no clue about the motive behind the killing.</br>
</br>
There were two possibilities. One was to destroy the golden apple, and another was to kill Academician Qin…</br>
</br>
Wait!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly opened his eyes as he realized he entered into a logical error.</br>
</br>
Regardless who the killer was, he must be sure of one thing, and that is the fallout shelter is already open, and Academician Qin has moved to the surface. It was not hard to know about this point as camp 27 was only recently constructed, and the camp was not well fortified like the Fishbone base. A drone hovered in the air would thoroughly detect everything in the base.</br>
</br>
Who would have plotted against fallout shelter 027 from the start, and, as if he had the foresight, know that it has opened recently? The answer was obvious.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen, and the people from the Crimson Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
Based on the mission details obtained in the EP, Jiang Chen could deduce that Crimson Chamber of Commerce could only be considered an accomplice. They were helping Lin Chaoen with the formula of "happy times."</br>
</br>
Therefore, it must be Lin Chaoen that plotted this explosion!</br>
</br>
But what are his motives?</br>
</br>
A word popped into his head.</br>
</br>
Evolution!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still remembered the words that Academician Qin had told him about the three directions of evolution for civilization, as well as the inevitability of ideology output from the new civilization to the old one. Jiang Chen didn't think it was a big deal, but now something like this has happened.</br>
</br>
Could it be that these two things are connected?</br>
</br>
"Robots, digitalized human… representing Supreme?" Jiang Chen mustered.</br>
</br>
Then, the signal light at the corner of the table began to flash.</br>
</br>
Seeing that there was a phone call, Jiang Chen pressed on the corner. Before him, a holographic projection appeared and projected Cheng Weiguo's portrait.</br>
</br>
"Boss, we have already investigated the location you have requested." When he saw Jiang Chen, Cheng Weiguo reported in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Did you find something."</br>
</br>
"We found a survivor gathering spot… but we are not certain. This is the aerial view." As he said this, Cheng Weiguo transmitted a video in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was a recording from one thousand meters above.</br>
</br>
The target location was an office building. Because it was close to the city center, the building received higher impact from the high temperature of the shockwave. Just from the burnt surface, there was nothing to be made out. But from the sentry guns at the top of the building, it was not a no man land.</br>
</br>
Immediately, the helicopter descended. The pilot wanted to move closer to observe if there were survivor activities but was quickly fired at by the anti-air machine guns hidden underneath. The picture shook violently and was immediately followed by the helicopter backing away.</br>
</br>
Because he didn't receive any attack instructions, the gunner didn't fire back with the Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon.</br>
</br>
"Is there someone there?" Jiang Chen asked with a frown.</br>
</br>
"It is unclear." Cheng Weiguo's expression was helpless, "Any survivor gathering spot with some capability would be equipped with life signal detection absorber. From the outside, it was impossible to tell if there were people inside. But with the number of sentry guns, someone should be there."</br>
</br>
"Send a few drones to keep an eye on it, if there is anything immediately report to me. Also, send a few more men to camp 27… If there is nothing else, that's it."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Cheng Weiguo saluted and ended the communication.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned off the screen as he let out a sigh against the chair.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, why are there so many things to take care of."</br>
</br>
He cursed as he got up and left the office.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen spoke with Wang Zhaowu and urged him to prioritize drone defense. Establishing a radar within the camp and an EMP trap were necessary.</br>
</br>
After these things were finished, Jiang Chen returned to the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
It was almost mid-March. If there were no surprises, the events in the modern world should be progressing smoothly.</br>
</br>
He has already left for a month. It would be better to solve the Pannu Islands' problem as early as possible. Now that the modern world's development was at a bottleneck, he could only bring out those insane technologies after he manages to secure a reliable location.</br>
</br>
After telling Sun Jiao that he was leaving for a few days, Jiang Chen took a batch of firearms from the Sixth Street and traveled back to the modern world.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 324"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 324: The Gunshots in Coro</br>
</div></br>
To the Pannu Islands near the equator, the difference between winter and summer was negligible.</br>
</br>
The sea breeze from the South Pacific Ocean carried the salty taste unique to the ocean; it swayed the green palm trees as well as the desolate smokes.</br>
</br>
War.</br>
</br>
No one had expected that the shadow of war would cover this isolated and small country.</br>
</br>
As to who shot first, no one remembered.</br>
</br>
The Liberal Party, with the support of "unknown force's" funding as well as the firearms purchased from UA arms dealer, quickly equipped an anti-government force of five hundred.</br>
</br>
Their original plan was to start the uprising at the end of March. With the force separated into two, one force attacking Johnny's mansion while the other capture the presidential palace. They wanted to end president Edward's corrupt reign and support the new regime.</br>
</br>
But the truth stated that they were still too nave.</br>
</br>
The uprising experienced hardships from the beginning. While the Liberal party, with an ample amount of funding and the extreme disappointment of the people towards Pannu's current regime, could quickly gather a force willing to fight. But because of the abundance of people as well as the dismay in management, Pannu's current government seemed to have received information beforehand. The moment the uprising started, the military reacted.</br>
</br>
The riot first started in Pannu Islands' capital Coro. The anti-government soldiers, wearing masks printed with the new state and the city's camouflage were equipped with M4A1s. They were quickly tossed into an intense fire with state forces who held the same equipment.</br>
</br>
Then they were forced to retreat multiple times.</br>
</br>
The result completely surprised the Liberal Party.</br>
</br>
They originally thought that the moment the first shot was fired, the government military would join forces with them under the banner of justice.</br>
</br>
But their plan failed.</br>
</br>
The government military immediately started firing, and the soldiers wearing the new flag was quickly gunned down on the street. Then the armored vehicles headed onto the road as the 50 caliber heavy machine guns began to unleash its power on the rioters, concrete debris as well as broken limbs scattered everywhere.</br>
</br>
Although the government force was made up of only100 people, they were all professional soldiers. Even if they used the same UA equipment, the combat ability of both sides was not on the same level. Especially since the government forces had armored vehicles and a tank on top of everything!</br>
</br>
It was slaughter.</br>
</br>
The new flag symbol didn't bring courage to the coup but instead became the identification symbol for the government force to identify the enemy. The strategy of a direct fire was wrong. Although the Liberal Party's cause was deeply instilled in every Pannu citizen's heart, they still vastly overestimated their own influence and power. In modern warfare, numbers are not the decisive factor in winning a battle.</br>
</br>
</br>
Blood flowed from the front of the presidential palace to the north bank of Coro Island. The rioters attacking the palace had to continuously retreat. Those who were intelligent ripped off their masks and fled, pretending to be citizens. However, the slow reacting rioters were pushed out of the rural area and forced to jump off the cliff at the north end of Coro island.</br>
</br>
The vibrant blood made the passionate young men calm down. Although ideology was necessary, so was life. To the enemy they could not beat, they had no desire to fight for their life.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the battle, the same group of people attacking Johnny's mansion also suffered heavy defeat…</br>
</br>
Sparks jumped everywhere as the bullet shells dropped onto the ground.</br>
</br>
A white man in a bulletproof vest leaned against the wall as he maintained a professional stature. The SCAR assault rifle accurately eliminated the rioters across the street.</br>
</br>
"Headshot, the fifth one." The corner of Ouburn's mouth, holding the cigarette, curled. He adjusted his gun before pressing the trigger one more time, "Now it is the sixth one… You have lost."</br>
</br>
"Sh*t." The black young man leaning in front of the other window cursed as he felt the pain of losing the 200 USD bet.</br>
</br>
The rioters with M series assult rifles were no different than monkeys with sticks. Without receiving professional military training, they couldn't even use their cover to create crossfire coverage.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation outside?" Johnny walked behind them as he carefully peeked out of the window.</br>
</br>
He had thought that he was courageous. One time for a pound of weed, he even whipped out a pistol to exchange fire with people from another gang. But that courage didn't seem to be too useful on the battlefield. He looked at the concrete debris scattering everywhere as it was the first time he felt so fearful.</br>
</br>
Ouborn spat out the cigarette butt in his mouth and laughed. "Boss, don't worry. Even if 100 more came, they will only be targets."</br>
</br>
As he said this, the heavy machinegun on the roof unleashed fire and pinned ten something rioters, who were attempting to climb into the mansion, dead on the ground.</br>
</br>
"Just like this," Ouborn gave a thumbs up to the window on the other side as he said casually to Johnny.</br>
</br>
They were mercenaries from Australia and part of the Australian special force before leaving the army. Now, they receive a high salary of 5000 USD a month to protect this UA rich man.</br>
</br>
Johnny felt relieved. He sat on the sofa before standing up again.</br>
</br>
On the table was wine produced from Australia. Although the cap was removed, the anxious him didn't take a single sip out of it.</br>
</br>
"Boss, perhaps you need to relax." The black man with rifle comforted him as his smiled exposed his white teeth.</br>
</br>
It was too easy to take care of these rioters.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, of course, I know." He sat back on the sofa again as Johnny grabbed the wine bottle before pouring a cup for himself.</br>
</br>
But because his arms were trembling, the red liquid spilled onto his hand...</br>
</br>
"What a waste." The black man longingly moved his sight away from the wine as he shifted his attention back to the scope of the assault rifle.</br>
</br>
"Pay attention. Make sure you secure your position."</br>
</br>
"Okay, boss."</br>
</br>
The mercenaries didn't know why their boss was so frightened. The rioters had no deterrence at all. Although they conducted a massive scale attack, that soon was stopped by the heavy machine gun on the roof.</br>
</br>
Just a little longer, the military force will arrive. Johnny was the star businessman on Pannu Islands, as Edward has easily taken more than ten million USD from Johnny's hands.</br>
</br>
But only Johnny knew himself that the money didn't belong to himself, and instead, a man called Robert gave it to him.</br>
</br>
He previously didn't feel uncomfortable at all as he freely used the bundles of cash to do business, bribe, and cause havoc under Robert's directions. But with Johnny International starting to expand, he almost possessed a monopoly over the entire Pannu Islands' economy.</br>
</br>
Until this point, he started to listen less and less to Robert's direction, at least he thought so. They didn't have a debt relationship. Without Robert's help, Johnny International could operate smoothly now.</br>
</br>
And once the area Linhua Group was developing is complete, the tourism on Pannu Islands would exponentially grow, and his Johnny International would reap the benefits.</br>
</br>
That was true until a phone call two days ago woke him up from his sweet dream.</br>
</br>
"Two days later, the Liberal Party will face an upheaval." That day, Robert told him on the phone.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible, they are only an underground party without power or money," Johnny remembered as he rebuked immediately without hesitation.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? I am only reminding you. It's up to you if you want to listen or not."</br>
</br>
After this sentence, Robert hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Johnny didn't think it was a big deal, but he felt uneasy as he spoke with Edward about it. He said that he had heard from an employee about the Liberal Party planning an uprising…</br>
</br>
But the uprising actually happened.</br>
</br>
The rioters were weak, weak to the point where his bodyguards didn't suffer any injuries to block all of them out of his mansion. As to the bullet holes in the walls, it would only take a few thousand dollars to repair, his only loss…</br>
</br>
But what frightened Johnny was not this, but everything had been under Robert's control.</br>
</br>
How did he know the riot would occur? Isn't that guy in Los Santos? Dammit.</br>
</br>
Confusion and fear tangled in his heart, he couldn't bother with the wine on his pants as he took a big gulp from the cup.</br>
</br>
The red colored alcohol rolled down the corner of his mouth, along his neck, and passed beneath his collar.</br>
</br>
"Ha!"</br>
</br>
He swung his hand as he smashed the glass into the wall.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! Sh*t!" Johnny swore out loud as he stood up from the leather sofa. He walked to the stairs and headed down.</br>
</br>
"What's happening with boss?" The black guy glanced at the stairs and cursed.</br>
</br>
"War anxiety? I think all the new recruits suffer from this during their first," a bodyguard who hadn't spoken said in a low voice.</br>
</br>
Ouborn didn't say anything as he vision remain locked 500 meters away, the scope's crosshairs behind a rioter running away.</br>
</br>
He had already dropped his weapon, but Ouborn didn't plan to spare him.</br>
</br>
"Thirteenth," Ouborn pressed the trigger as he muttered out grimly.</br>
</br>
Johnny arrived at the basement downstairs.</br>
</br>
Four women were locked here barely covered in clothes. Their skin colors differed with varying identities. Three were locals while a blonde was a news reporter for New Zealand who has been locked here for less than a week.</br>
</br>
They wore eye masks, face masks and locked in cages. When they heard the door opening, their feeble figures began to move, followed by a pleading whimper and the sound of shaking chain.</br>
</br>
Breathing heavily, Johnny loosened the belt on his pants as he only wanted to unleash his anxiety through hormones.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, bit*hes…"</br>
</br>
The phone suddenly rang as it made the aroused Johnny jump.</br>
</br>
He took out his phone, wanting to smash into the wall. However, he saw the caller.</br>
</br>
&lt;Robert&gt;</br>
</br>
His fingers began to tremble as he instinctively wanted to hang up the phone.</br>
</br>
But after debating for a moment, he gulped as he picked up.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"You picked up? I thought you would hang up on me," Robert mocked.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, tell me what the fu*k you want." Johnny no longer respected him like when he first came to Pannu Islands as he shouted back angrily.</br>
</br>
"You drank?"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
"No wonder you are an Irish that lives inside booze." Robert grinned. He cleared his throat and then continued, "Let's talk about something serious. If you want to live, follow what I say right now. There is a boat on the North shore of Coro Island, take it. It will take you east to Australia, and you can spend the rest of your life there in peace and wealth.</br>
</br>
There was no response.</br>
</br>
Robert paused for a moment as he moved the phone away.</br>
</br>
He didn't know when the phone disconnected.</br>
</br>
"This dumba*s."</br>
</br>
Robert shook his head while laughing. He didn't bother with Johnny anymore as he called Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"He rejected," Robert said.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Lying on top of a chair while enjoying the peaceful horizon, Jiang Chen sluggishly held his phone.</br>
</br>
Although unfortunate, it was something he expected. Since Johnny just experienced life where he was above everything, a single phone call would not be enough to make him ditch everything there and spend the rest of his life in a corner. It was unpractical.</br>
</br>
Especially since he felt that he had now gained the confidence to break away from the chains on him, it certainly made sense.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, I don’t understand. Just shoot this garbage, why make it so problematic. If he really accepted the route of retiring in Australia, would you really let him live?" Robert complained.</br>
</br>
Johnny knew too much, it would be a threat to let him walk.</br>
</br>
"There was a high probability of him rejecting the offer. But since he did contribute to my cause, I thought it would be a nice gesture to give him an option. Of course, to making the wrong choice, I feel sincerely sorry."</br>
</br>
Although when Jiang Chen said that, he didn’t look sorry at all.</br>
</br>
"…Ok. Let’s not talk about that dumba*s anymore. The Freedom Party people got beat up badly this time." Robert’s tone carried a trace of mockery.</br>
</br>
"This guy, they bought the firearms from you, who laughs at their customer this way?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I remember teaching the dumba*s that bought the firearms from me how to use the AT4 RPG, but I heard they didn’t even bust a single armored vehicle." Robert cursed out, but he sounded like he was laughing.</br>
</br>
Because the harder they fall, the more advantageous it was for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he didn’t respond to his words.</br>
</br>
Without busting a single armored vehicle was something unexpected for them. Based on what Jiang Chen and Robert had imagined, even if the uprising failed, they should at least be able to break two or three armored vehicles, perhaps they could even cause some trouble to that tank. The fewer heavy armors on the island, the more advantageous it would be for the next step.</br>
</br>
The tropical climate made it really easy for people to feel sluggish. Although the phone was still by Jiang Chen's ear, he began to feel sleepy.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Are you still listening?" When he heard there was no response for a while, Robert asked.</br>
</br>
"Ahh, yes… Mhmm, just leave the rest to me."</br>
</br>
"Eight armored vehicles, one tank, and two helicopters, you sure that's okay?" Robert was skeptical.</br>
</br>
Although he participated in the creation of Future Security, because he was not part of the training, he was unsure about their capability. Even though they had trained for half a year already, their opponent was the actual military.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen yawned.</br>
</br>
"Okay, looks like I am worrying too much. I will not disturb your nap." Robert joked and then hung up.</br>
</br>
</br>
Not a problem? Rather, it was simple.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put the phone on the table as he sluggishly stretched out his body.</br>
</br>
His thoughts drifted to the distant horizon, and he gave up the control of his muscles to gravity. It felt like his entire body was loose.</br>
</br>
He had enough of the oppressive feeling at the wasteland, enough of the yellowish green radiation particles. The pristine blue and pure white made him unusually relaxed.</br>
</br>
"It would be great if someone could live here forever." Jiang Chen muttered to himself and closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
After spending too long in the apocalypse, he was tainted with a trace of hostility. However, following the sound of the crashing waves in the Southern Kingdom, his hostility was being washed away.</br>
</br>
A trace of fragrance entered his nose.</br>
</br>
Soft skin gently touched his head.</br>
</br>
With a smile on his face, Jiang Chen opened his eyes. Like what he had expected, it was the exotic face.</br>
</br>
It was Ayesha.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came back to the modern world, he asked her to come back.</br>
</br>
The sea wind swayed the lightly curly hair. The white veil outlined the lithe but athletic figure. The vest line on her abs stretched to the tip of her bikini; her pale skin was that bright under the tropical sunshine.</br>
</br>
"You are here," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Ivan said you were here, so I came." Within her green pupils, there was love as gentle as water. Ayesha smiled timidly as she hugged Jiang Chen’s head from behind.</br>
</br>
As he saw the softness on her face, Jiang Chen smiled, satisfied.</br>
</br>
"Are you used to the climate here?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded, but the words that floated out of her mouth were something completely different.</br>
</br>
"I miss you."</br>
</br>
Regardless how many time he listened to it, it made his heart beat a little faster.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, me too."</br>
</br>
He gently squeezed the hand caressing his face as he kissed the back of her soft hand.</br>
</br>
With fingers trembling, Ayesha became misty-eyed.</br>
</br>
She leaned forward and pecked on Jiang Chen’s lips.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only smiled. He quietly held onto her hand and watched the line connecting the ocean and the sky.</br>
</br>
In the sea waves of the Southern Kingdom, the two stayed until the sun set.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
This was the southernmost tip of Pannu Islands. The tragedy at the north end, Coro island, didn’t disturb the peace here.</br>
</br>
The deep water harbor was deserted as the two docks were empty, only a few seagulls unpleasantly left some droppings. The small deep-water harbor that had cost at least five million USD perhaps was a failed investment to begin with. The occasional vessel that docked here was mostly here to unload to the Celestial Trade company storage.</br>
</br>
The situation on the island was highly volatile as the government agencies were a complete mess. The government force searched house by house for the anti-government forces which put the entire island into panic mode. The uprising failed in less than 12 hours, everyone knew it was the end of the Freedom Party as they drew the line between them.</br>
</br>
Although the rioters didn’t hurt president Edward, an AT4 rocket happened to land in his backyard and torn his nicely decorated garden into pieces. The enraged Edward immediately ordered all rioters to be hung and ordered that all residents must cooperate with the military force’s search. Any non-cooperation would be viewed as the accomplice of the rioters.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang. Did you happen to see… rioters with weapons?" A Pannu soldier in city camouflage stood in front of the warehouse and asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Other than my security, no locals approached this place today." Jiang Chen smiled at the solider.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" The soldier extended his neck to peek inside the warehouse, but he didn’t go in.</br>
</br>
Edward specifically urged them to not offend the foreign investors.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands were in the stage of development, and they needed investments (bribes). If this riot changed these capitalists’ investment rating for Pannu, it would be problematic.</br>
</br>
Although they have received information that a few Freedom party members escaped to the Southern end of Coro Island, there was no evidence pointed to them fleeing here.</br>
</br>
The soldier looked at Jiang Chen for a few more times before he signaled his comrades to leave.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched the Jeep drive away as he smiled unnoticeably. He then went back into the warehouse.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
From the shadow of the warehouse, Zhang Yapin’s lifeless face appeared as he walked in front of Jiang Chen and bowed deeply.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 326"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 326: Commissioning the War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the Zhang Yapin who seemed to have aged overnight. He gave him a comforting smile.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin's face was full of bitterness. His mouth twitched for a while before he finally squeezed out a sentence.</br>
</br>
"We failed… Sorry."</br>
</br>
Five hundred people, five times the force!</br>
</br>
They never thought they would fail; even if two people died for every government force, they wouldn't have lost. But they overestimated the determination of the people that joined the force. They had the will of iron before the war, but as soon as the war started, they swore at their parents for not giving an extra pair of legs when they fleed the battle. Only a few died in the crossfire, but countless died escaping.</br>
</br>
Regarding equipment, the anti-government had excellent equipment. Although they didn't have any armored units, they had plenty of anti-armor AT4 rockets. Not to say the countless light machine guns, grenades, and smoke grenades… Unfortunately, they didn't use them before escaping, leaving the equipment to the government force.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, a total loss.</br>
</br>
The uprising had failed, the Liberal Party under the suppression of the current regime could not even take care of themselves, Jiang Chen's five million USD investment naturally went down the drain.</br>
</br>
To the foreign businessman that helped him when he was in need, Zhang Yapin felt guilty. However, he couldn't do anything about it.</br>
</br>
"Do you know the reason behind why you failed?" Jiang Chen asked lightly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin bitterly smiled as he leaned on the wall of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
"The lack of organization? The lack of training?"</br>
</br>
"Your uprising was too hasty." Jiang Chen then muttered to himself in his mind, [Sorry, Robert leaked the information.]</br>
</br>
"Regardless… There is no use to saying any of this."</br>
</br>
"Have you given up?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"…The civil war ended in 12 hours, Edward's government had already demonstrated the power of the Pannu military. At least in the next 10 years, no one would dare oppose his ruling."</br>
</br>
"Of course I know this, I don't need you to tell me. I only want to ask, have you given up?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin stared at Jiang Chen blankly. Finally, Zhang Yapin with a bitter smile shook his head.</br>
</br>
"How can I give up… But, I will learn to accept this reality. We originally thought that with 500 people and advanced equipment, we could easily execute Edward, but…"</br>
</br>
"There is no could in history, and no if."</br>
</br>
"I know, but I... Sorry, but I have failed your investment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed. "Five million USD is only a small number to me, I am willing to take the bet. Business is a lot like gambling. The truth is I lost the first round. Now I just want to know, are you still worth my next bet."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was shocked.</br>
</br>
</br>
'You mean…"</br>
</br>
"I can fund five million more."</br>
</br>
"That is wasting money. Not only did president Edward outlaw forming any parties, even if the Liberal party rose again, no one would respond under our banner."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
He needed that effect. A weak, and easy to control government in power. Therefore, even if they replaced president Edward, their reputation among the citizens would not be high because the previous regime was not overthrown by them, but only under external influence. It will be a replica of what happened in Iraq, a complete puppet regime.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin looked at Jiang Chen's pleasant smile in confusion, he didn't know what was funny.</br>
</br>
"I remember you studied in New Zealand before."</br>
</br>
"That's right." Zhang Yapin nodded. He even considered that if the uprising was to fail, he could flee to New Zealand or Australia.</br>
</br>
"Then have you heard the word mercenary before?"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The riot ended.</br>
</br>
The gunshots in Coro city had completed stopped, replaced by the siren of ambulances. Not only were the rioters injured, so were innocent citizens. The riot happened all of a sudden without any time to react. After the failed uprising, the cowardly rioters escaped into the crowd which caused a lot of ordinary citizens to be wounded, and there were even casualties.</br>
</br>
Tonight would not be quiet.</br>
</br>
Outside of the presidential palace.</br>
</br>
In the palace similar to the Whitehouse, Edward was facing cameras as he clarified the situation to the foreign reporters eager for news.</br>
</br>
"Mr. President, what's your opinion on this riot?"</br>
</br>
"They are only a bunch rioters, and my military suppressed them! Let me repeat, they are all rioters! Other than that, I have no opinion," Edward shouted at the British reporter.</br>
</br>
He didn't remember how many times he had to clarify this. Are the heads of the Western reporters made out of glue? Or are they just deaf?</br>
</br>
"Is that so? But they are all citizens of Pannu Islands, without using the police and directly sending the military, did this not violate the constitution of the country?"</br>
</br>
"I repeat, no! If I have, I will go change it now."</br>
</br>
"Is your country's constitution written on toilet paper?" A UA reporter mocked.</br>
</br>
The crowd laughed.</br>
</br>
Edward was so angry his face turned white, but he couldn't do anything to them.</br>
</br>
The firm stance of the Pannu regime was only domestic. The UA aircraft carrier was parked at Guam Island one thousand kilometers away. They would be able to initiate military action to rescue their citizens within moments.</br>
</br>
The only thing that angered him was that he had ordered for all flights into the country to be suspended two days ago, but these reporters seemed to have appeared out of thin air onto his territory.</br>
</br>
After dealing with the reporters, the weary Edward returned to the presidential palace and sat on his chair.</br>
</br>
But before he could get a moment of peace, a Han walked in.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng, the representative from Linhua Group. He was from a relatively powerful family from Hua and was also the son of Linhua Group's president Wang Linhua.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?" Edward used a calm tone as he looked at the man standing in front of his table.</br>
</br>
"Regarding the progress on construction," with fluid English, Wang Tianfeng was straightforward, "the riot in your country effected the progress of our construction…"</br>
</br>
"If it's in regards to business, you can talk with Johnny." Edward didn't want to listen to this question anymore.</br>
</br>
"But I haven't been able to find him recently," Wang Tianfeng said helplessly.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't' want to come to this god forbidden place. Even if he had to deal with foreigners, he would rather go to Europe or North America. But Linhua Group's business expansion internationally was the decision of his father and the board. As the successor of Linhua Group, he had to familiarize himself with international business.</br>
</br>
Based on what his father said, it was an excellent opportunity to build a reputation for their company. On the peaceful Pacific Island, compared to the politically unstable Africa, it was much easier to develop business here…</br>
</br>
Yes, two months ago, it was peaceful here. But now, the riot had almost entirely halted construction.</br>
</br>
To be honest, rather than staying in the real estate business, he favored the future of IT much more. But Linhua Group's failure to acquire Future Technology. Additionally, this massive project from overseas has made the board change their decision.</br>
</br>
As he thought about this, Wang Tianfeng cursed at the person called Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He was a dog raised by the Wang family. He feels this bloated just by being on the Wall Street Journal twice.</br>
</br>
While he thought about this, he selectively ignored the ability Future Technology had demonstrated and put all the achievement of Future Technology domestically as the success of his uncle. But he was not to be blamed for thinking this way as Linhua Group rose because of political support.</br>
</br>
"You can't find him?" Edward raised his eyebrows in shock.</br>
</br>
"I went to his mansion, but his security blocked me out. From the looks of it, the security level there is pretty high?"</br>
</br>
"What is that guy doing?"</br>
</br>
There was a limit to fearing death. The civil war has already ended and he is still hiding in his mansion?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 327: Pannu Landing</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The night began to fall.</br>
</br>
Despite the intense change that happened during the day, most of the Pannu people have drifted to sleep already.</br>
</br>
Johnny was still in his mansion; curled up in his basement. Sitting on top of the cold wooden chair, he was chugging his collection.</br>
</br>
Lafette from 1982, Margaux from 1986… Half a year ago, these were things he wouldn't even dare to dream about. The weed in Los Santos was expensive, but compared to the "blood of the upper class", it was still night and day.</br>
</br>
The basement was humid, but he was trembling.</br>
</br>
Not because of the cold, but because of the fear he felt from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
He ordered the mercenaries to station themselves around the mansion and not let a single fly in.</br>
</br>
He could read through their eyes. He knew the people he has paid to do things thought he was crazy. But he didn't care, he had enough money, he only wanted to live…</br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't know why he was afraid of the guy who was in faraway Los Santos or why he was scared of the person behind Robert. Although this mansion and the saving in his bank account all belonged to him, he didn't have any sense of security.</br>
</br>
He felt like a hand was controlling everything.</br>
</br>
Like being the reckless billionaire he is, the increasingly cocky dictator president, the officials corrupted by USD…</br>
</br>
And the hundreds of bodies outside the mansion.</br>
</br>
He chugged the red wine like there was no tomorrow.</br>
</br>
The sour-sweet taste in his throat was like the ink of the bill, the color was like virgin blood.</br>
</br>
Beside him were four naked bodies, but he didn't have enough energy to play with them anymore. Even his finger became sore eventually.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t!" He cursed as he flung away the glass in his hand.</br>
</br>
Smash-</br>
</br>
The glass shattered.</br>
</br>
He stared at the pool of redness on the ground as he decadently burped.</br>
</br>
"Dammit."</br>
</br>
He said this in Han. It sounded weird. He learned it from Wang Tianfeng.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng just came to find him, the bodyguard told him.</br>
</br>
Robert introduced Linhua Group. Wang Tianfeng was the representative from Linhua Group, and he didn't trust them.</br>
</br>
He was shaking. His instincts told him, someone wants to kill him, someone wants him died.</br>
</br>
He didn't want to die. He wanted to continue to play the role of a billionaire. He could act recklessly and at his will. Whether it was the wife or the daughter of the neighbor, as long as he was interested and he had the USD, Edward would solve the problem for him.</br>
</br>
But the last call from Robert woke him up completely.</br>
</br>
Yes, he was just a thug from the ghetto, an Irish without any talent. The only reason he possessed everything was that someone needed him to stir the muddy water.</br>
</br>
Leave? Retire in West Australia? Go to hell, how could he agree!</br>
</br>
</br>
He hung up on Robert and ripped apart the sim card.</br>
</br>
With a grim look in his eyes, he stared at the basement door.</br>
</br>
"Come, I want to see, how will you take my fu*king life away!"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next evening, at the southern tip of Coro Island.</br>
</br>
An old transport vessel quietly sailed into the empty port.</br>
</br>
The port was deserted without a soul. Due to what had happened yesterday, most of the residents on Coro island were immersed in fear and sorrow. Most people chose to ask for a day of leave so that they wouldn't need to go outside.</br>
</br>
The vessel docked.</br>
</br>
Fifty muscular figures walked down from the vessel in an orderly fashion.</br>
</br>
The vessel came from West Africa. It sailed across half the globe.</br>
</br>
Ivan stood along with Jiang Chen on the high ground near the port. Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he overlooked his loyal soldiers on the dock.</br>
</br>
"These are fifty of the most talented soldiers. They have fought with Tuareg tribe's guerrillas before during their training in Niger. But for real, is there no need to bring any equipment along?" Ivan asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"No need. "Our firearms" have been transported into the warehouse already," Jiang Chen answered concisely.</br>
</br>
Ivan looked at Jiang Chen in astonishment.</br>
</br>
The firearms had already arrived, and he didn't sense it the slightest. His came to gain a new understanding of the boss' ability once again.</br>
</br>
"When should we start the operation?" Ivan asked concisely.</br>
</br>
"When you are prepared."</br>
</br>
A slightly cruel smile appeared on Ivan's mouth.</br>
</br>
"Then now is a good time."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and threw warehouse No.3's key into Ivan's hand.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I will leave it up to you."</br>
</br>
After he finished, Jiang Chen left.</br>
</br>
Ivan watched Jiang Chen leave as he stood firm and saluted.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Including the fifty people that arrived earlier, the total number of mercenaries from Future Security had reached 65 people. It was equivalent to half of the force of Future Security.</br>
</br>
No armored vehicles, no tank.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen prepared something much more advanced, kinetic skeletons and drones.</br>
</br>
Before he returned to the modern world, Jiang Chen almost cleaned out all the kinetic skeletons stored in the warehouse of the Fishbone base, even the ones that just came off the production line. Wang Qin was quite confused as to why Jiang Chen moved these things into the mansion.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen obviously wouldn't explain it to her.</br>
</br>
When he opened the containers inside warehouse No.3, Ivan ordered the captain of each team to hand a kinetic skeleton to each of the soldiers. At the training base in Niger, Jiang Chen left two sets of kinetic skeletons. Therefore, all the soldiers here have practiced with them, so they had no problems equipping them.</br>
</br>
Wearing the kinetic skeleton with polyethylene bulletproof boards and wielding the fluid looking Reaper assault rifle, the team of futuristic looking soldiers walked out of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
The 64 people were divided into eight teams under the command of Ivan to complete the mission. All instructions would be given by the terminal in Ivan's hand and sent in real time to the tactical helmet of each captain.</br>
</br>
The eight modified vans were the only method of transportation used. Both to store ammunition and as a drone control terminal.</br>
</br>
Other than the eight infantry teams, fifty hummingbird drone would also be involved. In a small-scale conflict without EMP, the disc-sized drone was without a natural predator.</br>
</br>
It was meant to be an unfair war, just like how the military steam-rolled the anti-government force.</br>
</br>
From equipping to dispatching, it only took ten minutes.</br>
</br>
Standing in front of the warehouse, Zhang Yapin silently watched the trials of dust left by the eight vans, speechless.</br>
</br>
When he watched Ivan, Jiang Chen's "bodyguard", begin to command these mercenaries, he already guessed the identity of these mercenaries.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked beside Zhang Yapin with a smile. "I am glad you made the correct choice."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Perhaps it is the worst choice." Zhang Yapin sounded like he was speaking to himself.</br>
</br>
"It would have to depend on how you view the problem.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"Imagine this. Until today, you were all just underground party members that the government searched for. From today on, I will raise you to the throne." Jiang Chen exaggeratedly opened his arms.</br>
</br>
"But this 'throne' is only your puppet, am I right?" Zhang Yapin smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he understood the situation well, Jiang Chen laughed joyfully.</br>
</br>
He thoughtfully looked into the eyes of the future president.</br>
</br>
"That's right. But without me, you are not even a puppet."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Deep into the night in Pannu barracks.</br>
</br>
Soldier A: "Stop sleeping, the superior said to take extra caution, we have to keep an eye out."</br>
</br>
Soldier B rubbed his eyes and adjusted his hat, "Mhmm, I will be up soon…"</br>
</br>
The battle yesterday lasted until midnight. Until now, they haven’t had the opportunity to close their eyes.</br>
</br>
Solider A lit up a cigarette as he glanced at the small TV in the corner, "The TV is playing president Edward’s speech…"</br>
</br>
Soldier B sighed. "War… This goddamn war. Once the curfew is over, what do you plan to do?"</br>
</br>
Soldier A: "Take my kids on vacation in Australia. Little Jim has been wanting to go for a long time. He wants to the see the Great Barrier Reefs… What about you?"</br>
</br>
Within the military, president Edward had high prestige. Some of the personal checks he received were distributed among the soldiers as a bonus. And because of this, while he didn’t gain respect among the citizens, he received support from the military.</br>
</br>
Soldier B: "I think I need to take care of my family. She said in the letters that she wished I'd come back early."</br>
</br>
Soldier A: "I wish this whole fiasco can be over soon…"</br>
</br>
Soldier B: "Shhhh… I just heard something…"</br>
</br>
That voice was light, like the vibration of a cicada's wings.</br>
</br>
The hummingbird with a 2mm caliber machinegun hovered in the air as it silently stopped in front of the window. The thumb-sized wide field camera reflected two alerted but clueless faces.</br>
</br>
Tatata</br>
</br>
An abrupt sound.</br>
</br>
Followed by the glass shattering and splashes of blood, the Grim Reaper silently arrived.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The army is the foundation of a stable regime.</br>
</br>
To overthrow a regime, destroying its military was enough.</br>
</br>
The mission with the codename "Shattering sword" promised to shatter the sword of the unwise ruler with flame and steel.</br>
</br>
Three signal flares ignited and broke the quietness of the cold, silent night.</br>
</br>
Tatata!</br>
</br>
Bullets began to fly into the barrack; the orange tail light laminated the entire camp.</br>
</br>
Future Security’s mercenaries launched an unexpected attack.</br>
</br>
Pannu Island’s government was still immersed in their victory from yesterday. Although they remained alert, they were still caught off guard.</br>
</br>
"The barrack is being attacked, I repeat, the barrack is being attacked." The general roared into the radio as he leaned against the thick concrete post, ordering the soldiers patrolling in the city to return and defend.</br>
</br>
An armored vehicle dashed out from the garage as the machinegun on the top spit out intense fire. It unleashed its power in the darkness outside of the camp.</br>
</br>
"Dammit! Who are these people? They are definitely not the rioters!" A soldier leaned behind the armored vehicle as he anxiously clipped on his helmet and fired into the darkness.</br>
</br>
</br>
Tatata.</br>
</br>
A few bullets scathed by his head as he immediately ducked down.</br>
</br>
"It’s drones! Dammit… we have to shoot those down!" A government soldier holding a light machinegun fired at the shadows hovering above.</br>
</br>
"Too small, can’t hit them!’</br>
</br>
"Dumba*s, just cover fire!"</br>
</br>
The dense bullets hindered the attack from the drones as it forced the drones to retreat temporarily, but just as they thought they were at an advantage, the Future Security ground force began to attack.</br>
</br>
"Three o’clock direction."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The eight-person team almost covered every functionality. There were markers, snipers, infantry who took care of the cover fire, and support soldiers who maintained fire suppression. The team currently had no use for medics… even if a stray bullet accidentally hit them, the outdated bullet would not be able to pierce through the polyethylene board on the kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
With the piercing power of the Reaper assault rifle, the concrete barrack was like tofu, non-existent. The bullets could even leave a row of dents on the steel door of the armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
The only trouble that the government force could cause to these mercenaries were the heavy machinegun on the armored vehicle. But against the armored vehicle, the mercenaries were more collected than the rioters.</br>
</br>
A few "Python" rockets flew over as it instantly blew away three armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
Another armored vehicle realized the dire situation; it released a smoke grenade as it immediately backed away. But a rocket flew in its direction as if it had an eye and penetrated its armor without any doubt.</br>
</br>
Flames erupted, and smoke filled the air as the armored vehicle scattered everywhere and hit a few government soldiers who were taking cover.</br>
</br>
The general watched the flames as his eyes began to pop out. He tightly clenched onto the radio as he forgot how to speak.</br>
</br>
A soldier ducked behind cover fired back with a heavy machinegun while he shouted.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, their firepower is too strong."</br>
</br>
At the same time, a deafening explosion covered the sound of the bullets.</br>
</br>
An explosion erupted among the field controlled by the attackers.</br>
</br>
As the general saw this, he turned ecstatic as he roared at the almost fallen friendly position.</br>
</br>
"It’s a tank! Our tank! Everyone hold their damn position! The victory will belong to us!"</br>
</br>
Tank, and helicopters. To demonstrate the negligible military power of Pannu Islands, president Edward put all these heavy armors onto the street to patrol.</br>
</br>
In front of the armored force, any infantry was minuscule!</br>
</br>
Only one round of attacks…</br>
</br>
He stared in the direction of the support force with a fierce expression.</br>
</br>
Contrary to the excitement of the general, against the tank, Future Security's mercenaries were calm and collected.</br>
</br>
The HE shell exploded. In fact, it wounded a few mercenaries, but that was it.</br>
</br>
The medics quickly dragged away the wounded soldiers.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a mercenary with a "Python" on his shoulder, in cover among the shadows, opened the laser guide and locked it onto the tank.</br>
</br>
Before the tank could reload the second shell, he pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Smoke erupted, The arm thick anti-armor rocket that was launched left behind a trail of orange light as it flew towards the front armor of the tank.</br>
</br>
In front of the thick armor, the trail of flames seemed frail.</br>
</br>
But the next scene completed shocked the government force.</br>
</br>
The undefeatable god in their heart – "Chief" tank was blown open by the seemly negligible rocket as if its armor was made out of paper.</br>
</br>
The flame went up to the sky as it illuminated their faces of despair.</br>
</br>
The helicopters with rotating machine guns flew towards them, but it soon crashed elegantly, along with it was the last remaining hope of the government force.</br>
</br>
The ten something hummingbird drones swarmed forward at the thin propeller of the helicopter, it was a simple way of attacking, but surprisingly effective.</br>
</br>
Their hope was extinguished entirely, the government force without any morale left finally lifted the white flag as they ditched their weapon and walked out of cover.</br>
</br>
Now, the regime of president Edward has finally ended.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 329: Farewell</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The night was bitter.</br>
</br>
A daunting human shaped-armor walked along the empty street. The moonlight scattered onto the merciless steel as it shined on the white symbols, T-3.</br>
</br>
His steps were slow as he scanned around. It was as if he was taking a stroll.</br>
</br>
Broken houses.</br>
</br>
The closer he approached the "mansion" the more tragic the scene looked. From the bullet marks on the wall and its density, it seemed to be from the cover fire of the machine guns. From the signs of explosions amongst the street, It looked like it was from grenade launchers.</br>
</br>
In the shambles, Jiang Chen saw a pair of eyes.</br>
</br>
Like a startled animal, the eyes escaped him when he turned around slightly.</br>
</br>
His throat moved before looking away.</br>
</br>
"I can do the "cleaning". Ayesha’s voice came into his ears.</br>
</br>
"No… I think I should go personally."</br>
</br>
Although he couldn’t see Ayesha’s face, Jiang Chen could still imagine her gentle gaze.</br>
</br>
In the civilian building not far away, the bullets almost penetrated the entire wooden back wall. A hand appeared in front of him, shaking, before quietly shutting the wooden window.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could feel that they feared him.</br>
</br>
"Are you feeling okay?" Ayesha gently asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course. I have seen plenty of things more horrifying than bodies," Jiang Chen looked away from the civilian buildings in ruins as he said casually.</br>
</br>
Ayesha knew he was talking about the other world.</br>
</br>
"But I feel you are not really okay."</br>
</br>
"Why do you say that?" Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
He was getting closer and closer to Johnny’s mansion. He pulled out the tactical rifle from his waist.</br>
</br>
Although it certainly felt like killing a chicken with a machete, he still wanted to personally say goodbye to Johnny. As to the reason… he couldn’t explain.</br>
</br>
"Instincts." The cold voice carried a trace of tenderness.</br>
</br>
Instincts?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, he didn’t comment on Ayesha’s explanation.</br>
</br>
Ka-</br>
</br>
The crisp sound of the magazine being clipped on.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Do you think… I am in the wrong here?"</br>
</br>
It was supposed to be quiet here, everything started because of him. If it was not for his out-of-the-blue idea of asking Robert to send Johnny here, and then supporting an opposition to start a civil war, the people living here may never have had to experience war in their lifetime.</br>
</br>
It was a question he recently started to realize. The change in dimension may only take half a second, but the change in one's thinking process would take a long time. Sometimes he questioned himself if he had used the logic of the apocalypse in the modern world.</br>
</br>
This way indeed matched his interest, but was it correct?</br>
</br>
"In my heart, you are always correct."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused.</br>
</br>
A moment later, an open-minded laugh echoed inside the steel armor.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
After he hung up the communication channel, fury instantly activated as a series of dense red dots appeared in his field of vision.</br>
</br>
All the trouble and hindrance of human nature were thrown into the back of his head, Jiang Chen felt his head was never so clear.</br>
</br>
The clarity was known as slaughter.</br>
</br>
Ding-!</br>
</br>
The armor vibrated faintly as a bullet hit the plastic steel, it didn’t leave a single trace. Jiang Chen looked forward with a grim smile, it was a black man aiming with his automatic rifle in hand. It should be the mercenaries that Johnny hired.</br>
</br>
The black guy saw his shot was ineffective. While he was shocked, his actions didn't stop as he launched a grenade.</br>
</br>
With the cool steel in front of him, he instinctively felt fear.</br>
</br>
The turbine engine in the back spit out flames as Jiang Chen casually separated himself from the grenade.</br>
</br>
The machine gun on the roof was pointed in Jiang Chen's direction. However, after he fired a few shots in that direction, the people along with the gun was shredded into pieces. Then Jiang Chen turned his gun and aimed at the red dots hidden behind the wall and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
The bullet ripped apart the weak wall and shredded the hearts hidden behind it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kicked opened the steel door of the mansion as he immersed himself in the rain of bullets without avoiding anything, Jiang Chen walked forward in big steps and started to fire back with the rifle.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries hired by Johnny fell down one by one. Seeing that they could not harm the "monster" in any way, the remaining mercenaries all began to feel fear.</br>
</br>
Then, an RPG with a trial of flame flew towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Without thinking, Jiang Chen slapped the RPG with his left hand.</br>
</br>
Explosion, flame.</br>
</br>
The shattered shell made screeching noises on the plastic steel, but it didn’t damage it at the slightest.</br>
</br>
"Explosive shell? Try the armor piercing next time, suckers." Jiang Chen grimly smiled as he shot the person with the launcher onto the ground.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries were terrified.</br>
</br>
The truth had proved that in front of an undefeatable enemy, the professionalism people held was just bullsh*t. The remaining red dots began to retreat. They abandoned the person that hired them and fleed in three directions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the mercenaries that lost the will to fight as he smashed open the door to the mansion and walked inside with the rifle on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
The trip mine at the door flew up.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen in Fury laughed contemptuously as he didn’t even bother to dodge. He passed through the exploding smoke and walked towards the basement.</br>
</br>
There were five red dots inside, instincts told him Johnny was there.</br>
</br>
Fury deactivated.</br>
</br>
He took out the laser sword and melted the lock, Jiang Chen kicked open the door.</br>
</br>
A pungent alcohol smell blew in his face. With eyebrows furrowed, Jiang Chen started the air filtration system and walked downstairs.</br>
</br>
The light was on.</br>
</br>
The dark red room was filled with a cage, pole, wooden horse… as well as all kinds of sick-minded devices. Jiang Chen didn’t look at the four naked bodies and stared at the man on the wooden chair.</br>
</br>
"Wine… You certainly know how to enjoy life."</br>
</br>
Pale eyes looked at Jiang Chen as Johnny’s throat moved.</br>
</br>
"Are you here to kill me?"</br>
</br>
"That’s right."</br>
</br>
"Where did the mercenaries upstairs go?" His voice had a hint of pleading, but he was unwilling to accept reality.</br>
</br>
"Either dead, or they ran away."</br>
</br>
Johnny’s eyes popped as he grabbed the pistol on the table and aimed it at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
His hand trembled. Especially when he saw that Jiang Chen didn’t react to his action, his trembling became more noticeable.</br>
</br>
"I beg you, please give me a chance…"</br>
</br>
"I did, but you didn’t value it."</br>
</br>
Johnny first paused, before he started laughing hysterically.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, if I listened to Robert and gave up everything, would you let me arrive in Australia alive? Bullsh*t!" As he laughed, Johnny waved the pistol in his hand and pointed at Jiang Chen who was inside the steel armor.</br>
</br>
Just like a child waving a toothpick at an adult.</br>
</br>
"No… If I answer it like this, it will make you feel better when you die."</br>
</br>
Johnny temporarily held a pleading look on his face before it changed into hysteria.</br>
</br>
"Then let's die together!"</br>
</br>
Johnny shouted, pressing the trigger in his hand.</br>
</br>
It was not a pistol, but a detonator in the shape of a gun used to control the 15 kilograms of explosives underneath the basement.</br>
</br>
Sparks flashed, but nothing happened.</br>
</br>
His face began to show his despair.</br>
</br>
"Wh…Why."</br>
</br>
"Even if I explain to you what an EMP is, you probably wouldn’t understand… Whatever, farewell."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed the gun at his head and pressed the trigger.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The past three days were incredibly abnormal for the people living on Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
They previously thought the government force would be overthrown by an anti-government force, but the anti-government force suffered unimaginable losses. Just as they were about to give up hope on the anti-government force, the mercenaries they hired made the government force surrender with a white flag.</br>
</br>
The dramatic turn of events made people unable to comprehend what just happened.</br>
</br>
But regardless, the revolution was finally successful.</br>
</br>
After the barrack was captured, people finally recollected their confidence for victory. The insurgents yet to die in the civil war reunited under the new flag and retrieved the equipment from the armory and captured the presidential palace.</br>
</br>
They dragged president Edward that had yet to wake up from his bed and shoved him into prison. An insurgent climbed onto the top of the presidential palace and axed down the original flag and replaced with the new flag; nine star and two palm leaves.</br>
</br>
The nine stars represented the nine islands of Pannu Islands, palm leaves represented victory.</br>
</br>
At the same time, with the march of the insurgents, Zhang Yapin elected as the head of the Liberal Party became the new leader in the presidential palace. He read the new declaration in front of the foreign reporters.</br>
</br>
The old regime was banished. The Pannu Islands regime was changed from a presidential dictatorship to a presidential republic. At the same time, the country changed to federalism. The country's new name was New United Pannu, or in short, Xin.</br>
</br>
The first president was Zhang Yapin with a term of five years. A general election will be held five years later. The parliament was compromised off nine members elected from each of the nine islands' own jurisdiction.</br>
</br>
Other than some small amendment in the constitution to the president's power, all laws were succeeded by the previous political regime.</br>
</br>
A federal body consisting of only nine Islands were comical in the eyes of media. A lot of the western media were debating if this news should be placed in international news or entertainment.</br>
</br>
Immediately, the BBC reporter asked if the country was named in Han. Zhang Yapin explained that people with Han heritage comprised of 36% of the island's population, Han was listed as an official language along with English and Dutch. It was a decision based on culture, so there was no need to interpret it further.</br>
</br>
Another reporter asked a really sharp question. "President Edward used the military to establish a dictatorship, what would prevent you from going on the same path as him."</br>
</br>
As to that question, although Zhang Yapin felt bitter, his expression didn't reveal anything. He calmly announced a term that astonished all the reporters – "Defensive contract."</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands' national defense will be solely contracted to Celestial Trade Corporation. Celestial has the right to hire mercenaries within or outside of the border of Pannu as its defensive force. Pannu Islands will be directly responsible for the constitution with no need to follow the order of the president. The contract fee would be paid in the form of customs tax and land rental cost.</br>
</br>
</br>
When they heard Zhang Yapin's explanation, the same thought flashed across all of the reporters' minds.</br>
</br>
This is insane.</br>
</br>
In this case, it practically meant the military of the country was handed over to private ownership, the military would operate similarly to a corporation.</br>
</br>
Would this military have any combat ability? Would this military be able to protect national security? Would this kind of company be safe in the first place?</br>
</br>
But after they thought it through, this kind of thing was not without precedence.</br>
</br>
The current UA force was an army that was most reliant on private corporations. Over 60% of the defense budget was paid to defense contractors. The current UA soldiers would complete the most basic duties as a soldier while the rest were contracted out. From weapon development, manufacturing, to the logistics behind supplies, private contractors existed everywhere.</br>
</br>
The force would be government-owned while private corporations contracted for the work. Not only would it save a significant amount in terms of cost, but it would also throw the burden of any casualties to the company.</br>
</br>
Since there was a precedence, this measure could certainly be applicable.</br>
</br>
But it was the first time these reporters had heard of contracting the entire "national defense" to a private corporation.</br>
</br>
They had to say, regarding being lazy, the sesame sized small country was at the frontier of the world.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the small country with less than twenty thousand people made to the front page of international news several times. At the same time, Celestial Trade also got on the pages of a reputable news agency.</br>
</br>
To the company that the public never heard of, all kinds of irresponsible claims began to appear.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Someone said that oil may be underneath Pannu Islands and the Celestial Trade Corporation was a subsidiary of an oil giant, so the capital may be from the UA. Someone also guessed it may be the work of HUA as they plan to intervene in international affairs…</br>
</br>
Of course, no one imagined the connection between Celestial and Future International since the two were completely unrelated. Before the boat left from West Africa, Jiang Chen closed Future Security in Niger and moved the equipment and the remaining individuals onto two vessels. As to the basic infrastructure, it was sold to the Niger government at cost.</br>
</br>
The two vessels would set sail through Cape of Good Hope and take the far route to Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
On the other side, after the insurgents had shoved president Edward along with his family into the prison, they furiously marched towards Johnny's mansion.</br>
</br>
They were much more careful this time after they learned from the tragic experience of attacking Johnny's mansion previously. They brought the only armored vehicle that remained from the civil war. With the cover of the armored vehicle, they were much more confident.</br>
</br>
But when they arrived at the mansion, they found out someone already visited.</br>
</br>
The metal gate outside looked like a car smashed into it as it lied on the grass field a few meters away. The wall looked as if large caliber bullets sprayed through it as a few parts were broken into sections. Especially the machine gun position hidden behind sandbags, the sand from the bags had all spilled out. A lot of walls were shattered into pieces. They didn't know what weapon was so powerful.</br>
</br>
The bodies in the mansion were yet to be cleaned, all the fatalities had their heart pierced by a bullet. The killer's shooting was frighteningly accurate, even for the mercenaries that hid behind the wall, the bullet penetrated through the wall before it hit their heart.</br>
</br>
In the end, the insurgents found Johnny's body in the basement along with four females he locked up.</br>
</br>
Three of the females were locals, one of them was a wife, and one was in junior high. They were all registered died due to vehicle accidents, but they were actually locked up in the villain's basement.</br>
</br>
The other woman was a reporter from New Zealand and captured when she sneaked into Johnny's mansion undercover for a report. When the news was exposed it cause a huge uproar in New Zealand. However, because Johnny had already died, there was no purpose seeking justice on a corpse, especially since the old regime was already overthrown. The incident was heated for a period before it cooled down.</br>
</br>
In the end, the four victims all received a generous sum of compensation from the Xin government. It was rumored that the money was donated by an anonymous wealthy man as a small compensation to the unfortunate people.</br>
</br>
Of course, these were all after stories.</br>

</br>
The next day.</br>
</br>
The nine-star flag waved above the Pannu Islands and the citizens celebrating the new regime walked onto the streets as if they were celebrating New Year or Christmas. The cheered on the new birth of the country.</br>
</br>
Noontime.</br>
</br>
In the cafeteria of the presidential palace, Jiang Chen and Zhang Yapin sat on the two sides of the table.</br>
</br>
Lunch was curry lamb with rice along with an odd coconut smell. It certainly tasted like south Asia. In front of Zhang Yapin was a piece of steak along with coconut juice. With the shift in the regime, only the chef was the most indifferent in the entire presidential palace.</br>
</br>
"UA extended their welcome to us wishing us to join forces with them. They indicated that if we continue to extend the pro-UA policy like the previous regime and announce declaration that favors their political view internationally, they would increase their funding to support us," Zhang Yapin spoke about the country's affairs while working hard to cut the steak.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't even raise his head as he said without hesitation. "Reject."</br>
</br>
"But… That is ten million USD," Zhang Yapin seemed to be unwilling to give up the money as he said with difficulty.</br>
</br>
It was ten million USD. If it were split among the citizens, it would be 500 each. They only needed to speak a few sentences in front of the media, and no one listened to them anyways. This place was just a tiny country, the entire islands combined together was not even bigger than a province in Australia.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his head as he rolled his eyes at Zhang Yapin. "Someone hires you to curse at your mother, why would you agree?"</br>
</br>
There was no need to think. They wanted to drag a bunch of Southeast Asia countries to curse about the Han threat theory. Pannu Islands was located on the southeast side of Country F, they could be stretched to a surrounding country of hua.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin fiercely shook his head, but he added one sentence in his mind, [That depends on how much…]</br>
</br>
"It's only ten million USD, my Future International has an income of two hundred to three hundred million USD per month, I'll loan you the money if you need it," Jiang Chen put a spoonful of the rice in his mouth while saying this slowly.</br>
</br>
"Just pay me back with the land."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, could I interpret this as showing off?" Zhang Yapin smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands just recently introduced a tax cut measure to stimulate economic recovery, but there were still significant holes in funding. The mess created by Edward now had to be cleaned up by the successor.</br>
</br>
"I am only giving you some confidence. I chose Pannu Islands because I believe in its future prospects," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Johnny Group declared bankruptcy. The ten billion dollar project is now down the drain. What prospect is there?" Zhang Yapin's expression was bitter.</br>
</br>
</br>
He initiated the uprising because of the passion in his blood, but now that he has become the president, he began to feel the difficulties of managing a country.</br>
</br>
"No, I am going to take over that project."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin looked at Jiang Chen in shock.</br>
</br>
"Ten billion USD, do you have that kind of money?"</br>
</br>
"I believe a lot of banks are willing to lend to Future International," Jiang Chen said confidently.</br>
</br>
That was true. Even when they were in Hua, a lot of banks went to Xia Shiyu, begging her to take a loan from them. The current liquid cash of Future International is 1.5 billion which was the earning of five months. Although ten billion was rather daunting, with Future International's equity as collateral, it would be easy to obtain.</br>
</br>
Especially since he didn't even need to borrow the full ten billion.</br>
</br>
"You are really willing to … borrow ten billion for a small island country?" Zhang Yapin looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I believe this will generate more than one hundred billion in return."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin held his breath.</br>
</br>
He could not imagine how the country with less than one hundred million USD GDP and a population of fewer than twenty thousand people would generate more than one hundred billion in value.</br>
</br>
"Excuse me for being honest, but it is hard for me to imagine… Although the Pannu Islands have a vast sea territory, it doesn't have oil. Could you point it out to me? Even if it is just painting a picture for me." Zhang Yapin smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"How should I say this? Hmm… Okay. First, Pannu Islands is near the equator."</br>
</br>
"Near the equator?" Zhang Yapin's eyes widened, "Do you mean tourism? Even with tourism, it is still hard to generate ten billion return in ten years right?'</br>
</br>
"It is hard to explain to you. All in all, just remember what I said." Jiang Chen put down the fork in his hand as he slowly got up.</br>
</br>
There were plenty of advantages of being near the equator, it was not as simple as tourism. With space elevator for example, to non-equator countries, it was something they couldn't even think about. To the technology that appeared in 2150, Jiang Chen had the confidence of bringing them into the modern world.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to go?" Zhang Yapin also put down his fork as he looked at Jiang Chen leaving the table.</br>
</br>
"I have something to take care of and I am also full."</br>
</br>
"Also, if other countries –"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped, turned back, and smiled. "Maintain neutrality and friendliness. You know what I mean."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin helplessly let out a sigh. "I know."</br>
</br>
"Do a good job and maintain your current diligent image. Once your term ends, I will give you a retirement fund."</br>
</br>
"I don't need your retirement fund, I just want you to keep your promise and lead this country to prosperity."</br>
</br>
When he heard this, Jiang Chen looked at Zhang Yapin in surprise.</br>
</br>
There was not a lot of people that could refuse money in this era.</br>
</br>
After a moment of pause, Jiang Chen said lightly, "Of course, I promise."</br>
</br>
If everything proceeds smoothly, in less than five years, this would become an island that the world desired to be.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Under the shade of the trees outside the presidential palace, a blue Lamborghini was waiting and Ayesha was sitting in the driver's seat. A grey sports bra drew out her beautiful curvatures and a pair of shades was clipped on the collar. The view was certainly a beauty with a nice car as it made the passersby turn their heads.</br>
</br>
This Lamborghini was previously Johnny's, but now it belonged to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Although he died, he could not escape this crime. The court prosecuted Johnny with 17 charges and confiscated all personal assets to the country's treasury. The cars he had on Pannu Islands, the mansion, as well as two boats were all auctioned off in Australia. There, Jiang Chen took it all over as his own possession, needing only to bid twice.</br>
</br>
Since it belonged to the deceased, there may be some misfortunes attached to the things of the people who died of an unnatural cause. On top of that, the rich mostly feared death, but Jiang Chen didn't mind as he was an absolute materialist.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pulled open the door as he sat in the passenger seat.</br>
</br>
Ayesha put the shades over her eyes and put her hands on the steering wheel while turning to look at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going?"</br>
</br>
"Linhua Group's construction site."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded as she started the car.</br>
</br>
Leaning on the comfortable chair, Jiang Chen looked at the scenery flying by as he tried his best to snap the beauty in his mind.</br>
</br>
It was an indiscernible feeling. Before he had to work for his next meal but now he has become the hidden owner of a series of islands. This was his kingdom. No deceit or trickery would work against him here. No one would be able to plot against his company.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he was bored, but he turned and looked back into the car at Ayesha concentrating on driving.</br>
</br>
The shades and sports bra was a beautiful set. Any style of clothing seemed to look great on her.</br>
</br>
Ayesha sensed Jiang Chen's gaze as she began blushing with her lips carved up.</br>
</br>
She enjoyed his gaze.</br>
</br>
Although they were yet to be married, she considered herself the wife of her husband. As a traditional wife, in her perspective, the husband was everything…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 332: The Disastrous Loss of Linhua Group</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xin was formed.</br>
</br>
As to who suffered the most economically, it would be the Linhua Group working on the construction site.</br>
</br>
The collapse of the old regime and the bankruptcy of Johnny International made Linhua Group's ten billion USD contract turn into a piece of scrap paper.</br>
</br>
As to the two gold mines used by Johnny International as collateral, it was the typical trick, the old fox, Robert used. He first managed to find two abandoned mines and then hired geologists to reevaluate the gold reserve of the mines and fake a report. Then he took the gold Jiang Chen provided to create a production report in South Africa, completed the tax procedure, and produced a beautiful four quarters production report.</br>
</br>
Immediately after, under Robert's directions of readjusting the business' focus, the two goldmines stopped operating. By using manipulation and forgery, the two goldmines were valued at 10.3 billion USD and completed the asset collateral verification.</br>
</br>
Asset collateral verification was easy to fake since it was not an asset sale process. Therefore, the auditing team would usually not conduct an onsite audit. Robert even told Jiang Chen that even without the gold, he could still borrow gold from other mines to complete the asset verification process. A lot of mines were willing to do this because it meant that someone was willing to take on part of the tax burden for them.</br>
</br>
Compared to the international capitals who fought through fierce market competition, Linhua Group, growing out of policies, was just a naïve baby still learning how to talk; they were no match against Robert who even dared to trick the FBA. Linhua Group's project team did carefully examine the fifty paged asset verification report, but they didn't think that the asset behind the iron seal of the South African government was fake.</br>
</br>
Now that Johnny International was bankrupt, the two goldmines were given to Linhua Group as collateral. But when Wang Linhua wanted to sell it off for cash, he realized that the two mines were all abandoned mines.</br>
</br>
Johnny International forged the gold reserve. The asset audit report was inaccurate.</br>
</br>
As if a rumble of thunder had struck his head, Wang Linhua immediately became unconscious after he acquired the news and was sent to the emergency room by ambulance.</br>
</br>
Insurmountable loss.</br>
</br>
These were the only words that could describe the loss suffered by Linhua Group, or the Wang family. On the ten billion overseas project, Linhua Group had currently invested 2.5 billion USD. However, Johnny International had gone bankrupt the day before the first phase of the project contract was due for payment.</br>
</br>
A loss of 2.5 billion USD in the first quarter, this financial report would blind the Linhua board.</br>
</br>
And not long ago, Wang Linhua increased his holding of Linhua Group through the secondary market.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the west coast of Coro Island was the most beautiful scenery of all the islands.</br>
</br>
The deep blue shallow waters reflected a stunning light under the bright sunshine, just like the goddess of the sea's veil. The coral reefs hid among the sea waves as it divided the magnificent undersea world into an array of pictures.</br>
</br>
The islands covered in vegetation scattered between Coro Island and Garlin Island, connected by deep or shallow sand beaches and formed a natural but sophisticated maze.</br>
</br>
A car drove on the highway along the east coast. Jiang Chen rolled down the window as he gazed at the beautiful scenery from afar. He exclaimed,</br>
</br>
"This is too beautiful."</br>
</br>
"Do you want me to slow down?" Ayesha asked gently.</br>
</br>
"No need, we should go faster," Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes as he stared at the seagulls at the end of the sky, "I need to get rid of the annoying people from my island."</br>
</br>
With a grin on her face, Ayesha changed gears, "Sit tight."</br>
</br>
The engine roared.</br>
</br>
The car accelerated to a speed of 160 kilometers per hour as it turned into a blue shadow racing to its destination.</br>
</br>
The speed may have been dangerous for ordinary people, but for Ayesha with the genetic vaccine, it was not a problem at all.</br>
</br>
Moments later, they arrived at Linhua Group's camp.</br>
</br>
With the car parked on the road, Jiang Chen saw from afar a group of people surrounding Linhua Group's door. Natives with hoes, scythes, and even sugarcanes surrounded Linhua Group's door. Everyone was emotional as they were preparing to enter forcefully.</br>
</br>
Soldiers with rifles maintained the situation. They were all insurgents who participated in the uprising. They were not dissolved after the war as some of them joined the police force.</br>
</br>
He signaled Ayesha to wait for him in the car and walked straight to the gate.</br>
</br>
"What's going on here?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly, stopping beside a policeman.</br>
</br>
The bearded policeman frowned as he was going to tell Jiang Chen to stand aside, but when he saw a pass personally signed by Zhang Yapin in Jiang Chen's hand, he immediately stopped looking annoyed.</br>
</br>
"It has to do with land compensation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately understood.</br>
</br>
The negotiated compensation for two USD per square meters between Johnny International and Linhua Group was too cruel. Now that Johnny International was bankrupted and the old Pannu regime has collapsed, the citizens would not allow such an unfair agreement to exist.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng immediately called the police when he realized the situation was going south. Although the police force was also unhappy with Linhua Group, they still must uphold the law as they sent out a team to stabilize the situation. But the citizens still surrounded the police while they wait for an explanation.</br>
</br>
"Let me go in to check it out."</br>
</br>
The policeman hesitated before he moved and allowed Jiang Chen to go in.</br>
</br>
Inside the camp was an array of trailers. The expensive equipment was all locked inside the warehouse by the workers to prevent the rioters from robbing or destroying it. As to the workers, they wore their hardhead and wielded sticks, preparing to fight.</br>
</br>
If there were a conflict between the natives, the outsiders would always be at a disadvantage. Although they had "armed" themselves, everyone prayed that a conflict would not occur. In a riot, if they were killed by the rioter, it might even be difficult to seek justice.</br>
</br>
When they saw someone walk over, they first felt tense, but when they saw it was a fellow countryman, they felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Although there were quite some Han on the island, for them who traveled often, it was easy to distinguish who was home-born and who was not.</br>
</br>
A tanned worker greeted Jiang Chen and asked, "How is the situation outside?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the anxious expression on his face as he comforted him, "Don't worry, the Xin president is already working to resolve the problem."</br>
</br>
The worker felt relieved as he wiped the sweat from his forehead and smiled at Jiang Chen, exposing his teeth. "Are you from the embassy?"</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands were too small to have an embassy.</br>
</br>
"No, but I am here to arrange your travel home."</br>
</br>
When he heard he could go home, a look of joy appeared on the worker's face.</br>
</br>
"Great, haha. Buddy, we all want to go home. The construction keeps getting delayed without any progress. The situation outside is becoming more and more dangerous. A month ago we could still go buy some fruits on the street, now we are afraid to even leave the camp."</br>
</br>
"Sigh, it's been tough for you."</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen disdained the Wang family's greediness, he didn't mind the regular workers. Or rather, it was a pleasant feeling to see his fellow countrymen in a different part of the world.</br>
</br>
It was his fellow countrymen after all. Jiang Chen wouldn't sit around if his people encountered danger.</br>
</br>
"It's okay." The tanned worker shook his hand. "Are you here to see Manager Wang? Do you need me to take you there?"</br>
</br>
"No need, just tell me the location."</br>
</br>
The worker didn't insist as he pointed at the concrete building at the back of the construction site.</br>
</br>
"His office is on the second floor at the end of the hall."</br>
</br>
After he said goodbye, Jiang Chen walked toward Wang Tianfeng's office.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 333: I enjoy the fact you don't like me, but you can't do anything about it</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The door was knocked.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng, who was sitting at the table while on the phone, frowned. After he spoke a few more sentences to his sister regarding taking care of his father, he cleared his throat.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open. The person who came in almost made Wang Tianfeng’s eyes pop out.</br>
</br>
"Jiang, Jiang Chen?!"</br>
</br>
"That’s right. You recognize me?" Jiang Chen casually sat on the sofa in the office as he smiled at Wang Tianfeng.</br>
</br>
He heard Wang Tianfeng was Wang Linhua’s son; they indeed resembled each other.</br>
</br>
Arrogance was apparent in his eyes.</br>
</br>
He didn’t understand why Jiang Chen would appear in this place. Future Technology had business here? The natives barely even used smartphones here.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I'm asking you guys to leave the place." Jiang Chen looked at Wang Tianfeng with a grin.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng thought he heard wrong.</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"Asking you guys to leave this place," Jiang Chen repeated. At the same time, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket and folded it into a paper airplane before he flew it onto Wang Tianfeng’s table.</br>
</br>
He was displeased with Jiang Chen’s attitude. Wang Tianfeng’s eyes scanned between Jiang Chen and the paper airplane before he, while suppressing his anger, opened the paper. As he studied the black letters on the white sheet, his chest pumped full of rage and his breath quickened.</br>
</br>
"That’s impossible! We already invested 2.5 billion on this project; the Xin government is bullsh*ting! They can’t just get rid of us like that! I'm going to find President Zhang right now."</br>
</br>
Although the notice was written in a reserved fashion, the decision was firm: All actions of Johnny International on Pannu Islands were illegal, and the previous land transfer agreement signed with the previous government wasn't recognized.</br>
</br>
As he spoke, Wang Tianfeng got up from his chair and headed for the door, but he froze mid-step.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered that the camp was surrounded by natives.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen crossed his legs as he reminded him casually, "I recommend you don’t go outside now; the people in front of the gate want you dead."</br>
</br>
A cold sweat rolled down his forehead as Wang Tianfeng thought of Johnny who suffered a tragic death in the basement. He remembered the partnership between Johnny International and Linhua Group. The rioters may potentially view him as an accomplice to Johnny even if he didn’t do anything illegal.</br>
</br>
He walked stiffly back to the desk as he looked at Jiang Chen again.</br>
</br>
"Why would you appear here?"</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng’s eyes flashed; he seemed to sense that this had something to do with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t hide anything as he said straightforwardly, "Because Future International is the successor of the project and the Xin government is pleased with our compensation plan."</br>
</br>
</br>
Successor?</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng was stunned.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible!? When did you get into real estate as a tech company?"</br>
</br>
"Web + Tourism? You could interpret it this way. Who said we would build houses by ourselves? We can contract the work. You don’t have to look at me like that; there's no way I'd contract it to you. You better get out of my sight as soon as possible so I can get on with my work term," Jiang Chen said pleasantly.</br>
</br>
"You!"</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng looked at Jiang Chen’s grin as his face turned pale white from anger. His finger pointing at Jiang Chen trembled uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
Everyone knew the first phase was the most difficult to execute, and it was also the phase with the highest cost. Linhua Group invested 2.5 billion in the first phase as they gathered the most advanced equipment and most professional workers to ensure that a solid foundation was established for the future. It wasn't just any poorly-built project they'd normally do domestically - it was Linhua Group’s first international client. It would act as a business card and a case Linhua Group could use to discuss potential partnerships with other international clients.</br>
</br>
Once they received the project from overseas, their sales team could proudly point at the Pannu Islands on the map and bring out diagrams of the completed construction to demonstrate their abilities and achievements to clients. The ten billion deal wasn't only significant in the amount of profit it would bring, but it was also a stepping stone to enter global competition.</br>
</br>
Linhua Group couldn't afford to lose this project.</br>
</br>
Therefore, a pleading look surfaced on his face.</br>
</br>
"We have worked on this project for over two months and invested over 2.5 billion USD on the project. You can’t just make us leave; no one is more familiar with the project than us. We can forfeit the fee for the first phase, so at least give the next three phases to us?"</br>
</br>
The humiliation made Wang Tianfeng want to kill himself.</br>
</br>
As the heir of a ten billion dollar real estate company, he was forced to lower his head to a dog the Wang family supported before. His arrogance was tested to the point where it was about to shatter.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, even up until now, he still didn’t recognize the reality of the situation.</br>
</br>
"I reject." Jiang Chen smiled. " On another note, you have reparations to pay on the basis that you illegally occupied the land. Therefore, you have to pay a fine. Of course, it's not a large fine - only ten million USD. I trust that with your company’s financial capabilities, this amount is nothing to you."</br>
</br>
"Illegally occupying the land? That’s impossible! We have an agreement-" Wang Tianfeng’s eyes were bloodshot.</br>
</br>
"Any agreement with the previous regime is now void."</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng’s body trembled as he stared at Jiang Chen with a pale face.</br>
</br>
"You knew about the coup from the start, right?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. I happen to… have some connection with the boss of the Celestial Trade company." While the fact that he owned Celestial Trade Company was yet to be disclosed, even if people found out, it would only be a small number of people. This trading company had a total of three warehouses as its assets as of three months ago and it was registered in Pannu islands, but its operations were outsourced to New Zealand since it operated completely as an offshore company.</br>
</br>
"Why didn’t you tell us! Did you forget the favors the Wang family gave you?" Wang Tianfeng already lost all rationality as he roared.</br>
</br>
"Why do I have to tell you? How did you help me?" Jiang Chen shrugged as he put on an innocent face.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng froze.</br>
</br>
"Since you are the successor of Linhua Group, you must know what your dad told me that night." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
When he heard that, Wang Tianfeng’s throat moved. He wanted to argue, but nothing came out.</br>
</br>
"I didn’t plan to leave. But since I brought out Future 1.0, you couldn’t sit around any longer and wanted to pick the fruit? How shameless. Please allow me to use this word to describe your father and your uncle."</br>
</br>
When he heard this, the enraged Wang Tianfeng calmed down.</br>
</br>
The expression on his face turned menacing.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you afraid that something unfortunate could happen to your family? I know your family is still in the country." Wang Tianfeng stared straight at Jiang Chen as he threatened him.</br>
</br>
"Of course not. They're currently traveling in Xiangjiang and will immigrate to Pannu Islands in a few days. Despite how powerful the Wang family is, could you capture foreign citizens in a different jurisdiction?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"You!" Wang Tianfeng had his eyes wide open.</br>
</br>
"That’s right. They became Xin citizens and automatically forfeited their ol.d citizenship." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
It wasn't the best choice, but it was the safest option, and he didn’t want these problematic things to bother him anymore.</br>
</br>
Although the government wouldn't do something as despicable as taking someone hostage, some despicable people may think otherwise.</br>
</br>
It took a bit of effort to convince his parents to immigrate, but he was finally successful. The two elders did long to see the outside world. Since they spent half their lives at the small factory and didn’t even leave the province that many times, and now that their son was accomplished, they were more than happy to venture out to see the outside world.</br>
</br>
Since they were getting old, they had more concerns. Therefore, they were a bit hesitant about leaving the country, partly because they didn’t want to cause trouble for their son and partly because they didn’t want to leave their old house. But Jiang Chen promised them that if they missed home, they could go back anytime.</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng’s lips shivered as he couldn’t think of any way to threaten Jiang Chen. Just as Jiang Chen said, while the Wang family was powerful domestically, they didn’t have the same reach overseas.</br>
</br>
Seeing as Wang Tianfeng had nothing else to say, Jiang Chen laughed and stood up.</br>
</br>
"You better leave the island in three days or the security force may forcefully remove you from the island. By the way, everything is within the boundaries of the law."</br>
</br>
"You…"</br>
</br>
Wang Tianfeng’s fists clenched as he wanted to beat him up. But he managed to restrain himself since he wasn't home and if he caused trouble, his uncle wasn't here to solve things for him.</br>
</br>
He should be glad he managed to restrain himself because if he did swing his fist at Jiang Chen, the outcome would be quite different than he imagined.</br>
</br>
"I enjoy the fact that you don’t like me but can’t do anything to me." Seeing that he didn’t take a swing, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fixed his collar before opening the office door and walking outside.</br>
</br>
"Seeing that you allowed me to vent my frustrations, I'll arrange vehicles to transport you safely to the airport along with your workers. Also, some words for your father: It is never too late to seek revenge, although it has only been a few months.</br>
</br>
Then he turned around as he left Wang Tianfeng, who looked like he just ate sh*t, there without turning his head.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left Linhua Group’s camp, the citizens at the gate had yet to disperse. On the contrary, more people had gathered there.</br>
</br>
The angry natives swung the sugarcane in their hand; it was quite a comical scene.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the workers inside the camp. He thought for a moment before he shouted to the citizens.</br>
</br>
"Quiet! Everyone, quiet down!"</br>
</br>
When they heard Jiang Chen shout, the citizens all looked in his direction.</br>
</br>
"First, I am not from the LInhua Group." When he saw the unfriendly gazes, Jiang Chen cleared his throat to clarify.</br>
</br>
When they heard that Jiang Chen wasn't a part of Linhua Group, the citizens all lost interest but before the crowd turned rowdy again, Jiang Chen continued shouting.</br>
</br>
"But, I have already reached an agreement with Linhua Group. This construction site will be taken over by Future International. You may have never heard this name before, but don’t worry. We will negotiate a price with the new president that you can all accept to compensate for your lost land. If you trust your president, please leave now."</br>
</br>
The citizens stared at each other. A muscular, brown-skinned man walked to Jiang Chen and used Han mixed with English to ask Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Is what you said true?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
The person turned around as he debated with the citizens.</br>
</br>
Finally, they seemed to have reached an agreement as the man stood in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"We trust our new president. But…" The man pointed in Linhua Group’s direction, " Before the compensation is finalized, they can’t leave."</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
Seeing the crowd beginning to disperse, the police on duty felt relieved and walked beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, my friend. If it wasn't for you, it'd be hard for us to take care of this."</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry, it's all part of my responsibilities. Especially… since some are innocent."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 334: New Moon Island</br>
</div></br>
</br>
President Edward’s trial was set for the fifth day after the coup had ended.</br>
</br>
On this day, almost all Pannu people stayed home and gathered around the TV to watch the live trial.</br>
</br>
In the end, the supreme court of Pannu Islands sentenced the former president Edward to seventeen crimes including treason. All his assets would be confiscated and he would be executed by the end of the month.</br>
</br>
The result received support from all Xin citizens - the people who suffered under his reign wanted to rip off his skin and tear his tendons out. Of course, Xin was a civilized country so they evidently wouldn't sentence him to a violent death; death by injection was his final fate.</br>
</br>
As to the soldiers that surrendered, considering that they fought as part of their duty, the court didn’t punish them for their actions during the coup. In the end, they were only sentenced to 10 years in prison for accepting bribes.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the previous government force was dissolved.</br>
</br>
Once the political situation stabilized, the small country began to lose attention from international media and returned to a tranquil state isolated from the rest of the world.</br>
</br>
But this was only relative - the small country remained in sight of many capitalists.</br>
</br>
This was because of a ten billion USD project.</br>
</br>
The infrastructure improvement project with its first phase complete restarted the bidding process for all construction companies in the world. The project was estimated to be in the seven billion range.</br>
</br>
The most difficult first phase was completed by Linhua Group "free" of charge, so there were no other difficulties anticipated in completing the remaining three phases. Of course, considering the stability of the current regime and what happened to Linhua Group, the other construction companies all tightened their auditing process.</br>
</br>
But when they heard Future International was the owner of the project, all concerns faded.</br>
</br>
With a tech company with the profitability of over three hundred million USD a month, there was no need to question its ability to pay. Or rather, all construction companies hoped Future International would be unable to pay its debt. They could then use the equity in collateral and force the company to go public on Nasdaq. With a P/E ratio of 20 times, the amount of return would be unimaginable.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didn't lack money to repay the debt.</br>
</br>
All capitals focused their sights on the island isolated from the world. Even if they couldn't win the ten billion USD project, it wasn't a bad choice to share a piece of the pie along with the mega capitals for the development of the island.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The boat’s engine hummed as Jiang Chen let the sea breeze mess his hair as he gazed at the horizon in front of the boat.</br>
</br>
He bought the boat from the auctioning of Johnny’s assets. The captain of the boat was an older fisher named Carter; the warehouse security man, Cassan, recommend him to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
The brown-skinned native spoke equally fluent Han and English. He went to Yangchen in Hua before for business. When his business closed down, he returned home to fish and fished for twenty-something years.</br>
</br>
"How much longer?"</br>
</br>
"Soon." The old fisherman piloting the boat cracked a smile as he accelerated the boat.</br>
</br>
They were cruising the sea at 50 knots; a single wave could send the boat soaring into the air. But the fisherman was undoubtedly a master of his trade - regardless how the waves changed, the boat cut through the waves smoothly and steadily.</br>
</br>
Ayesha anxiously held onto Jiang Chen’s hand while the other hand tightly grasped onto the iron railing. Jiang Chen was more courageous as he didn’t look afraid at all. He stood there facing the wind as he breathed in the fresh air.</br>
</br>
Not long after, an island surfaced in the close horizon.</br>
</br>
"Do you see it?" the old fisherman shouted as he laughed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I see it." Jiang Chen couldn’t wait to take his binoculars out as he looked at his island.</br>
</br>
That’s right, it was his island.</br>
</br>
As the biggest winner of the coup, Celestial Trade Company not only won the contract for national security in which they acquired the rights to form a military on behalf of the Xin government, they also gained the permission to build a military outpost, one hundred square meters big, on the nine islands. On top of all this, the New Moon Island 150 kilometers west of Coro Island was leased to Celestial Trade Company with an indefinite term by the Xin government for the establishment of a military base.</br>
</br>
Just like its name, the island was shaped like a crescent.</br>
</br>
The island was covered in thick, tropical vegetation. The middle part of the island was higher with the two edges flatter. The gulf of the island was somewhat shallow with a bench forming when the tide fell. An aerial view taken at that moment would show the island was shaped like a full moon. When the tide rose, it was more similar to a crescent. Hence the island was also known as Tide Island.</br>
</br>
Because of the small area as well as a lack of fresh water sources, it was uninhabited and not part of the nine Pannu islands. Although it would ruin the beautiful scenery on the island, building a military base here was an excellent choice.</br>
</br>
Once the boat approached the island, Jiang Chen saw the two vessels anchored on the side of the island.</br>
</br>
Because there was no deepwater port, the two vessels could not dock - they could only anchor far away from the island and transport the people and supplies through boats.</br>
</br>
These people were all from the Niger military base. They were mostly Christians from Syria and were incorporated as mercenaries during their escape. Although they were half forced, when they realized that Jiang Chen wouldn't torture them and settled things appropriately with their family, they were gracious for everything Jiang Chen had done. After months of military training, they all settled into their new roles.</br>
</br>
After a period of time, Jiang Chen would recruit new soldiers from Pannu. Based on his plan, in the first phase, the military base would maintain a force of five hundred people. While they prioritized the development of the air force, they would purchase old naval vessels and "modernize" them.</br>
</br>
Of course, the plan must be executed one step at a time. Because they were in a peaceful time and Xin’s foreign relations with neighboring countries was rather normal, they didn’t have the need to expand militarily.</br>
</br>
"Should we head for the shore or head to the vessel?" With the sea wind in his mouth, the old fisherman roared.</br>
</br>
"To the vessel," Jiang Chen commanded.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
The old fisherman dashed to the vessel.</br>
</br>
The kilometers in the distance disappeared instantly.</br>
</br>
After he secured the boat with chains, the people on the vessel lowered the ladder. Jiang Chen and Ayesha were the first to climb up.</br>
</br>
When her feet came in contact with the flat deck, Ayesha felt disoriented and almost fell down. If it weren't for Jiang Chen catching her, she might've fallen into the sea.</br>
</br>
"Are you seasick?" With how drowsy Ayesha looked, the corners of Jiang Chen’s lips curled up.</br>
</br>
Considering how disoriented she looked, it was the first time he saw her like this.</br>
</br>
"A little bit." Ayesha shook her head as she touched her forehead.</br>
</br>
"Why didn’t you tell me earlier?" Jiang Chen said, concerned.</br>
</br>
"Because… You looked really happy while we were out there." A red hue surfaced on her cold face as Ayesha murmured gently. She kept her head buried.</br>
</br>
With how cute she looked, Jiang Chen’s heart skipped a beat and he gulped.</br>
</br>
But then, a light cough came from not far away.</br>
</br>
Ivan’s defined face looked at Jiang Chen full of mockery.</br>
</br>
"Boss, I'm not trying to be a third wheel, but… Everyone is looking." As he spoke, Ivan jokingly pointed.</br>
</br>
The soldiers on the deck blew whistles and cheered at Jiang Chen, and the teasing in their eyes was evident.</br>
</br>
Ayesha hid her blushing face behind Jiang Chen's back. Although she was open and proactive when they were alone, she still wasn't used to acting intimately in front of other people.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
These people dared to laugh at the boss.</br>
</br>
"Get back to work! If I see you all wandering around on the deck, you don’t get to join the BBQ party at night!" Jiang Chen shouted at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
When they heard there was a BBQ party that night, the soldiers all dispersed and got back to their jobs. The people with nothing to do all pretended to be busy since no one would say no to barbeque.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned at Ivan with a grimace.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, boss, I'm just… preventing you from embarrassing yourself in front of your subordinates." Ivan forced a laugh. He felt eerie being stared down by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
That was enough joking around. Jiang Chen put on a stern face.</br>
</br>
"That’s enough joking around; wait for me in the captain room. Bring Barkary along with you."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Ivan saluted and left with the order.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After arranging for Ayesha to rest in an empty room, Jiang Chen headed to the captain’s room.</br>
</br>
When he arrived, Ivan and Barkary were already waiting there.</br>
</br>
Barkary was the man who worked as the manager to Future Security. He was in charge of the logistics. After Future Security shut down, Ivan asked if he was willing to relocate to work on the other side of the planet and Barkary accepted without hesitation. His only request was to bring his wife and children along. It was his dream to leave the impoverished West African region.</br>
</br>
"Are you used to the deepwater here?"</br>
</br>
Barkary smiled humbly, showing his white teeth. He spoke with his broken English, "Yes, just a bit wet."</br>
</br>
"That's normal since this is the sea." Ivan laughed and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Now, let’s get down to business. Ivan must've already told you." Jiang Chen looked at Ivan and stared into Barkary’s eyes.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Barkary nodded.</br>
</br>
Currently, the relationship between Celestial Trade and Future International wasn't disclosed to the public. Before Barkary arrived, he signed a non-disclosure agreement after which he would wear an electronic collar for ten years. The advantage was that his salary would increase from four hundred USD a month to one hundred thousand USD a year, the same amount as Ivan.</br>
</br>
"Then your response is?’</br>
</br>
"I have no reason to reject," Barkary said light-heartedly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as took out the silica gel for the electronic collar and passed it to Barkary. The young black man didn’t hesitate as he put the collar on in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don’t worry too much, this is just for cautionary measures."</br>
</br>
"I understand, but it feels weird to wear this," Barkary said as he touched his neck.</br>
</br>
"You'll get used to it." Ivan patted him on the shoulder. "Buddy, now you’re a part of us."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and looked at Barkary. "Just like before, I'll leave you the logistics of the military base to you, including fresh water, food, and living necessities. As to the firearms and ammo, I have my channel to take care of this. You only need to transport supplies from Coro Island’s warehouses to here."</br>
</br>
"Count on me," Barkary said confidently.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as he looked at Ivan. "You must've heard that Xin’s national defense will be taken care of by Celestial. I plan to build a military base, not for training purposes. Do you have any recommendations?"</br>
</br>
Ivan served in Kane before and was an old Soviet veteran. Even if he wasn't an expert, he must have some perspectives to share.</br>
</br>
"A deepwater port would be a good idea. The area near the island is too shallow, so vessels with a higher displacement can't approach it. Without a deepwater port, both supplies and military mobility would be greatly limited."</br>
</br>
"The deepwater port will definitely be built. What about other areas?" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Bunker, training field, radar station, hanger, runway… Mostly these." Ivan smiled. "The size of this island is pretty good and quite similar to UA's Wake Island. It might even be a bit bigger."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll start the building process for the military base; keep an eye on this for me."</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
"Then that’s all."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Moving took an entire afternoon.</br>
</br>
It was indeed troublesome to move supplies between the island and vessels. Jiang Chen already made up his mind - he would contact people to build the deepwater port once he headed back the next day.</br>
</br>
Although it was tiring to move supplies and build houses, Jiang Chen discovered that everyone’s face was filled with joy and happiness.</br>
</br>
To avoid the flames of war caused by extremists, they had to flee with their families from their homes. Now, they were finally able to settle down on the other side of the world, on a beautiful island, to restart their life.</br>
</br>
Although it was just an inhabited island now, everyone believed great things were to come.</br>
</br>
The passion for building their new home made everyone energetic. It wasn't long before an array of tents were set up in the middle of the island.</br>
</br>
At night, people gathered in the middle of the island and started bonfires around the island. They took out food from the vessel and began the BBQ party.</br>
</br>
Children chased each other in the camp, couples cuddled together, people who enjoyed large crowds sat in the circle. People joked, drank, and ate.</br>
</br>
The aroma of the barbeque spread across the camp - it was just like a picnic.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen soon joined them. A young man from Turkey warmly asked Jiang Chen to try his roasted turkey.</br>
</br>
It was crispy on one side but tender on the other; Jiang Chen almost ate his tongue.</br>
</br>
With the saline and warm wind blowing while they drank cold beer, it was a superb feeling.</br>
</br>
The BBQ party lasted till midnight, after which people cleaned up the garbage on the ground. Although it had only been half a day, they felt an indescribable sense of belonging on the island already.</br>
</br>
How could he explain?</br>
</br>
Compared with Demarcus engulfed in the flames of war, the life here was too pleasant.</br>
</br>
The next morning, people didn’t oversleep due to the celebration the night before, after months of military training made it a routine for them to wake up early.</br>
</br>
Men lined up on the empty ground as they began the day's training with their trainers.</br>
</br>
The children and women also woke up early, because they wanted to see the sunrise.</br>
</br>
Since there was no extra tent on the island, Jiang Chen and Ayesha spent the night on the vessel. It was rather embarrassing in the morning because compared to the hardworking soldiers, it wasn't until noon before Jiang Chen left Ayesha’s body in bed.</br>
</br>
After washing up, the two didn’t return to the island and remained on the boat.</br>
</br>
Because he still needed to take care of the military base, he needed to return to Coro Island before taking a flight to Australia.</br>
</br>
The older fisherman had woken up long ago. There was a bucket of fresh sea fish on the boat. When he saw Jiang Chen, the older fisherman named Carter was somewhat embarrassed. When he woke up in the morning, seeing that Jiang Chen had yet to get up, he took the boat out and fished.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen only laughed as he didn’t mind him using a small amount of diesel. He also jokingly asked for a few fish and asked how to cook the fish.</br>
</br>
The old fisherman felt relieved when Jiang Chen didn’t seem to mind him using his boat for other purposes. He controlled the boat expertly with the steering wheel while he began to explain the delicacies of eating the fish.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't paying complete attention, but Ayesha listened diligently while she recorded things secretively on her EP. The girl thought Jiang Chen suddenly became interested in eating fish, so she made up her mind to master this cuisine.</br>
</br>
Once this conversation about fish started, the fisherman began to talk about his stories from when he fished. This time, Ayesha was rather disinterested while Jiang Chen was completely drawn in.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that in a life of fishing so many outsiders considered dull, the old fisherman had all kinds of interesting stories to tell.</br>
</br>
In the light and happy atmosphere, 150 kilometers soared by.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 336: Australia Trip</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After he got off the boat at Coro Island, Jiang Chen didn’t stop for a moment.</br>
</br>
He told Carter to drive the boat back to his mansion before he took a plane to Melbourne, Australia.</br>
</br>
It was already two in the afternoon when he checked in at the hotel near the airport.</br>
</br>
Without any food in his body yet, he managed to find a Han restaurant to take care of his lunch before he started his schedule for the day.</br>
</br>
Based on the directions given by his phone map, he quickly arrived at the building of a military company called "Mammoth."</br>
</br>
Robert recommended this company to Jiang Chen since they were one of the internationally-renowned military base construction companies. They built military outposts in Iraq for the UN peacekeeping force before, and they also did business with Robert in the arms deal.</br>
</br>
After he explained his intentions to the gorgeous reception lady at the front desk, the boss of the company personally came down to greet Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The boss of the company was an Australian man with a big beard named Thomas; he had served in the Australian special forces.</br>
</br>
Robert already communicated with him beforehand, so after briefly asking about Jiang Chen’s requirements for the military base, he eagerly brought out ten-something construction plans. The decrease in international conflicts resulted in his company not receiving any projects of this size for a long time. It was apparent why he was so eager.</br>
</br>
After two days of negotiation, the two parties finally settled on a construction plan.</br>
</br>
The total contract was worth four hundred million USD. The construction would include four deepwater docks, a radar station, weather observation equipment, a runway, an artillery base and missile silo; it would be constructed similarly to the layout on Wake Island.</br>
</br>
Of course, because of the restrictions in arms sales, the construction didn’t include a missile launch device or high caliber artillery. Without the permission of the Australian government, Thomas wouldn't have the guts to sell those.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn’t want those things either.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how reliable the missiles were in the 21st century, they wouldn't be stronger than the Disaster-32 Cruise Missile. Regardless of how powerful the artillery was, would it be more decimating than a Type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon? Although he had yet to control the technology for the previous weapon and the latter was only limited to vehicle type, Jiang Chen firmly believeD that with his continual exploration in the apocalypse, these unbelievable technologies would be his one day.</br>
</br>
Thomas also sold Jiang Chen four UH-60 Black Eagle helicopters with a unit price of four million USD. Included in the price tag was the training for eight helicopter pilots.</br>
</br>
With the four Black Eagles, the mobility of the military base on New Moon Island would increase substantially. With the transportation ability of the four helicopters, the soldiers of the Celestial Trade Company could quickly parachute onto any of the nine islands to respond to unexpected situations.</br>
</br>
</br>
Before he upgraded the technology, Black Eagle would be the ideal transition flight vehicle.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
By his third day in Australia, the military base contract had been settled. Mammoth sent professionals to survey New Moon Island. Based on what Thomas said, if all projects were executed smoothly, the base would be completed by July.</br>
</br>
After he finished this task, Jiang Chen didn’t return right away.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen woke up early and headed to the rural area north of Melbourne.</br>
</br>
The Victoria province located at the Southeastern end of Australia was renowned as the "province of the garden." Because it was by the ocean, the climate was warm and wet, so the province possessed the best vegetation and the most fertile grassland in all of Australia. Victoria, therefore, was the biggest producer of dairy products and farm products in the country.</br>
</br>
As the car left the city center, the air became a lot fresher.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped in front of a farm just before he managed to catch the farm owner who just got off his truck.</br>
</br>
"You are?"</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen." Jiang Chen introduced himself.</br>
</br>
The farmer owner with a rather big beer belly wiped the sweat off his face with a towel.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen? Han ?... Why do I feel like I heard this name before? Mhmm, you can call me Luke. I'm the owner of the farm. Are you here to buy fresh milk?"</br>
</br>
"Fresh milk?’ Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Are you not?" The farm owner looked at Jiang Chen in surprise as he wrapped the towel around his thick neck. "Are you not a " purchaser 1  "? With your age, you must be an international student from Melbourne."</br>
</br>
Luke used Han when he used the word purchaser.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen facepalmed. Future International was now a Fortune 500 company. As the president, it would be impossible for him to be a purchaser.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, you made a mistake. I'm here to discuss a big deal."</br>
</br>
Luke looked at him skeptically.</br>
</br>
Just as they spoke, a van stopped in front of the farm.</br>
</br>
A girl in a cap got out of the car. When Luke saw who it was, he seemed to know the reason why she came as he retreated to the farm right away.</br>
</br>
"Hello," The girl was rather lively as she warmly greeted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and asked her casually, "Are you an international student in Melbourne?"</br>
</br>
The girl was rather talkative as she said brightly, "Mhmm, I’m studying business administration - I'm in my third year now. What about you?"</br>
</br>
"I’m not a student; I finished studying two years ago."</br>
</br>
"Are you not an international student? Are you an immigrant then?" the girl asked as she blinked her eyes.</br>
</br>
Although it wasn't wrong for her to say this, Jiang Chen wasn't an Australian immigrant but a Xin immigrant.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Eh? Where are you from then?"</br>
</br>
"Hucheng."</br>
</br>
"I see. I'm from Shangjing. Are you in the powder milk purchaser business?"</br>
</br>
"Why would you think I'm a purchaser?" Jiang Chen said with a speechless expression.</br>
</br>
The girl looked at Jiang Chen, confused. Then she seemed to understand something as she kindly recommended something to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"If you are taking some for your family, it's better to purchase it from the superstore. Although the products from the farm are drinkable, the packaging is inconvenient and not hygienic."</br>
</br>
"What about you?" Jiang Chen looked at her, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"I'm not buying for my family." The girl rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen. "I'm a purchaser and I mostly sell on Wechat and Taobao… Also, I recently opened a purchaser store on Little White; I can pay my tuition now."</br>
</br>
As she said this, a proud smile appeared on the girl’s face. Compared with poor students studying abroad who made their parents sell their houses or students coming from rich families, there weren't a lot of international students who could be as independent as her. She didn’t have a sugar daddy nor did she burden her family.</br>
</br>
But she couldn't imagine that the designer of Little White was standing in front of her and casually having a conversation with her.</br>
</br>
"Purchaser store… Uh, do the purchaser stores not purchase from the supermarket?" Jiang Chen faintly recollected the ads in his memory were written that way.</br>
</br>
"Are you a fool or what?" The girl rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen. "Have you never purchased powdered milk from Walmart before? Han customers are only permitted to purchase two at a time and they're also more expensive. The online store I own with a friend sells at least twenty-something a day -how could we purchase that from the supermarket? We buy directly from the farm and purchase the expensive empty containers from the recycling plant-"</br>
</br>
Then she seemed to have realized something and immediately stopped talking.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, Luke walked over to them while carrying a big bag. The girl’s eyes lit up and she immediately walked up to him.</br>
</br>
The Australian helped the girl load the powdered milk onto the van and accepted her stack of bills.</br>
</br>
"See you." The girl smiled sweetly at Jiang Chen before she waved goodbye.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved back and said goodbye to the girl he didn’t know.</br>
</br>
A courteous girl.</br>
</br>
But he felt the sweet smile was fake.</br>
</br>
"Okay, buddy, what’s your big deal?" Luke wiped off his sweat as he asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t respond as he asked an irrelevant question, "Is that powdered milk safe?"</br>
</br>
Luke was completely lost. He looked at Jiang Chen with a puzzled face before he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Of course it's safe; my farm passed all health inspections from the very start. Although that batch was off-label supplies that I asked my friend’s powdered milk factory to produce, the quality is undoubtedly safe.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Jiang Chen sighed with a tone of defeat.</br>
</br>
"As long as it's safe. Of course, I’m not here to buy powdered milk, I'm just a bit curious… Whatever, let’s talk business…"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 337: Public Opinion</br>
</div></br>
Celestial Trade Company's food was all previously imported from New Zealand. The specifics of its operation were all contracted to professionals to manage. But with the increase in demand, this operational model was no longer suitable.</br>
</br>
This is what Jiang Chen was planning:</br>
</br>
He would import goods from Australian farms and transport them to Coro Island through the port in Melbourne. Part of the goods would be sold by Celestial Trade Company in Pannu Islands and part of them would be kept as raw ingredients for further food production and transported to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Xinlong Food Processing Plant located in Wanghai City would be moved to Pannu Islands. All the staff willing to relocate overseas would be kept on, while local cheap labor would be hired to perform the assembly process. They'd produce cheap raw ingredients from Australia into canned foods and preserved products.</br>
</br>
This processed food would be partially be sold locally and moved to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he wouldn't only save on tariffs, but he would also save on the labor cost as well as easing transportation of the goods to the apocalypse. It was like hitting three birds with one stone.</br>
</br>
Of course, with such a massive and long-term deal, it couldn't be hastily decided upon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only initiated the conversation because he happened to be in Australia. Therefore, he made a personal trip. As to the specifics of the deal, he left it to Zheng Hongjie to take care of and left Luke his number.</br>
</br>
After that, Luke cheerfully sent Jiang Chen off in a taxi to head back to Melbourne.</br>
</br>
He booked tickets for the next day. Although there was still some time before it turned dark, he didn't know what to do by himself when he looked at the busy street. He started to regret not bringing Ayesha along.</br>
</br>
The girl seemed to really enjoy pretty clothes. He still vividly remembered the date with her in Veit. That day, they almost cleaned out an entire clothing store with some intimacy that happened that same night.</br>
</br>
When he returned to the hotel he was staying at, Jiang Chen felt lonely on the massive king bed, so he took out his phone.</br>
</br>
He happened to see Liu Yao's message on Little White, so he replied.</br>
</br>
&lt;Are you here?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;I'm here, haha, did you miss me?&gt;</br>
</br>
Without any surprise, Jiang Chen still replied instantly. He sometimes even suspected whether the girl created a special alert just for him.</br>
</br>
With a smile on his face, Jiang Chen naughtily prepared to tease her.</br>
</br>
&lt;Guess.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Definitely not! (Sad)&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Congratulations… You guessed wrong.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Haha. (Happy)&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen continued to type on the screen with a smirk on his face.</br>
</br>
&lt;How is your filming going?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;We're close to finishing. I'm so tired.&gt;</br>
</br>
</br>
*Buzz*</br>
</br>
Liu Yao sent a selfie over.</br>
</br>
Scissor hands at a 45 degrees angle - playful but at the same time demonstrating her impressive 36D cleavage.</br>
</br>
She also added: &lt;Do I look good?~&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't stop himself from laughing as he replied.</br>
</br>
&lt;Good to masturbate to.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Screw you!&gt;</br>
</br>
Although that was what she said, she didn't feel annoyed at all as another buzzing sound came through. This selfie was even more flirtatious. Although nothing was exposed, it teased Jiang Chen even more.</br>
</br>
Fine, Jiang Chen was hard.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, time flies when you talk with a beauty. Liu Yao was also a great conversation starter as she didn't make Jiang Chen feel bored at all as the night flew by.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen prepared to say goodbye, Liu Yao sent another message over.</br>
</br>
&lt;Also, did you know that Weibo has been full of posts about you these last few days?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;Weibo?&gt; Jiang Chen paused.</br>
</br>
He did register a Weibo before and Sina decided by themselves to verify him as an Orange V. He had millions of followers already. But since he was flooded with messages such as &lt;I want to bear your baby&gt; and was constantly tagged with pointless things, Jiang Chen hadn't logged on for a while.</br>
</br>
After he said goodnight to Liu Yao, Jiang Chen didn't immediately sleep but instead opened Baidu and searched for his name.</br>
</br>
After he searched himself, thousands of posts popped up about him.</br>
</br>
Some were negative, some were positive.</br>
</br>
&lt;Internal feud? Future International's sudden expansion in real estate, Linhua Group's record loss of 2.5 billion USD. In the face of profit, the tendency of countrymen to fight each other remains unchanged!&gt; Jiang Chen could guess the content just by scanning the name.</br>
</br>
Disregarding the fact that it might've been an internet army hired by Linhua Group to change public opinion, Jiang Chen wasn't bored enough to read this type of foolish article. It was written without any proof or understanding of the circumstances and emphasized partial facts rather than the complete picture.</br>
</br>
While he was in the country, Linhua didn't act like a victim when they were plotting against him. They had the attitude of &lt;I'm going to buy 50% of your share, or you can't do business here&gt; when they negotiated. They totally deserved what they got now.</br>
</br>
Of course, there was certainly a lot of positive news. Generally speaking, public opinion stood on Jiang Chen's side, since Future International's rise to the top meant that Hua's artificial intelligent stood at the frontier of the world. Although Future International had relocated to Xin, Han netizens still considered it as a national company. Even though Alibaba's IPO made a Japanese person named Su Zhengyi the wealthiest man, people rarely considered Alibaba a Japanese company.</br>
</br>
Other than the posts with polarized opinions, Jiang Chen saw a post with an interesting point of view.</br>
</br>
&lt;Celestial Trade Company and Future International, they belong to the same hidden organization? Overseas Han organization may be plotting a masterpiece!&gt;</br>
</br>
The original poster of this post listed large quantities of half-fake, half-genuine "evidence" and perfectly demonstrated their imagination as the OP connected the two completely contrary companies together. He declared that the organization controlling the two companies was an overseas Han organization. Counting the coup in Pannu Islands, it was their work that sparked everything. The formation of the Han-speaking country, Xin, was a link in their master plan.</br>
</br>
And this organization may have received secret support from the Han government!</br>
</br>
The renowned, born-in-the-nineties billionaire Jiang Chen was only a pawn of the organization.</br>
</br>
Because of this sophisticated thought process, clear explanation, and excellent storytelling ability, the post caused a lot of people to reply. The number of likes easily broke a million. But the replies were also funny, such as:</br>
</br>
&lt;The OP knows too much; is your water meter okay 1 ?&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;The UA wouldn't allow Hua to intervene with Pacific affairs. This coup was the afterproduct of the superpowers' strategic conflict - OP's intelligence is questionable. What overseas Han organization? There should be a limit to this guy's imagination.&gt;</br>
</br>
&lt;The person above is a pro-UA supporter, let me curse at him.&gt;</br>
</br>
The comments certainly entertained Jiang Chen, but if he were to comment on the post, the only word he could think of was:</br>
</br>
Bullsh*t.</br>
</br>
A lot of conspiracy theories had no proof to back them up. Logically, any natural occurring events could be described as "preplanned" after the fact.</br>
</br>
Of course, these comments were like smoke screens for Jiang Chen - the more, the better for him.</br>
</br>
When his eyes began to feel drowsy, Jiang Chen flung the phone away. Just as he was about to sleep, the EP on his left hand buzzed.</br>
</br>
When he opened it, it was Lin Lin's message.</br>
</br>
&lt;Come back.&gt;</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen was puzzled why Lin Lin didn't just open the video message, he still got up from the bed.</br>
</br>
He closed the curtain by the window before he started interdimensional travel on the bed.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Due to the difference in time zones, Melbourne was three hours ahead of Wanghai. When Jiang Chen returned to the mansion in the apocalypse, the light was still on in the mansion. Sun Jiao and them were not asleep yet.</br>
</br>
After he said hi to Sun Jiao, Jiang Chen headed directly to Lin Lin's lab.</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that Lin Lin had a surprise for him.</br>
</br>
When he pushed open the lab door, Jiang Chen saw Lin Lin in a white lab coat. The girl's fashion sense was particularly weird; she liked to wear fashionable clothing from before the war underneath a giant white lab coat.</br>
</br>
"Wow, you're fast." When she saw Jiang Chen, Lin Lin put aside the item in her hand and walked to the door with a grin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly knew what her expression meant and took out the pudding from the storage dimension and put it in her hand.</br>
</br>
"Did you call me back because you wanted pudding?" Jiang Chen facepalmed as he looked at her joyful expression of opening the pudding.</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Lin Lin proudly raised her eyebrows. Using her plastic spoon, she pointed at the helmet on the lab bench with high spirit. "Dang dang dang dang!"</br>
</br>
It was a circular plate. Inside the circular plate was a fist-sized metal sphere.</br>
</br>
"Is that a Golden Apple?' Jiang Chen looked in the direction of the spoon, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"No, no, no!" She proudly raised her tiny chest as she arrogantly shook her finger. "Although part of the inspiration came from that "Golden Apple", the technology is not on the same level at all."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then what is special about yours?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"That Golden apple is a communication device and sends out a resonance signal. But mine, I can send mass!" Lin Lin smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was moved as he rushed to say, " You mean, you can transfer the mass from the modern world to here?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head. "It is impossible to send mass from another dimension to this dimension. Any physical quantity is useless between dimensions. Even with the most advanced technology in the 22nd century, it could not create a miracle that extends beyond the boundary of physics."</br>
</br>
"Then why did you shock me and say it could send mass?" Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
As she spoke, Lin Lin smiled mysteriously and handed the sphere ball to Jiang Chen from the circular plate.</br>
</br>
"Try to put that metallic sphere into your storage dimension."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her skeptically. He took the sphere and threw it in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"Then put this on." As she said, Lin Lin placed a soft plastic bracelet into Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
He followed Lin Lin's direction and put it on.</br>
</br>
It was light, and it didn't feel like there was anything at all around his wrist. Inside the bracelet, a grain-sized crystal was in the middle and it cast a dark green light.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Take out anything from the storage dimension." Lin Lin curled up the tips of her mouth proudly.</br>
</br>
Anything?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered to himself and followed Lin Lin's instruction. He connected his conscious to the interdimensional bracelet and selected the Type-11 pistol floating in the sub-dimension.</br>
</br>
But what happened stunned him.</br>
</br>
The pistol didn't appear in his hand, but rather, appeared on the circular plate that contained the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen was flabbergasted.</br>
</br>
"Just as I have expected." Lin Lin rubbed her chin as she nodded in confidence. Then, she handed the pistol back to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Stop playing riddles with me, what exactly is this?" Jiang Chen threw the pistol back into the storage dimension. He glanced at the circular plate, this time the pistol didn't appear there.</br>
</br>
"To put it in simple terms, it is the interdimensional mass transporter or a transport array!" Lin Lin walked in front of the whiteboard in the lab and drew two lines.</br>
</br>
"The two lines represent two parallel worlds." As she explained, Lin Lin also drew a circle between the two lines, "And this circle represents a small universe."</br>
</br>
Small universe? Super Saiyan?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a strange expression on his face.</br>
</br>
Professor Lin Lin ignored the fact that Jiang Chen's attention slipped away for a moment as she moved her nose and slapped the circle.</br>
</br>
"You refer to this as the storage dimension, but is it just a convenient backpack?"</br>
</br>
"Then what is it?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"I already said," She stared into Jiang Chen's eyes with excitement, "It is a small universe or a sub-dimension. It stands outside of the macro universe, parallel to all timelines, but it would be infinitely closed to all timelines. Theoretically, it is not possible to transport mass to the small universe, but you could. Although the current theories can't explain your ability, we can take advantage of this!"</br>
</br>
"Take advantage of this?" Jiang Chen muttered to himself while immersed in thought. Then, he took out another box of mango pudding from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"That's right; the bracelet can continuously emit Klein particle waves of special frequency to interfere with your interdimensional bracelet's recognition of the fourth-dimensional coordinate. It is similar to adding a backdoor program in the computer software. By changing the fourth dimensional coordinate, the objects being taken out would appear on this circular plate, rather than in front of the person wearing the bracelet – Ahh! Pudding~"</br>
</br>
Green lights flared into the circular plate as the Klein particles in the dimension vibrated rhythmically.</br>
</br>
Just like the previous pistol, the mango pudding didn't appear in his hand but appear on the plate. Jiang Chen tried to put the mango pudding away, but there was no reaction at all.</br>
</br>
The "transport array" seemed to be one-directional, it could only send items here and not the other way around.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's eyes lit up as she snatched the pudding on the circular plate with a smile on the face. She joyfully rubbed it against her face.</br>
</br>
"As long as I wear this bracelet, the stuff I take out from the storage dimension would appear on this circulate plate? Even if I was in the modern world?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was excited by the idea. If that was the case, then he didn't need to tirelessly run back and forth. He would only need to wear the bracelet and stand at the warehouse in the modern world, throw all the supplies into the storage dimension before taking it out.</br>
</br>
"That's right!" Lin Lin put her hands on her waist as she laughed proudly.</br>
</br>
"Haha! This is amazing! Lin Lin, you have helped me so much!"</br>
</br>
The thrilled Jiang Chen grabbed Lin Lin's shoulders, hugged her, and spun her around.</br>
</br>
"Wahhhh! What, what are you doing!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's face instantly turned red. Steam began to emerge from her head, and her limbs moved listlessly in the air. Jiang Chen also realized that his action was a bit over the line as he immediately put her down.</br>
</br>
"Ah, sorry, ahem… I was too excited." Jiang Chen forced a laugh as he embarrassedly scratched his head while looking at Lin Lin with a face as red as a ripe apple.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin hissed a few times, especially unlike her, but didn't say anything. Instead, she grabbed the two boxes of pudding she obtained from Jiang Chen and ran out the door with her head buried.</br>
</br>
When she passed by Jiang Chen, he noticed that the red hue has extended from her ear to her neck.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
[…Digitalized human can blush too?]</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 339: Return to Xiangjiang</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Lin Lin stuffed boxes of pudding into the kitchen fridge before walking back to the room. The expression on her face seemed to suggest that she still hasn't completely forgiven Jiang Chen for his action. When she came in, she didn't say anything as she just pushed Jiang Chen out of the room with her two slim arms and shut the door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at the closed shut door, knowing he was in the wrong. However, all he did was awkwardly scratch his nose as he didn't know what to say to apologize.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen admitted that despite not processing his action through his head, the act he committed was over the line for a girl. But he didn't expect her to react so dramatically.</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a while, Jiang Chen let out a sigh and gave up on the idea of explaining himself. Instead, he walked to his own bedroom.</br>
</br>
Worst case he would just have to bring her a few more boxes of pudding next time… Mango flavored.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lied on his bed and muttered to himself before he closed his eyes and commenced interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes again, he was in the modern world.</br>
</br>
He raised his hand and pressed the grain-sized crystal on the bracelet as the dark green light immediately dimmed down. He threw the bracelet into the storage dimension, and then checked his phone for the time.</br>
</br>
It was getting late, already midnight.</br>
</br>
He rubbed his weary eyes, dragged up the sheets, and slept till morning.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen checked out from the hotel before arriving at the close by airport, empty-handed. He boarded a plane from Melbourne to Xiangjiang.</br>
</br>
The ticket was book three days ago.</br>
</br>
Because there was still the bidding on the construction site and the loan to take care of, Jiang Chen had to head to Xiangjiang before returning to Xin. It was already April, and the contract with Dalmer corporation was almost up. Although the "smart driving system" was completed by Yao Yao in two hours, to avoid any commotion, Jiang Chen hasn't given the USB and the chip to Carmen Rothschild. On this trip to Xiangjiang, Jiang Chen planned to provide Carmen with the program.</br>
</br>
One billion in two hours, needless to say, Yao Yao was the biggest "goldmine" of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
After hours of flying, with the flight attendant's gentle announcement, Jiang Chen woke up from his nap and got off the plane.</br>
</br>
At the gate of the airport, Jiang Chen saw the stunning figure from a distance.</br>
</br>
It was Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
Before he returned to Xiangjiang, Jiang Chen had sent a message to Xia Shiyu, asking her to pick him up if convenient.</br>
</br>
With a smile on his face, Jiang Chen walked directly towards her.</br>
</br>
"You are finally back."</br>
</br>
Although her face was rather expressionless, Jiang Chen could still read the sense of blame within her eyes. He had known her affection from the start and thus obviously understood the meaning behind her words. However, just like before, he only laughed and avoided the question.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I haven't seen you in two months… You have lost weight."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen, didn't respond, and instead opened the Maybach door.</br>
</br>
The car was previously Jiang Chen's ride, but he left the key to Ayesha who was protecting Xia Shiyu at the time in Xiangjiang before he left the country. After she had confirmed that Xia Shiyu was safe, Ayesha left the car key to Xia Shiyu according to Jiang Chen's instructions. Now, the car became Xia Shiyu's mode of transportation.</br>
</br>
In the passenger seat, Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu who was combing her hair to the side as she started the car.</br>
</br>
"Do you like it?" Jiang Chen asked abruptly.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyes instantly turned red. She stepped on the gas as the car dashed forward along the barrier. The series of actions almost scared Jiang Chen to death.</br>
</br>
"What, what are you even saying?" She hastily gained control of her steering, but the red hue climbed from the bottom of her neck to the tip of her ears. Xia Shiyu's voice was also listless, and her tone was even off.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I… I am asking if you like the car."</br>
</br>
Her pumping chest began to return to normal. The calmed Xia Shiyu turned her head and gave Jiang Chen a dirty look before she returned to her expressionless state.</br>
</br>
It seemed like… She was angry?</br>
</br>
"Uh, I am serious. If you like it, I'll give it to you as a gift," Jiang Chen said in a tiny voice.</br>
</br>
"No need, I can afford it myself." Xia Shiyu clenched her teeth as it made a crisp sound.</br>
</br>
She didn't know why she was so angry. But there was one thing she was certain about and that was this guy definitely was not as courteous as she had thought. No, he was a pervert!</br>
</br>
As to how she knew about this, she learned that by living with Ayesha. Because of her delicate figure, although her face looked young, she had always thought Ayesha was over 18. Until one time they talked about age, and she finally knew Ayesha's real age.</br>
</br>
But that was not the point. When she asked that if Jiang Chen had done anything to her. Ayesha looked at her innocently and said in a casual voice: We had sex.</br>
</br>
Had sex?</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu didn't manage to react at first, but then it hit her like lightning.</br>
</br>
She just remembered that she was completely stunned.</br>
</br>
She had thought Jiang Chen was a type where he would always be respectable to girls but never had the skill to interact with them. However, he was actually a pervert that did it with his own bodyguard – a girl that was less than 18 years old.</br>
</br>
But Xia Shiyu's reaction was typical as Ayesha told Xia Shiyu with a straight face. It was normal for people to be married at the age of 13. Especially during a conflict-filled era, the age might be even younger. Also, she had expressed to Xia Shiyu that she could sense her affection towards Jiang Chen as well and she wouldn't mind sharing his gentleness with her.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was ordinary in Ayesha's eyes. Since in her home country, polygamy was common. Even if Syria was at the frontier of modernization among the middle eastern countries, this point did not change at all.</br>
</br>
But to Xia Shiyu, who lived in the modern world, it was an unacceptable practice!</br>
</br>
When she heard that Ayesha and Jiang Chen had done it before, she was shocked.</br>
</br>
Then remorse, even despair, before it gradually turned into hate.</br>
</br>
All men would turn to the bed once they have money.</br>
</br>
She felt as if she had just gone through a break-up, although her feelings and the relationship could only be considered a crush.</br>
</br>
But regardless, it was her first time feeling so heartbroken.</br>
</br>
But with Ayesha's pure and innocent eyes, she couldn't impose the hate on her, especially since she had risked her life to save hers. And what made her feel the most powerless was…</br>
</br>
She still loved him.</br>
</br>
If she didn't love him, she wouldn't even be sad about this. She would not be jealous of the fact that another woman was before her, she would only need to leave.</br>
</br>
If she didn't love him, she wouldn't be here to pick him up.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The car stopped at a modern apartment as Xia Shiyu skillfully parked the car in the garage.</br>
</br>
"This place is?"</br>
</br>
"My home," Xia Shiyu answered concisely and got out of the car.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed her as they walked to the elevator of the apartment, he had to ask.</br>
</br>
"Do you not plan to send me to a hotel?"</br>
</br>
"That's too problematic, just live here." Xia Shiyu swayed her hair as she didn't realize how explosive her words were and pressed the elevator button.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Uh?"</br>
</br>
"What, do you dislike me?" The corners of Xia Shiyu's mouth formed a beautiful curvature while she looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Stunned by the glimpse of her beauty, Jiang Chen didn't manage to react in time.</br>
</br>
"No, No."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was satisfied with Jiang Chen's expression as a smile appeared on her lips, and she said, "Then that's that. This time you are back for business, it is easier for us to exchange opinion if we live together… No other intentions."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought the last sentence was trying to cover something up.</br>
</br>
As they spoke, the elevator arrived.</br>
</br>
While the door opened, she only stepped one foot into the elevator.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu with eyes saying "What are you waiting for" as he stepped into the elevator feeling puzzled.</br>
</br>
She had already made up her mind, she must act proactively.</br>
</br>
What if he had another woman? Still not married yet! Before he gets married, it's all fair game. Therefore, she will win him over.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's presence made her feel threatened. She had no feelings to be bothered by the childish question of "Who confessed to who first". Xia Shiyu made up her mind to drag Jiang Chen onto the right track and save the good person that mistakenly went on the "wrong" road.</br>
</br>
No need to be mistaken, it was just for her to repay the favor of him saving her multiple times.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu comforted herself.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In the Pannu Islands thousands of kilometers away, two transport vessels and two construction vessels slowly headed to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
To best protect the local environment, Jiang Chen didn't choose to blow up the reef to build the port, but instead, he decided to build a sea platform two kilometers away from the island. There, he would construct a dock that would connect the platform to the land. As to the sea platform, it will be built with a three kilometers long arch water dam.</br>
</br>
Two cars could travel at the same time on the dam. On the far end of the dam, they will construct a tidal wave electricity generator. Although the depth near the island was somewhat shallow, the continuous waves made up for it. Not only did it solve the problem of connecting the land to the sea platform, but it also addressed New Moon Island's electricity.</br>
</br>
The sea platform cost more than one billion USD and even surpassed the military base by two folds, but Jiang Chen still considered the investment to be well worth it. The sea platform and dam construction were contracted to a company called "Wilson" while Thomas' "Mammoth" was only responsible for connecting the dam.</br>
</br>
Since these professional sea construction projects already exceeded the capabilities of a military construction company. Thomas had brought up the idea of working with other companies on this project. The boss of both corporations were all confused as to why Celestial would spend so much money to build a sea platform.</br>
</br>
Usually, this thing was built far away from the shore; it was kind of pointless to build it near the island. Especially since the request was to build it as large as possible, they wondered what the true intention was behind the project.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 340"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 340: Blackmail</br>
</div></br>
Due to the construction project being a sensitive topic, the construction company didn't ask more about the usage of the sea platform. After they received the upfront payment, they sent the vessels to start building.</br>
</br>
The sea platform was the size of two football fields, shaped triangularly. If it were far away from the shore, the difficulty of constructing it would be unimaginable. If it were standard steel, the tide of the ocean would dismember this giant. But if titanium were used, the cost of the construction would be an astronomical number.</br>
</br>
However, because it was in a shallow sea with a depth of ten meters, the construction process was a lot simpler. A reinforced steel base could be inserted into the rock bottom of the ocean, making it equivalent to a man-made floating island.</br>
</br>
The four vessels were anchored near New Moon Island as they sent out boats to explore the surroundings.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Celestial Trade Company's vessel also lowered a boat and approached the construction vessels. After they boarded the Mammoth's ship, Ivan and Barkary had met Thomas. After they confirmed the details of the construction project, the three began to joke around on the deck.</br>
</br>
A Ukranian, a Nigerian, and an Australian, it was as if they were in a United Nations meeting. Ivan was the oldest among the three and had the most to say. He joined the army in the Soviets, so he talked about the dramatic changes in East Europe and the civil war in Ukraine.</br>
</br>
Just as they were having a great conversation, three medium-sized boats appeared from the horizon along with a few sharp air horn sounds.</br>
</br>
"What's that?" Ivan frowned and took out the binoculars from his pocket, but he couldn't recognize the red-blue flag.</br>
</br>
Barkary didn't recognize it either as he narrowed his eyes and took a few hard looks. Thomas had more knowledge as he immediately recognized it.</br>
</br>
"It's Country F's flag. It should be their fishing boats." Thomas raised his eyebrows as he felt a trace of ominous feeling and walked to the tip of the vessel.</br>
</br>
The three fishing boats stopped beside the vessel. Immediately, a southeastern Asian with yellow skin and his shirt unbuttoned walked out onto the deck of their ship and shouted a few gibberish words at Thomas.</br>
</br>
Although Thomas recognized the flag, he didn't know the F language as he had to drag the translator on the boat out to explain to him.</br>
</br>
"What is this guy saying?" Ivan walked beside Thomas with a frown.</br>
</br>
The F citizen saw that another foreigner came out from the boat and gave Ivan a hard stare. But Ivan, born in Russia, had seen more bullet holes than people was not afraid as he stared back at him.</br>
</br>
The F citizen was someone that preyed on the weak. Seeing that Ivan didn't back down, he subconsciously wanted to go back. But when he saw the two other fishing boats come by, he regained his courage and stared back and began shouting towards the ship.</br>
</br>
</br>
"He is saying that this is the territory they fish in. Our construction boats have scared away the fish, and they are seeking compensation from us. These shameless bastards, the construction gets delayed every time they're here," Thomas cursed.</br>
</br>
F country's fishing boats? But isn't this Xin's territory?" Ivan frowned.</br>
</br>
New Moon Island was twelve hundred kilometers away from the southernmost island MLL Island of Country F. Therefore, there should be no territorial disputes in this area.</br>
</br>
"Speaking from the law, yes. But these bastards never follow the law. Even if they took a sh*t here before, it would be their fishing territory even if it was in your backyard. It is the result of the moronic president," Thomas cursed.</br>
</br>
Since he was in the military construction business, despite being a veteran, he still had fury in his attitude. It was just the years in business that had rounded out his eyes. He knew that there was no use in being angry. If he angered the natives, there was no way the construction could continue.</br>
</br>
He took a few deep breaths and calmed his emotions down. Then, speaking with the interpreter, he began to negotiate with the fishermen.</br>
</br>
But Ivan standing on the side had a different reaction.</br>
</br>
These monkeys were here to scam them. His eyebrows jumped, and he signaled Barkary.</br>
</br>
Barkary understood. Smiling, he jumped onto the boat and headed to Celestial Trade Company's vessel.</br>
</br>
"Now we would have to ask the Xin government. This is their territory; they should send their coastal guards here and capture these monkeys asking for bananas. Then transfer them back to their home country. But even then, they would almost be immediately released by their government," Thomas said in rage.</br>
</br>
"Xin government? Why do we need to ask them?" Ivan's eyes narrowed as he looked at the monkey from F.</br>
</br>
Thomas paused for a moment as he looked at Ivan, puzzled.</br>
</br>
Ivan took out his phone. He didn't call Zhang Yapin but called another number.</br>
</br>
&lt;Jiang Chen&gt;</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The interior was fashionably decorated. The warm colored wallpaper certainly gave a peaceful feeling. The range of appliances completed the room with comfort and beauty. Just by looks, the owner of the apartment knew how to enjoy life.</br>
</br>
After he took off his shoes at the door, Jiang Chen scanned the decorations and asked Xia Shiyu nonchalantly,</br>
</br>
"Are you still renting?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Why don't you buy a house? The company just paid out dividends last month, there is no way that you don't have the money right?" Jiang Chen was confused.</br>
</br>
Future Technology had its shareholders meeting in March, (Although there are only two shareholders), and paid out 4 billion USD in dividends. Xia Shiyu owned 1% of Future International. Because she was taxed in Xin, she barely paid any personal income tax. She had at least forty million in her savings account.</br>
</br>
"I feel like you won't live here too long." She took off her shoes, and her feet covered in black stockings stepped into slippers. Jiang Chen, watching on the side, reflexively gulped and missed the deeper meaning behind Xia Shiyu's words.</br>
</br>
"Feel free to sit, I will pour you a cup of water… Also, where is your luggage?" Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen's empty hands as she asked in confusion.</br>
</br>
Facepalm! He should have brought the luggage from the storage dimension in the airport bathroom.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen had luggage, but he couldn't tell Xia Shiyu it was in his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I prefer to buy local." Jiang Chen had to make up a story.</br>
</br>
Xiao Shiyu's delicate eyebrows raised.</br>
</br>
"That's such a waste… It's okay, I will bring you to Causeway Bay tonight. At least buy a few sets of clothing and formal clothing for professional gatherings. Those are necessary for a business professional."</br>
</br>
"Okay, as you wish."</br>
</br>
Sigh, he should have insisted on staying in a hotel. Of course, he brought everything with him, it was just inconvenient to bring it out in front of Xia Shiyu. Due to the devil controlling his mind for just a moment, he had agreed to live at Xia Shiyu's place, leading him to have to rebuy everything.</br>
</br>
It was not that he cared about the money, it was because he hated the trouble.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched Xia Shiyu go into the kitchen. He felt relieved and sank into the sofa.</br>
</br>
A light scent twirled around the tip of his nose, it was Xia Shiyu's odor.</br>
</br>
It was a faint scent, and it carried a hint of lily. It made Jiang Chen feel thirsty. It had to be the work of hormones getting him into trouble.</br>
</br>
Not long after, Xia Shiyu brought a cup of water from the kitchen and handed the warm water to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately chugged the entire glass clean to suppress the weird feelings in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Are you that thirsty? Do you want another cup?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, no need."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded, sat beside Jiang Chen, and grabbed a stack of documents that were on the table.</br>
</br>
"These are the information about the bidders-"</br>
</br>
But at the same time, Jiang Chen's phone began to ring.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, let me get a call." As Jiang Chen spoke, he walked to the window and took out his phone.</br>
</br>
[Ivan?</br>
</br>
Did something happen at the New Moon Island military base?]</br>
</br>
He looked at the name and picked up.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Boss, citizens from country F are causing trouble in the ocean territory near New Moon Island. They said our construction has interfered with their fishing."</br>
</br>
Country F fishers?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard Ivan's explanation, he first paused for a moment. He was so angry that he began to laugh.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, I'm already unhappy with them. Now they want to take advantage of me? I have to pay up even to build in my backyard?]</br>
</br>
"You are asking for my permission on this? Pirates have invaded our territory. You tell me what the coastal guard should do. Don't see me if you can't take care of it properly.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After he received confirmation from his boss, a wicked smile surfaced on Ivan's face.</br>
</br>
The grimace was mixed with thrill as he was waiting for the boss to say this.</br>
</br>
"Yes! Commander."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 341: Fishermen? They are pirates!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After Ivan hung up the phone, he took out the pistol strapped to his waist and loaded the gun.</br>
</br>
His action made Thomas jump as he immediately blocked the Russian.</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy! If your action gets filmed, they will definitely take the opportunity to scam you!"</br>
</br>
Thomas who frequently conducted construction with Han companies knew that even if these fishermen looked dumb, they were extremely cunning. If they filmed Ivan pulling out the gun, they would return and make a few holes in their own boat. He knew that without paying money, the construction would be unable to continue.</br>
</br>
What's even worse was that the actions of these fishermen received the support of the F government. Their government would also first pay for their damage and then help them with the international lawsuit.</br>
</br>
"Scam?" Ivan scorned contemptuously and aimed at the monkeys' chest.</br>
</br>
The country F citizen was first scared, but then he turned ecstatic as he ran inside to take out his camera. When he saw this, Thomas in defeat put down the hand holding onto Ivan's arm as he smashed his hand onto the railing of the deck.</br>
</br>
"Dammit… Now that's that. I'm going to request your boss extend the construction period. We can't conduct any work with their interference."</br>
</br>
Ivan ignored Thomas' complaint and looked at the translator on the side.</br>
</br>
"Tell them to leave Xin territory within a minute. This place doesn't welcome pirates."</br>
</br>
"Pirates? They are fishermen.." The translator paused for a moment as he attempted to correct Ivan.</br>
</br>
"The boss said they are pirates, so they are pirates," Ivan raised the pistol and said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Ivan began the countdown, the translator clenched his teeth and translated his message to the fishermen on the fishing boat.</br>
</br>
The fishermen were immediately enraged.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k you. You threaten us with a gun, you think we are scared?]</br>
</br>
They banked on the fact that the neighboring countries cared about their own feathers and wouldn't shoot. Who are you trying to scare pointing at people instead of the boat?</br>
</br>
As to being pirates, that's more bullsh*t! Without a single gun, who would believe that?</br>
</br>
The country F citizen didn't back down as he acted even more recklessly. He was not only mocking Ivan, but he also coastal peed in their direction.</br>
</br>
Half a minute passed; five boats emerged from the distance. On top of the boats were fully equipped soldiers. Although they didn't wear kinetic skeletons, the rifles they had belonged to the 22nd century.</br>
</br>
"Sixty." The last Russian word came out of his chapped lips.</br>
</br>
Time was up.</br>
</br>
Thomas thought he would awkwardly put the gun down, or shoot at the water or the boat, but the Russian pressed the trigger aimed at the monkey's chest.</br>
</br>
That's right, it was the chest! Not the hands or legs!</br>
</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
Blood began to splatter as it instantly stained the clothes of the monkey. He tumbled and fell down on the deck. He had his eyes widened as he looked at his chest in disbelief.</br>
</br>
He wanted to scream, but only blood coughed out.</br>
</br>
"Run! They are killing people!"</br>
</br>
"Run! Run!"</br>
</br>
The gibberish mixed with screams diffused over the sea. A fisherman quickly dashed out from inside the boat and dragged the wounded companion inside. The three fishing boats accelerated at max speed as they fled in country F's direction.</br>
</br>
Thomas stared blankly at Ivan.</br>
</br>
"You… killed him?"</br>
</br>
"I killed a pirate," Ivan added as he fired a few more rounds at the fishing boats turning around. Although he didn't hit anyone, it made the fishermen scream in fear. Although he didn't understand, he could hear the fright in their voices.</br>
</br>
There was no return once he fired the first shot, if any escaped, they would be a witness in court. Since he killed a person, he would have to leave all of them here, down into the deep abyss.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Jiang Chen didn't have that kind of awareness, but Ivan had. At the front line in Oesk, he fought head to head with the Russian army, why would he be afraid of the country F?</br>
</br>
Thomas's lips twitched, but then he sighed in defeat as he shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Fine… That was beautiful, I fu*cking wanted to do that for a long time."</br>
</br>
"Territorial issues are without negotiations, only war." Ivan scorned and used a famous quote.</br>
</br>
"That's right, but sometimes… for business, we have to learn to compromise to avoid a bigger loss."</br>
</br>
"But my boss told me, we are not businessmen." Ivan smiled.</br>
</br>
But an army.</br>
</br>
Thomas was shocked, but then he sighed.</br>
</br>
"Then you have an interesting boss… I will retrain my crew. They didn't see anything today."</br>
</br>
"Thank you," Ivan looked him in the eyes and said sincerely.</br>
</br>
To the scums who caused trouble. Only blood would teach them humiliation and awe! If you take one step back, then they would take your mercy as weakness and take ten steps forward!</br>
</br>
Ivan got on the fast boat as he personally commanded the "pirate" hunt.</br>
</br>
"Attention all boats, attention all boats! Three pirate boats are fleeing in the northwestern direction. They carry weapons on board. Fire at will. I repeat. Fire at will!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The coastal guard in fast boats immediately moved towards the three fishing boats' direction and fired with their rifles. It left a series of bullet holes in the body of the boat. The fishermen finally knew that they messed with the wrong group of people as they were only begging to grow a pair of wings and escape for their lives to their border.</br>
</br>
The fast boats didn't ask them to surrender at all as they were treating them like pirates. In terms of speed, the fishing boat was nowhere as fast as the fast boat. The fast boats fired at the engine of the fishing boats simultaneously, and it didn't take long before their engines blew out.</br>
</br>
In the blanket of fire, the country F fishers hid inside their boat. They cursed at the foreigners with their dialect about how they don't follow the rules while they screamed inside the radio requesting for their coastal guard's assistance. Since they were deep into Xin water, even if their coastal guard trespass the border, it would still take some time.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the firing stopped.</br>
</br>
Just as these monkeys thought that their people had arrived, a few "clanking" sound transmitted from outside the boat.</br>
</br>
The Xin boats approached them and threw a few things inside.</br>
</br>
The captained adjusted his hat and carefully peeked out and looked at the deck through the window. When he saw a few M-series assault rifles on deck, he first paused for a moment before his expression suddenly changed drastically.</br>
</br>
The two fast boats throwing weapons on the fishing boats quickly moved away while the other three stopped thirty meters out.</br>
</br>
The soldiers in bulletproof vests lied on the deck, and one soldier held an AT4 rocket launcher on his arm.</br>
</br>
"#$%$$!"</br>
</br>
The captain ran for his life to the outside of the boat and kneeled on the ground in fear. With tear-filled eyes, he begged for mercy.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, no one understood him, they didn't plan to spare the invaders.</br>
</br>
The soldier aimed at the fishing boat and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Three RPGs fired from three different directions at the three fishing boats. The explosion lit up the sky to a vibrant red. The coastal guards of country F were on their way just in the distance. The soldiers on the fast boats followed Ivan's instruction and fired a few rounds at their own boat to create a few bullet holes.</br>
</br>
The soldiers threw away the one-time usage AT4 rocket launcher and took out the more advanced "Python" rocket launcher on the side. Everyone reloaded their clips and prepared to engage in battle.</br>
</br>
Under Ivan's command, the five fast boats approached the country F coastal guard ships.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 342: How did I forget about that?</br>
</div></br>
Jiang Chen stuffed the phone back into his pocket and returned to the living room.</br>
</br>
"Who just called?"</br>
</br>
"Uh, a friend," Jiang Chen nonchalantly replied and sat back down beside her.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen wasn't planning to explain, Xia Shiyu only glared at him suspiciously before she stopped persisting on the question and picked up the documents on the table.</br>
</br>
She cleared her throat and put on a stern face before she began to explain the documents to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The paper documents contain information on the bidders, mostly about the specifications and bidding price. As to the design project and project visualization, they are all on my computer, and we can take a look later. But before we start, can I ask you a question?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
If it a question he could answer, he would facepalm answer. If It were not appropriate for her to know now, he would remain silent.</br>
</br>
"Future Technology currently has good profitability. We just managed to gain our footsteps in the web space, why did we all the sudden expand into the tourism real estate market?" Xia Shiyu pushed up the glasses on her nose and asked with an undertone.</br>
</br>
From an investor's perspective, Future Technology has a bright future. Its return would be far higher than building infrastructure in a small country on the Pacifics to revitalize the tourism industry there.</br>
</br>
"Because I believe in the future of Pannu Islands' tourism, as well as Xin's growth prospect, Xin's plan to pay partially with land and sea developments also fits my interest."</br>
</br>
For construction such as the expansion of airports, roads, hospitals, because these projects were none not-for-profit, Xin's government won't make Jiang Chen work for free. Because the Xin government didn't have the money and was unable to access loans from international banks, they could only repay Jiang Chen in the form of land and ocean development rights. Based on the consideration that once the infrastructure was built, the land price would appreciate substantially. From a business's point of view, there was a lot to gain, only that…</br>
</br>
"But is it worth it to take on billions in debt for these of high-risk projects that could not generate profit in a short period? Right now Future Technology is currently working hard to expand its global market. It is in a rapid growth phase. The establishment of subsidiaries, talent acquisition, all these need money. If the cash flow is broken, its consequence would be severe."</br>
</br>
She looked at Jiang Chen with a stern face and gave him a hard question to answer.</br>
</br>
It was a problem.</br>
</br>
It was rather embarrassing because Xia Shiyu was the one who took care of the company for him. Not including the current operation of the business, he didn't even manage to meet all the board members as the president. Although they had drunk together before, after such a long time, he has almost forgotten all of their names.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen was not to blame for his short memory, he was a man that lived in two worlds after all.</br>
</br>
As he heard the question, he scratched his chin and began to deliberate.</br>
</br>
"How much does Future Technology need to expand its operation?"</br>
</br>
"Currently it is in the process of establishing subsidiaries in Australia, North America, Europe, Russia and Southeast Asia. This includes the construction of the subsidiary headquarter and hiring and training employees with an estimated cost of eight hundred million USD."</br>
</br>
"Eight hundred million USD? That's not a lot." Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the company's president had no sense of money, Xia Shiyu was exasperated and began to educate Jiang Chen about the fundamentals.</br>
</br>
"We are a tech company and the majority of our income is attributable to Future 1.0 and &lt;New Era&gt;. Although we have formed an absolute advantage in terms of technical capability, with the rapid shift in technology, no one can guarantee we can maintain the technological edge. Imagine this, if a replacement product for Future 1.0 was introduced on the market. Even if it could only do one out of the functions we currently offer, such as accelerated hardware, battery saving, or smart control and even if it was inferior compared to Future 1.0 if it was free, would people still be willing to pay for our VIP service?"</br>
</br>
"By that time, we would have to decrease our VIP charge, or even change the paid service into free service. If we lose Future 1.0 as a revenue channel, without exaggeration, Future Technology may turn from being profitable to losing money."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu warned Jiang Chen with sternness.</br>
</br>
The reason why she said so much was so that Jiang Chen wouldn't be blinded by Future Technology's current high profitability and sign a multi-billion deal without processing things in his head.</br>
</br>
Without a doubt, from the company's expansion perspective, Xia Shiyu had the right foresight. But Jiang Chen saw further compared to her since his perspective was not limited to the small Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"Revenue channel? I will take care of that, you can just take care of the operation…" Jiang Chen held his chin as he vaguely replied.</br>
</br>
Although it was not that virtual reality didn't exist, it still remained in the body sensing motion and visual replication stage. For example, a camera would capture user's action before it is fed back to the game. The VR glasses would then display it as a three-dimensional image in front of the user. It was incomparable to the virtual reality of the 22nd century, which directly connected the game to the nerve at the back of the person's neck. As long as you lie in the metal box, the entire head and body muscles would be sleeping, but the person's conscious would appear in the virtual world.</br>
</br>
Without the need for mechanical functions such as vibrations to mimic real feelings, the senses were directly simulated in the brain. There was no need to have a screen because it would be extraneous to form an image on the cornea. The virtual reality equipment from the 22nd century would connect directly to the nerve. By that time, it would no longer be a dream to close your eyes and play the game.</br>
</br>
Except the technology differential was too drastic. Jiang Chen himself was uncertain if he should bring the space elevator out or the virtual reality helmet out.</br>
</br>
"Okay, then I won't ask anymore regarding this. But as the president, you should be aware of the company's operations."</br>
</br>
"Haha, don't worry." Jiang Chen laughed confidently.</br>
</br>
Funny, there were so many wonderful things in the apocalypse, there was no need to worry about money. But he should think carefully about the next money making product. Perhaps he should ask Yao Yao or Du Yongkang to create a new software? But he didn't have any ideas yet.</br>
</br>
There was artificial intelligence, battery saver, mobile game, what else did smartphones lack?</br>
</br>
Just as he was zoning out, he saw a red box under the table.</br>
</br>
"What is that?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen curiously reached for the cookie-sized box, but Xia Shiyu jumped up as if she had her tail stepped on.</br>
</br>
She snatched the box away from Jiang Chen's hand, with a steaming face, she hid the box behind her back.</br>
</br>
But the more she tried to hide it, the more curious Jiang Chen became. What thing made the ice mountain standoffish beauty embarrassed like that?</br>
</br>
Could it be…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about it, the way he looked at Xia Shiyu turned lascivious. He narrowed his eyes. He was the only one to blame for being too perverted as he could relate anything to the sensual things in life.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, women are sensitive creatures. When she saw Jiang Chen's abnormal smile, Xia Shiyu first paused for a moment before she realized.</br>
</br>
"Get your mind out of the gutter! It's weightloss tea! Weightloss tea!"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu in embarrassment threw the box in Jiang Chen's lap. The red hue made her entire neck turn red and her teeth clenched in anger.</br>
</br>
[This bastard, what is he even thinking! Dammit!]</br>
</br>
"Weightloss tea? But you are not fat at all." Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu, confused.</br>
</br>
Her waist and legs were both skinny, weightloss, she should gain some weight…</br>
</br>
Wait, weightloss tea…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen seemed to have caught onto something. He closed his eyes and repeatedly chewed on the words.</br>
</br>
But Xia Shiyu didn't notice the odd look on Jiang Chen's face. Her cold face was completely warmed by her blushing expression. She buried her head, not speaking.</br>
</br>
[He said that I'm not fat?]</br>
</br>
[That means… He is pleased with my body?]</br>
</br>
The imagination of a girl in love was certainly wild. Even for a girl like Xia Shiyu with negative EQ could not escape the fate.</br>
</br>
"Butt… My butt got a bit bigger."</br>
</br>
With her finger twirling the tip of her hair, she used the decibel that only she could hear herself.</br>
</br>
But as she spoke, she was stunned, why did she tell him such embarrassing thing!</br>
</br>
With the bright redness of her face that was about to drip down, Xia Shiyu kept her head down, afraid to look at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't even notice how awkward she was nor did he hear her murmur.</br>
</br>
For an office lady, who worked long hours sitting in a chair, it was normal for her butt to grow some meat. But Xia Shiyu was okay since she was the type that could be blown away by the wind. Though it was still a woman's tendency to want to be beautiful, especially in front of someone she adored.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen clapped his hands and stood up. This scared Xia Shiyu who's imagination was running wild.</br>
</br>
"Hahahaha! I remember now! Fu*k, how did I forget about that!"</br>
</br>
Because of the lack of technical knowledge in this, he never treated it seriously. Now that he has given it some thought, that thing could generate more money than any software, and it would produce a stable stream of revenue.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen in bewilderment as he laughed hysterically. She was completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
She didn't know what just happened to him.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 343: The Creative Use of Nutrient Supply</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After he left with the words "I won't be back tonight," Jiang Chen eagerly ran out the door and left Xia Shiyu in complete shock.</br>
</br>
[Won't be back tonight? Where are you going to sleep?]</br>
</br>
[Also, didn't we say we're going shopping tonight?]</br>
</br>
With a bunch of questions in her head, Xia Shiyu realized it was too late to stop Jiang Chen as he was about to slam the door closed.</br>
</br>
She sighed and rested her forehead on her hand.</br>
</br>
When she sensed the coldness in her hand, she paused.</br>
</br>
She realized she was completely red.</br>
</br>
Disregarding whether Xia Shiyu had any reservations about his quick departure, Jiang Chen ran to a nearby hotel. He ignored the concierge's strange look and ran to the elevator with his key.</br>
</br>
After he locked the door, he lied down on the bed before he returned to the apocalypse and found Sun Jiao as he began to explain his intentions.</br>
</br>
"Nutrient supply?" Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen with short breaths. She was puzzled. "Don't you guys have plenty of food on the other side? Why would you need that?"</br>
</br>
Anyone with options wouldn't choose to drink the terrible-tasting nutrient supply on the wasteland. The meals at the mansion had fresh vegetables and frozen meat every day. In all of Fishbone base, only slaves and lower citizens would drink that.</br>
</br>
"Help people lose weight! Oh, no, it's to make a profit!" Jiang Chen said in excitement.</br>
</br>
"Lose weight?" Sun Jiao was full of doubt.</br>
</br>
There were hardly any fat people in the apocalypse - it was fortunate to have a full stomach in the first place, let alone having an excess of food, so losing weight was an interesting concept to Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
"Uh, it's hard to explain… There's an organic converter at the base, right? Can you take me so I can have a look?"</br>
</br>
Although she was skeptical about the benefits of the terrible tasting liquid, considering how eager Jiang Chen looked, she had no choice but to bring him to the Fishbone base warehouse.</br>
</br>
Based on Sun Jiao's words, the organic converter wasn't stored with the food but instead, it was stored with the steel and concrete. They passed by the Death Claw statue and arrived at the warehouse not far from the community center.</br>
</br>
They pushed open the warehouse, and the pungent smell of water desiccant blew into their faces. A gas cylinder boiler stood at the corner of the warehouse along with a bunch of green fruits. There were some wires connected to the organic converter, resembling a magnified version of a squeezer.</br>
</br>
The reason why poor people were so skinny in the apocalypse was mostly because of the ironically unnutritious nutrient supply boiler. Mutant meat and fruits are all dumped inside the device. When turned on, the particle membrane separated out protein, sugar, fat, and vitamins that could be absorbed by the human body. They were produced into liquid food that could be absorbed by humans.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sniffed as a weird smell entered his nostrils. He looked with a frown at the boiler. "Is this the organic converter?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Sun Jiao nodded then tilted her head and asked, "You sure people would be interested in it if you brought this thing to the other side?"</br>
</br>
"Definitely not this, something smells weird… Is the nutrient supply created by this really drinkable?"</br>
</br>
"That's the way the organic converter is. The weird smell is because of the filtered out contents like the toxic substances. So this area can't store food otherwise the entire room's contents would be contaminated," Sun Jiao said in defeat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded to signal his understanding then he looked at the fruits on the side, "This fruit is?"</br>
</br>
"This is mutated fruit - the double-headed cow really likes to eat it. Because of the high oxalic acid content, humans can't consume it directly, but it's not a bad ingredient to have in the nutrient supply. Combined with a small quantity of mutant meat, it can produce C-grade nutrient supply," Sun Jiao said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried the C-grade nutrient supply once - the sour taste was nowhere close to being good. As a product, taste was certainly important. If it ended up tasting like Han medicine, not a lot of people would buy it.</br>
</br>
After he thought for a moment, Jiang Chen asked, "If we use fresh meat or grain, would the produced nutrient supply reach level A?"</br>
</br>
"Use fresh food to produce nutrient supply? Are you crazy?" Sun Jiao said in shock.</br>
</br>
With fresh food who would eat this? Is this something an average person would do?</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I'm not crazy! Don't you facepalm - tell me the answer."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao face-palmed and sighed in defeat.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, although I never tried before, it's probably possible. To produce nutrient supply above B-grade, not only does it require strict ingredients, there is also a high requirement for the production equipment. I heard that Liuding Town has the equipment needd to produce nutrient supply above B-grade, but I never purchased that before. Aside from the better taste, I can't tell the difference between C-grade and E-grade. It may be more nutritious? Who knows. Even if it is S-grade nutrient supply, it doesn't taste as good as real food."</br>
</br>
"There's S-grade nutrient supply?" Jiang Chen in shock.</br>
</br>
"Of course. S-grade nutrient supply was the nutrient supply produced before the war. I heard it was a military necessity. But in peaceful times, no one would eat that," Sun Jiao said.</br>
</br>
"Where do you find the production equipment for the S-grade nutrient supply?" Jiang Chen desperately wanted to know the answer.</br>
</br>
"I don't know… But the scientists at the fallout shelter should know."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smacked his head.</br>
</br>
How could he forget the survivors from fallout shelter No.27? With so many scientists, there must be a few who would know. There was no need to create S-grade nutrient supply - he could just create his own custom version.</br>
</br>
At this thought, Jiang Chen immediately headed to the warehouse door. He wanted to fly to camp 27 right now to take care of it.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen head for the door, Sun Jiao paused and tried to convince him to stay, "Eh? You want to go now? It's almost dark… Why don't you wait until tomorrow?"</br>
</br>
As she said that, her face felt a burning sensation.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and saw the red cloud on Sun Jiao's beautiful face. She obviously knew the meaning of her words as her face met his smirk.</br>
</br>
He hugged Sun Jiao's waist and blew gently into her ear.</br>
</br>
"Then I'll go tomorrow."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, with two dark circles, Jiang Chen took the helicopter to camp 27. When he got off, he looked for Xu Lu who was working in the command center.</br>
</br>
Because all survivors' abilities were registered and recorded, when she heard then't purpose of Jiang Chen's trip, Xu Lu quickly managed to select a few people and called them to the office.</br>
</br>
When they heard they were being asked to see Jiang Chen, the survivors were ecstatic.</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
There was no need to ask! It must be because their abilities were going to be used for something - likely a project team. Although it wasn't bad to live on the surface, it couldn't compare to living in the fallout shelter. Who didn't want to live a happy life with their family?</br>
</br>
Even if Jiang Chen's requirements were strict, they would still accept without hesitation.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 344: Sorry</br>
</div></br>
In order to lose a lot of weight, a lot of young girls with great family backgrounds only ate one meal a day, with some going to the extent of only eating an apple for their single meal. Jiang Chen wondered: wouldn't they starve to death?</br>
</br>
Losing weight by dieting wasn't only harmful to the body, it was also hard to maintain. This was conveyed by the joke, "When fat people are losing weight, the more they try, the more fat they get."</br>
</br>
Imagine this, if a weight loss medicine appeared on the market – no, it would be called low-calorie food! Two test tubes a day would ensure you were full without any damage to your body. If you drank it continuously for half a year, it would guarantee you would be as thin as the refugees in the ghetto… Of course, no one would want to be as thin as that. Normal people would stop drinking it after a month.</br>
</br>
The nutrient supply from the apocalypse wasn't fit for marketing to the modern world. Since it was a product, the taste was definitely a significant consideration. Also with concern for food safety, the ingredients and nutrient value would have to be redesigned.</br>
</br>
For the improved version of the nutrient supply, Jiang Chen made a few requests to the five researchers.</br>
</br>
The first was that it had to taste good, then it had to be healthy. Third, the calories had to be low enough and fourth, the ingredients had to be easy to gather and suitable for large-scale farming. Finally, the recipe had to be finished within a month. For each day they were ahead of schedule, the researchers could spend a month longer in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Faced with Jiang Chen's demands, the five researchers all raised their chests in confidence and promised to finish the recipe within the allocated time.</br>
</br>
When the five people left the command center, they all had cheerful smiles on their faces as they couldn't wait to return to the fallout shelter to start the experiment.</br>
</br>
"Once they have results, immediately report back to the base." Before Jiang Chen left, he urged Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
"Yes, Boss!" Xu Lu responded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Then that's all… Also, did Han Junhua give up?"</br>
</br>
Xu Lu shook her head with embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Not yet."</br>
</br>
"I see…"</br>
</br>
[What a stubborn person; why can't she just listen? PAC already flew lightyears away - what's there to be stubborn about?]</br>
</br>
"Do you want to go see her?" Xu Lu asked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… Might as well." Jiang Chen said casually.</br>
</br>
He wanted to personally ask if she changed her mind and display his genuineness. Then, depending on the circumstances, he would see if she needed a more intensive lesson before he left… Jiang Chen thought he was a wicked person.</br>
</br>
A smile surfaced on Xu Lu's face and she nodded gently.</br>
</br>
"Okay, please follow me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed Xu Lu into the cold basement. The patrol at the door saluted to him and opened the door for them before closing it.</br>
</br>
</br>
Han Junhua sat quietly on the bed and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He could sense that the instant she saw him, a hint of fright flashed across her pupils. Although it quickly vanished, it left a deep impression on his mind.</br>
</br>
With the calm and collected look she put up, he felt a sense of guilt for some reason.</br>
</br>
Maybe because he still had the conscience of someone from the modern world?</br>
</br>
"… You can leave for now," Jiang Chen said lightly.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Xu Lu nodded before she left the basement.</br>
</br>
When the steel door closed shut, the basement returned to silence.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, it was Han Junhua who first broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"What perverted thing do you plan to do to me today?"</br>
</br>
Her voice was distant and cold - it sounded like it could freeze a person without any hint of emotion.</br>
</br>
"I…" Jiang Chen opened his mouth, but he chose to close it.</br>
</br>
He came in with a script in mind, but with that face as calm as still water, he didn't know what to say.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed and threw out the words he prepared beforehand as he gently said, "Sorry."</br>
</br>
Surprise flashed through Han Junhua's eyes. There was also a trace of confusion, but it vanished instantly.</br>
</br>
"Although I'm not seeking your forgiveness, I still want to apologize for what I did."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen admitted he did all those despicable things because he thought with his lower body and put his wicked thoughts into action. He didn't even think it was wrong afterwards. She was his captive - it was his choice to determine how he treated her.</br>
</br>
If a person stayed too long in a society without rule and boundaries, the person would subconsciously be withered by the environment. Jiang Chen realized a long time ago that the longer he stayed in the apocalypse, the more he thought as a person from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
If it was the old him, although he lacked some boundaries, he would never r*pe or force people.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, she said calmly with a peaceful tone.</br>
</br>
"Who apologizes to their captive?"</br>
</br>
"… Perhaps." Jiang Chen smiled bitterly. He shook his head and left the basement.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua stared at Jiang Chen's back. She didn't speak.</br>
</br>
But inside her dark pupils, she looked completely.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
He returned to the hotel and checked out before he headed to Xia Shiyu's apartment.</br>
</br>
But when he knocked on the door, he realized there was no response inside. He called Xia Shiyu before he realized it was 10. She went to work a long time ago.</br>
</br>
On the phone, Xia Shiyu didn't ask where Jiang Chen went the night before; she just briefly explained how to get Future International's building and hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Her meaning was obvious. She wanted the missing-in-action president to take some time to come to the company. Regarding the construction bidding, they only managed to discuss it halfway before Jiang Chen ran out - it was the perfect opportunity to finish the last bit.</br>
</br>
To save time, Jiang Chen took a taxi and headed on his way. He played with his phone.</br>
</br>
But then, a number called.</br>
</br>
&lt;Wang Zhiyong&gt;</br>
</br>
When he saw the name, Jiang Chen was silent for a moment, but he still picked up.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me." Wang Zhiyong's voice was bitter.</br>
</br>
"… If you're calling on behalf of your uncle, you don't need to say anything," Jiang Chen said lightly.</br>
</br>
"I know you would say this." Wang Zhiyong sighed.</br>
</br>
After a two second pause, Wang Zhiyong used a pleading voice.</br>
</br>
"Could you not just let this one go?"</br>
</br>
He never asked for favors from his friends - he didn't want to go to the trouble. But this time it was for his family, not for himself. Although he was reckless at times, he always stood with his family.</br>
</br>
"You can ask Wang Linhua - did you consider letting this one go when he plotted against me that night?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhiyong fell into silence.</br>
</br>
After a lengthy pause, he let out a long sigh.</br>
</br>
"I see… Sorry, this one is my fault."</br>
</br>
The day when he came out of the police station, he didn't notify Jiang Chen that the Wang family was plotting against his Future Technology, even though he knew a few details of their plan at the time. When he compared his family to his friends, there was no doubt which one was more important.</br>
</br>
"No problem. It's not your fault."</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Jiang Chen hung up.</br>
</br>
He didn't have a lot of friends, and now there was one less…</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to put away his phone, his phone began to ring again.</br>
</br>
It was an international call.</br>
</br>
&lt;Zhang Yapin&gt;</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 345"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 345: A surprising reward</br>
</div></br>
The moment the phone call went through, Zhang Yapin lowered his voice and roared at him.</br>
</br>
"God, what did you do!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen first paused then asked in surprise, "Oh, you're a Christian?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin took a moment to think before he roared in anger again.</br>
</br>
"Is this the time to discuss this right now? New Moon Island, country F fishers, pirates? Are you crazy?!"</br>
</br>
After Zhang Yapin finished venting, he took short, panting breaths before finally regaining his breath after a long time. Jiang Chen noticed the phone kept ringing on his side, but he didn't pick up.</br>
</br>
"Are you calm now?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The calm Zhang Yapin forced a laugh, leaned back into his chair, and continued.</br>
</br>
"… Almost in despair."</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen said lightheartedly.</br>
</br>
"Just go read any newspaper from country F! Three fishing boats that accidentally entered Xin territory were attacked and maliciously sunk by the Xin military. All 11 fishers died… Don't tell me you didn't know about this."</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k, sunk them?] Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't think of sinking the three fishing boats. He just ordered Ivan to take care of things and confiscate the fishing boats as pirate boats. He didn't think the Slav had such a bad temper. He wondered what they did to enrage him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wouldn't admit his mistake as he tried to rebuke: "Who would buy the newspaper printed by them?"</br>
</br>
They deserved to be sunk. Is a military base a place you can just wander around? Delaying the building of military infrastructure, in any country, would cost a few artilleries at least.</br>
</br>
"It won't be long before the world knows. BBC's reporter is outside and being rowdy, saying he wanted to get ahead of his colleagues," Zhang Yapin said wearily as he rubbed his sore eyes.</br>
</br>
After a lengthy silence, Jiang Chen asked in a small voice, "Did Ivan… really kill them all?"</br>
</br>
"All killed."</br>
</br>
"Where are the sunken ships?" Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"The diplomat of country F is currently negotiating with me to start the recovery as early as possible…"</br>
</br>
"Who's leading this?" Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised.</br>
</br>
"They want them to lead the investigation of the incident. Their coastal guard ships already crossed the border, but your people forced them back… That's your own troops, do you really have no idea?" Zhang Yapin asked with skepticism.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at his phone and glared at it; there were two missed calls.</br>
</br>
He was at the apocalypse yesterday, how could he pick up the phone?!</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I didn't have signal yesterday."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin rubbed his temples wearily. "What should we do?"</br>
</br>
"Other than recovering the sunken ships, what else did they ask?"</br>
</br>
"They demanded us to arrest the murderers and prosecute them under the law, or else they reserved all options for the situation to escalate."</br>
</br>
</br>
Murderers?</br>
</br>
When he heard this word, Jiang Chen was instantly unhappy. He didn't notice Zhang Yapin's last word as he cursed.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, if they sunk, they sunk! They were in Xin territory; did they have any excuse to trespass illegally?"</br>
</br>
"Removing illegally trespassing fishers would only require a water gun. More severe cases would warrant bumping their boat, but using rockets is unprecedented! Zhang Yapin said bitterly in a helpless voice.</br>
</br>
"In military zones, unique circumstances should be treated with caution; who knows if they were spies or not?"</br>
</br>
With a frown, Jiang Chen deliberated for a moment. He glanced at the driver beside him as he lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"I can't really talk right now… But all in all, just make sure you remain firm that the boats were all pirate boats. Pointing at the deer and saying it's a horse, do you understand? If you don't, Baidu it. I know you've never been to Hua, but don't forget things passed on by the ancestors. Remain calm throughout the recovery process. Just drag it on until I come back to take care of it. Okay?"</br>
</br>
"Okay…"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin's response was without energy.</br>
</br>
He just became the president. The domestic situation had yet to be stabilized before a foreign affairs problem arose. The country F president spoke with him yesterday on the phone with a strong stance, seeming somewhat arrogant. Country F had a population of 100 million, while Pannu only had twenty thousand. The 500 times differential didn't give him a lot of courage to carry a strong attitude. With a current enlisted force of 120 thousand, it was six times Xin's entire population. If there was a military conflict, Xin would be the one losing – although Jiang Chen thought otherwise.</br>
</br>
"Then that's all, bye."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Half an hour of driving later, the car arrived in Kowloon. After they turned a street, among the skyscrapers, Jiang Chen instantly saw the name "Future International."</br>
</br>
He threw down two bills, got out of the car, and took out the phone to call Ivan.</br>
</br>
As Ivan picked up, Jiang Chen rushed to ask him:</br>
</br>
"Did you kill them all?"</br>
</br>
"All killed… I'm willing to accept the punishment." Ivan was straightforward.</br>
</br>
"You didn't do anything wrong. The border must be protected!... But this incident might be a bit problematic so remain calm and wait for me to return," Jiang Chen said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Ivan said.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Xin's national defense contractor, Celestial Trade Company, sank three fishing boats and forcefully removed country F's coastal guards with force.</br>
</br>
Contrary to the shock and anger in country F, the Xin citizens were all ecstatic as if they had all taken drugs. Even for the people who had reserved opinions about Celestial all began to turn to their favor.</br>
</br>
To sum it up in one sentence, it was fu*king amazing.</br>
</br>
The conflicts between the two societies had existed a long time before.</br>
</br>
When president Edward ruled Pannu Islands, he only lived the lavish life with Johnny - he didn't care about the lives of the fishermen at all. How much tax did the fishermen pay? Was it enough to pay for one of his meals?</br>
</br>
There were no steel guard ships in Pannu Islands - only a few fishing boats served as a replacement. The low military budget was all allocated to the land force to suppress dissident voices within the country.</br>
</br>
Therefore, although Pannu Islands possessed a significant amount of sea territory, their control over the sea was practically zero. Not to say that F country fishers or even New Guinea citizens could enter their territory to steal fish, but New Guinea was much less ruthless compared to country F. Not only did they steal their fish, but they also bullied the local fishermen.</br>
</br>
The Pannu fishermen all hated those F citizens deep in their bones. Because of economic limitations, Pannu fishermen's fishing boats were inferior compared to those of the F country fishermen. If they bumped into each other, the Pannu ships would be the one to sink. Therefore, when they actually fought for fish, they had to avoid them, even if it was in their own territory.</br>
</br>
Therefore, that was why even with the vast fishing resources near New Moon Island, there wasn't a single Xin fishing boat.</br>
</br>
It was certainly not the most thrilling feeling.</br>
</br>
But Celestial's actions were like a slap on the thugs' faces.</br>
</br>
The attitudes of the Xin citizens to Celestial Trade Company instantly changed from "outside interfering force" to the "protector of people." Before, there wasn't a lot of response to Celestial's recruitment, but after this event, the recruitment site had a long line up.</br>
</br>
The sharp domestic problem immediately turned to face the rest of the world. The issues of land compensation, whether the development of the tourism sector would continue, and the restructuring of the government were all shifted to the back of everyone's mind because currently, all Xin people faced a common enemy.</br>
</br>
It was country F.</br>
</br>
The result was surprising. Jiang Chen didn't even consider it at the time.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 346: Evaluation of Bid</br>
</div></br>
As the president of Future International, Jiang Chen left everything to Xia Shiyu to take care of.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had an excellent background; she was a top graduate from a renowned program at Wanghai University. Her knowledge and abilities were far superior compared to ordinary people. Although the jump from being the store manager of a clothing store to the CEO of a global tech company was rather massive, she still used her shrill shoulders to lift everything. She studied how to manage a company while she applied this knowledge through the daily operations of Future Internationl.</br>
</br>
Till now, even if she encountered some difficulties along the way, there had been no major problems in Future Technology's operations. Her abilities had to be commended as Jiang Chen knew he wouldn't be able to manage such a massive company himself.</br>
</br>
It had been a while since Jiang Chen showed up. When everyone saw the missing-in-action president appear at the office, all the employees were shocked as if the Sun had risen from the west.</br>
</br>
There were familiar faces and new faces among the employees. Not everyone chose to relocate to Xiangjiang, but Jiang Chen rewarded the employees who followed him. All of them were either promoted based on their abilities or given a raise.</br>
</br>
After he took a tour of the company, Jiang Chen was surprised to see he could still put a name to the majority of the people, such as the Future 1.0 project manager Ning Huajian or the bold girl Su Mengqi from the company dinner.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't interfere with their work after he greeted the people he knew. He then headed to Xia Shiyu's office.</br>
</br>
She was dressed in a set of professional attire with her black hair curled up at the back of her head. A piece of hair dropped down from the side, reflecting the gentleness of the sun. When Jiang Chen came in, Xia Shiyu was reading documents. She sat straight up with her eyes focused; she had a tranquil but dignified vibe when she worked.</br>
</br>
She noticed Jiang Chen come in as she put down the pen in her hand and looked up.</br>
</br>
"You're here. Feel free to sit."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
He sat on the sofa across from Xia Shiyu's desk. Jiang Chen scanned the thick pile of documents on the table as an embarrassed expression appeared on his face. A lot of these things should've been the responsibility of the president, but everything was piled onto her.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for working so hard."</br>
</br>
"It's okay."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu tucked some of her hair behind her ear. She got up, picked up the laptop, and sat down beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"These are all construction visualizations. The spreadsheet on the side contains cost estimates I organized. Although I understand your intention to be a free owner, as the president, you should be involved in the bidding process. Look at this one first…"</br>
</br>
</br>
As she explained, she scrolled through the screen and led Jiang Chen through all the documents.</br>
</br>
To gain the ten billion contract, all the major international construction companies spent their effort creating the most brilliant visualization. Not only did they use 3D modeling to demonstrate every detail of the construction, they even built the 3D aerial view of the four constructed islands.</br>
</br>
After spending an entire afternoon on his selection, Jiang Chen finally chose a Dutch construction company named BMA. The company was previously involved in the development of Maldives' tourism project. Their experience on island construction was extensive. This was demonstrated especially well with their 3D visualization that could be described as art. The second Jiang Chen saw it; he was captured by the design philosophy.</br>
</br>
The harmonious fusion of technology and nature was demonstrated flawlessly in BMA's design philosophy. While they retained the natural beauty of Pannu islands, their bold technology design provided the best experience for tourists.</br>
</br>
Most noticeable was the transparent "bubble hotel" that was just like a balloon attached to a post. With the attachment of an air pipeline, tourists could move the bubbles anywhere between the sea level and the hundred-meter-deep ocean based on their desires. They could also choose to fix the room or allow the room to freely flow along with the waves, dance with the colorful tropical fish and sleep listening to gentle grace of the sea. With the help of technology, this allowed tourists to completely immerse themselves in the beauty of nature. Jiang Chen was instantly hooked by this design.</br>
</br>
The cost of 8.7 billion USD wasn't low by any means, but if BMA could really transform his backyard – Pannu Islands – into the jewel on the visualization, Jiang Chen didn't mind spending the money.</br>
</br>
Although Xia Shiyu recommended Jiang Chen to consider his options for a few more days, he still went through with the decision. There was no point reconsidering it no matter how long he looked. Instead, he just left it to his instincts. Since the companies invited to bid were world-class, BMA was among the best, without a doubt.</br>
</br>
Another reason he was so hasty was because he had to return to Xin immediately.</br>
</br>
After they finished the bidding review, it was already six in the evening.</br>
</br>
By that time, aside from employees working overtime, there weren't a lot of people in the building. After they left the building, Xia Shiyu sped up while Jiang Chen followed her as they walked to the company's garage.</br>
</br>
With the door open, Xia Shiyu subconsciously looked around before she sat inside. Jiang Chen gave her a strange look before he took a seat.</br>
</br>
With his seat belt on, Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly, "Do you have anything to do tonight?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu raised her eyebrows, puzzled by the question, "No."</br>
</br>
"Then why did you walk so fast? It looked like you had something to do."</br>
</br>
As she heard this, Xia Shiyu's eyes widened.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, it's not good for the employees to see us being so close together. Since we're both single… If rumors spread, it would decrease work efficiency… All in all, that situation wouldn't be ideal."</br>
</br>
She hastily shifted her gears as she attempted to start the car.</br>
</br>
[It's not that bad to enter a car together, it could just be a woman giving her coworker a ride…] Jiang Chen ridiculed her in his mind.</br>
</br>
Although he couldn't see her face from the back, with the light outside, Jiang Chen noticed her neck turning red.</br>
</br>
"You forgot to press the clutch." Considering how listless Xia Shiyu was, Jiang Chen reminded her in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"I... I know!"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu turned around and gave Jiang Chen a hard stare as her feet forcefully stepped on the gas…</br>
</br>
It was indeed a thrilling journey.</br>
</br>
He didn't know what Xia Shiyu was thinking as she kept driving like a madwoman. A few times, she almost scratched the car in front of her. Jiang Chen stared at the steering wheel in her hands on high alert as he prepared to take the wheel in any unexpected situation.</br>
</br>
But what Jiang Chen didn't know was that if he hadn't stared at her like that, Xia Shiyu might not have been so nervous...</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 347"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 347: I don’t dislike her</br>
</div></br>
When they got off the car, both of them simultaneously felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu went to the door and took out her key, pretending to be calm, but before she could open the door, she dropped it on the ground.</br>
</br>
"Why don't I just go sleep outside?" With how nervous Xia Shiyu looked, Jiang Chen made this proposal in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
[I'm just crashing at your place; we're not doing anything naughty. Why are you so nervous?! You're making me nervous too.]</br>
</br>
"No, no need. It's too much trouble."</br>
</br>
[No, no, it's probably more convenient…] Jiang Chen said in his mind.</br>
</br>
As she finally lined the key up with the lock, Xia Shiyu seemed to be battling with something internally. She finally pushed the door open with one foot and stiffly stepped into the house.</br>
</br>
[Everything was fine during the day…] Jiang Chen ridiculed her in his mind as he stared at Xia Shiyu's back.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed her inside as he was dragged to the spare bedroom.</br>
</br>
The layout of the bedroom was feminine. It looked like where Ayesha stayed when she was protecting Xia Shiyu before. The sheets had the smell of sunshine; they were clearly hung out to dry outside not long ago.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, with a rigid look, threw Jiang Chen a set of spare keys before she hastily left the bedroom. She didn't have the fluidity she had when she first invited Jiang Chen to crash at her place.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and sat on the bed. He took out his phone and called his parents and Ayesha separately.</br>
</br>
His parents were enjoying their time on Coro Island. Not only did they live in a mansion, Jiang Chen also hired two caretakers to care of them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Jianguo enjoyed fishing before, but since the river near their old place was too populated to fish and Fanyang Lake was too far away from home, he wasn't able to engage in his hobby. Now that he lived near the sea, it was possible to fish only a couple steps away, so he picked his hobby back up. He spent all day fishing with Carter from morning to night.</br>
</br>
In their conversation, Jiang Jianguo kept bragging to his son about how big the fish he caught were. Although they tasted salty, when they were mixed with ginger and garlic sauce, they tasted surprisingly good.</br>
</br>
As to his mom, Li Xuemei, other than occasionally heading out to the sea with Jiang Jianguo, she spent the majority of time homemaking and gardening. Ayesha visited her sometimes to learn the secrets to Han cuisine.</br>
</br>
Regarding the beautiful foreign daughter-in-law, Li Xuemei absolutely adored her. Not only was she courteous, but she was also virtuous; it was hard to find someone as good as she was. Especially with Ayesha's earnestness when she asked what Jiang Chen liked to eat, Li Xuemei was even more delighted as she kept telling her husband how lucky Jiang Chen was.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although they weren't married yet, the two elders all treated her like she was part of the family.</br>
</br>
The first phone call lasted for an entire hour before his dad hung up in fear an exorbitantly high phone bill.</br>
</br>
The second phone call was rather short since Ayesha never spoke too much. But from her concise words, Jiang Chen still felt her deep affection as well as longing from hundreds of miles away.</br>
</br>
"… Remember to take care of yourself, I'll be back in a few days."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Ayesha responded gently.</br>
</br>
"That's all, I'm going to hang up."</br>
</br>
"Wait," Ayesha abruptly said.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Is there something else?" Jiang Chen said in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Did you figure out Xia Shiyu yet?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost choked on his own spit when he heard these words from the other side of the phone.</br>
</br>
"Ahem? What 'figure her out'? Where did you learn this from?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head as she continued, "I didn't use this phrase properly? I saw it in a drama."</br>
</br>
She previously enjoyed UA drama before, but to understand the mysterious "mother and daughter-in-law relationship," she specifically watched a few Han shows. Although she didn't quite understand, it dramatically helped with her vocabulary.</br>
</br>
"Watch less of that drama…" Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll stop watching," Ayesha responded mildly.</br>
</br>
"Also, did you say something to Xia Shiyu? I think she has been acting a bit strange." Jiang Chen recalled when he first saw Xia Shiyu off the plane; he could only come to one conclusion. It must be Ayesha who told Xia Shiyu something.</br>
</br>
In the two months when Jiang Chen was overseas, Ayesha stayed with Xia Shiyu. Jiang Chen didn't know what the two spoke about, but based on the fact that Ayesha saved Xia Shiyu's life and even lost her own, there shouldn't have been any conflicts between them. But because of Xia Shiyu's affection to him, as well as the damage of that kiss….</br>
</br>
"She said she won't admit defeat." It was a rare occasion when Ayesha didn't answer Jiang Chen directly.</br>
</br>
"She won't admit defeat? Wait, what exactly did you say to her?" Jiang Chen said, sensing a slight headache coming on.</br>
</br>
"Ummm," Ayesha was hesitant, but she finally opened her mouth, "I admitted our relationship to her."</br>
</br>
[No wonder…] Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
No wonder Xia Shiyu looked at him oddly when he first got off the plane and invited him to live at her place; that was unlike the Xia Shiyu who always put on a cold face in front of anyone.</br>
</br>
"Sorry." Like a kitty that accidentally broke a cup, Ayesha lowered her head as she said with a fast tone and small voice, "I only thought… since she really liked you, there's no need to restrain herself. I don't mind sharing with her and I don't plan to oppose her…"</br>
</br>
To be honest, that kiss in the car and admitting the truth to Xia Shiyu were all intended to "push her." But things turned out opposite to her intentions - Xia Shiyu's first and second reaction were both surprising to Ayesha. Xia Shiyu seemed to have interpreted her actions as acts of aggression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately interrupted her, "No, no, no, you don't need to apologize; our relationship isn't something that needs to be hidden."</br>
</br>
"But… She seemed to have misinterpreted something." Ayesha's voice still had a hint of guilt.</br>
</br>
"It's not that she misinterpreted something. How should I say this? The Han culture is a bit different from your own; she won't agree to it."</br>
</br>
"Then do you like her?" Ayesha asked seriously.</br>
</br>
When he heard her sudden question, Jiang Chen stopped.</br>
</br>
After he thought seriously for half a minute, he slowly said, "I … don't dislike her."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen admited he was a greedy person, and also a selfish person.</br>
</br>
But he didn't plan to explain himself.</br>
</br>
"I will help you," Ayesha said earnestly.</br>
</br>
"There's no need to help me... Just go with the flow. To be honest, I don't even know myself how I'll treat her. Don't sleep too late; good night."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, good night." When she sensed that Jiang Chen didn't want to continue talking, Ayesha ended the topic.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone and lied on the bed.</br>
</br>
"Woosh-"</br>
</br>
He let out a long sigh. Jiang Chen turned and stared at himself in the mirror.</br>
</br>
He grinned. When he looked at his smile in the mirror, Jiang Chen restrained the desire to smile bitterly.</br>
</br>
[Whatever, I'll just sleep early. There's still a meeting with Dalmer Corporation tomorrow.]</br>
</br>
While battling his thoughts, Jiang Chen didn't even take off his clothes before he drifted to sleep.</br>

It was Xia Shiyu who knocked on his door to wake him up.</br>
</br>
She was accustomed to the nine to five routine. So every day, she wakes up early to cook breakfast. She placed the scrambled egg, toast, and milk on the dinner table. When they were eating breakfast, Jiang Chen's heart pumped a little faster while he watched her in an apron.</br>
</br>
He didn't know she had such a virtuous side.</br>
</br>
He remembered back in university that one of his friends who always bragged about how many girlfriends he had always said that a single girl's life is not always the tidiest. It was normal for them to clean up in a few months. But from Xia Shiyu, Jiang Chen didn't see any carelessness.</br>
</br>
Their conversation during the day was normal, not the slightest bit of awkwardness existed from yesterday.</br>
</br>
After breakfast, the two headed to the office together. She looked okay, but from the thick makeup covering her eye bags, Jiang Chen could see that she didn't have the best night of sleep.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The meeting with Daimler corporation took place in Future International. The representative they sent was from Europe and had arrived last night. The representative was rumored to be a "person of importance". Before the representative arrived, Jiang Chen was guessing who it could be, but he ended up seeing a familiar face.</br>
</br>
"Haha! Hello, Mr. Jiang, we meet again."</br>
</br>
With fluent Chinese, Carmen Rothschild opened his arm with a warm smile and walked in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Carmen? This is a surprise, you personally came to China."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the man in front of him with surprise before he quickly regathered himself and opened his arm.</br>
</br>
Although it was weird to hug a man, out of respect, Jiang Chen gave him a manly hug.</br>
</br>
"Of course, Daimler corporation values the partnership with your company, the same goes for the Rothschild family," Carmen said earnestly.</br>
</br>
[He shouldn't have figured out the GPS tracker… ] Carmen thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
[What is this guy's intention?] Jiang Chen was puzzled too.</br>
</br>
The USB Carmen gave Jiang Chen last night had a GPS tracker inside. Yao Yao, who only specialized in programming, although she had some abilities in electronic device modification, didn't receive any anti-surveillance training, so naturally, she didn't notice it. If it were Ayesha, the GPS tracker would not escape her eyes. It was all about specialties.</br>
</br>
"My honor, you are also an important partner for Future International." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The two sat down around the conference table. The bodyguard following Carmen stayed outside the room. The two technical experts in suits and an assistant followed inside. Xia Shiyu took out the contract and placed it in front of Jiang Chen, then stood beside him.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just as the meeting started, Carmen couldn't wait and immediately said, "Let's get straight to the point shall we"</br>
</br>
"As you wish."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and signaled the employee to place the brief containing the USB and the chip in front of Carmen.</br>
</br>
On this trip, Carmen brought the technical experts from the company. The contract stated that the product must be delivered by May. To be honest, when Daimler's programmers heard that Future Technology not only tackled the technical barriers in the smart driving system, they also managed to complete it within a month before the deadline. They were so shocked that their eyes almost popped out.</br>
</br>
Everyone had the same thought, "Is Future Technology tricking them?"</br>
</br>
The Germans' rigorous technical skills were renowned worldwide. They could not let a single mistake exist during the quality assurance process. Because of their skepticism to Future Technology's ability, the board sent the two technical experts responsible for the primary control system over to audit the smart driving program.</br>
</br>
If the innovative technology had any problems, Daimler corporation's loss was not as simple as compensation, the reputation they've built over the years would also suffer greatly as a result. On the other side, if this triggered people's fear for the autonomous driving vehicle, it would indeed cast a gloom over the future of smart cars. Because of their persistence to safety, it resulted in aborting the contract with the previous company.</br>
</br>
The two technical experts walked up. A man with a stern expression open the briefcase, and the other took out a laptop computer. They inserted the USB into the laptop and began to work.</br>
</br>
The conference room was quiet, there was only the sound of keys clicking and computer fan spinning.</br>
</br>
Carmen's arms were placed on the table with his eyes half-closed, but Jiang Chen noticed that he had his full attention on that computer screen. Xia Shiyu was still expressionless, but from her continuously moving eyes, Jiang Chen could clearly sense her unease.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was the most relaxed. He leaned back in his chair while waiting for the results to come out.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen noticed that the assistant behind Carmen was observing him. Jiang Chen gave him a friendly smile, but he looked away.</br>
</br>
The two technical experts' expression was turning more and more grave as they began to exchange opinions in a small voice.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu held her breath as her heart was pumping rapidly.</br>
</br>
It was a one billion dollar deal! Whether it was a success or failure, it would all depend on the words that came out of the two peoples' mouths.</br>
</br>
Finally, the two technical experts stood up. From their actions, the review was completed.</br>
</br>
"The result?"</br>
</br>
Carmen was more eager than Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The older looking technical expert nodded, then turned to Jiang Chen and said in English.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, your company's achievement in artificial intelligence is at the point worth praising and envying. Please allow me to apologize for my skepticism of your company's ability."</br>
</br>
While he said this, the technical expert bowed deeply to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry. As a technical expert, it is a virtue to dare to question," Jiang Chen replied with a calm tone.</br>
</br>
"Ahem." Carmen coughed.</br>
</br>
The technical expert realized his mishap and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
They were not in the lab, but the conference table.</br>
</br>
"Since our chief technical engineer has already verified the excellent performance of the software, then my trip is certainly worthwhile." Carmen stood up and smiled.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu felt relieved. She only noticed now that her palms were drenched in sweat.</br>
</br>
She looked at Jiang Chen as her eyes stopped on the smile laced with confidence.</br>
</br>
Her face felt hot as she looked away subtly.</br>
</br>
Seeing Carmen stand up, Jiang Chen also stood up with a smile and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"It's great working with you."</br>
</br>
"Haha, It's great to work with you too." Carmen also extended his right hand and shook with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
One billion dollars. Although it was small compared to the eight billion USD gap, it would certainly alleviate some of their financial pressures.</br>
</br>
But then, the corner of Jiang Chen's eyes caught the ring on his hand.</br>
</br>
His pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>
That is…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 349: A Massive Loan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
That shape, it's the Golden Apple!?</br>
</br>
How is that possible!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's first reaction was that he made a mistake. He wanted to confirm the shape of the ring, but Carmen already let his hand go. Because of the angle, he couldn't see the front of the ring.</br>
</br>
"After we finish the next round of auditing, the one billion will be transferred to your company's account. Of course, I trust that there are no other problems. To celebrate the success of our partnership, can I invite you to eat lunch with me?" Carmen smiled.</br>
</br>
"My honor." Jiang Chen humbly laughed as he hid his shock behind his laughter.</br>
</br>
The Golden Apple? Why?</br>
</br>
Could it be the Rothschild family and the Golden Apple have some hidden secrets? No… But that Golden Apple was inside the U-235 submarine, from the diary of the officer from the Third Reich. The Golden Apple was protected as the "last trump card" for the Third Reich. As a Jewish family, how could they have come into contact with this?</br>
</br>
Could it be that it was Hitler who robbed the Golden Apple away from them? No, that didn't make sense.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen felt strange.</br>
</br>
He suddenly realized that there was no point in being bothered by this.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whatever the empire had plotted, that part of the history has already gone by for 70 years. From the diary, he already confirmed that the possessor of the Golden Apple didn't know how to use it even at the last moment. Although the country may have received some technologies in the future, it still faded in the passage of time.</br>
</br>
Carmen didn't notice the irregularity on Jiang Chen's face as he warmly welcomed Jiang Chen to sit with him on his vehicle. The black bodyguard sat down in the driver seat, and his assistant sat in the passenger seat.</br>
</br>
Although the bodyguard didn't say anything for the entire trip, Jiang Chen still sensed a hint of danger from him.</br>
</br>
The guy was dangerous, at least on the same danger level as Nick. But contrary to Nick's silent and reserved state, this person didn't attempt to restrain his murderous vibe. He seemed like a war machine.</br>
</br>
The bodyguard of the Rothschild family was not a simple character.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat with Carmen in the back as they chatted and joked. Carmen spoke excellent Chinese, it was even better than Robert, and he was also very talkative.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long before the car arrived at its destination - Catalan restaurant.</br>
</br>
The place has quite a reputation in the upper-class society in Xiangjiang. From the delicate interior to the elegance of the waitress, it was easy to see how remarkable the restaurant was. From the respectful expressions the two waitresses at the door gave to Carmen, Jiang Chen suspected that the restaurant was an asset that belonged to the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
They entered a private room and ordered. It didn't take long before the servers brought up exquisite dishes. The two chatted while they ate.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Oh right, I remembered the bet we made. I still owe you a Maybach EX," Carmen said as he elegantly dissected the red shrimp from the Mediterranean.</br>
</br>
When they first signed the contract, Carmen and Jiang Chen made a bet. If Jiang Chen could deliver the product before May, he would gift Jiang Chen a Maybach EX – one of the only five vehicles worldwide.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
He almost forgot about it.</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Jiang free in October?" Carmen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Hard to say, is there something going on?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"The Mun Auto Exhibition is in October. Daimler corporation will be participating in the auto exhibition as a sponsor. The five Maybach EX will be displayed during the exhibition, and one of them will belong to you. If Mr. Jiang has the time, I would like to extend an invitation."</br>
</br>
"Even if I don't have time, I will make time to attend." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Carmen also smiled. To Jiang Chen accepting the invitation, he was pleased.</br>
</br>
As lunch was approaching the end, Carmen put down his utensils and wiped his mouth with the cloth.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of something else, does Mr. Jiang mind talking about business during lunchtime?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not, it is a tradition to talk about business over a meal."</br>
</br>
"Then I will be straightforward. Although the Rothschild family is in an expansive industry, our foundation still lies within the banking sector. I heard that Future International recently accepted a bid to the ten billion mega-project, would you guys need a little help?" Carmen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What kind of help?" Jiang Chen pretended to be intrigued and asked.</br>
</br>
"A loan of eight billion USD. A five-year term and an annual interest rate of 4.15%. Is Mr. Jiang interested in this loan?"</br>
</br>
4.15% of annual interest was lower compared to the annual interest of 4.28% offered by the other banks Jiang Chen contacted. Although it was just a 0.13% discrepancy, for a multi-billion dollar loan, even 0.1% of interest differential was a difference of more than ten million.</br>
</br>
"Eight billion USD?" Jiang Chen fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
"If Mr. Jiang has other opinions on the amount, we can discuss and adjust accordingly," seeing that Jiang Chen didn't give him a response, Carmen added.</br>
</br>
Eight billion was nowhere enough, but not a lot of banks were willing to lend Future Technology over ten billion USD. Even if a few banks agreed, they would also include additional terms such as listing out the exact purpose of the loan or an IPO on Nasdaq.</br>
</br>
Carmen came at just the right time to solve his problem, he deliberated for a few moment before he had an idea.</br>
</br>
"Eight billion would not be enough, is Mr. Carmen interested in a bigger deal?" Jiang Chen looked at Carmen with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Of course I am interested, Mr. Jiang's suggestion is?"</br>
</br>
"Thirty billion USD on a three-year term with 99% of Future Technology's share as collateral." Jiang Chen calmly unleashed a mega bomb.</br>
</br>
Carmen's eyes contracted as he held his breath, but he quickly regained his courteous expression.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was pleased with how his facial expression changed.</br>
</br>
He knew Carmen was tempted.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Carmen slowly said.</br>
</br>
"Okay, we are interested in artificial intelligence, and we are also optimistic about the future of your company in this field. But thirty billion is certainly not a small number. I am interested in how you would pay me back in three years? Future 1.0's current market penetration is already reaching its peak. With the current speed of technology shift, it will not be easy for your company to continue to increase its profitability.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was surprised; he didn't think Carmen would agree on this concisely. Just like he said, thirty billion was not a small number. Although the Rothschild family has built a massive business empire, money doesn't just simply grew on trees.</br>
</br>
"That would be my problem. But I have a feeling that it won't take me three years to repay the debt." Jiang Chen with a smile didn't directly respond to Carmen's question.</br>
</br>
It would still take fifty years before the first basic artificial intelligence is introduced to the world. Even with the diverse political background in the mix and the technology research speed of the modern world is faster compared to the apocalypse, the technological gap would still not be surpassed in the next ten years. Additionally, it will be hard because basic artificial intelligence was not merely an advancement in the IT field, it also comprised of sociology, psychology, biology and other areas of combined achievements.</br>
</br>
Before Jiang Chen can make the artificial intelligence database public, just in terms of the artificial intelligence field, Future 1.0 could not be surpassed. So Carmen's concern was excessive, at least in the short run.</br>
</br>
But just with Future Technology's current profitability, it would still be impossible to repay the loan in only three years. But did Jiang Chen lack methods to make money? He didn't have any concerns about repaying the loan.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen wasn't planning to disclose any information, Carmen didn't persist.</br>
</br>
"Then what about 4.5%? This the best offer I can give. Although the rate should be lower at a higher amount, it is at a condition where the party would have an equivalent amount of assets as collateral. To put it straightforwardly, your company currently does not have the assets for a thirty billion dollar collateral," Carmen said with caution.</br>
</br>
It was a risk he would take to lend the money to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"No problem, deal," Jiang Chen said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
Future International needed money, and a lot of it. He had already acquired the base as Pannu Islands. Thus all the growth must be accelerated. The technology from the wasteland would continue to fuel Future International's growth in the world.</br>
</br>
Although thirty billion was enough to purchase ten aircraft carriers, it was still a bit far away from completing the technological empire in his mind.</br>
</br>
The only thing that made Jiang Chen puzzled was, why Carmen… Or instead, the Rothschild family had so much confidence in him and was willing to lend him the money without wavering.</br>
</br>
It was thirty billion! Not the Zimbabwean currency, but the dollar!</br>
</br>
What made Jiang Chen feel strange was, from Carmen's dignified and courteous smile, he didn't see a slight trace of hesitation.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's confidence rose from his belief in the wasteland's technology, but what did Carmen count on? Even if it was the Rothschild family, how many billions did they have?</br>
</br>
Although he was thankful for Carmen's help, he felt something was off.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Obtaining the loan went surprisingly smooth, more smooth than Jiang Chen had imagined.</br>
</br>
Carmen was highly efficient as a contract in English and Chinese was sent to him the next day.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen had signed, the thirty billion USD loan was transferred from the British Rothschild bank to Future Technology's Swiss bank account. Carmen then flew back to Europe after the process was complete.</br>
</br>
Before he left, he handed Jiang Chen an invitation to the Mun Auto Exhibition and warmly exchanged departing words with him.</br>
</br>
Moments after Jiang Chen sent the wealthy European man away, he and Xia Shiyu left the airport.</br>
</br>
When they got on the car, Xia Shiyu couldn't wait another second before she asked him.</br>
</br>
"You really borrowed thirty billion USD?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, do you think I was joking?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
She looked into Jiang Chen's eyes earnestly as she let out a sigh of defeat, "Sigh… Okay, could you tell me your plan? How do you plan to be wasteful this time?"</br>
</br>
"Wasteful? You don't have to describe me like that," Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
But the way Xia Shiyu looked at him clearly expressed one message – "If this is not waste what is it?"</br>
</br>
"4.5% in annual interest, do you know how much money you would need to pay back in five years? 37.385 billion! In USD!" Xia Shiyu exclaimed emotionally.</br>
</br>
Forty billion USD was enough to purchase half of Baidu.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I used my personal shares as collateral, not the company's asset. Even if I can't afford it at that time, it won't affect you," Jiang Chen comforted her with a smile.</br>
</br>
She seemed displeased with Jiang Chen's explanation as she said coldly, "Who do you think I'm concerned for?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was slightly shocked as the smile on his face turned dubious, he teased her with a smirk, "Oh? So you are saying that you are worried about me?"</br>
</br>
As she heard his words, Xia Shiyu's aggressive stance quickly came to a halt as her face began to turn red.</br>
</br>
She looked away, started the vehicle, and stopped looking in his direction.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"I, I just don't want a new boss. I am pleased with the current work environment. Altho… Although the current president would make people frustrated at times, being able to relinquish control to people with ability is indeed worthy of being praised. If there is a new boss that pretends to know everything, it would be terrible.</br>
</br>
Her luscious black bangs happened to cover the side of her face. The faint yet rapid explanation took a lot of effort for Jiang Chen to understand.</br>
</br>
Seeing the usually cold Xia Shiyu worried about him greatly, Jiang Chen felt warmth swell up inside his body as he tried to comfort her.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, it's only thirty-something billion. The current market cap of Future Technology is ten billion, and I will double it in two years."</br>
</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's unreasonable flattering, Xia Shiyu chose to remain silent.</br>
</br>
With Xia Shiyu's distinctly unconfident look, Jiang Chen grinned and said, "Since you don't believe me, why don't we make a bet."</br>
</br>
"Make a bet? Okay. Once you're bankrupt, become an assistant of mine and let me order you around for a few years," Xia Shiyu joked.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen laughed, "But what if I win?"</br>
</br>
"Up to you." She combed her hair to the side as the tips of her mouth curved up.</br>
</br>
Although it was a bet, it was more like banter between friends as she didn't quite put this on her mind. Subconsciously, Xia Shiyu still believed that Jiang Chen would have a way to solve this problem. As to why she trusted him so dearly, she couldn't explain it either.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen mischievously smiled as he used a joking tone. "Up to me? Really?"</br>
</br>
She noticed Jiang Chen's smile and paused before her pale face was once again covered in a red hue.</br>
</br>
But she didn't say anything this time as she hid her expression behind her bang.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Upon the first ray of the morning sun, a plane appeared on top of Ber. With the help of the guide, the personal plane landed smoothly.</br>
</br>
A black Mercedes-Benz sedan stopped beside the airplane. A butler-looking old man walked out from inside and silently waited beside the car.</br>
</br>
The gangway car drove beside the plane as the hatch door quickly opened, a European first stepped out of the car.</br>
</br>
The old butler courteously bowed to Carmen, then he used German to greet him, "Welcome home, master Carmen."</br>
</br>
"It's been a while, Mr.Cides. Is my father doing well?" Carmen said pleasantly.</br>
</br>
"Very well. Old master has been drawn into sailing," the old butler said as he opened the door gracefully for him.</br>
</br>
"Sailing? Let me guess, he is in Florence now?"</br>
</br>
Florence is a coastal city in the Mediterranean. Carmen could vaguely recall they have family assets there.</br>
</br>
"No, he is in Germany, at the manor located in Balv." The butler shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Balv?"</br>
</br>
[Is that place near the sea?] Carmen slightly raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"The old master wants you to take some time to visit home."</br>
</br>
"Of course, I want to see him as well." Carmen sat in the back of the car with a smile.</br>
</br>
Johnson walked forward and sat beside Carmen.</br>
</br>
The butler only glanced at the bodyguard. He didn't say anything as he sat in the driver seat and served the duty of a driver.</br>
</br>
"Did you take out the tracker from the USB?" Carmen whispered.</br>
</br>
"Yes… It's hard to believe what technology that Han possesses," Johnson said in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Probably an advanced wireless blockage technology, who knows… Good thing they didn't find anything," Carmen said.</br>
</br>
Carmen did not suspect this point at all. He could determine from their eyes whether the words were real or fake. Without the proper training in fabricating lies, it would definitely not escape his eyes.</br>
</br>
The car arrived at the manor not soon after. The servers in the manor took Johnson to the guest room, and the old butler led Carmen to the backyard.</br>
</br>
They followed the stone path through the grass field. Then in a small wooden hut beside the man-made lake, Carmen saw his own father.</br>
</br>
Jocano Rothschild.</br>
</br>
The giant the ruled the financial world and the person that led the Rothschild out of the gloom of the Second World War and reached the peak after the cold war. He wore a plain shirt and sat beside the lake sawing a piece of wood.</br>
</br>
When his small son Carmen was born, he stepped down as the head of the family with his own brother taking over and began living his life in seclusion. Although he stopped asking about family affairs, no one in the family questioned his influence. Since the family that was hanging on the edge was dragged back from the abyss by him.</br>
</br>
And because of this, to his father's request, Carmen would treat the family business seriously. After getting off the plane, he headed straight to the manor without wasting a single second.</br>
</br>
But when he saw his father sawing wood, he was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1301: You Should Be Lowkey</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Bogota, the capital of Colombia; a city where beauty and sin coexisted.</br>
</br>
Maybe apart from emeralds, all foreigners shared the same impression of Colombia - drugs and guerrillas. In fact, in addition to these two things, Colombia also had robbers, thieves, homeless people, the typical South American passion, as well as the "lazy culture."</br>
</br>
Since the beginning of the Cold War, the guerrillas in this country were fighting against the pro-UA government and the UA. However, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the guerrillas that had lost external support quickly deteriorated, and now they have basically survived on hostages and drugs. Not only did their numbers decrease significantly, but they also moved completely from the city into the remote border mountains.</br>
</br>
It was impossible to describe in plain words the chaos in the country. A drama did depict some of these phenomena, and its name was the same as the theme it wanted to express, "Narcos".</br>
</br>
A girl in a cute skirt appeared in the rundown airport lobby.</br>
</br>
When she passed through the airport terminal, many passengers gazed at the girl with surprise and concern in their eyes.</br>
</br>
The reason why it was odd, other than her exquisite beauty by human standard, was the fact that she dared to come to this city without her parents. In particular, the lack of baggage in her hands created more suspicion and doubt and made people question if she had been separated from her parents.</br>
</br>
However, while they were concerned, no one stepped forward to help her.</br>
</br>
Even the police at the gate of the airport just glanced at her for a second before he continued to slouch on the chair and slumber.</br>
</br>
It was one in the morning.</br>
</br>
The street outside the airport was brightly lit, but there were very few people that could be seen.</br>
</br>
At this time, unless it was absolutely necessary, almost no one chose to venture out at night.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, shortly after she left the airport, she was being followed.</br>
</br>
Lilith followed the direction from the satellite map towards the embassy, ​​but soon noticed that someone was following her. Therefore, she decided to turn into an alley.</br>
</br>
When all the homeless people curled up in the alley saw such a beautiful girl appear, they all froze.</br>
</br>
For a glimpse second, they thought they saw an angel.</br>
</br>
But the next second, the angel in their eyes turned into green banknotes.</br>
</br>
Robbing tourists was a part-time job for almost all homeless Colombians, especially those near the airport.</br>
</br>
Just as they hesitated on whether they should rob, kidnap, or do something else, the faces that appeared at the alleyway made them change their mind. The expression that was previously ferocious, quickly changed as they hurriedly stood up and left the alley.</br>
</br>
In an instant, the entire alley was empty.</br>
</br>
Not because they saw the police.</br>
</br>
It was because they saw someone more terrifying than the police.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect your face to be so effective," The man with slightly dark skin joked.</br>
</br>
"Really? I think the name Torres works better," Another big man with an ugly face grinned.</br>
</br>
The man in the middle did not speak, but his greedy eyes repeatedly examined the calves under the girl's skirt.</br>
</br>
Abel Torres, a drug lord active in Central America, delivered tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of drugs to the UA through the Florida gangs every year.</br>
</br>
However, because of his considerable force in Colombia and Panama, he not only colluded with the local judicial department, but he also controlled a private armed force of about 500 people to protect his drug plantations and drug factories.</br>
</br>
Ironically, the weapons used by his men were basically bought from the UA. Especially the .20 caliber heavy machine gun and M224 mortar that he kept as part of his collection in his mansion. They were both gifts from an arms dealer named Robert a few years ago after a big deal.</br>
</br>
Apart from dollars and weapons, there was only one other thing he adored, which was, Caucasian girls around twelve-to-thirteen years old. The venting of his sexual desire and sadism on a pure body made him feel joy from the heart, and it was one of the reasons why he was listed in the top five of the CIB's Most Wanted List in South America.</br>
</br>
Torres kneeled in front of Lilith. He grinned and revealed his yellowish black teeth, then he started to laugh in a way that resembled a wolf.</br>
</br>
"Little girl, are you lost?"</br>
</br>
Lilith looked at the weird uncle in front of her without expression and did not speak.</br>
</br>
Torres did not feel angry about the fact that Lilith disregarded him, but he smiled patiently.</br>
</br>
"I'll take you to your mother, okay?"</br>
</br>
Lilith let out a long sigh, looked up in the sky, then muttered to herself.</br>
</br>
"This is really troublesome."</br>
</br>
After he was ignored two times, Abel Torres started to feel irritated. And the two men behind him began to shout a little impatiently.</br>
</br>
"What is this kid talking about?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know... Boss, I know this is your hobby, but we better not stay here too long. You know, the CIB is looking for us," The ugly giant said as he looked uncomfortably behind him.</br>
</br>
"True," Torres sighed and looked at Lilith, then he spoke to her in a sincere tone. "You'll have to sleep for a bit."</br>
</br>
Without warning, he revealed the taser in his hand.</br>
</br>
Based on how fluid his action was, it was obviously not his first time.</br>
</br>
The electric current crackled.</br>
</br>
However, to the three people's astonishment, the little girl in front of them just glanced coldly at the taser directed at her chest. She did not paralyze or pass out.</br>
</br>
Torres leaped up from the ground, then took two steps back in surprise. He looked back at the taser in his hand in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"How, how is this possible."</br>
</br>
On Lilith's expressionless poker face, there was no excess emotion as she looked at the men in front of her.</br>
</br>
And then she revealed a contemptuous look.</br>
</br>
It resembled someone looking down on the ants at their feet ...</br>
</br>
"Stand there, don't move!" A creepy feeling crawled into his head, and the big man immediately pulled out the pistol on his waist and pointed it at Lilith as he took two steps back nervously, "Boss, this girl is weird!"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, you don't need to say that!" Torres tossed the taser in his hand, then pulled out the pistol hidden in his pants and roared at Lilith, "Who are you? CIB? Or…"</br>
</br>
At this moment, three pistols were aimed at the girl standing in the middle of the alley.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult to identify the side at a disadvantage.</br>
</br>
However, the truth was just the opposite.</br>
</br>
"Well, go die."</br>
</br>
Tired of the noise the three men made, Lilith waved her hand.</br>
</br>
Literally, she just waved her hand.</br>
</br>
Countless metal thorns burst out without warning. Torres, who was still shouting half a second ago, was instantly turned into a sieve, his feet even left the ground.</br>
</br>
The two thugs behind him froze in place, and the stunned look gradually turned into trembling fear.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
With a scream that didn't match the size of his body, the big man crawled towards the alley exit behind him and fired the gun in his hand. The skinny man bolted out, without even firing a shot.</br>
</br>
Three shots.</br>
</br>
In a hurry, only one shot hit Lilith's forehead.</br>
</br>
However, instead of hurting her at all, the bullet made a clung sound and was deflected to the side.</br>
</br>
Closer examination would reveal that at that instant, Lilith's forehead was covered by a layer of bright silver liquid metal.</br>
</br>
However, in the eyes of the two men, she became an invulnerable monster.</br>
</br>
"Devil! Devil!"</br>
</br>
They screamed in Spanish, and the slightly more courageous big man also completely gave up resisting. He threw down his weapon and desperately tried to catch up to his partner who had almost made it to the end of the alley</br>
</br>
Lilith just moved her finger slightly as she looked at the two fleeing men.</br>
</br>
The silver thorns that penetrated Torres turned into countless tiny droplets.</br>
</br>
The droplets gradually elongated and elongated in a special field...</br>
</br>
Eventually, they turned into silver needles as thin as hair strands.</br>
</br>
There was no sign of the incoming danger.</br>
</br>
The two men who made it to the end of the alley collapsed onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Soon, dense blood droplets oozed out from their bodies, and they were drenched in blood within half a minute.</br>
</br>
Lilith sighed without a change of expression as she examined the three bodies.</br>
</br>
"So troublesome."</br>
</br>
For Lilith, there was no difference between squishing a person and squashing a bug, especially if the person occupied less than 1kb of memory in her emotional center.</br>
</br>
However, dealing with these corpses and bloodstains were troublesome after all.</br>
</br>
After she recalled Jiang Chen's "you should be lowkey" advice before she left, Lilith glanced at the trash cans in the alleys and the newspapers on the ground.</br>
</br>
This will have to do…</br>
</br>
She silently recalled the liquid metal on the ground, then the metal condensed into two big silver hands in front of her, and she reached to Torres who was closest to her...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1302: Doub</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was daybreak, and an uninvited guest greeted the inaccessible alley.</br>
</br>
With his right hand hidden inside his jacket pocket, Agent Davis walked into the alley and tightly grasped onto the M9 pistol with the safety unlocked. He carefully searched the alley.</br>
</br>
Just a few days ago, Agent Braddock, who was tracking Abel Torres in Colombia, disappeared in his apartment.</br>
</br>
After he received the order from the headquarters, Davis immediately tied up the loose ends on his end and headed from Brazil to Colombia. He traced the clues of drug lord Abel Torres and arrived in the vice city known as Bogota.</br>
</br>
Based on the informant's intelligence and existing leads, Abel Torres met with a Florida "dealer" at a bar near the airport last night. Based on rumors, a major event was about to take place which made the drug dealer exchange all his stock into weapons.</br>
</br>
Davis didn't know what the "major event" Torres mentioned that is about to happen in Colombia was. Just like he didn't know the whereabouts of his colleague, but they were both reasons why he showed up here in the first place. The CIB's senior officials placed heavy emphasis on this matter. Not only did they gave him the highest level of authority, but they even promised him the authority to mobilize a SEAL team when necessary.</br>
</br>
Now, all the leads led him here.</br>
</br>
From a homeless man, at the expense of 10 dollars, he learned that Abel Torres appeared in this alley in the early hours of yesterday morning. There was also a blonde girl who also appeared here, and she was only about twelve or thirteen years old.</br>
</br>
Davis took two seconds to mourn for the girl that likely suffered an unfortunate fate after he learned the drug lord's special hobby, then he moved forward in the alley.</br>
</br>
The faint smell of blood in the air made him frown.</br>
</br>
Soon, he found some unusualness from a few details on the ground.</br>
</br>
"Hair?"</br>
</br>
He kneeled down, and took out his gloves, then used a pair of tweezers to pick up the strand of brown hair.</br>
</br>
With his other hand, he took out the flashlight and put the hair under the bright light. He quickly discovered the issue.</br>
</br>
"Brown matches with Torres' hair color. The cut is clean and doesn't look like it was torn off in a fight, but was like cut directly by a sharp instrument. Bloodstains? Who does this belong to?"</br>
</br>
The conditions here obviously did not permit him to do DNA testing.</br>
</br>
Davis took out a small plastic bag about the size of his index finger from his pocket, clamped the strand of hair with the tweezers, and carefully inserted it into the bag.</br>
</br>
After he finished that, he continued to search the ground for evidence.</br>
</br>
However, to his surprise, he found a lot of useful clues on the ground but did not find the one he was searching for.</br>
</br>
"Blonde hair... this is not right; it should be very conspicuous. Did Torres not encounter any resistance when he was abusing the girl? But that can't explain the hair and blood...and the fibers left behind."</br>
</br>
</br>
David quietly analyzed as he continued to move deeper into the alley.</br>
</br>
Just as he passed a row of trash cans, he suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
With a frown, his gaze turned to the row of trash cans.</br>
</br>
In the disgusting rancid smell, there was a subtle smell of blood that was even stronger than before.</br>
</br>
He reached for the lid of the trash can.</br>
</br>
The second he opened the lid, the pungent smell blew into his face and made him subconsciously move his head back.</br>
</br>
Then he looked at the newspaper in the trash can and fiddled the pieces around.</br>
</br>
Just after he put his hand on the newspaper, he immediately felt something wet.</br>
</br>
After a moment of hesitation, he suddenly ripped the newspaper away.</br>
</br>
When he saw what was buried under the newspaper, his face turned pale, and nauseousness agitated his stomach. A stream of fluid almost oozed up to his Adam's apple.</br>
</br>
Arms, organs, even eyeballs...all the organs were neatly placed in the bloody trash can and it perfectly utilized every inch of space.</br>
</br>
However, this merciless neatness was what made this bloody scene crueler and colder. Even if he was used to seeing corpses and blood, he couldn't help feeling the tremor and fear deep in his bones as he stared at the scene in front of him.</br>
</br>
What kind of person could be so cruel...</br>
</br>
"God... Sh*t..."</br>
</br>
He muttered incoherently as he put on his plastic gloves and took out the head mechanically. Then he flipped it to the right side, used his finger to slide down the nose, and stopped at the jaw.</br>
</br>
"Abel Torres...no way this can't be."</br>
</br>
David took two steps back and muttered blankly. He tore off the plastic gloves and threw them into the bag he was carrying</br>
</br>
"This is Standard-bearer..." David pressed a button on his collar, fought down the urge to vomit, and squeezed out the words one by one, "I have confirmed the whereabouts of Abel Torres."</br>
</br>
"Where!?" Baird grabbed the radio and hurriedly said into channel inside the special operations command room.</br>
</br>
"In an alley outside the airport," Davis, with his face as pale as a ghost, glanced at the pile of indescribable things. "Fifteen meters in and turn left. In the second trash can..."</br>
</br>
Baird was stunned, he thought he heard wrong.</br>
</br>
"The second... trash can?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Davis swallowed down hard, "A total of three people were killed, or cruelly dismembered, and stuffed into the trash can. One of them was Torres, and the others were his henchman, with a very long name, a native of South America."</br>
</br>
"You mean, Abel Torres... was killed?" Baird said, his voice was in complete disbelief.</br>
</br>
After Davis took a deep breath, he spoke slowly.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Although the CIB was eager to get rid of this guy, the organization absolutely did not want him to die here. There was plenty of information that could be extracted from him. Now that he had died in an inexplicable manner, this completely disrupted their plan.</br>
</br>
"Where's Agent Braddock..." Baird asked.</br>
</br>
"I don't know," Davis smiled wryly, "The only thing that I'm certain is that he is not in this trash can."</br>
</br>
"Find the murderer who killed Abel Torres! He might know something."</br>
</br>
"Yes..."</br>
</br>
Davis ended the communication and the wry smile on his face was even more apparent.</br>
</br>
The lead stopped here.</br>
</br>
Who executed Abel Torres in such a cruel way? Was it just a gang murder, or was the greatest mystery being buried here?</br>
</br>
Also, where is Agent Braddock now? Did he discover something before he disappeared?</br>
</br>
For some odd reason, Davis suddenly felt chills behind him.</br>
</br>
From the putrid smell mixed with blood, he subtly felt a hint of conspiracy.</br>
</br>
His instinct had always been accurate.</br>
</br>
And now, his instinct told him that he had only seen the tip of the iceberg...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1303: Who Knows?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At New Moon Island located northwest of Coro City.</br>
</br>
Since the establishment of the High-Tech Industrial Park on Ange Island, the production line of the Phantom was moved from the nearby offshore platform to Ange Island.</br>
</br>
This offshore platform had been transformed into a deep water port, used to dock the Guardian-class frigates that were upgraded by Future Military's dark technologies, as well as experimental equipment such as submarines designed by Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
On top of the platform, off of New Moon Island, Ivan showed Jiang Chen the latest equipment of Celestial Trade Marine Corps.</br>
</br>
"This is the latest innovation from Future Military, the 'Crocodile-20' Amphibious Assault Vehicle. It can submerge up to ten meters underwater, quickly attack the coastline, and provide cover fire for the landing infantry..."</br>
</br>
The short and compact cross-section made the vehicle resemble more of a tank than an armored vehicle, but the weapon layout was nearly identical to a general armored vehicle. The circular tubular external tanks that hung on both sides of the armor were used to control the depth by draining water, and the tail end was equipped with a propulsion device to provide power for the amphibious assault vehicle.</br>
</br>
The top of the armored vehicle was equipped with an electromagnetic pulse rapid-fire cannon, and the mass projectile accelerated to the limit could easily penetrate through the light armor of a general infantry fighting vehicle. The auto-loading rockets that suspended on both sides of the turret could fire both armor-piercing and high-explosive rockets.</br>
</br>
With both high penetration and firepower, whether it was fighting in city terrains or amphibious conditions, the amphibious assault vehicle named "Crocodile" could easily handle any battle conditions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded at the weapon tailor-made for Celestial Trade Marine Corps and provided a two-word response.</br>
</br>
"Not bad."</br>
</br>
With armored vehicles and mechanized infantries as the main battle force, and Tiger IIs and other penetrative and high-damaging main battle tanks as the supporting force aligned with the tactical strategy of Celestial Trade, which emphasized fast attack and soft target killing. Future Military's research and development of weapons were also based on this strategy.</br>
</br>
The most evident example was the lack of a main battle tank in all of the research and development projects.</br>
</br>
There was naturally a reason for this phenomenon.</br>
</br>
Since the advent of electromagnetic pulse cannons, the asymmetry of offense and defense of armored units was pushed to the extreme. A mass projectile accelerated to ten times the speed of sound would not only easily penetrate the front armor of the M1A2 main battle tank, but the projectile would also come out from the back.</br>
</br>
In fact, even without a next era weapon like the electromagnetic pulse cannon, the asymmetry of offense and defense of modern main battle tanks was starting to become more apparent</br>
</br>
</br>
Disregarding the dark technologies of Celestial Trade, let's take a very simple example.</br>
</br>
The standard 125mm armor-piercing ammunition of Hua has a penetration depth of 1000mm as reported by the media (there was mention of 1800mm, but it should be disregarded as being too unrealistic and not used for reference). Its imaginary enemy, the M1A2 tank, has the strongest armor at the front of the turret, and the horizontal anti-ballistic ability is equivalent to 850 mm rolled homogeneous armor, and the inclination coefficient is 1.3. The equivalent thickness of the Chobham armor may be higher, but it will not exceed 1000mm rolled homogeneous steel.</br>
</br>
What does this mean?</br>
</br>
Even if M1A2 took the hit at the strongest point, it may not be able to resist a single shot.</br>
</br>
Of course, the reverse is also true.</br>
</br>
In an encounter within "2000 meters", whether it was a tank or a squishy, one shot was enough.</br>
</br>
It was also the reason why Europe had been reluctant to equip 140mm tank guns. Apart from the military expenditure issue, the most fundamental reason was the lack of necessity.</br>
</br>
Even against the front armor of the latest main battle tank, a 120mm tank gun with an armor-piercing shell could easily penetrate within 2000 meters. And if you want to effectively defend against 120mm (including Russia's 125mm) tank guns, you must greatly increase defense at the expense of sacrificing mobility.</br>
</br>
However, in the modern warfare era with diverse anti-tank methods, loss of mobility is often more deadly than the loss of armor.</br>
</br>
The current developmental thinking of Future Military followed the guidelines established by Jiang Chen, and Jiang Chen referenced the apocalypse. From the middle of the 21st century to the early 22nd century, the main battle tanks were indeed unfavored for an extended period of time.</br>
</br>
It was not until the emergence of giant brain-hole designs such as the Wanderer and Spider Tank did main battle tanks regain their purpose. But by that time, the boundary between tanks and armored vehicles was actually quite blurred.</br>
</br>
The Wanderer may still be able to count as a tank. As for the Spider Tank... what aspect of that design resembled a tank?</br>
</br>
After a tour on the offshore platform, they returned to New Moon Island, and Jiang Chen asked Ivan.</br>
</br>
"How many Crocodiles do we have?"</br>
</br>
"We have only ordered twenty vehicles from Future Military," Ivan replied.</br>
</br>
"How do you think they work?" Jiang Chen asked again.</br>
</br>
Without exactly understanding what Jiang Chen meant, Ivan hesitated a little, and said truthfully, "The performance in several exercises has been quite positive. It has indeed greatly improved the Marine Corps' landing combat capabilities."</br>
</br>
"Then buy five hundred of it," Jiang Chen laughed and said casually, "What can twenty vehicles do? It's too few."</br>
</br>
Ivan silently remembered these words. He planned to get someone on this task right away.</br>
</br>
"Right," Jiang Chen suddenly turned around and looked at Ivan, "How big is our reserve?"</br>
</br>
It seemed that he felt he was not being accurate so he added another sentence.</br>
</br>
"You know, I mean those mercenaries."</br>
</br>
"Counting the recruits in training, there are 30,000 people!"</br>
</br>
"Too few," Jiang Chen shook his head, "I think it is necessary to increase the number of 'contractors'."</br>
</br>
Ivan looked at him, lowered his voice, and asked.</br>
</br>
"Is there going to be a war?"</br>
</br>
When the Russian asked this sentence, his pupils flashed with excitement.</br>
</br>
Since the establishment of the Aerospace Department, Celestial Trade's Space Defense Force had been designated into the responsibilities of the Aerospace Department. Including the orbital airborne brigade and the power armor brigade, although they were all referred to as Celestial Trade Marine Corps out of habit, they were two completely different systems from the Celestial Trade Navy and Marine Corps currently commanded by Ivan.</br>
</br>
It was precisely this reason that, although Celestial Trade had engaged in warfare, for Ivan, nothing much changed.</br>
</br>
Although he never considered war to be a good thing, he still couldn't help the fact that he craved battle. Whenever he heard that an orbital airborne brigade achieved victory somewhere, he always felt somewhat frustrated.</br>
</br>
From the tone in the boss's voice, he heard a subtle hint of unusualness.</br>
</br>
Including the sudden visit of the boss to New Moon Island, who had always focused on space issues, to make a rare inspection of the military training. All these actions were intriguing.</br>
</br>
Because the last time he frequently visited the New Moon Island Military Base, the Battle of MLL Island that shocked the world broke out shortly after.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not give a clear answer to Ivan's question. He only smiled and gave an ambiguous answer.</br>
</br>
"Who knows, especially with a war?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1304"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1304: Delegation Arrival</br>
</div></br>
</br>
An aircraft printed with Xin's flag and Celestial Trade's logo appeared over the Bogota International Airport and slowly descended on the runway.</br>
</br>
In the security tunnel of the airport, soldiers in military green camouflage were on standby. On the street not far away, armored vehicles were even spotted.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the Colombian authorities recognized the importance of the situation. Although they were not eager to see the delegation from Xin, they definitely did not want Xin's delegation to lose a single strand of hair here.</br>
</br>
With a bright smile on his face, the Hispanic Colombian President Juan walked up and extended his right hand with friendliness to shake Zhang Yaping's extended hand.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, friends from the Western Pacific! The Colombian people welcome you, you'll love this beautiful country."</br>
</br>
If the smile was any indicator, it would be hard to imagine that the economic exchanges between the two countries were the complete opposite. Celestial Trade had began its effort to open up the South American market in 2018, but there was minimal progress.</br>
</br>
The UA had carefully guarded its back garden against Celestial Trade's attempt to increase its influence.</br>
</br>
Even for the capitalist world, Celestial Trade was a rather "deformed" monster. Although the military-industrial complex of the UA and Samsung of Korea were both involved in military production, and rely on their own influence to interfere in government policies, Celestial Trade's direct monopolization of a country's military as a contractor could only be compared with the "East India Company" in the past.</br>
</br>
The UA was afraid Celestial Trade's goal of replicating the "Xin Model" in South America, and South American countries themselves were also concerned about that possibility. Only an anti-American, poor economic condition country like Ecuador would consider opening its doors to the monster known as Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
For example, Juan was one of the biggest obstacles to Celestial Trade's expansion into Colombia.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping sensed the caution and rejection hidden behind his smile. However, he still smiled and said in a relaxed but sincere tone in front of the media.</br>
</br>
"Of course, as soon as I got off the plane, I already felt the charm of this country. I believe this trip will definitely be worthwhile."</br>
</br>
"I assure you," Juan laughed along, as he shook Zhang Yaping's hand with force, then he gestured to the direction of the VIP tunnel of the airport, and said respectfully, "Please."</br>
</br>
Followed by Celestial Trade's bodyguards, the delegation of Xin passed through the VIP tunnel and got on the convoy sent by the Colombian government.</br>
</br>
In the extended black vehicle, Juan glanced at the media reporters outside of the car, and a subtle hint of mockery appeared under his thick bread. He then looked at Zhang Yaping across from him and asked with a "sincere" smile.</br>
</br>
"Would you like a cigar?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"Thank you, there is no need," Zhang Yaping politely declined.</br>
</br>
"You can feel more relaxed. You don't have to worry about the annoying media in the car, and we don't have to do anything superficial." Juan took a cut cigar from his assistant, took out a lighter, and smiled to Zhang Yaping, "In South America, cigars and coffee are a kind of culture, and we will have to have at least one of them when we talk about business."</br>
</br>
The ventilation system was superb, and the milky white smoke quickly drifted to the sides of the roof, and no smell lingered inside the vehicle.</br>
</br>
"Talk about business?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, we like to be straight forward. South American culture is like that." Juan grinned with the cigar still in his mouth and then said in a relaxed tone, "Of course, if President Zhang doesn't like this metaphor, I'm willing to take my words back."</br>
</br>
"Of course not, I also like to be straightforward," Zhang Yaping shook his head, then smiled, "But when it comes to business, we might as well talk about something interesting."</br>
</br>
Oh?" Juan raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"According to the latest space resource development plan announced by Celestial Trade, we intend to build a second space elevator within five years. Here I can tell you in advance that the possibility of this elevator being located in South America is very high."</br>
</br>
"And it's going to be in Ecuador, am I right?" Juan responded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Zhang Yaping agreed, then continued, "If you have studied the Asia-Pacific economic data in the last three years, it shouldn't be difficult for you to see that with Xin's space elevator as the center, the GDP of neighboring countries and regions have grown substantially. After the completion of the space elevator in Ecuador, Colombia and even the entire South America will be the direct beneficiaries."</br>
</br>
"Will it?"</br>
</br>
Juan did not deny this, but he revealed a mischievous smile. He was obviously not moved by the check with an astronomical number.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping eyed Juan thoughtfully, but he also laughed again and changed the subject.</br>
</br>
He gave him a chance.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he didn't catch it.</br>
</br>
"Xin is willing to provide Colombia with a low-interest loan of 50 billion Xin New Dollars," Zhang Yaping said without a change of expression.</br>
</br>
"If the premise is that Colombia joins the Global Grid Plan of Celestial Trade, I am sorry but I must refuse. I cannot put Colombia's national security in the hands of an irresponsible warmonger," Juan shook his head and said righteously.</br>
</br>
"There is no premise," Zhang Yaping smiled and said in a relaxed tone.</br>
</br>
Juan was stunned.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping's response was completely beyond his expectation.</br>
</br>
A loan without any conditions?</br>
</br>
How can that be!</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping studied the silent Juan, and a hint of mockery appeared in corners of his mouth tugged just slightly upward. But quickly, he hid the mockery in a friendly smile as he watched the Colombian president speak.</br>
</br>
"To support the construction of infrastructure in Colombia, this loan will be used to support Colombia's infrastructure, transportation, light and heavy industry, and other sectors. Any company with operating qualifications can apply for this loan after passing the risk assessment process."</br>
</br>
"What about the use of the loan?" Juan was no longer smoking his cigar, as he hurriedly asked, "Are there any restrictions?"</br>
</br>
50 billion in foreign investment!</br>
</br>
No one will complain about money.</br>
</br>
Especially for Colombia, whose economic situation was not so positive, the 50 billion in foreign investment would not only directly impact the employment rate, but would even impact the annual GDP data.</br>
</br>
Juan did not understand what Zhang Yaping was planning to do, but if the loan was really without any conditions as he said, there was absolutely no reason to refuse!</br>
</br>
"There are no restrictions."</br>
</br>
Those words were like a heavenly melody.</br>
</br>
After Juan took a deep breath, he did all he could to restrain the excitement in his heart so that the expression on his face would not be so explicit.</br>
</br>
He extinguished the cigar between his fingers, looked at Zhang Yaping, and solemnly thanked him.</br>
</br>
"On behalf of the Colombian government, I thank you for your generosity! Colombian people will always remember this friendship!"</br>
</br>
"You are welcome," Zhang Yaping said softly, "If you want to express your gratitude, thank Future Group. The loan was provided from Future Bank. We are just taking the lead."</br>
</br>
Future Group?</br>
</br>
When he heard this name, Juan instinctively felt a little uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
However, he couldn't tell what made him uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping looked at the frowning President Juan and the smile hidden with a deeper layer of meaning was even more apparent.</br>
</br>
Yes.</br>
</br>
There was really no conditions on this loan.</br>
</br>
However, the loan was not used to witness the friendship between the two countries or to help the poor.</br>
</br>
It was here to help the Colombian people rebuild their homes...</br>

</br>
In an apartment building about one block away from the embassy.</br>
</br>
In the dimly lit room, Hirst used his finger to slightly open the curtain.</br>
</br>
A ray of sunlight passed through the gap in the curtain and like a giant and visible scar, it was imprinted on his gloomy face.</br>
</br>
This apartment originally belonged to a 30-year-old middle-aged white-collar worker who worked in an office building about four stops away from here. After he saw the apartment, Andrew invaded his consciousness with mental power, controlled and forced him to ask for vacation time from his company, and then the mercenary drove him to Lake Santa Ana and tossed him in.</br>
</br>
Hirst saw the delegation's convoy pass through the street not far away, and his eyes narrowed. His dark green pupils showed a dangerous color.</br>
</br>
He heard the door closing behind him.</br>
</br>
Sakai Shichie changed her shoes at the entrance, tossed her backpack on the sofa, took off the digital camera around her neck, then threw it to Andrew who was resting.</br>
</br>
"In order to protect the delegation of Xin, the Colombian Military deployed at least one battalion. In addition, the Colombian Special Forces are also involved in security work. There is a sniper squad on standby on the clock tower not far away. Another sniper squad was on the roof of the apartment building across the embassy with heavy disguise."</br>
</br>
Andrew opened his eyes, then opened the photo album in the digital camera. He was quite intrigued by the photos.</br>
</br>
As expected, with a background as an agent. Miss Sakai did indeed have her specialty in intelligence work. Especially with the help of her abilities, her ability to conduct surveillance and counter-surveillance was amplified by more than one level. She took photos of all the open and hidden posts arranged by the Columbia force with her digital camera.</br>
</br>
"Leave me the sniper squad on the clock tower." Garek carefully wiped the accessories of the sniper rifle and as if he was completely immersed in this boring work, he did not even stop for a second. "The position there is good. I plan to do it there."</br>
</br>
"I'll be in charge of luring the army away," Hirst had a sinister smile on his face and his facial muscles showed a twisted appearance as they moved, "It'll be easy for me."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Sakai was just about to say something, but Andrew was the first to speak.</br>
</br>
"You and I will be coordinating at the ambush location," Andrew said with a gentle smile on his old face, "If Garek succeeds, we will just mix in with the crowd. If Garek misses, you go for the final blow. At that time, I will use my mental power to help you contain the police and soldiers nearby. I believe that with your ability, it should not be difficult to escape unscathed."</br>
</br>
"I won't miss," Gerak said coldly.</br>
</br>
"Of course I believe you," Andrew nodded, then he said, "So I used the word 'if'."</br>
</br>
"So, I'm just a backup?" Sakai frowned, obviously she felt a little dissatisfied with this arrangement.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Andrew smiled, "but from an efficiency perspective, we should let the sniper go first. If one bullet can solve the problem, why waste the second one?"</br>
</br>
Sakai reluctantly accepted the old man's argument and she nodded in silence. She then sat down on the sofa without speaking another word.</br>
</br>
Hirst, who was by the window, returned to the living room. He asked Andrew who had closed his eyes again.</br>
</br>
"That's right, by the way, what will happen to that Juan?"</br>
</br>
He was also the president of Colombia after all.</br>
</br>
Although the Kurofune superpowers were enough to ignore the rules in this world, this issue would undoubtedly trigger the sensitive nerves of countries around the world. It was better to not take the risk.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about him. Our target is only one person and that is Zhang Yaping," Andrew still had a smile on his face and said without even opening his eyes, "Of course, if the Colombian is in the way, it doesn't hurt to kill him."</br>
</br>
On the roof of an office building hundreds of meters away.</br>
</br>
Lilith sat on the water tank as she looked blankly at the traffic on the street, then she abruptly said to the air.</br>
</br>
"The convoy has arrived safely to the embassy, everything is normal."</br>
</br>
After a while, Jiang Chen's voice returned to her ear.</br>
</br>
"Continue to monitor."</br>
</br>
"Got it."</br>
</br>
She jumped down from the water tank, then patted the dust on her skirt.</br>
</br>
Just then, a raindrop fell on the tip of her nose.</br>
</br>
Lilith raised her head slightly, looked at the gray clouds that had hidden the sunlight for some time, and touched the tip of her nose.</br>
</br>
"Is it going to rain?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was the afternoon in Colombia, but still early in the morning in Xin.</br>
</br>
In the office, Jiang Chen nodded after he had listened to Lilith's report.</br>
</br>
With the communication closed, he closed the holographic screen next to him.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who stood across from the desk, hesitated a little as she watched Jiang Chen. However, she finally asked what concerned her the most.</br>
</br>
"Is Lilith going to be okay?"</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, whoever runs into her should be more worried. Compared to her safety, I have some sympathy for those who get in her path..." Jiang Chen coughed. "Well, what were we talking about earlier?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded and continued their previous topic.</br>
</br>
"...Based on the information from Bernice, just yesterday evening, a SEAL unit set out from UA and arrived in Colombia by plane."</br>
</br>
"What's the stance of Colombia?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"It's not clear yet." Ayesha shook her head.</br>
</br>
After he pondered for a moment, his frown suddenly disappeared, he shook his head, then laughed.</br>
</br>
Just now, he suddenly felt that his worries were completely unnecessary.</br>
</br>
What if it were the disbanded Rainbow Six that got sent here? He didn't think that a mere team of Special Forces could defeat an advanced artificial intelligence from the 22nd century.</br>
</br>
The only thing he didn't understand was why the UA would send a team of Special Forces to Colombia at this time.</br>
</br>
Was it just a coincidence?</br>
</br>
Or rather, they planned to recklessly start a war by assassinating Xin's president...</br>
</br>
His index finger tapped gently on the armrest of the chair as the thoughts flowed in his mind.</br>
</br>
Splash...</br>
</br>
Big raindrops fell down and hit the glass windows one after another. With the wind picking up, the sound of water splashing against the window grew louder. The palm leaves outside the window were like a boat, floating in the raging waves.</br>
</br>
"It's raining," Ayesha said softly as she watched the rain droplets start to get more concentrated on the glass window.</br>
</br>
The sky was still clear half an hour ago, but now the sky was covered by dense clouds.</br>
</br>
The weather in the Western Pacific always behaved like this, especially in late spring and early summer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's gaze floated out of the window as he watched the sudden rainstorm. His tone was filled with emotion.</br>
</br>
"Yes, it's starting to rain."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1306"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1306: Adapt To The Situation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A flash of lightning broke through the heavy clouds, followed by the rolling thunder that echoed through the valley in the dense rain forest.</br>
</br>
In the depths of the valley, soldiers in military green camouflage were busy moving boxes of ammunition into the cave. The four English letters of FARC and a flag with two crossed rifles were printed on the armband of the soldiers' uniform.</br>
</br>
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia was their name.</br>
</br>
Under the army green rain-proof tarpaulin, there were several large-caliber mortars lined up, as well as RPG-7 rocket launchers.</br>
</br>
An old man with a beret and a serious expression stood under the tarpaulin. He was there with the agents of the Russian Security Services, as they watched soldiers verify the supplies with a list.</br>
</br>
After all the equipment was confirmed, the wrinkles on the old man's face turned into a smile.</br>
</br>
"Confirmation completed."</br>
</br>
A soldier ran to the old man, performed a military salute, and handed over the list in his hand.</br>
</br>
The old man returned a military salute, then took the list and signed his name on it-</br>
</br>
Timoleon Jimenez, or known as Timochenko.</br>
</br>
Timoleon Jimenez, a name that created countless headaches for both the UA and Colombia. With influence and ability no less inferior to the early FARC leader Marulanda. Unlike Marulanda, who possessed outstanding military talents, his talents were better reflected in management.</br>
</br>
Such ability was reflected in drug traffic. Today, it not only operated its own official website in seven languages, but its annual revenue was even as high as 500 million dollars. No drug dealers in North America were unfamiliar with the name of this South American tycoon.</br>
</br>
It was precisely this that Mr. Timochenko was honored as the top candidate of the CIB's most wanted list in South America. The Colombian government even offered 50 million dollars as a reward for his head. However, until today, a few years later, no one was able away to claim the bounty.</br>
</br>
"In late October, we will deliver the last batch of equipment to you. From November to early February next year, you will have three months to end this war," After the Russian agent shook hands with Timochenko, he continued, "The UA is currently going through its election process. Therefore, it is impossible for them to use troops during this time, but after this period, no one can be certain."</br>
</br>
"Three months is too short." Timochenko  shook his head, "Even if we win every battle, we may not be able to win within three months."</br>
</br>
"You can tear up the peace deal in advance, but the war must be ended before March next year at the latest, creating a fait accompli that FARC will rule entire Colombia. As in the agreement, we will help you to gain legality through the United Nations."</br>
</br>
"I have a question."</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"How much ahead is appropriate?" Jimenez asked.</br>
</br>
"Depends on you," the Russian agent shrugged, "I believe you will be better at grasping this opportunity than us. Of course, I prefer you to spend more time on preparation before the war, and wait until you are fully prepared."</br>
</br>
</br>
"You can rest assured," Timochenko cracked into a grin, "We have been preparing for half a century for this opportunity."</br>
</br>
After he sent someone to take the guest from Moscow out of the rain forest. Timochenko got on the army green off-road vehicle at the entrance of the cave, he then raised his legs and rested them on the steering wheel. The thunderstorm outside made him feel flustered. He took a half-smoked cigar from his pocket and lit it with a lighter.</br>
</br>
At this moment, his subordinate trotted to the side of the car and performed a military salute.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?" Jimenez asked as he continued to stare out the window.</br>
</br>
"Our informant in Bogota has learned that Abel Torres, who went missing three days ago, has been confirmed dead. His body was found in an alley near Bogota International Airport and has now been recovered by Colombian police."</br>
</br>
All of Columbia's drug lords were inseparable from FARC, and Abel Torres was no exception.</br>
</br>
"This idiot, I told him to be low-key." Timochenko  sneered, shook his head, and after a pause, he nonchalantly said, "Did the Colombian police do it? Or the CIB?"</br>
</br>
The soldier hesitated for a second, then spoke.</br>
</br>
"According to our informants from the Colombian military, a team of SEAL has recently entered Colombia and has now arrived at a military base near Caramanga..."</br>
</br>
"SEAL?"</br>
</br>
Timochenko's pupils suddenly constricted, and his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"Is it the SEAL that did this?"</br>
</br>
"...I don't know." The soldier lowered his head and said quickly, "However, our informants in the police system said the CIB agent who found Abel Torres' body has the commanding authority over this SEAL team."</br>
</br>
Half of the credit for FARC's survival to this day could be given to those government officials who were bought by them. They penetrated the Colombian government from all aspects, whether it was the police system or the military system. They could sense any danger based on advanced intelligence.</br>
</br>
From the death of Abel Torres and the sudden arrival of a SEAL team in Colombia, Timochenko smelled a hint of danger.</br>
</br>
Is the UA planning to take action against the Colombian guerrillas?</br>
</br>
The Quantum Communication Satellite of Celestial Trade could receive signals even in the depths of the Andes. Although he hid in the rainforests all year round, he had never been out of touch with this world. He was well aware of the importance of information in this era, so he spent a considerable amount of time studying news every day.</br>
</br>
For example, the conflicts between the UA and Xin, and he had an idea why Russia suddenly provided assistance to him.</br>
</br>
The SEAL team that suddenly landed in Colombia undoubtedly stung his sensitive nerves.</br>
</br>
Did the CIB get the news in advance?</br>
</br>
Timochenko frowned.</br>
</br>
The death of Abel Torres forced him to seriously think about the possibilities.</br>
</br>
Just then, a drop of cold sweat suddenly slipped down from his forehead.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered what he had said to Torres not long ago, including asking him to exchange the drug stock with firearms as soon as possible and some major events in Colombia that were going to take place soon...</br>
</br>
If Torres was killed by the CIB, and the CIB agents tortured him before he died. If they learned something, then this SEAL team was likely after him.</br>
</br>
Maybe not just the SEAL team...</br>
</br>
As the Russian agent said, from November to February, the UA was unlikely to use troops in foreign countries. From another perspective, if the CIB really did learn some information, the period before November was undoubtedly the best time to target him.</br>
</br>
Timochenko's fists clenched, and then there was a hint of hesitation in his eyes.</br>
</br>
The best defense is offense?</br>
</br>
Or wait it out...</br>
</br>
The soldier who was standing in the rain cautiously asked as the leader was silent.</br>
</br>
"Sir?"</br>
</br>
The hesitation was instantly quashed from Timochenko's eyes.</br>
</br>
He looked at the soldier outside the car and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Inform all brigade-level combat units to immediately prepare for battle!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! Sir!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1307: First Blood</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Bang, bang!</br>
</br>
Two quick shots were concealed by the rolling thunder.</br>
</br>
The smoke diffused.</br>
</br>
There was a terrifying blood hole on their forehead, and two figures, one after another, fell into the pool of blood.</br>
</br>
The silver revolver was hoisted again, and Garek dropped the guitar case to the ground.</br>
</br>
He walked forward and dragged the two bodies from the clock tower window to the wooden box under the stairs. He took out two claymores from his backpack and placed them behind the locked wooden door.</br>
</br>
Unless there was something wrong with the clock tower, under normal circumstances, no one would come to the attic. In addition, the Colombian police must have done their homework and temporarily closed this clock tower during the visit of Xin delegation.</br>
</br>
After he had set up the trap, he returned to the window and opened the redwood guitar case.</br>
</br>
Large and small parts neatly filled all the space in the guitar case.</br>
</br>
Garek skillfully assembled the parts, then placed the sniper rifle on his shoulder and aimed around a few times.</br>
</br>
The wide magazine, the square muzzle with openings on both sides made it extremely easy for anyone, even without the slightest knowledge about weapons, to call out the name of this rifle.</br>
</br>
Barrett.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was the Barrett M107A1, a new product from Barrett. Different from the old M82 series, as the world's newest, most advanced, and most powerful sniper rifle, its effective range reached an astounding 2000 meters, and gained its name as the "silencing cannon" in the sniper industry.</br>
</br>
Garek loaded the bullets painted red into the magazine one by one, he pulled the bolt and sneered.</br>
</br>
API armor-piercing incendiary bullets could penetrate 11mm thick rolled homogeneous steel at a 45-degree angle within one kilometer, and produce more than 20 shrapnel behind the armor, as well as a combustion effect comparable to aviation kerosene. It was no exaggeration to say that even if the Xin president was in an armored vehicle, he was confident that it would only take one shot.</br>
</br>
As for missing?</br>
</br>
He never thought about it.</br>
</br>
Every member of the Kurofune possessed a superpower.</br>
</br>
The power that transcended the world was a gift from higher civilization.</br>
</br>
And his abilities happened to be tailored for his role...</br>
</br>
With the M107 placed on the window, he moved his eyes to the scope, looked through the pouring rain, he pressed the headset on his ear, and said coldly.</br>
</br>
"This is Hunter, I'm in place."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Along with the violent wind from the Western Pacific, the thunderstorm lasted from yesterday morning till the next day afternoon.</br>
</br>
However, even in the terrible weather, the beauty of the city remained undiminished.</br>
</br>
It was during the peak tourist season, and the streets of Bogota were full of tourists from all over the world. Umbrellas were connected together, and the crowd was bustling underneath. They traversed through the streets full of shops designed with South American culture and dazzling amounts of merchandise.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the rainy street, Lilith, who stood in front of a cafe, looked at the crowd under umbrellas on the street blankly, like a child separated from her parents.</br>
</br>
Several waiters at the entrance of the cafe were eyeing her as they discussed whether or not she needed help.</br>
</br>
Boom——</br>
</br>
The dull thunder reverberated from afar.</br>
</br>
Just then, Lilith's eyelashes suddenly moved.</br>
</br>
After a while, accompanied by electric static noise, a strange male voice intermittently came into her ear.</br>
</br>
"...This is Hunter, I'm in place."</br>
</br>
As if she received a signal, Lilith slowly raised her head and looked in the direction of the clock tower; her green pupils slightly zoomed-in.</br>
</br>
"There?"</br>
</br>
The waiter at the entrance of the cafe finally agreed on a plan and sent the girl who was best at dealing with children.</br>
</br>
A South American girl in her twenties, in the café uniform, walked out the door.</br>
</br>
However, just when she wanted to go over and ask the girl if she needed help, she was surprised to find that the girl who had stood there was gone...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was almost time.</br>
</br>
Garek bit the tip of his tongue in excitement, and the crosshair in his scope was firmly locked in on the bustling street hundreds of meters away.</br>
</br>
Andrew used his mental intervention ability on the embassy staff who went out and obtained the itinerary of the delegation. At five in the afternoon, the convoy would pass by here to attend a dinner hosted by the Colombian Presidential Palace in the city center.</br>
</br>
Hirst would use his transformation ability to disperse the army responsible for the security of this area. Andrew would use his power to identify Zhang Yaping's vehicle.</br>
</br>
Then, all he had to do was pull the trigger and escape from here. He would then go to an apartment about two blocks away from here, untie the CIB agent named Braddock, then give a bullet to his head, and fake a scene that the helpless CIB agent was responsible for the crime, and was finally killed by someone.</br>
</br>
"A world war?" Excitement flashed from his eyes.</br>
</br>
The gunshots of Sarajevo lit the powder keg of World War I.</br>
</br>
And now, the trigger that would determine the fate of the world was held tightly in his hand, and he could even feel the coldness coming from his index finger.</br>
</br>
The convoy drove away from the presidential palace in the city center. The delegation that had concluded its visit was returning in the direction of the embassy.</br>
</br>
Garek opened the safety, took a deep breath, and entered his state.</br>
</br>
It was not the right time yet.</br>
</br>
At this moment, there were two sudden popping noises from downstairs.</br>
</br>
Garek was taken aback for a moment and immediately became alert.</br>
</br>
The mines exploded?</br>
</br>
Suddenly, terror went up from his spine to his forehead.</br>
</br>
Almost out of reflex, Garek let go of the sniper rifle in his hand and dove to the side.</br>
</br>
There was a muffled noise behind him, and a silver thorn with the thickness of an index finger was nailed to his original position, and it actually sank into the wall.</br>
</br>
A cold drop of sweat oozed out from Garek's forehead as he narrowly escaped death.</br>
</br>
He did not hesitate to pull out the silver revolver from his waist. When he saw the girl at the door clearly, he was surprised for a second, but the index finger that pulled the trigger did not slow down for a moment.</br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
The bullet flew!</br>
</br>
But a strange scene happened.</br>
</br>
The bullet hit Lilith's eyebrows, but after a sharp clank, like hitting a sheet of metal, the bullet bounced away.</br>
</br>
"How is this possible!"</br>
</br>
Garek's heart jumped wildly and his eyes widened. He shot three times, but all the bullets bounced off.</br>
</br>
As he saw the silver long blade that was gradually condensing in front of Lilith, his heart withered, his pupils suddenly constricted, and he cursed.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k. A supernatural!"</br>
</br>
He threw away the revolver in his hand. Then, as both of his hands reached for his waist, his ability instantly activated—</br>
</br>
Bullet time!</br>
</br>
Everything in his field of view started to slow down.</br>
</br>
He took out two sharp daggers and his legs suddenly exerted force. He locked onto Lilith who looked at him expressionlessly and aimed at her delicate throat.</br>
</br>
He had a smirk on his face as he took swift and slow steps in the almost frozen time-space.</br>
</br>
"Go to hell!"</br>
</br>
In the almost stagnant time, he was God.</br>
</br>
No one could beat him in close combat!</br>
</br>
But the next second, there was a trace of despair in his pupils.</br>
</br>
"No!"</br>
</br>
Garek cried out. He was about to dodge, but it was too late.</br>
</br>
Everything was slowing down, except for the silver blade that condensed.</br>
</br>
The silver shadow flickered, and before he could even give his last words, his head flew to the corner of the room like a football.</br>
</br>
The expression of horror froze on his face.</br>
</br>
Lilith ignored the headless corpse that was still spraying blood and walked to the side of Garek's head. The pupil of her right eye flickered slightly, and a layer of light blue ripples scanned across her sight.</br>
</br>
After she collected the facial features of the killer, she quickly connected it to the quantum communication satellite in the synchronous orbit and matched it with the data in the Ghost Agent database. In less than two seconds, the matching result appeared in front of her.</br>
</br>
Garek, a mercenary and a core member of the Kurofune. Ability: Bullet Time. He died two years ago during the pursuit of Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he didn't really die, but faked a death, so that now he appeared here.</br>
</br>
A stream of data flashed in her pupils, and realization quickly appeared in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"The Kurofune? I see."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"If it were not for the typhoon weather lately, I would have recommended you visit Monserrate. From my personal point of view, it's probably the most beautiful place in Bogota. I went there last year around this time, and I can tell you that every time I look at the city from the above, I always feel my own insignificance.</br>
</br>
There is a church on the top of the mountain with a statue of the crucified Christ. It has been said that many miracles have happened there..." Inside the limo, the Colombian president described the beauty of this city to him vividly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping, who sat across from him, resisted the urge to tell him that if he could make time to visit Xin, looking down from the space elevator would make him feel more insignificant.</br>
</br>
"Really? If the weather clears up, I'll consider making a visit."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping forced a slightly reluctant smile as his eyes kept searching the street outside the window.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he was being too nervous but he had a feeling that a masked guy would jump out from the crowd and shoot at him with an AK-47, or perhaps fire an RPG-7 or something. Therefore, what Juan said after completed escaped him.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhang?" Juan looked at Zhang Yaping, confused, as he called out his name.</br>
</br>
After Zhang Yaping recollected his thoughts, he withdrew his gaze from out the window and coughed while being apologetic.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, where were we just now?"</br>
</br>
"That 50 billion loan." Juan did not mind Zhang Yaping's faux pas. With eyes full of light, Juan continued, "Although we will not compromise on national security issues, if Future Bank is willing to invest in Colombia's infrastructure, we are willing to carry out more cooperation in high-tech fields that you excel at, such as...maglev roads."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping mocked in his mind.</br>
</br>
Want to introduce maglev roads?</br>
</br>
Haha, what a joke!</br>
</br>
There are countless representatives of other countries lined up in front of Future Group.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping nonchalantly responded to Juan and his gaze drifted back to the rainy weather outside.</br>
</br>
Just then, he frowned.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he felt like he was being watched.</br>
</br>
A pair of eyes seemed to be spying on him in the dark...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the rotisserie on the street, Andrew, who sat in a chair with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes. He pressed the headset in his ear and said softly.</br>
</br>
"The third car, to the left."</br>
</br>
Sakai, who was across from him, put down the menu and looked at the street not far away. She casually touched the black fishing rod bag by the table next to her right hand.</br>
</br>
Andrew noticed Sakai's movements and smiled gently.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, let Garek do it."</br>
</br>
Sakai loosened her hand as she shrugged.</br>
</br>
"I was preparing just in case."</br>
</br>
Xin delegation's convoy quickly entered the street next to them, and the smile on Andrew's face became brighter.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on the plan they designed yesterday, when the Xin president passed the fourth street light, Garek who was lurking in the clock tower would pull the trigger. Then they could find a place to hide, pop the champagne, turn on the news, and wait for the CIB agent's body to be discovered by Ghost Agents. Finally, they would only have to wait for the furious Xin to declare war on the UA...</br>
</br>
Of course, Xin could choose to just accept the loss.</br>
</br>
But based on precedence, the possibility was close to zero.</br>
</br>
When the third vehicle passed the fourth street light, Andrew's smile froze, and he jerked his head toward the clock tower.</br>
</br>
"Impossible... Garek did not get to the sniper position? How is this possible?"</br>
</br>
There was a gleam of disbelief in his pupils, and his eyes widened as he watched the convoy continue forward.</br>
</br>
"It seems that Garek has escaped." Sakai grabbed the fishing rod bag, pushed aside the chair, and stood up. Then she pulled up the hood on her jacket as a menacing light appeared in her eyes and she said, "Execute the backup plan."</br>
</br>
"I'll leave it to you." Andrew's expression did not look great.</br>
</br>
Garek backing down was undoubtedly a heavy blow to their plan.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, he had a backup plan to prevent the entire mission from faltering. It was just that if Sakai executed the mission, it would be difficult to fool the Ghost Agents and plant it on the CIB.</br>
</br>
That failure!</br>
</br>
He cursed the mercenary 10,000 times in his mind, and he already made up his mind. Once the mission was over, he would catch the guy who betrayed the organization and use the cruelest way to make him regret his betrayal.</br>
</br>
"Ok."</br>
</br>
Without any nonsense, Sakai tossed the bag behind her and chased after the convoy.</br>
</br>
As Sakai disappeared into the crowd, Andrew took a deep breath, slowly closed his dry eyelids, and instantly spread out his immense mental power. It spanned five streets and weaved into a giant spiritual network.</br>
</br>
Under this big web, the spiritual entities were like flying mosquitoes falling into the web; no one could escape. What made the psychics terrifying was their ability to attack from anywhere without even being recognized where the attack came from.</br>
</br>
Soon, Andrew's consciousness locked onto the driver of Zhang Yaping's car, and his immense mental power flooded the car like a tide.</br>
</br>
The driver who was driving felt dizzy as he lost control of his hands and feet, he turned the steering wheel violently and stepped on the gas</br>
</br>
"FU*K, what are you doing!"</br>
</br>
The bodyguard next to him reached out to control the driver, but the next second, his brain felt like it was hit by a heavy hammer, and he fainted.</br>
</br>
The vehicle that lost control crashed into the crowd on both sides of the street.</br>
</br>
Because of the heavy rain, the umbrellas obstructed people's views. When the car lost control, the pedestrians didn't even realize what had just happened before they were hit.</br>
</br>
With a terrifying bloodstain dragged out on the ground, the limo that lost control smashed through the window right into the supermarket on the side of the road. It knocked down several rows of shelves before it finally stopped.</br>
</br>
People screamed, cried, and begged. The frightened crowd fled in all directions, and the streets were in complete chaos. People who weren't aware of the situation thought that there was another terrorist attack. Under the cascading effect, they also ran with the panicked crowd.</br>
</br>
Not just the president's vehicle.</br>
</br>
There were five cars in total, and the driver of each car rolled their eyes as if they were all on drugs. They stepped on the gas pedal to the limit, rammed through the street, and made the ready chaotic scene even more chaotic.</br>
</br>
In the vehicle that crashed into the supermarket first, the door of the back seat opened, and a man covered in blood struggled to get out of the car.</br>
</br>
"Dam...n..."</br>
</br>
Juan climbed up from the floor filled with glass shards. His face was filled with terror. He turned back to look at the unconscious Zhang Yaping and then pulled out his phone.</br>
</br>
But just when he was about to call the Director of Bogota Police, a black muzzle appeared in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
Pew-</br>
</br>
There was a short and quiet shot, and a flash appeared in the muzzle attached with a silencer.</br>
</br>
The phone fell to the ground, and Juan returned back on the floor covered with glass. Blood seeped down from his forehead and blood covered his panic-stricken face.</br>
</br>
Sakai stepped over Juan's corpse, looked at the unconscious target sitting in the car, and the sneer on her face under the hood started to become more and more obvious.</br>
</br>
She raised the gun, aimed it at Zhang Yaping's head, and was about to pull the trigger.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, a sound that pierced through air stroke her from the side...</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1309"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1309: A President Died</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the moment between life and death, Sakai dropped the pistol, drew out the dagger she had hidden in her bag, and slashed it to her side out of instinct.</br>
</br>
Ding!</br>
</br>
There was a crisp sound of metal banging together, and a silver metal ball hit her blade like a bullet.</br>
</br>
The immense force traveled up to her wrist and almost forced her to drop the dagger.</br>
</br>
Sakai saw the girl at the entrance of the supermarket and there was a glimpse of surprise in her eyes, but it was quickly replaced by deep fear. Based on her years of experience in dangerous situations, the girl in front of her was extremely dangerous.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that she also possessed a superpower.</br>
</br>
And it was a powerful one!</br>
</br>
"Did you kill Garek?" Sakai starred at Lilith as her right hand reached for the sword in her bag behind her.</br>
</br>
"Are you talking about that sniper? You can say that." Lilith looked at the cautious Sakai with the same emotionless state and shrugged. "Do you want to keep waiting? I don't care, but your time is limited."</br>
</br>
Lilith just finished her sentence when the woman moved.</br>
</br>
Without the slightest arrogance, Sakai immediately used her power to the limit in her first strike.</br>
</br>
Crimson flares scattered in her hair, and the two blades, one long and one short, one forward and one back, were covered by the crimson light particles, and they instantly turned into ghostly flame, like blooming red lotuses in the rain.</br>
</br>
Control of flame!</br>
</br>
Among the four, her ability was the most aggressive!</br>
</br>
The raindrops vaporized into water mist in the flames. The slashing blades, like rolling waves, slammed towards Lilith.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
The blades slashed down, but they couldn't touch Lilith. Instead, along with the raging flame, they slammed onto a buckler that suddenly rose.</br>
</br>
Several silver thorns protruded from the ground, and Sakai jumped to the side abruptly, and barely dodged Lilith's counterattack.</br>
</br>
"Do you only have this ability?"</br>
</br>
The silver droplets condensed on Lilith's hand and were gradually elongated into silver needles.</br>
</br>
Sakai's eyelids twitched wildly, and she crossed her blades in front of her while shouting to the side, "Andrew, what are you waiting for!"</br>
</br>
On the chair beside the street, Andrew sat there blankly, as if he had been possessed. He stared at the expressionless Lilith in the rain.</br>
</br>
Just now, he used his strongest trump card—Spiritual Piercing.</br>
</br>
As one of the few attacks of a psychic, the lethality of Spiritual Piercing on the target was completely on a different level compared to Mental Shock. The latter could only make people faint at best, but the former, like the literal meaning, could directly pierce a person's soul!</br>
</br>
If the target's willpower was weak, one blow could turn the target into an idiot.</br>
</br>
However, what surprised Andrew was that he did not even sense the girl's spirit.</br>
</br>
</br>
"...How is it possible, it's impossible!" As if he had just seen a ghost, his turbid pupils shrunk to a point in his eye sockets, "You are a psychic... NO! YOU ARE NOT A HUMAN!"</br>
</br>
"Well, I really am not such a troublesome thing."</br>
</br>
Just as Lilith finished her sentence, she moved.</br>
</br>
The elongated silver needles bursted out like arrows.</br>
</br>
The silver needles sealed all of Sakai's retreats and were about to turn her into a sieve, but all of a sudden, a black figure slammed into the wall and blocked in front of her while screaming.</br>
</br>
There, the sound of clanging metal lasted for a while.</br>
</br>
A huge figure, fully black, with arms as thick as a normal person's thigh, stood in front of her. The silver needles were all deflected as if they hit a wall.</br>
</br>
Transformation.</br>
</br>
It was not just changing one's height and face. Hurst, who could control every bone and every cell, could turn himself into an old man without harm, and of course, could also transform himself into a powerful giant.</br>
</br>
Incorporating metal into the skin to strengthen his defense was an ability he only recently gained, but even he himself did not expect to put it into use so quickly.</br>
</br>
"A mutated human with metalized skin?" On the downpouring street, Lilith looked expressionless at the panting Hurst, her digitalized eyes constricted slightly, "Or the downgraded version...transformation? I see, I probably know your plan."</br>
</br>
"Then take it into the grave!" Hurst, who had become a black giant, roared. He picked up the shelf lying on the ground, and slammed it at Lilith, while he shouted to the companion behind him. "She can't break my defense, strike!"</br>
</br>
Sakai, who was behind him, responded to his call with action. The double blades were once again covered by crimson particles as they swung in Lilith's direction again.</br>
</br>
Lilith sighed softly as she watched the shelf smash into her.</br>
</br>
"When did you have the illusion that I can't break your defense."</br>
</br>
For an instant, the heavy rain was gilded with silver.</br>
</br>
Under the action of the electromagnetic force field, the viscous metal droplets flowed upstream and condensed around Lilith into a shield with no weakness, like an eggshell that formed from ground up.</br>
</br>
Hurst's veins bulged. The shelf that swung in his hands flew to Lilith like an out of control windmill. On the other hand, two blades engulfed in flame slashed toward Lilith's side.</br>
</br>
The two attacks both slammed onto the silver eggshell at the same time, and with a muffled bang, there were layers of ripples on the silver metal surface.</br>
</br>
Hurst and Sakai's hearts sank at the same time.</br>
</br>
Just now, they had used 120% of their strength, but they still couldn't break through the defense of the girl in front of them.</br>
</br>
Sakai gritted her teeth and jumped back immediately.</br>
</br>
"Retreat—"</br>
</br>
She was only halfway before there was a spark, and the silver eggshell suddenly burst.</br>
</br>
The fragments of the explosion raged on the deserted street, engulfing the three people surrounding Lilith without any warning.</br>
</br>
Before he could even raise his arms to defend, he was hit by hundreds of fragments on his chest. Blood slowly oozed out of his mouth. He only felt that every inch of bone and every internal organ in his body was torn into pieces by this huge kinetic energy.</br>
</br>
Before his vision turned into darkness, he saw it with his last remaining consciousness.</br>
</br>
Sakai, who stood on the other side of him, had been blown up to the side of the road, with fist-sized blood holes all over her body. She couldn't be more dead.</br>
</br>
In the center of the explosion, Lilith glanced at the three people lying in a pool of blood like rags, and then glanced at the cobweb on the glass window of the extended limo in the supermarket. Although the power of that blow was immense, she carefully controlled the direction of the blast and did not injure the protected target.</br>
</br>
Lilith was about to leave.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, the roar of a helicopter came from afar, and a Blackhawk gradually emerged from the rain.</br>
</br>
A team of heavily armed SEALs in jet black special combat uniforms descended by rope. They surrounded Lilith with their rifles and locked on the expressionless girl.</br>
</br>
"Put down your weapon and put your hands on your head. Squat down immediately!"</br>
</br>
"This is the SEAL Team 5, we have arrived at the scene. The target has been successfully suppressed. Requesting next steps."</br>
</br>
While they communicated in the channel, two SEALs, with raised rifles, quickly approached Lilith with cautious steps.</br>
</br>
Lilith just wanted to say something, but then she noticed the Colombian President who was covered in blood under the shelf in the supermarket across the road.</br>
</br>
She turned on the life detection device and did not detect his life signals.</br>
</br>
She was slightly taken back when she saw the countless nervous and cautious sights behind the tactical eyepieces.</br>
</br>
The President of Xin was saved, but another president suffered an unfortunate fate.</br>
</br>
She suddenly realized that things seemed to be slowly getting out of her control.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"What should I do if a president is dead? This is an urgent question, please respond ASAP." (1)</br>
</br>
It was still late at night in Xin on the other side of the Pacific Ocean when this message was sent to Jiang Chen's watch.</br>
</br>
The watch on the bedside table beeped and woke Jiang Chen from his sleep. He loosened his arm from Ayesha's grasp, got up from the bed with sleepy eyes, and opened the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
When he saw Lilith's message, his sleepiness instantly vanished. He quickly put on his clothes and went to the office next door.</br>
</br>
"What the hell is going on? Which president died? Didn't I tell you to look after Zhang Yaping?" Jiang Chen asked with a headache as he looked at the expressionless Lilith.</br>
</br>
It may be that Jiang Chen's tone was too harsh, but Lilith began to explain quickly.</br>
</br>
"Zhang Yaping is probably fine... the Colombian President died."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
The Colombia President? What happened?</br>
</br>
"Wait," Jiang Chen pinched his eyebrows as he felt a growing headache, "Tell me everything that happened?"</br>
</br>
Lilith sighed and told him the whole story.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent for a long time and couldn't help but curse in his mind.</br>
</br>
He calculated every step but this one. Even now, he still didn't get why the Colombian President was in the Xin delegation vehicle. When did Colombia treat Xin so diligently?</br>
</br>
How did he know that everything was for the sake of 50 billion Xin New dollars...?</br>
</br>
"The assassins who planned and carried out the attack were the remnants of the Kurofune. A total of four people participated in the attack and all of them possessed some form of superpowers. Your intelligence was wrong, and it was not the CIB who did it," Lilith added.</br>
</br>
"If I say it was the CIB who did it, then it must have been the CIB. They must have done this." Jiang Chen rubbed his eyebrows as tried to subside his headache before he sat down. "Let's not talk about this. Where are you now?"</br>
</br>
"I am on a UA military helicopter now."</br>
</br>
"You were caught by the UA Army?" Jiang Chen was taken aback.</br>
</br>
"No, I just made them think they caught me. I followed them onto the helicopter and took care of everything." Lilith was extremely dissatisfied with Jiang Chen's choice of words as she corrected him while piloting the Black Hawk helicopter. "I have flown out of Bogota now, and will be in the rainforest of the western Andes in two hours. I have posted the specific latitude and longitude on your watch. Hurry up and send someone to pick me up."</br>
</br>
The SEAL Team 5 rappelled down on the streets of Bogota immediately controlled Lilith.</br>
</br>
Lilith obediently followed them onto the helicopter, and then took care of them all shortly after the helicopter took off. She kicked the pilot out of the cabin. She was in the pilot seat, turned off the GPS navigation system, grasped the control skillfully, and flew towards the Andes.</br>
</br>
</br>
"You can pilot helicopters?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
"Well, as long as I can look up the tutorial, this kind of variable does not trouble me," Lilith controlled the helicopter as she responded with swagger.</br>
</br>
"Do you still have enough fuel?"</br>
</br>
"There is about half a tank, what's wrong?" Lilith asked.</br>
</br>
"If you have enough fuel, go directly to Ecuador," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"I'm afraid I'll get shot down by air defense missiles at the border," Lilith replied.</br>
</br>
"Don't be afraid. I will contact Ecuador right now, and they will at least do this much for me." After Jiang Chen deliberated for a moment, he continued, "After you descend, immediately go to the nearest Xin Embassy or Consulate. I will let the people at the embassy know and someone will arrange for your return home as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
Regardless, the priority was to bring back this troublemaker.</br>
</br>
The rest was out of her control.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen ended the communication, he immediately contacted the Ecuador Embassy as well as the Colombia Embassy. After he made sure any problems Lilith could encounter were taken care of, he confirmed Zhang Yaping's status with the embassy.</br>
</br>
After he learned that President Zhang was fine, Jiang Chen was relieved. He hung up the phone and leaned back on his chair.</br>
</br>
The door of the room was pushed open. Ayesha, in her nightgown, brought two cups of hot cocoa in.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." He took the steaming hot cocoa from Ayesha, then took a sip. He felt somewhat refreshed as he looked at her apologetically, "I'm sorry I woke you up."</br>
</br>
"It's okay," Ayesha shook her head gently. She then walked behind Jiang Chen, placed her small hands on his shoulders, and whispered in a concerned tone, "What happened? You look very anxious."</br>
</br>
"Well, something happened on Lilith's side." Jiang Chen nodded, and then briefly recounted the tragedy that happened on the streets of Bogota just a few minutes ago.</br>
</br>
After she listened to the story, she pointed out the crux of the problem.</br>
</br>
"We must blame this on the CIB."</br>
</br>
"I think so too." With both hands surrounding the cup as he felt the warmth in his hands, Jiang Chen sorted out the thoughts in his head and said in a deep voice, "We must fabricate evidence that the CIB did this before they put the blame on us. We must ensure we can put the blame on them."</br>
</br>
In a few more hours, the tragedy in Bogota would make headlines in major media around the world. The president of a country was killed on the street, even in the chaotic Colombia, such a bloody and terrifying tragedy had never happened before.</br>
</br>
There were also pedestrians who were killed by the vehicles that lost control...</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen sat in the Capitol's position, he would probably not let this opportunity go, and would do everything possible to put this blame on Xin. Therefore, what Xin must do now is exactly what the UA is doing. He must get ahead of the CIB. He must take advantage of the fact that the international public's opinion does not have a preconceived impression of this incident and use the UA as a scapegoat.</br>
</br>
Even if the CIB could not be fully blamed for the incident, he must make this situation as messy as possible.</br>
</br>
As for the truth… it was not so important here.</br>
</br>
"I will go to Ghost Island now to overlook this case," Ayesha said seriously.</br>
</br>
"It's too late now." Jiang Chen glanced at the dark night outside the window.</br>
</br>
"We have to take the time difference into account. It's daytime in the UA," Ayesha shook her head and said softly, "From now on, every second is precious."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen responded to her resolute but gentle eyes; his Adam's apple moved slightly.</br>
</br>
There were a lot of thankful words to say, but when the words reached his lips, he swallowed them back and finally turned them all into sincere gratitude.</br>
</br>
"...Thank you."</br>
</br>
Ayesha smiled softly, turned, and walked out of the room.</br>
</br>
He looked at her figure disappear from the entrance before he put the cup full of hot cocoa on the table and leaned back on the chair. He then closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Columbia has become a gunpowder barrel.</br>
</br>
He was not worried about the situation in Colombia, but rather worried about the UA election.</br>
</br>
He had poured too many resources on Joseph Kennedy. If the diplomatic relations between the UA and Xin deteriorate, as a result, it would undoubtedly have a negative impact on Joseph's election.</br>
</br>
But if Xin chose to do nothing…</br>
</br>
After half a minute, he opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
He made up his mind. He clicked on the watch to call Ning Huajian, CEO of Future Technology. The media companies under Future Group were all controlled by Future Technology. After he woke Ning Huajian up, he personally assigned him the task.</br>
</br>
No matter the method, within an hour, he must see reports on the murder of the Colombian president on the official website of Future Technology and the headlines of its media groups. Moreover, all reports must have a clear orientation, that is, to subtly hint that the perpetrator of this incident was the UA...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1311: Igniting the Powder Keg</br>
</div></br>
</br>
53 minutes after the death of the Colombian President, the first report about the incident appeared in the Washington Post. Seven minutes later, Future Group's media quickly followed with a report on the incident based on first-hand information provided by the Xin Embassy staff in Colombia.</br>
</br>
The contents of the two reports were quite different. The UA and Xin had turned their spear against each other, and both held credible opinions.</br>
</br>
Someone with a little knowledge would have already sensed the unusualness.</br>
</br>
A battle over public opinion had quietly started over the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
Xin immediately stated that the unwarranted speculations reported by the UA media were unjustified, and Xin was also a victim of this incident!</br>
</br>
However, why would the UA accept the short end of the stick? The UA immediately said that even if Xin was not to blame, the UA would not accept any responsibility!</br>
</br>
Neither side conceded, and the intelligence personnel of the two countries also did not stop.</br>
</br>
Someone from the CIB got the authorization from the Colombian government and ran to the scene with perjury... Oh wait, collect evidence? Ghost Agents were not sitting around either. Although they did not receive authorization from the Colombian government, they obviously did not intend to submit a written application.</br>
</br>
There was constantly new evidence emerging, and for a while, Juan's cause of death had become complicated and confusing.</br>
</br>
Not until three days later, when the body of Agent Braddock was found by the Ghost Agents in an apartment not far from the incident, and they confirmed that his death was a result of hunger. In addition, Ghost Agents also found API armor-piercing incendiary for Barrett sniper rifle in this apartment. The same bullet was also found in the clock tower, and it was the CIB personnel who disclosed it to the media.</br>
</br>
It was still a mystery how the CIB agent got kidnapped.</br>
</br>
But it didn't matter. With the tools of the crime and the missing CIB agent being discovered at the same time, the UA had gradually become at a disadvantage in this battle. It may not be long before the media under Future Group would be able to use the UA as a scapegoat.</br>
</br>
However, nearly a week after the war of public opinion commenced between Xin and the UA, another event that shocked the world happened.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the 2016 ceasefire agreement, the FARC, which had died down, suddenly updated a two-minute video on its official website.</br>
</br>
At first, everyone thought that it was another advertisement for FARC's drug and hostage business. However, after people watched the video, everyone began to realize what it was not an advertisement, but a declaration of war!</br>
</br>
In the video, Timochenko, the current leader of FARC, declared war.</br>
</br>
An old man over the age of seventy was wearing a military uniform, had a cigar dangling from his mouth, and an AK-47 over his shoulder. In front of the world, with arrogance, he took a jab at the UA.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Juan's death is a conspiracy of the CIB, a conspiracy of the UA, a conspiracy from a sinful capitalist world."</br>
</br>
"I said a long time ago that the UA is unreliable. They are all liars and hypocrites. However, Mr. Juan obviously did not trust me. Very well, he has now paid a heavy price for his wrong choice."</br>
</br>
"The Colombian people will be truly free, and I will use my actions to prove that I am not joking."</br>
</br>
After he finished this sentence, Timochenko loaded the rifle with a click, and the video stopped.</br>
</br>
Honestly, those words did sound quite inspiring.</br>
</br>
It was just that the words "freedom" and "democracy" felt strange coming out of the mouth of a big drug dealer…</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
This video was posted on the official website half an hour after FARC attacked the Pamplona area on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. The old and cunning Timochenko fought an undeclared war against the government at the most chaotic moment in Colombia.</br>
</br>
Pamplona was just a small town, but its geographical location determined its importance.</br>
</br>
FARC's military power was concentrated in the tropical jungle east of the Andes, and Pamplona was a gateway between the east and the west of the mountains. Not only that, north of Pamplona was Cucuta, the capital of Colombia's Santander province and an economic town located on the border.</br>
</br>
If Cucuta fell into FARC control, FARC could get continuous support from Venezuela, and at the same time, it would smash the morale of the government.</br>
</br>
When guerrillas rushed out of the forest and the screams of mortars pierced the silent night sky. Most people in Pamplona were still asleep when the sound of explosions and gunshots outside the window awakened their sleep. Almost all of them thought they were dreaming.</br>
</br>
When guerrillas in camouflage uniformed lined up across the street, army-green trucks drove in one after another towards the square in the city center, the broadcasts of the propagandists resonated in the streets and alleys of the town, and masked soldiers came searching door-to-door for hidden government officials and government soldiers, the civilians finally realized that, like a dream, war had broken out.</br>
</br>
The FARC Fourth Mountain Brigade was responsible for attacking Pamplona.</br>
</br>
In less than fifteen minutes, they disintegrated the temporary line of defense set up by the local militia and police. They took complete control of the entire area from the town center to the suburbs.</br>
</br>
Half an hour after the outbreak of the war, the Colombian government and army quickly responded. Two infantry brigades set off from the military base on the border between Colombia and Venezuela and rushed to Pamplona. At the same time, the UA troops stationed at the military base in Karamanga also sent a reconnaissance company to the FARC-controlled area.</br>
</br>
However, because Pamplona was in a mountainous region, the terrain was rugged, the road condition was poor, and it was late at night. The Colombian Army itself was not in its most optimal state, and there was no guaranteed win when fighting against a group of drug lords. It was already four hours later when the two airborne brigades of the government army arrived on the outskirts of Pamplona.</br>
</br>
Four hours was enough for the rebels to do a lot.</br>
</br>
Temporary bunkers had been set up, FARC had hidden military supplies in residential houses, and had arranged machine gun firepower points along the buildings outside the town.</br>
</br>
Because the town's civilians had not yet evacuated, the government could not bombard the rebels in Pamplona. The UA planes just did two loops before they left.</br>
</br>
The two sides confronted each other in the suburbs for an hour, and it was not until nearly dawn that the senior army commanders surrounding Pamplona received the order to launch an attack on Pamplona and crush the rebels.</br>
</br>
However, after the armored vehicles of the government army drove into the town, the government forces realized that their nightmare had just begun.</br>
</br>
They were countless RPGs that greeted the armored vehicles, it seemed like the rockets did not cost any money.</br>
</br>
In order to win, these FARC rebels did not care about the consequences. They used all the weapons they could, including mortars and grenades that made the Colombian soldiers scramble. The tragic battle on the streets lasted for nearly two hours. After hundreds of casualties and several armored vehicles destroyed, the government soldiers had to withdraw from the town.</br>
</br>
Senior military commanders called the Colombian Presidential Palace and asked the Presidential Palace to decide whether if they should seek assistance from the UA military to send additional special forces, or to use heavy firepower against the rebels in the town... as either way, their current plan was not working. These FARC rebels were obviously not a group of stragglers, but elites supported by foreign forces.</br>
</br>
But how could the Colombian government have any ideas?</br>
</br>
The president just died. Congress was busy arguing. How could they take care of this mess?</br>
</br>
Just when the two sides were deadlocked in the Pamplona area, a small group of FARC guerrillas quietly mobilized along the Andes, as they targeted the busiest part of Colombia – the west coast...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1312: Armed Intervention</br>
</div></br>
</br>
FARC's declaration of war on the Colombian government forces not only shocked the UA, but also their advisors, Russia and Xin.</br>
</br>
Timochenko not only pushed the plan ahead by half a year, but he also didn't send a message before he pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
However, he couldn't take the entirety of the blame.</br>
</br>
Juan died at the hands of the CIB... Whether or not he really died because of the CIB, it was an excellent opportunity to attack the pro-UA government.</br>
</br>
The Colombian President was dead, the vice president was too incompetent to step in, thus the power struggle within the elites was escalating. The entire political situation in the country was in chaos and the popular support had plummeted...</br>
</br>
The excuse and the timing for a revolution were there. If he didn't use this opportunity, when would be a better time?</br>
</br>
With Timochenko's order, the FARC guerrillas active in the eastern tropical rain forest swarmed out and launched the largest offensive attack in the western region controlled by government forces in the 21st century.</br>
</br>
Wrapped in bullet chains and armed with light machine guns, the guerrillas rushed out of the tropical rainforest and swarmed the streets. They fired at any police vehicles they saw, which forced the Colombian police, with small pistols, unable to fend for themselves.</br>
</br>
The militia who came to support were no match either. They were forced to retreat, and soon the entire town was under the control of FARC.</br>
</br>
The same scene happened in different small towns at the foot of the Andes.</br>
</br>
This time Timochenko thoroughly implemented the strategy of besieging cities by taking control of the rural area first, as he executed guerrilla tactics to the extreme. The cities controlled by government forces were not touched at all, and the towns and villages with weak defense forces were his focus.</br>
</br>
As for the Colombian government forces, the situation could not be worse.</br>
</br>
To describe it in one word, it was chaotic.</br>
</br>
The vice president who had taken over for the president was a mascot. He did not have any influence in his party. If it weren't for Juan's death, he would never have the chance to become the president.</br>
</br>
However, even if he was a mascot, he was still the president. Not to mention a congress with a complex power structure, he couldn't even manage the issues within the party, let alone to solve the diplomatic crisis and and civil war?</br>
</br>
The battle in the Pamplona region was at a deadlock, the central area was once again in a guerrilla warfare. The Colombian government immediately dispatched an armored brigade to the Cucuta area north of Pamplona. On the one hand, the move was to calm the panic among the locals, and on the other hand, it was to prevent the FARC from taking control of this economic center.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, South America was in typhoon season, and heavy rains had continued for many days.</br>
</br>
The road conditions in the Andes were terrible to begin with, and the threat of thunderstorms and mudslides turned the entire mountain area into a nightmare for armored forces. Most of the tanks were stranded at the foot of the mountain. The armored brigade had to abandon the cumbersome heavy armor, and the infantries transported by trucks were the first to arrive at the Colombia border.</br>
</br>
</br>
More unfortunately, this armor brigade just happened to encounter the FARC guerrillas.</br>
</br>
A battle broke out in the heavy rain between the two sides.</br>
</br>
Both sides were elite forces, especially the Colombian side. Although two tank battalions were forced to stay behind, the armored vehicles were still effective. In the end, the victory was decided after FARC guerrillas were forced to retreat.</br>
</br>
As for who really won?</br>
</br>
It was hard to say.</br>
</br>
After countless hardships, this elite force finally arrived in the Cucuta area, which finally stabilized Colombia's control of the border. For the next while, it was unlikely for FARC to plan an attack on this city, but it was inevitable for the two sides to fight for the control of this area.</br>
</br>
Because this location was a shortcut to Venezuela, Timochenko was determined to control the city in order to receive armored units from Russia and Xin.</br>
</br>
At this point in the war, the areas controlled by both sides were already divided.</br>
</br>
The Colombia government forces controlled most of the country, while the guerrillas used the Andes to gain a hold of the mountainous region in central Colombia, as well as its traditional sphere of influence-parts of the deepest southern Amazon jungle.</br>
</br>
Here, it was worth mentioning the geographical environment of Colombia.</br>
</br>
The Andes was a dividing line that divided Colombia into two worlds.</br>
</br>
On the left was the bustling west coast, and on the right was the endless rainforest and grassland.</br>
</br>
On Google Maps, the crisscrossing highway network in the west created in sharp contrast with the bare east. It was not difficult to see the divided parts of the nation from the differences in the road network.</br>
</br>
Although Timochenko was a cruel and evil tyrant, and notorious for drug and hostage issues, he still received support in southeastern Colombia because his drug plantations concentrated in the southeast had greatly improved the living standards of local people.</br>
</br>
FARC's revolution did in fact draw in many young South Americans.</br>
</br>
If FARC's guerrillas took complete control of the Andes, it would inevitably cut off government control of the southern provinces, and there was no doubt the Colombian government would completely lose its influence. As a result, FARC could also take a large chunk out of Colombia's territory.</br>
</br>
And it was an outcome both the government and the UA did not want to see.</br>
</br>
Precisely to avoid this situation, just in the twenty-fourth hour when the FARC guerrillas launched a full-scale offensive against the Colombian government, the UA Capitol signed a special order and received an approval rate of more than 80%.</br>
</br>
The UA finally intervened.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Inside the flagship's bridge, Hogg gazed into the South American continent on the horizon through the heavy downpour and rumbling waves. His eagle-like eyes seemed to narrow, and from his face, it was difficult to tell what he was thinking about.</br>
</br>
On a Ford-class aircraft carrier not far away, the crew was busy. A fully loaded F35 slowly moved from the hangar onto the runway, and took off through the curtain of rain to the sky. Although its mission was only reconnaissance, if the situation required, it would not be stingy in pouring the flames of "justice" on the FARC.</br>
</br>
The UA invested heavily in order to save their backyard.</br>
</br>
The country not only dispatched the Ford-class aircraft carrier battle group that confronted Xin in the Western Pacific some time ago, but also dispatched a brigade of marines and an integrated aviation squadron.</br>
</br>
Yes, not just aircraft carriers, but also ground forces.</br>
</br>
In a rare occurrence that the Capitol and the Congress reached an consensus on sending ground forces, after they received the authorization from the current Colombia President (former vice president), they sent ground troops to Colombia for reinforcement.</br>
</br>
It seemed that this time the UA was not only planning to abuse their air superiority, but the country was also planning to run their tanks up for a lap.</br>
</br>
Even the aircraft carrier battle group was the latest Ford-class.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made a malicious speculation that the UA likely decided to use Columbia as a weapon testing ground to test the Ford-class aircraft carrier battle group's capability to provide ground support. After all, among all aircraft carriers, this latest Ford-class was the only class not tested by war.</br>
</br>
Of course, no matter what the UA's intentions were, the previously confident Timochenko was no longer certain about his decision when he saw the UA soldiers land on Colombian soil...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1313: The Constantly Ringing Phone</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"This is the wrong decision. It is an interference in the Colombian people's choice of their future! It is an act of aggression!"</br>
</br>
"If the Vietnam War failed to teach the arrogant UA a lesson, then feel free to come! This is the second Vietnam, and I promise that the steepness of the Andes will make them have a good rest at night. If they dare to set foot on the land of Colombia, I will make sure there is no return trip!"</br>
</br>
On TV, Timochenko shouted passionately into the interview microphone. With his saliva flying in the air, it was difficult to imagine he was a man over seventy.</br>
</br>
Of course, anyone could speak loudly, the difficult part was keeping the promise.</br>
</br>
On the second day after the UA soldiers landed in South America, Timochenko called Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
A few days ago, Jiang Chen wondered if he should give the man a call, but the phone call already arrived.</br>
</br>
As soon as the call was connected, Timochenko's voice, filled with urgency, went straight to the point.</br>
</br>
"I need your help!"</br>
</br>
The expected request was also the most troublesome request.</br>
</br>
"We can't directly send troops to South America. The Russians have told you from the beginning. Once the war starts, you can only rely on yourself." Jiang Chen sighed, "There is no doubt you chose the worst timing."</br>
</br>
"There is no better time! The President of Colombia was assassinated and the people of Colombia need a strong leader to seek justice, instead of inviting the murderer in and allowing the CIB to falsify the case!" Timochenko said indignantly.</br>
</br>
Is this an attempt to flatter him?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen counted it.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether he acted confused or was really confused, Celestial Trade did need to put the blame on the CIB.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, even so, Jiang Chen could not send ground troops to help him win this war.</br>
</br>
An orbital airborne brigade was not an option, at least not before the results of the UA election. Moreover, it was not worth the loss for the diplomatic strategy of Celestial Trade to touch the sensitive nerves of half of the South American countries for the sake of Columbia. The option of using Madagascar mercenaries was available, but they were reserved for Ayesha's "natal family."</br>
</br>
Some time ago, he asked Ivan to expand the scale of non-staff personnel, or contractor, but there was still less than half a month before the deadline. He couldn't just send the recruits to die?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's finger lightly tapped on the table, after a moment of thought, he said.</br>
</br>
"Although we cannot send troops directly to support you, we can send you some anti-aircraft artilleries and surface-to-air defense missiles."</br>
</br>
It may be laughable to fight F35s with obsolete anti-aircraft missiles and antiaircraft artillery, but these weapons could still interfere with airstrikes and deter them.</br>
</br>
It was impossible for the UA to invest too many ground forces in South America. The brigade of the Marine Corps was mostly there to help the government forces defend important cities and facilities. Airstrikes were inevitable the primary strategy for the UA and thus it was not difficult to imagine the difficulty of striking targets in mountains and rain forests.</br>
</br>
</br>
Timochenko's emotion was more stabilized after he heard Celestial Trade is willing to sell missiles, and he thanked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Even the SAM missiles from the past era would be extremely helpful to FARC. Although it was useless against the UA, it was more than enough to bully the Colombian Air Force. It was the 21st century, but the propeller planes were still in service with the Colombian Air Force.</br>
</br>
Without the proxy between Xin and the UA, the war between the two would be "child's play."</br>
</br>
"Take the Cucuta area, then these anti-aircraft missiles can be transported across the border. You can't expect anti-aircraft missiles to be transported through the mountains like rifles. Your only choice is to control a road to Venezuela," Jiang Chen emphasized again.</br>
</br>
Timochenko gritted his teeth</br>
</br>
"I'll try my best."</br>
</br>
"I don't want you to try. You must do it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
After he leaned back on the chair to rest for a while, he sat up again and called the Colombian Presidential Palace.</br>
</br>
In the past week, his phone didn't stop ringing, and they were all long-distance calls.</br>
</br>
There were calls from North America, Russia, and even Hua, but most of them were from South America.</br>
</br>
Some of these calls were made to the Xin Embassy in Colombia to confirm the current situation of the injured Zhang Yaping. The other calls were to the Colombian Congress, the Presidential Palace, and even the police station...In short, he was demanding them to release people.</br>
</br>
Release people?</br>
</br>
That's right.</br>
</br>
Release people!</br>
</br>
Just a week ago, after the tragedy in Bogota, the police in Bogota locked down the Xin Embassy. It threatened that the delegation of Xin was restricted from leaving the country until the murder investigation was clear.</br>
</br>
Travel restrictions?</br>
</br>
Are you kidding me?</br>
</br>
Also considered a suspect, the CIB not only could freely enter and leave the country, but it was also part of the investigation!</br>
</br>
The order was issued by the Colombian Congress, and the Bogota Police only acted on orders. As for the newly appointed Colombian President, because the transfer of power was too hasty, while he did promise to lift the restriction order as soon as possible, it was obvious that he could do very little in the current circumstance.</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen's increasingly harsh stance, he could only respond with "we're working hard" and "I will consider", and even started to drag this situation on.</br>
</br>
"I will give you seventy-two hours. If you don't allow my delegation to be released within seventy-two hours, we will let you know the cost of angering us!"</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen hung up, he looked at Ayesha, then immediately ordered, "I'll contact Ecuador to open the border, and immediately send Ghost Agents to pick up the people. They must withdraw all diplomatic personnel of Xin within the country in twenty-four hours."</br>
</br>
The seventy-two-hour notice was only used to paralyze the Columbia government. From the excuses of that president, Jiang Chen did not expect his delegation to be released any time soon. What's more, the restriction was likely a work of the behind the scene CIB.</br>
</br>
You dare to restrict my people?</br>
</br>
How foolish!</br>
</br>
Ayesha turned serious, then said softly.</br>
</br>
"If we encounter resistance?"</br>
</br>
"Execute!" He slammed on the table with force. After some thought, he tapped on the table, and then added, "Well, also, remember to put on the FARC armband, you understand what I mean."</br>
</br>
Anyway, since they were already in Celestial Trade's debt, it would cause no harm to just use their name for this. For the sake of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft artillery, they could also allow the FARC to bombard the suburbs of Bogota for a few rounds to attract the attention of the government forces to complete the story</br>
</br>
"Do I need to go there in person?"</br>
</br>
"No," Jiang Chen shook his head. "It's enough to send a few reliable agents. Now is a critical period, and you need to take command of the headquarters."</br>
</br>
"Then I will send Zhu Yu," Ayesha responded.</br>
</br>
"You can take care of this matter... By the way, ask her to bring Lilith back too."</br>
</br>
When he thought of Lilith, he had a headache.</br>
</br>
The little girl seemed to realize that she had gotten into trouble. She had been staying at the embassy for a while, afraid to come back.</br>
</br>
However, was that decision effective?</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen really wanted to punish her, he would have traveled back to the apocalypse and brought a hammer to the server room.</br>
</br>
The monk could run, but the temple couldn't run!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The sofa in the study of Xin Embassy in Ecuador was now occupied by a girl about twelve or thirteen years old. Just like an Internet Addict, she had a Phantom Helmet on as she laid there motionlessly.</br>
</br>
Since she arrived at the embassy more than a week ago, she claimed her territory in the study as her own.</br>
</br>
Footsteps could be heard coming downstairs.</br>
</br>
When Lilith heard the movement downstairs, she moved slightly, twisted her neck, and turned to the door.</br>
</br>
Unlike ordinary people, she still retained her senses to the outside world when she was connected to the Phantom Helmet.</br>
</br>
When she saw Zhu Yu and the others enter the study, Lilith's expression suddenly froze. It was as if she had guessed why they came.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu walked next to the sofa and looked at the little girl in front of her. It was difficult for her to draw the connection between a powerful individual who "killed four supernatural beings on her own plus a squad of SEALs" with her.</br>
</br>
She just looked like a NEET?</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu let out a sigh, kneeled down, and gently persuaded Lilith.</br>
</br>
"I'm here to take you home... When this mission is over, will you come home with me?"</br>
</br>
Lilith shook her head, and a scared expression appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
Although humans were no different from insects to the artifical intelligence, there was an exception; the man named Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As the only individual who stood out from many samples, Jiang Chen's quality as a "sample" was undoubtedly the best among the many "samples" she had seen. Although his combat power and IQ were not necessarily the best among the people she encountered, he was the "most interesting" for her.</br>
</br>
After they met again at Line 0, she was surprised by Jiang Chen's growth, but there was a hint of fear that she started to feel.</br>
</br>
Would artificial intelligence feel scared?</br>
</br>
Intermediate artificial intelligence may not, but advanced artificial intelligence certainly would.</br>
</br>
"If there is any difficulty, you can tell me, I will try to help you solve it," Zhu Yu sighed as she watched Lilith who refused to get up from the sofa, then she patiently explained, "Jiang Chen is worried about you, so he hopes you will go back soon."</br>
</br>
"Then can you make him not be upset?" Lilith immediately asked, "I'm afraid he will beat me."</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is not that kind of person," The female agent behind Zhu Yu immediately retorted.</br>
</br>
Like most Ghost Agents, they deeply respected, or even longed for the man who took them away from hunger and war and gave them a second life...</br>
</br>
"You are too naïve." Lilith eyed the woman, and then let out a sigh that was uncharacteristic for her age, and said slowly, "You don't know how much that man is—"</br>
</br>
"Ahem," Zhu Yu felt that she had to interrupt her, and coughed hard, "Miss Lilith, I will report every word you say to Jiang Chen. I can guarantee that he did not get mad because of the incident in Bogota. However, I can't guarantee his attitude won't change if you continue on this silly topic."</br>
</br>
</br>
Obviously, the last sentence worked.</br>
</br>
Lilith closed her mouth immediately.</br>
</br>
When she saw Zhu Yu's uncompromising expression, she knew that she couldn't stay here anymore, so she had to make a reluctant compromise.</br>
</br>
"Well, I can go back, but I have a request."</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu motioned her to continue with her eyes.</br>
</br>
Lilith slowly crawled up from the sofa, and then looked at the two at the door.</br>
</br>
"You are going to Colombia for a mission? Take me with you."</br>
</br>
"Little girl, we are not going to travel," The female agent behind Zhu Yu teased.</br>
</br>
"I know."</br>
</br>
Lilith nodded blankly and raised her right hand.</br>
</br>
In the horrified expression of the two, two silver metal balls flew out from her cuffs. Under the interference of the special force field, they rose from her palms and flew up and down, separated then condensed. Gradually, the flying speed of the metal ball became faster and faster, and it formed a flashing silver ring above her palm.</br>
</br>
A touch of splendor appeared in Zhu Yu's eyes.</br>
</br>
"You also have superpowers?"</br>
</br>
Although Zhu Yu didn't know about her special ability, but since Lilith was able to defeat the senior Kurofune members' trump cards, then it must be through the help of this silver metal sphere.</br>
</br>
"Well, it's not wrong to interpret it this way," Lilith said with her emotionless state after she recalled the balls into her sleeves. "It's very troublesome to explain specifically. In short, I can easily take care of a battalion. What do you think?"</br>
</br>
Advanced artificial intelligence and digitalized humans, all of which were considered the top secrets of Celestial Trade. Lilith of course would not disclose these secrets. As long as they believed her capability, the identity of someone possessing superpowers seemed more convenient.</br>
</br>
As for why she decided to follow Zhu Yu and the others on the mission, instead of waiting for them to come back to the embassy...</br>
</br>
Okay, Lilith was still a little worried that Jiang Chen is angry with her, so she thought it was an opportunity to make up for her mistake.</br>
</br>
Since she had nothing to do anyway.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After Zhu Yu requested permissions from Jiang Chen, she finally agreed to Lilith's request.</br>
</br>
Just as the group set off from the embassy and took a vehicle to the border between Colombia and Ecuador, another major incident occurred on the front line of the Colombian government army and FARC.</br>
</br>
That morning, the FARC guerrillas deployed north of the Andes suddenly launched a fierce offensive attack against the Cucuta area.</br>
</br>
Hundreds of mortars bombarded the city of Cucuta, where government troops were stationed. The FARC, which previously abided by international law, completely disregarded humanitarianism and international conventions.</br>
</br>
Thousands of FARC soldiers, like evil wolves, pounced toward the government forces under the cover of shelling. Smoke filled every corner of the city, and the gunfire never stopped for a second from the moment it began.</br>
</br>
The FARC's attack lasted for an entire day.</br>
</br>
The attack that started at five o'clock in the morning did not subside until the next morning.</br>
</br>
In just one day, both sides left thousands of corpses. There was no way to obtain the number of civilians killed in this battle.</br>
</br>
FARC surrounded the Colombian government troops stationed near the airport. Under the frenzied attack that disregarded casualty figures, victory may only be a matter of time.</br>
</br>
However, Timoshenko was not pleased with the results of this battle. He ordered the officers responsible for besieging the city of Cucuta to fully control the Cucuta region and the border between Colombia and Venezuela within twelve hours.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the landing of UA soldiers in Colombia stung his sensitive nerves, otherwise, he would not order this irresponsible or even manic battle.</br>
</br>
In order to get those anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft artilleries as soon as possible, he no longer cared about civilian casualties and his international image. If these anti-aircraft missiles were not deployed in the rainforests of the Andes as soon as possible, once the airstrikes began, it would be his real hell.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1315: Clash</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Bucaramanga, less than 50 kilometers away from Pamplona region controlled by FARC, was already the front line of the firefight between government forces and FARC. Every day, stray bullets fell into the suburbs of Bucaramanga. It was not difficult to discern the severity of the conflict in this area based on the nervous expression of the locals.</br>
</br>
Just one day ago, the UA Marines who landed from the west coast arrived in Bucaramanga.</br>
</br>
In less than a day, a temporary military base was already taking its shape.</br>
</br>
The large and small barracks were neatly located within the wire fence, and soldiers in jungle camouflage with rifles patrolled the base. LAV-25 armored vehicles were parked in the garages of the military base with their cannon raised up, and the wedge-shaped armor was equipped with digital camouflage reactive armor. Not far away on the tarmac, there was an AH-1 Cobra gunship with countless air-to-surface rockets equipped.</br>
</br>
Based on the equipment, the combat effectiveness of this unit was far superior compared to the FARC guerrillas.</br>
</br>
In the afternoon, a Hercules transport plane landed at the airport of the Bucaramanga military base. Another group of heavily armed Marines trotted out from the cabin and gathered in the open space beside the runway. They waited for the review and instruction from their officers.</br>
</br>
Agent Davis stood beside the runway and glanced at his watch.</br>
</br>
He did not wait for long before a burly soldier and a suited old man came towards him.</br>
</br>
He cleared his throat, extended his right hand, and was just about to introduce himself.</br>
</br>
However, the soldier did not intend to shake hands with him, he even interrupted his speech and got to the point.</br>
</br>
"Did you find the missing helicopter?"</br>
</br>
"We found it, although it was already a wreckage..." Davis's expression was a bit regretful, "In the border area between Colombia and Ecuador, we found the crashed helicopter. From the data on the black box—"</br>
</br>
"I don't care about the black box," Jonathan stared at David in the eyes, as he said one word at a time, "I just want to know where my people are now!"</br>
</br>
"There are bloodstains on the plane... If nothing is out of ordinary, they might have been killed in combat." Davis did not dare to look into Jonathan's eyes when he esponded. He coughed and with a hint of grief in his tone, "I'm sorry..."</br>
</br>
Jonathan stared at Davis for a long time. The corner of his mouth moved and then he tossed his green bag on his shoulder as he walked to the headquarters of the military base without looking back.</br>
</br>
Davis looked silently at the direction Jonathan went. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He could only shrug in the end to express his helplessness.</br>
</br>
"The soldiers lost in the last mission were the elites of Team Five, and they were all trained by Colonel Jonathan himself." The old man who had not spoken before walked to Davis's side and sighed, "He has prejudices against the CIB, but he means no harm. I hope you can forgive him."</br>
</br>
</br>
"I understand his feelings," Davis said, "but I still don't understand. Based on the SEAL's last communication, they had successfully suppressed the target at the time, why..."</br>
</br>
"I'm also confused." The old man watched Jonathan leave. He narrowed his eyes as if he was in the middle of his thought. "The little girl in the center of the explosion has the ability to manipulate liquid metal... This is completely beyond our understanding of the word 'supernatural power'."</br>
</br>
Supernatural powers had always been a research focus of the Department of Defense's Project Research Bureau. Especially after their existence was confirmed through the Kurofune, the amount of funding poured onto this project was increasing every year.</br>
</br>
However, even with supernatural powers, it was impossible to defeat the SEAL combat team in an instant, right?!</br>
</br>
"Is it magic?" Davis jokingly raised the question which was not funny.</br>
</br>
"I would rather believe that it is the dark technology of Celestial Trade." The old man shrugged, "To be honest, I don't feel any bit of surprise regardless of what new things they bring out."</br>
</br>
The old man sniffed, then withdrew his gaze from Jonathan's back and looked at Davis. He said, "The death of Agent Braddock is not important anymore, even the SEALs that suffered mysterious death... …The situation we are facing is probably more severe than last year's confrontation in the Western Pacific."</br>
</br>
"What do I need to do?" Davis asked solemnly.</br>
</br>
"This operation will involve squads of SEALs, led by Jonathan himself. You have worked in South America for many years so you should be familiar with the situation here. I hope you and your assistant will serve as intelligence support and action planning." The old man said.</br>
</br>
"Decapitation?" A look of sharpness quickly appeared in Davis's eyes, "But Timochenko is hiding in the mountains, no one knows where he is hiding."</br>
</br>
"It's not Timochenko, it's the Xin Embassy." The old man looked to the Cobra gunship that was taking off on the tarmac, and a sinister smile appeared. "To be precise, it is the ghosts preparing to save people."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Xin Embassy, Bogota.</br>
</br>
The heavily armed Colombian soldiers surrounded the embassy and even put up yellow lines as a cordon outside the embassy; ​they only left a small opening at the front entrance. There were two police assault vehicles parked at the main entrance, controlled by the Bogota Police. Everyone who entered or exited was questioned.</br>
</br>
Fully abided by the Geneva Convention, the Colombian people did not step into the embassy and they only placed the streets near the embassy under martial law. Obviously, even at this chaotic moment, they did not intend to turn their relationship with Xin even sourer.</br>
</br>
But then again, if Colombian soldiers really stepped into the embassy, ​​the Ghost Agents wouldn't be the ones paying them a visit, it would be the orbital airborne brigade.</br>
</br>
In the living room of the embassy, ​​Zhang Yaping with a bandage on his forehead did not appear in the best shape as he laid on the sofa. Obviously, the car crash did leave its marks, but fortunately, there was nothing serious with his injury, at least he could get out of bed.</br>
</br>
These days, his phone was about to explode based on the number of calls.</br>
</br>
Because Bogota Police requested the delegation to cooperate with the investigation and even took measures to restrict their travel, he was placed under house arrest in the embassy and had to cancel the rest of his South American trip. He even had to handle domestic affairs through satellite phones.</br>
</br>
No one was allowed to enter or leave the embassy.</br>
</br>
It was precisely this that when he saw Zhu Yu and the others, he was genuinely shocked.</br>
</br>
"Why are you here?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang asked me to take you home." With a rifle attached to the K2 kinetic skeleton, Zhu Yu sat on the sofa across from Zhang Yaping and gestured to the agent behind her to close the curtains.</br>
</br>
"What's the plan?" Zhang Yaping asked.</br>
</br>
"In one hour, the FARC guerrillas will launch a feint attack on the eastern suburbs of Bogota to attract the attention of the police and the garrison. We'll cover you to evacuate from the embassy. There is a helicopter in the western suburb, we'll board there."</br>
</br>
"We can't get out at all," Zhang Yaping shook his head and glanced at the closed curtains. "You saw it when you came in. There are all those people outside. I think there is at least a battalion."</br>
</br>
"There is only a company from the presidential palace. Lilith said she will take care of it."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping was taken aback when he heard the strange name.</br>
</br>
"Who is Lilith?"</br>
</br>
"The person who saved your life last time."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping's face suddenly turned green.</br>
</br>
What the fu*k? You call that saving me?!</br>
</br>
"Can I choose not to leave?" Zhang Yaping smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
It's good to stay here, at least it's not life-threatening.</br>
</br>
"You can call Mr. Jiang," Zhu Yu shrugged, "but my guess is his answer will probably be a no."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Bogota.</br>
</br>
On the roof of an apartment building just one kilometer across from Embassy Street, eight SEALs in urban camouflage were on standby. One of the snipers set up their sniper rifle, and another soldier opened his laptop and released the quadcopter drone from his backpack.</br>
</br>
"Do you think they will show up?" With the crosshair pointed at the Xin Embassy, the man wearing a beret moved his finger slightly and said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Outside the wall of the Xin Embassy in Colombia, Colombian soldiers with live ammunition had completely surrounded the entire building; not even a fly would be able to get in. However, everyone there knew that this level of security was sufficient to stop the living, but it could not stop the invisible "ghosts".</br>
</br>
Even so, it was not easy to save people from the watch of an entire company unit.</br>
</br>
Although the combat effectiveness of the Colombian government army was weak, the soldiers stationed at the Embassy Street belonged to the company serving the president. While their uniform appeared no different, they were the elites from the army. They were not comparable to the SEALs, but by the third world countries' standard, they were top-notch.</br>
</br>
"They will definitely show up," Jonathan said emotionlessly as he tuned the HK416 in his hands, "Forbearance is not their style or that of their boss."</br>
</br>
As a derivative of the carbine M4, the HK416 was undoubtedly much better than its older predecessor. The new version not only solved the problem that the gunpowder gas was easily transmitted to the gun, but it could also shoot underwater.</br>
</br>
In addition, cutting-edge individual equipment such as a heartbeat detector, infrared thermal imaging, nano-ceramic body armor, and special armor-piercing rounds armed these SEALs from teeth to toe. Even the Advanced Project Research Bureau of the Department of Defense designed a piece of specialized equipment against Ghost Agents. Although it was still in the experimental stage, it was part of their toolkit.</br>
</br>
The UA invested heavily in this operation.</br>
</br>
Xin delegation that absconded in fear of crime was caught by the SEAL team, and Celestial Trade agents were killed on the spot...</br>
</br>
When Jonathan thought about the headlines tomorrow, he got even more excited.</br>
</br>
From the very beginning, the CIB put pressure on the Colombian government to restrict the movement of the Xin delegation as it was all part of a ploy on Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
When the man on the roof saw that a window curtain was closed in a room of the Xin Embassy, his eyes narrowed and he adjusted the scope closer. Then, he pointed the crosshair directly at the entrance of the embassy</br>
</br>
But at this moment, an unexpected event suddenly happened.</br>
</br>
The air instantly became much colder, and a white mist gradually condensed in the air, and soon surrounded the entire city. The thick white mist covered everyone's vision with a layer of silk, and the man's visibility quickly dropped below ten meters.</br>
</br>
</br>
"SH*T!" The sniper cursed as he got up from the ground and put away the mounted sniper rifle.</br>
</br>
The sniper rifle clearly lost its purpose in this weather condition.</br>
</br>
"I've checked the weather forecast. It should be sunny today," the SEAL who had been on his laptop said, then closed the laptop and put it in his backpack. "If the weather forecast is not wrong, then something is clearly wrong."</br>
</br>
"Weather weapon?"</br>
</br>
"Maybe, maybe not."</br>
</br>
Jonathan's eyes narrowed as he listened to the discussion of his comrades. He looked up, sensed the coolness at the tip of his nose, and inexplicable anxiety seemed to appear in his mind.</br>
</br>
Intuition told him that this fog was not a coincidence.</br>
</br>
Before he could hesitate, he touched his tactical helmet and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Attention. Immediately enter combat position. Operation commences."</br>
</br>
And at this moment, there was a loud explosion from the suburbs.</br>
</br>
The flickering fire light and giant black smoke cone were visible even through the heavy fog.</br>
</br>
As if the city had noticed the abnormal situation outside the city, the alarms and sirens went wild on the streets. Vehicles and pedestrians rushed to the western part of the city. In front of the eminent threat of war, the traffic lights and traffic rules lost their effect, and the entire city turned into chaos.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jonathan was right, this fog was not a coincidence.</br>
</br>
Just ten minutes ago, the Seagull-class arrived above South America and launched hundreds of dry ice rockets at the capital of Colombia. After these dry ice rockets detonated under the clouds, the scattered dry ice quickly covered the entire province of Cundinamarca. Not only did the sunny day turn into dense fog, it even dropped the temperature of the entire area by five to ten degrees!</br>
</br>
It was hard to estimate how long the fog could last, but it was sufficient to cover the Xin delegation's evacuation.</br>
</br>
As soon as the fog appeared, Lilith began to move.</br>
</br>
The silver metal projectile was transformed into a frantic storm under the action of the electromagnetic force field, and more than ten lives were harvested in an instant.</br>
</br>
The Colombian soldiers immediately raised their rifles and started to react to the shocking event that unfolded in front of their eyes. However, as they were ready to fire back, Lilith had already moved to the next position under the cover of the fog and unleashed silver bullets from her fingertips.</br>
</br>
"SH*T! I'm shot!"</br>
</br>
"He's over there! Fire! Fire!"</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
There were screams and howls everywhere. Blood started to bloom in the misty street.</br>
</br>
The machine guns on top of the armored vehicle started to spew out bullets without the ability to consider friendly fire anymore. However, it was silenced after a flash of silver light quickly disappeared.</br>
</br>
With the commotion caused by Lilith, Ghost Agents blasted the walls of the embassy and took the Xin delegation out of the Colombian government soldiers' siege.</br>
</br>
"This is the Xin Embassy! We are under attack! Requesting backup... DAMMIT! THERE IS NO SIGNAL." An officer in another armored vehicle smashed the radio onto the ground as his eyes turned crimson from anger.</br>
</br>
Obviously, Xin detonated an EMP weapon and all unprotected electronic equipment was burned.</br>
</br>
With communication paralyzed, they had no chance to even resist the enemies that they couldn't even spot, let alone fight back. While gunshots continued to be fired, but only friendly soldiers collapsed.</br>
</br>
He could only pray that the gunshots could attract the attention of the local garrison and the police, and reinforcements could arrive earlier.</br>
</br>
However, his prayer was destined to be futile.</br>
</br>
Just as Lilith started, FARC responded to Jiang Chen's request and mobilized guerrillas lurking in Cundinamarca. In just five minutes, hundreds of mortar shells started to pour into the suburbs of Bogota.</br>
</br>
Although these shells did not fall on the heads of the Colombian military and police, they caused considerable panic in Bogota. With half of the city traffic in a paralyzed city, and the city's military and police on high alert, all the attention had been drawn to the outskirt of the city, how could they notice the noise on Embassy Street?</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu and three other "Ghosts" shot two soldiers that blocked their retreat, Zhang Yaping and four key members were moved outside and rushed into the parking lot of a shopping mall.</br>
</br>
Four modified black cars waited at the entrance of the parking lot .</br>
</br>
They quickly got into the cars, and soon the four cars drove out of the parking lot and separated into four paths toward the western suburbs.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu fastened her seat belt, put away her rifle, and pressed on her headset.</br>
</br>
"We have left Embassy Street, heading to the boarding point immediately!"</br>
</br>
"Roger." With one silver bullet penetrating a soldier aiming at her, Lilith, who was wearing a mask, recalled the silver droplets scattered on the ground. She ignored the bullets that were firing at her and quickly ran into the alley covered by fog.</br>
</br>
The remaining soldiers' eyes were fixated on the alley entrance, their minds debated furiously, but in the end, they did not choose to chase after.</br>
</br>
There was only one life; everyone was born to parents.</br>
</br>
They would not frown for one second if they fought against rebels, but against a monster that could kill them with one finger, the fact that they could stand there and not run away meant that they were already worthy of their military uniform...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1317: The Great Victory of Cucuta</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Jonathan and his team of SEALs advanced to the vicinity of the embassy, they only saw a messy battlefield.</br>
</br>
The wounded soldiers supported each other with their rifles and walked to the side of the road. Soldiers, laid on stretchers, were put into ambulances by medics and sent to the hospital for treatment. A scrapped armored vehicle rested in the middle of the road, and the cratered bullet holes on the armor surface told of the tragedy that happened.</br>
</br>
Jonathan's brows twitched as he examined the destroyed armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
The sniper next to him stepped forward and touched the inverted steel plate and was shocked. He was usually a talkative one, but not a word came out of him at this moment. The rest of the SEALs' mood was also down as they disguised their thoughts and emotions.</br>
</br>
His clenched fists loosened.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Jonathan was suddenly rejoiced that he was, fortunately, a beat behind.</br>
</br>
They obviously underestimated the strength of the Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
It took less than five minutes to beat an elite enhanced company. Jonathan questioned that even the legendary SEAL Team 6 might not be capable of this same feat.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"The delegation has successfully boarded and is moving towards the Ecuador border," Ayesha looked to Jiang Chen after she had just hung up the phone, "Following your request, we left pieces of evidence leading to FARC."</br>
</br>
"Very good." Jiang Chen smiled and nodded. "Prepare five thousand rifles and two hundred boxes of ammunition to be sent to the space elevator. I will arrange two Stingray C-1s to pass over South America to parachute these weapons to the FARC-occupied area through the orbit."</br>
</br>
"Why use Stingrays? If it's just light weapons, we can transport them across the border," Ayesha questioned.</br>
</br>
"Because I want them to see." Jiang Chen's finger tapped on the armrest of the sofa and he smiled.</br>
</br>
On the one hand, it was to make the plot as realistic as possible, to fake the entire "rescue operation" as FARC's action, and Xin was just the employer. On the other hand, it also served as a warning to the UA. If the situation in Colombia continued to escalate, Celestial Trade reserved the option of using space weapons to "resolve disputes".</br>
</br>
While the two spoke, another piece of good news came from Columbia.</br>
</br>
Timochenko successfully took control of the city of Cucuta on the border between Colombia and Venezuela with the Sixth Mountain Brigade. Now, he had successfully took grasp of the road leading to the Venezuelan border.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen learned of this good news, he immediately called Ivan and asked him to prepare the "shipment" at Celestial Trade's Venezuelan office.</br>
</br>
The next day, forty SAM-3 anti-aircraft missiles and missile launchers set off from the Venezuelan warehouse and quickly arrived in Timochenko's hands. Full of joy, the dictator even gave a call to express his gratitude for the generous assistance.</br>
</br>
</br>
One party was happy, the other one was sad.</br>
</br>
In contrast, the UA was not in the best mood.</br>
</br>
The Xin delegation slipped away under their noses. The company stationed at the Colombian Presidential Palace who was responsible for "peacekeeping" outside the embassy was completely crippled. If it were not for the SEALs that showed up and prevented any casualties, this operation could be described as a complete fiasco.</br>
</br>
Shame!</br>
</br>
Originally, the plan was to use Ghost Agents and "fleeing" Xin delegation as scapegoats for the death of the Colombian President, as well as obtain a few "invisibility cloaks" back to the Advanced Projects Agency for research. After Mr. Henry, the director of the CIB, learned that the mission failed, he almost suffered from internal injuries due to his anger.</br>
</br>
With the office door closed, he scolded all the responsible subordinates to finally alleviate his rage.</br>
</br>
However, the anger that was finally quelled was ignited again because of a piece of information from the frontline.</br>
</br>
Just an hour ago, two F35s took off from the Ford-class aircraft carrier. The original plan was to launch an airstrike in the Pamplona area. However, when they reached the target airspace, the airstrike plan had to be canceled.</br>
</br>
FARC was equipped with anti-aircraft missiles!</br>
</br>
Although SAM was not enough to threaten the fifth-generation fighter, when the fighter was locked by radar, it was impossible to carry out ground strikes.</br>
</br>
After the F35s returned, Hogg, the captain of the carrier battle group, immediately phoned the relevant person in charge of the CIB and asked them why they did not provide such a critical piece of intelligence.</br>
</br>
"Find out for me! Where did these missiles come from, and how were they transported into the hands of the rebels!" Henry banged his fist on the table as he furiously roared at his subordinates.</br>
</br>
They were all silent while they looked at each other in fear.</br>
</br>
In their memory, the boss never seemed to get angry, and had always been a polite gentleman. However, now, his appearance was nowhere close to that of a gentleman, he was more like an angry lion.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the continuous frustrations from the same place made him lose his rationality.</br>
</br>
"No need to check, the missile is SAM-3. It entered Colombia through the Venezuelan border through the FARC-controlled Cucuta. As for who sold it to them...who else?" Baird glanced at his colleagues who did not dare to make a sound as he bit the bullet and responded.</br>
</br>
Apart from Celestial Trade, who else would dare to risk angering the UA and sell missiles to FARC? Who else had the motive to support the FARC Revolution?</br>
</br>
However, even if he knew this, Henry had no alternative.</br>
</br>
In addition to options other than war, the most effective solution was economic sanctions. However, Celestial Trade's profitable sectors were the space elevator and the global power grid. Sanctions to the former would cause more damage to companies in the UA, while the latter did not even expand to North America at all.</br>
</br>
Sanctions against Future Group?</br>
</br>
The Ministry of Commerce certainly tried this before. What happened? The politicians in the Capitol almost couldn't get to work because of the protesters.</br>
</br>
It may be more difficult for their people to quit the high-tech products of Future Technology than for them to quit weed and alcohol.</br>
</br>
Henry was frustrated, but there was nothing he could do. And the same sentiment was shared by almost all of Capitol's politicians at this moment.</br>
</br>
Hill pinched her sore eyebrows to ease a headache as she read the report written by Hogg. The wrinkles at the corner of her eyes seemed to increase.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade is plotting South America," In front of the president's desk, Kerry asserted, "We cannot lose Colombia, otherwise no one can stop their tentacles from reaching our back garden!"</br>
</br>
Politics in the UA was so strange. Political opponents who were still attacking each other in the media one second before may appear in the same trench the next second. For example, Kerry, who had just lost the preliminary election, was making suggestions to Hill on the South American issue. While it was partially due to the fact that the cabinet lacked talent, it was also a show of mutual compromise.</br>
</br>
"Anyone can see their intentions, but the question is what should we do?" Hill said with a headache.</br>
</br>
"The crux of the problem is the outcome of this war," Kerry said solemnly. "As long as the Colombian government forces defeat the FARC rebels through military means, everything else is easy."</br>
</br>
"You mean..." Fill frowned.</br>
</br>
"We have to give a hand to our little friend," Kerry said.</br>
</br>
"We have sent an aircraft carrier battle group and a ground force there. This is the limit that Congress is willing to accept, and it is also the limit of our budget," Hill shook her head. "We can't send more ground troops in this war that does not belong to us."</br>
</br>
"Did I say to increase the number of troops?" A grin appeared on Kerry's face, "I mean, we can ask our allies..."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"...We have emphasized countless times that the incident in the Cucuta region is unacceptable and unforgivable. We regret the fact that Hua and Russia voted against the UN proposal. Here, I reiterate that NATO will not abandon its allies, nor will it tolerate a group of criminals trying to overthrow democracy!"</br>
</br>
At the press conference, the Secretary General of NATO made a stern statement in front of the reporters.</br>
</br>
Based on the hostile tone in his voice, many people sensed something big was about to unfold.</br>
</br>
During the question session, reporters targeted all different kinds of questions.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Stottenberg, what do you think about FARC's statement on the civilian casualties caused by the UA airstrikes?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Stottenberg, is NATO going to militarily interfere in the Colombian Civil War?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Stottenberg did not reveal an extra word in front of the eager reporters. He repeatedly emphasized what was mentioned in the previous statement, and reiterated NATO's position on the Colombian issue. He did not reveal any intent on the use of military units against FARC.</br>
</br>
However, on the second day after the press conference ended, NATO suddenly took action.</br>
</br>
On June 10, NATO countries including Britain, France, Italy, and Turkey declared war on FARC, announcing that they would send coalition forces to join the Colombian government to suppress FARC's illegal revolution.</br>
</br>
Code Name: "Torch".</br>
</br>
Seventy thousand NATO coalition forces boarded ships in different ports and would soon cross the Atlantic Ocean. They would gather at Barranquilla, the largest port on the north coast of Colombia.</br>
</br>
Turkey was the most enthusiastic country. Almost on the day of the declaration of war, it sent an expeditionary force to respond to this "just war".</br>
</br>
It was anxious to emphasize their own presence in NATO, as a plan to add bargaining chips to join the European Union. Among the 70,000 coalition forces, half came from Turkey.</br>
</br>
A South American version of the Desert Storm was brewing along the Gulf of Mexico.</br>
</br>
With multiple countries participating in the coalition forces, the scale of the war seemed to have tilted towards the Colombian government. It was difficult to say what the final outcome is. Would it be FARC collapsing under the rampage of the coalition forces, or would the Andes and the Amazon become a nightmare for the nations?</br>
</br>
The situation in Colombia seemed to be heading out of control from the very beginning. The UA's decision to pull NATO into this war completely surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He was also conflicted.</br>
</br>
Should he also join the fray?</br>
</br>
It was a question worth debating over.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the day when NATO announced its intervention in the civil war, the ill-fated Xin delegation ended its South American trip ahead of schedule, and the plane safely landed at Coro Airport. Because of Zhang Yaping's forehead injury, the Presidential Palace did not invite any media and ended the visit in a very low-key manner.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the VIP passage of the airport, Jiang Chen gave Zhang Yaping a hug and patted him on the shoulder, as he comforted him.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I was too negligent this time."</br>
</br>
"This is not your fault. Who would have thought that something so...so mysterious would happen." It took Zhang Yaping a while to search for a suitable word and he shook his head with a wry smile.</br>
</br>
For ordinary people, supernatural powers were indeed very mysterious.</br>
</br>
Even in the 22nd century, the scientific community had only limited knowledge about Klein particles. Particles active in the fourth dimension were like magic to humans living in the third dimension. Even Lin Lin, who was quite knowledgeable in related fields, could not sum up a suitable theorem to define the particles like ghosts.</br>
</br>
How did Harmony's colonization ship, which was the "black ship" in the Kurofune, train so many cultists with supernatural powers remained a mystery. Jiang Chen knew that the UA must also be studying this mystery, and was also as clueless...</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen put Zhang Yaping into the car, he looked at Lilith who had been silently standing behind Zhu Yu.</br>
</br>
Lilith seemed to have noticed Jiang Chen's sly expression, as her movement seemed somewhat stiff. She subtly looked away and then poked Zhu Yu.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu remembered the promise she made before they returned, after a moment of hesitation, she stepped forward half a step and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Miss Lilith helped us a lot while covering the retreat of the delegation. She hopes that... you will not be angry about her previous mistakes in South America."</br>
</br>
"Well, I see," Jiang Chen nodded to Zhu Yu and the three other Ghost Agents behind her and smiled. "Your mission in South America was very well executed. Thanks to you, the stranded delegation can finally return home safely."</br>
</br>
"It is our honor to serve you," Zhu Yu humbly said.</br>
</br>
"You can rest over these next few days. I will let Ayesha give you a long vacation," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Then, Zhu Yu and the three other Ghost Agents left the VIP passage of the airport.</br>
</br>
While Lilith tried to act low-key as she attempted to quietly leave with Zhu Yu, Jiang Chen obviously did not ignore her existence as he blocked her.</br>
</br>
"Miss Lilith, where are you going?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Contrary to Lilith's expectation, Jiang Chen did not blame her for her mistakes in Colombia and did not even mention what happened. He just asked her to put on her seat belt after getting in the car.</br>
</br>
The elevation gradually increased, and the Luer quickly ascended into the first-speed maglev lane and drove toward the highway outside the airport.</br>
</br>
The tip of Lilith's nose was stuck to the car window as she looked at the scenery quickly disappearing behind her, as she suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"Can I ask you a question?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead," Jiang Chen said casually.</br>
</br>
"Is it troublesome for a program to have its own thoughts?" Lilith asked as she looked at Jiang Chen for an answer</br>
</br>
"Troublesome? You could say that," Jiang Chen responded casually as he controlled the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
"Really."</br>
</br>
Lilith nodded blankly without speaking any more, it was difficult to tell what was going on in her mind.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at Lilith and then looked forward again, and continued.</br>
</br>
"Because once a program has its own thoughts, people can no longer use it as a tool, which is contrary to the original intention when people invented the program. The tool itself is only to make life more convenient, not to make it troublesome."</br>
</br>
Lilith raised her head and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You said something very interesting, it's very unlike you."</br>
</br>
"Unlike the usual me," Jiang Chen smiled, and he turned the steering wheel. "Occasionally, I'll say something that even I don't even understand."</br>
</br>
"There is one more question. About your last sentence, I can interpret it as...for you, am I not just a tool?" Lilith asked blankly, in her same expressionless state.</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Jiang Chen nodded, still smiling.</br>
</br>
"Really."</br>
</br>
After Lilith said this, she stopped talking for the rest of the way.</br>
</br>
Although she still had the same energy-saving expression, instinct told Jiang Chen that she seemed to be in a good mood?</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Lilith's return did not bring much change to the mansion.</br>
</br>
She remained in the same position, which was lying on the sofa with her Phantom Helmet on, for eighty percent of the day. If she was not in the living room, then she was in Jiang Chen's office. There was no need to eat or go to the washroom. From this perspective, the digitalized human's body was quite convenient...</br>
</br>
Time passed day by day, and it was soon June 15th, five days after Lilith had returned home.</br>
</br>
Unsurprisingly, Timochenko called again.</br>
</br>
The NATO Coalition Force was fully prepared and on the aggression. Although the troop carrier had yet to enter the Gulf of Mexico, the thought alone frightened him every day.</br>
</br>
When FARC publically stated it was 140,000 soldiers strong, its modern army force was less than 20,000 people. With the support of Russia and Xin, FARC could easily defeat the Colombian government force. However, against the well-equipped and well-trained NATO Coalition Force, they stood no chance.</br>
</br>
Timochenko wanted to pull Celestial Trade into the Colombian Civil War, but it was impossible before the results of the UA election.</br>
</br>
"If you can hold your ground until the end of November, I can consider launching an orbital airborne brigade to Colombia," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"The end of November?" Timochenko's face turned a bit sour, "Five months? You just gave me a tough problem."</br>
</br>
"Ha, who has been giving us problems? It's you! If you waited until November before you tore the peace deal, I promise it would not take a month for you to be the new president!" Jiang Chen couldn't stand the facts as he scolded him.</br>
</br>
Timochenko smiled bitterly. When the SEAL Team 5 went to South America and Abel Torres tragically died on the street, he thought the CIB had learned of his plot, and hurriedly seized the opportunity when the Colombian President was assassinated. However, who would have thought that from the beginning these two things were not connected at all.</br>
</br>
The SEALs went to South America for a missing agent, and Torres died because he provoked Celestial Trade...</br>
</br>
A series of coincidences led to the current situation, and it was futile to point fingers. At this moment, even the CIB probably didn't expect that tracking down a missing agent and a Colombian drug lord could lead to this conspiracy.</br>
</br>
"My friend, it doesn't make sense to discuss whose issue it is now," Timochenko said with a cheeky sophistry. "I admit that in some places I may be a little ill-conceived. I promise that I will discuss with you in the future... but what should I do now?"</br>
</br>
"Turn offensive to defensive. I'll transport you another batch of arms. You should try to arm as many soldiers as soon as possible," Jiang Chen tapped on the desk as he continued. "If you can't hold the city, just give it up, withdraw to the Andes, and carry out guerrilla warfare to the end. Even if NATO tanks are powerful, they can't fly, right? Don't tell me you can't beat NATO using guerrilla warfare."</br>
</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen slammed down the phone, he leaned back on to the chair, looked up to the ceiling, and let out a long sigh.</br>
</br>
"Is there something troubling you?" Lilith, who was lying on the sofa, proactively asked him for the first time.</br>
</br>
"Somewhat."</br>
</br>
"Can I help?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"How are you so certain?" Lilith asked blankly. "Based on the existing intelligence and the analysis of the content of your previous conversation, the one thing that can annoy you so much is probably the NATO Coalition Force. Am I right?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows, sat up from the chair, and looked at Lilith with intrigue.</br>
</br>
"Yes, what do you think?"</br>
</br>
"Since the UA has already mobilized its allies to participate in the war, why don't you also ask your allies?" Lilith asked.</br>
</br>
"Russia's position is similar to ours. Sending weapons to FARC for us is their limit. It is impossible for them to send soldiers to the other side of the Earth to fight for someone else's interests." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
As for Hua...</br>
</br>
Based on their neutral position, it was even more improbable for them to join this mess.</br>
</br>
"Are your allies only Russia and Hua?" Lilith asked rhetorically.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was taken aback for a moment. He first frowned and then suddenly hit his head.</br>
</br>
Right!</br>
</br>
If she didn't mention it, I would have forgotten I still have so many little brothers!</br>
</br>
Without hesitation, Jiang Chen immediately called Santos.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Since MLL Island became independent from Country F, the dictator's life had been incredible, not inferior to the leader in North Korea. With over 800,000 army troops, millions of reserves, countless guns, ammunition, tanks, and artilleries, the majority of his weapons were aid from Celestial Trade in the form of loans in the Moro-Country F War.</br>
</br>
These pieces of equipment, just like Moro soldiers, were collecting dust in the barracks. When Santos heard that Jiang Chen planned to hire his army at an "appropriate price", General Santos immediately agreed.</br>
</br>
But when he heard that the destination was in South America and the opponent was the NATO Coalition Force, the dictator started to hesitate...</br>
</br>
"The opponent is the NATO coalition?" His hand tembled as he tried to hold the phone. Then, Santos started to sweat. "I...I just want to help, but I can't beat them."</br>
</br>
"Why not? Would I let you lose while fighting with my equipment? Plus, the tropical rain forest environment in Colombia is exactly the same as your island. Guerrilla warfare is also your specialty. It's not like I'm making you go into direct battle with NATO's armored division."</br>
</br>
"If NATO brings the aircraft carrier to my door..." Santos hesitated.</br>
</br>
"NATO won't do that. South Asia is our home ground. If they dare to extend the war to the Western Pacific, I promise it'll be a one-way trip!" Jiang Chen said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
Santos nodded. "Well then, I'll just do as you said."</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen's assurance, he was completely relieved.</br>
</br>
It meant no matter how much trouble he caused, the fire won't burn him.</br>
</br>
Consuming excess weapon inventory, using NATO to gain prestige, this decision seemed to be a good choice? What's more, he could earn some "foreign exchange" from Celestial Trade. After he hung up the phone, Santos even started debating what he should say to the reporters to reflect the righteousness of the Moro Army and to highlight his impeccable leadership qualities...</br>
</br>
With Moro to make the water even cloudier, FARC was saved.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen, who just gained a brand new strategy, was not satisfied.</br>
</br>
Santos alone was not enough, he must drag someone else into the water.</br>
</br>
After he debated for a while, an idea appeared and he immediately called.</br>
</br>
Since South America was already in a mess ahead of schedule, then let's turn the global situation even messier.</br>
</br>
Especially Turkey, which made up half of the coalition forces.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't think that with a fire on its doorstep, Turkey would still be willing to cause chaos elsewhere.</br>
</br>
It was time for Syria!</br>

</br>
As soon as the phone was connected, Yerif's hearty laugh echoed in his ear.</br>
</br>
"My old friend, you finally remembered me."</br>
</br>
"It's been busy these days." Jiang Chen laughed along.</br>
</br>
"I can feel it," Yerif nodded, "I have been paying attention to Colombia recently. With all due respect, you don't seem to be in an optimistic position?"</br>
</br>
"It depends on how you define the word optimistic," Jiang Chen said. "Since you are keeping an eye on it, you might as well wait two days to see what will happen next."</br>
</br>
"Really? I knew you'd still have some cards hidden up your sleeves." Yerif laughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, and then said, "You'll see in the news. For now, let's talk about business."</br>
</br>
"The plan has been pushed ahead?" Yeirf had already sensed the purpose of the call.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded and leaned back in his chair. "We're ready. Ten thousand mercenaries have been assembled in the port of Madagascar and they are ready to set off for the Red Sea."</br>
</br>
"Are you sure this is the right time?" Yerif asked.</br>
</br>
"There is no better time than now. If we wait till the end of the year, the variables would be more uncertain," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
NATO's eyes were completely focused on South America. At this moment, even if a big shift happened in Syria, it was unlikely for the UA to create a second battlefield in the Middle East.</br>
</br>
The only possible risk was that intervening in Syria could potentially offset the regional balance in the area. However, based on the consideration that Celestial Trade did not plan to be heavily involved, even if the balance was tipped, Jiang Chen would not be the one having a headache.</br>
</br>
Yerif rubbed his beard and after a moment of thought, he said.</br>
</br>
"You can register a shell company in Madagascar. I will use my import and export company to sign a fruit import agreement with your shell company. Five large cargo ships will depart from Jeddah to the port of Madagascar. Just let your people board my cargo ships with fruit at that time. The UA has been patrolling the Gulf of Aden, but they usually don't touch the ships of the Saudi Royal Family. It's just that your people have to squeeze into the containers."</br>
</br>
"No problem, that is nothing to them," Jiang Chen said softly, "I'll get someone to look after the shell company today, and it can be done by tomorrow afternoon. Get your ships to set off as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
"This is not something that can be rushed," Yerif said, then shook his head, "It takes about three working days to complete the necessary processes. If we can follow the formal procedures, we should try to follow the formal procedures. You don't want to be targeted by the CIB."</br>
</br>
"Then you decide the time," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Yerif thought for a moment, then said.</br>
</br>
"July 1st. It is more fitting for it to be at the start of the month."</br>
</br>
"Great." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Well, I wish you all the best in your plan," Yeirf also laughed along and said in a relaxed tone, "I'm still waiting for you to fulfill your promise and transform my country into an oasis."</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On June 27th, NATO Coalition Force crossed the Atlantic and landed in South America.</br>
</br>
After the coalition forces disembarked at the port of Barranquilla, they immediately proceeded to the front line between the Colombian government and the FARC rebels - Bucaramanga. About half a month ago, the UA Marine Corps had already established a temporary military base and airport runway here. At this moment, it was used to house the coalition forces.</br>
</br>
In less than a week, the UA had mobilized many of its allies to participate in the war, and the total force now exceeded 90,000. Even South Korea sent dozens of people to participate in the fun as a response to the UA's call.</br>
</br>
And while NATO was busy rallying to Colombia, Jiang Chen was also busy.</br>
</br>
Moro's soldiers had quietly set off, in batches, to the New Moon Island military base.</br>
</br>
A total of 200,000 soldiers were divided into two groups on New Moon Island. A small number of people took-off in a large military transport plane directly to the FARC-controlled Cucuta Airport, while most of the remaining soldiers boarded a transport ship to Venezuela under the escort of the Celestial Trade Navy.</br>
</br>
Santos commanded a total of 800,000 troops, and he dispatched a quarter of his country's army at once, which demonstrated his willingness.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didn't treat him poorly either.</br>
</br>
Not only the military expenses for this expedition were borne by Celestial Trade, but Celestial Trade also gave Moro 2 billion XND in "compensation" based on the headcount, which was equivalent to ten thousand dollars for each soldier. This may be a drop in the bucket for Celestial Trade, but it was undoubtedly a huge sum of money for Moro, which was in desperate need of foreign exchange.</br>
</br>
The tit-for-tat confrontation between the UA and Xin on the South American issue pushed the global political situation on a knife's edge. With a little carelessness, the two powerful giants may end up in a conflict. If one of the sides failed to remain rational, it could potentially trigger a worldwide disaster.</br>
</br>
However, almost all international commentators in the world shared a pessimism about future prospects.</br>
</br>
The reason was very simple, because Celestial Trade's leader did not behave like a politician at all.</br>
</br>
He did not possess the rationality, compromise, and forbearing qualities that a politician should possess, and all his actions never considered any political significance, because he was not a politician himself, and his country's congress and the president did not have any constraint on his power. His first response to the Xin delegation's movement restriction was not through diplomatic channels, but to directly deploy special forces. He even shamelessly used the local rebels as scapegoats in the end while he claimed that he only spent money to purchase the "hostages" back.</br>
</br>
No one believed that a group of guerrillas could enter the city center without being detected, and completely cripple a company of soldiers!</br>
</br>
However, FARC was happy to be the scapegoat without feeling shameless at all. On the contrary, it left Colombia and the UA speechless, as well as the commentators that closely followed this incident.</br>
</br>
In five months, it was the UA general election.</br>
</br>
The overlord of the old world would elect its ruler.</br>
</br>
Based on the current polls, Joseph Kennedy's approval rate was slightly higher than the Internet celebrity Mr. Trump. However, what surprised the UA citizens was that after several debates, Trump's approval rating rose instead of fell.</br>
</br>
Curses, offensive comments, ridicules, and black humor filled this election. The televised debate that ended just now could only be described as "a mess". People all over the world were paying close attention to this election to see what else the seemingly careless new candidate had to say.</br>
</br>
At least one thing, whether correct or not, most people, especially young people, agreed.</br>
</br>
Hua took away their jobs, Xin took away their hegemony, and the UA was in decline. The UA should strengthen its strategic deployment in the Pacific. If an aircraft carrier battle group was not sufficient, then send a few more.</br>
</br>
Then, a tough president would negotiate with them.</br>
</br>
Also, the UA should indeed restrict immigration.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1321: Moro Intervention</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On July 1st, three days after the NATO Coalition Force landed in South America, a press conference was held in Moro.</br>
</br>
"Moro sympathizes with what FARC has experienced. The people of Colombia's southern provinces have the right to choose their own destiny. If the fake politicians do not give them this opportunity, they have the right to defend their rights."</br>
</br>
"The MLL people have suffered because of Western countries' unjust intervention. We have spent half a century of blood in exchange for a hard-won victory. We know how difficult it is. During this difficult era, someone should stand up and say no to those gesticulating villains. If there is no one, then we should stand up and carry the banner of justice."</br>
</br>
"We condemn NATO's decision to interfere in Colombia that bypassed the United Nations. Obtaining the authorization of the country concerned does not mean that NATO has obtained the consent of all citizens of the country concerned. If NATO really, as they advertise, support democracy, sovereignty, and freedom, then they should promote freedom, not escalate the war."</br>
</br>
Many countries condemned the NATO Coalition Force. After all, the NATO Coalition Force bypassed the UN Security Council after the United Nations vote failed to gain approval. They used the trick by obtaining authorization from the Colombian Congress to participate in the civil war.</br>
</br>
It made no sense in legal terms.</br>
</br>
However, just like the Iraq War in 2003, the UA, knowing that it could not obtain the authorization of the United Nations, directly bypassed the United Nations and declared war on Iraq through NATO.</br>
</br>
It was impossible to use rationality to approach international affairs.</br>
</br>
Because hegemony ruled above legal principles.</br>
</br>
So far, Santos's speech was still above average. Some reporters at the press conference even started to yawn, and jotted down "Moro condemned the NATO Coalition Force today."</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, Santos turned the speech to the next page, cleared his throat, and declared.</br>
</br>
"... Moro will send volunteer soldiers to FARC to defend independence and freedom until the NATO Coalition Force withdraw from South America."</br>
</br>
The silence at the press conference was terrifying.</br>
</br>
The reporters were all petrified and turned into immobile wax figures.</br>
</br>
Send... soldiers?</br>
</br>
Everyone questioned whether it was an illusion or reality.</br>
</br>
"There is no question session, the press conference is over!" Santos waved his hand and walked behind the scenes.</br>
</br>
The press conference is over?</br>
</br>
No question session?</br>
</br>
"Please stay, Mr. Santos, Moro is sending soldiers to Colombia? Are you sure you are not joking?"</br>
</br>
"Moro will support…"</br>
</br>
The scene became chaotic, and frenzied reporters swarmed up.</br>
</br>
The prepared soldiers immediately stepped forward and formed a wall around the podium. They stopped all the reporters and worked with the staff to persuade the reporters to leave the scene.</br>
</br>
</br>
The next day, Santos and his army made the headlines of every major newspaper and television news around the world.</br>
</br>
The dictator's speech at the press conference shocked everyone.</br>
</br>
Moro to send volunteer soldiers to Colombia... to support FARC?</br>
</br>
In other words, they were ready to engage in a war with the NATO Coalition Force?</br>
</br>
When most people heard the news, their first reaction was not to feel impressed by the courage of the dictator but to open the map to find the location of Moro. Many years had passed since the Moro-Country F war, and most had already forgotten the small country in the Western Pacific.</br>
</br>
It was only then that they suddenly remembered how Celestial Trade maintained its influence on the small country.</br>
</br>
Future 1.0's press had the honor to interview the dictator and even produced an interview column specifically for Santos. Based on the order of Jiang Chen, the news column of Future 1.0 avoided the taint of Santos himself, gave a positive evaluation of Moro intervention, and severely criticized NATO Coalition Force's intervention.</br>
</br>
Unsurprisingly, the UA media such as the Washington Post and the New York Times quoted the interview with Future 1.0 but did not quote its thoughts. Instead, the content satirized Moro and pointed the move as a handshake between two big drug lords.</br>
</br>
It was true, given that before the founding of the country, Santos was involved in drugs.</br>
</br>
Moro's move to send soldiers had created widespread discussion in the UA.</br>
</br>
The UA official responded quickly.</br>
</br>
The Capitol spokesperson first sneered and defined Santos's speech as nonsense. The Secretary of Defense even laughed in an interview as they joked about how Moro planned to transport the soldiers.</br>
</br>
Fishing boats? Or inflatable boats?</br>
</br>
However, on the second day, they couldn't laugh anymore.</br>
</br>
It turned out that when the press conference was held, the Moro soldiers had already arrived in Venezuela with the help of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Coordinated by Russia, with Venezuela keeping an eye closed, these soldiers dressed as civilians quickly boarded trucks and drove to the border between Colombia and Venezuela. After they entered Cucuta, they immediately stepped onto the battlefield with weapons and equipment from Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Although Celestial Trade did not directly participate in the war, it provided all-round support outside the field.</br>
</br>
Especially on intelligence!</br>
</br>
In addition to guns, ammunition, and light and heavy firepower, Celestial Trade also provided 500 tablets to the Moro soldiers. These tablets could obtain real-time high-definition satellite images of the battlefield through the "Sky Eye" system deployed above South America.</br>
</br>
It came with positioning, height, and distance measurement.</br>
</br>
With this gadget, a mortar could pinpoint exactly where to fire.</br>
</br>
It was not only accurate, but it also made firing two shots, then changing to another location possible. This made it more effective than missiles</br>
</br>
On the day after the Moro soldiers marched into Colombia, the NATO Coalition Force and the Colombian government force launched the fiercest offensive against Pamplona, ​​controlled by the FARC.</br>
</br>
In the mountains near Pamplona, ​​the two sides exchanged heavy fires.</br>
</br>
Moro was indeed a master in guerrilla warfare.</br>
</br>
The NATO Coalition Force twenty-four hours offensive did not manage to take down the palm-sized town of Pamplona. Instead, a Cobra gunship was downed and four armor vehicles were destroyed. Thirty-two hours after the offensive started, the NATO Coalition Force and the Colombian government forces finally called the mission, as they retreated from the mountainside with the wounded soldiers and the remains of the deceased.</br>
</br>
On the FARC and Moro side, after they successfully repelled NATO coalition forces, their morale was boosted as they quickly regained their lost position.</br>
</br>
After Timochenko heard the victory from the frontline, the haze between his brows suddenly disappeared.</br>
</br>
He discovered that the fabled NATO was not as invincible as he had imagined.</br>
</br>
At least in the Andes, in the tropical rain forests of Colombia, the FARC experienced in guerrilla warfare seemed to have an upper-hand...</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1322: Military Exercise</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On July 1st, a cargo ship marked with the Saudi Royal Family emblem set off from Jeddah Port, and headed away from the Gulf of Aden. The patrolling UA soldiers did not stop the ship for long before they allowed it into public water.</br>
</br>
On the morning of the same day, Celestial Trade and Moro Navy launched a joint military exercise in the Western Pacific.</br>
</br>
The military exercise was not limited to anti-ship, anti-submarine, anti-air exercises, but also also included landing combat and urban combt, code-named "Defense Determination," which lasted for three days. Although this military exercise turned into Celestial Trade showing off its high-tech equipment, it still achieved the effect Jiang Chen wanted - to show his position to the angered NATO.</br>
</br>
If NATO launched retaliatory military operations against Moro, Celestial Trade was ready to intervene.</br>
</br>
They must now weigh their decision if they decide to open another battlefield outside of South America.</br>
</br>
It was the third day of the military exercise.</br>
</br>
Five Guardian-class frigates installed with the modified type-50J electromagnetic pulse cannons were lined up at sea, and there were more than ten ships including anti-submarine destroyers, guided missile cruisers, supply ships, and submarines that patrolled around. Other than the fact that it lacked an aircraft carrier, the fleet was not inferior to any aircraft carrier battle group in the world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Ivan stood in the flagship bridge. Jiang Chen's eyes squinted at the satellite images on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
Under the "Sky Eye" military satellite, there were no secrets that could stay hidden under its watch in the Pacific Ocean. The positions of the enemy and friendly units were all marked with the distance, direction, and speed parameters listed.</br>
</br>
Santos and Moro naval officers also stood inside the bridge as they were amazed by the holographic screen floating directly in front of them. Everything here was a novelty to them, especially the satellite image that marked the positions of the units. It was not difficult to tell what this meant for naval warfare in the information age.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately there is no aircraft carrier."</br>
</br>
"If the Celestial Trade Navy is equipped with an aircraft carrier, with such an immense information advantage, it would be impossible to find an opponent that can compete with this fleet in the world."</br>
</br>
Among the audience, someone sighed regretfully.</br>
</br>
In today's naval thinking, the aircraft carrier was the core and soul of a fleet. A fleet without an aircraft carrier and carrier-based aircraft was incomplete.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen actually considered developing Celestial Trade's own aircraft carrier before, but after some deliberation, he gave up on the idea.</br>
</br>
First of all, Jiang Chen never intended to waste too much production capacity from Future Military on the sea, so it never planned to build a warship in the first place. Most of the warships were manufactured in Russian shipyards and then brought to Xin for secondary modification by Future Military.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Russians were certainly willing to sell the aircraft carrier to Celestial Trade, but their willingness was only limited to conventionally powered aircraft carriers. For example, it was not even remotely possible for Russia to sell nuclear-powered aircraft carriers as well as its core technology. Regardless of their relationship, this idea was off the table, similar to how Celestial Trade would never sell the type-50 electromagnetic pulse cannon.</br>
</br>
The technical difficulty of converting a conventionally powered aircraft carrier into a nuclear powered aircraft carrier was not on the same level as changing the main-gun of a frigate. Of course, it was not impossible but more so it was not necessary.</br>
</br>
After all, the ultra-long cruising radius of Aurora-20 made the need for aircraft carriers less meaningful.</br>
</br>
"The horizontal distance is 127 nautical miles, the target is locked."</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The launch pod of the guided missile cruiser opened, and with the roar of homing noises, the orange swords shot into the sky.</br>
</br>
In the area 127 nautical miles away, six scrapped cargo ships were used as target ships. They were arranged in a triangular formation on the sea, as they sailed in the direction of Guam at a speed of 20 knots.</br>
</br>
A total of six missiles all hit directly on target.</br>
</br>
The flames of the explosion erupted one after another as the cargo ships sank to the bottom of the sea.</br>
</br>
When the high-altitude drone transmitted the screen of the target ships destroyed to the bridge, the black smoke of the explosion could be seen in the horizon. Captain Lei Zheng put down the binoculars in his hand, then performed a military salute to Jiang Chen and Ivan.</br>
</br>
"Sir, the targets are destroyed! All missiles hit on target!"</br>
</br>
There was applause from the audience. Among them, not only representatives of Moro, but also representatives from Hua, Germany, and even Nippon, all of them showed the same hint of surprise.</br>
</br>
The missiles hitting targets were nothing surprising, since they all could achieve the same result with drone guidance.</br>
</br>
What really surprised them was the cruise speed of the anti-ship missile.</br>
</br>
Are you sure that was not a cannonball?</br>
</br>
Lei Zheng returned to the post and began preparations for the next stage of drills under the command.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen withdrew his gaze from the satellite image and looked at Ivan.</br>
</br>
"What's the next drill?"</br>
</br>
"All maritime exercises have been completed. The next one is the landing drill," Ivan replied.</br>
</br>
"It's time to test the new equipment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Ivan looked at each other and exchanged a heartfelt smile.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Finally, it was an opportunity for Moro to perform.</br>
</br>
Of course, their poor financial situation made it difficult for them to afford cruisers and frigates that cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars, but they could certainly afford rubber boats.</br>
</br>
Landing operations were the only exercise they could showcase their expertise.</br>
</br>
Guardian-class frigates lined up on the sea, and four thick and long type-50J electromagnetic pulse cannons were aimed at the coast. The glaring white lights flashed one after another, orange ballistic trajectories ripped through the sky, and the exploding dusts connected one after another onto the bunkers on the shore.</br>
</br>
After a round of fire barrage, the assault boat was released by Celestial Trade's large transport ship. Most of the soldiers on the assault boats were Moro soldiers.</br>
</br>
At almost the same time when the assault boat was put down, thirty "Crocodile-20" amphibious assault vehicles suddenly appeared out of the coast about 15 meters away. Like preying crocodiles, they bit towards the beach.</br>
</br>
As soon as the well-equipped Celestial Trade Marines reached the beach, they quickly followed the amphibious assault vehicles and the attack drones, and advanced towards the bombarded position.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Moro's assault boats also reached the beach. Soldiers with military green camouflage rushed in with light weapons, and quickly seized the bunkers bombed by artillery. They raised small red flags onto the turret and bunker positions.</br>
</br>
Before the landing operation began, Jiang Chen walked from the bridge to the deck of the ship.</br>
</br>
Compared with the narrow bridge, the field of vision here was wider and clearer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down the binoculars in his hand as he held onto the railing. He looked to the beach with his eyes narrowed. With the wind blowing his face and in a delightful mood, the corner of his mouth curved up as he spoke to Ivan next to him.</br>
</br>
"I always feel that something is missing there."</br>
</br>
"What is missing?" Ivan asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"It's at that place," Jiang Chen casually pointed to the beach, and laughed, "Don't you think there is still a Statue of Liberty missing?"</br>
</br>
Ivan was taken aback, and then he laughed along.</br>
</br>
"Would you like me to get someone to build one there, and we can re-conduct the drill?"</br>
</br>
"There is no need," Jiang Chen smiled, shook his head, and waved his hand, "If that day comes, it won't be a drill."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1323: Before The Counterattack</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the woods of the Andes, the leaves rustled. Two Asian soldiers in camouflage laid on the ground, their faces painted with black ink. Without being close, it was nearly impossible to see the two faces hidden in the shadow of the bushes.</br>
</br>
The forest was terribly quiet, and the two laid motionlessly on their stomachs, as if they were waiting for something.</br>
</br>
Not far away, there was a crisp sound.</br>
</br>
The two faces under the bushes also disappeared silently...</br>
</br>
Two NATO soldiers, one after another, carefully pushed aside the bushes and avoided the dead branches on the ground. With their backs hunched, they followed the shadow of the tropical vegetation as they headed towards the mountain... and then they bumped into the gunpoint of the Moro guerrillas.</br>
</br>
Gunshots passed through the dense rainforest, and bullets burst out from the shadows and rained on the two. Before they even had time to react, the two NATO soldiers fell to the ground with a terrifying howl.</br>
</br>
Two Moro soldiers got out from behind the banana leaf and quickly ran to the two NATO soldiers who were killed.</br>
</br>
"Where are their tags? Give me one."</br>
</br>
"Take it."</br>
</br>
"Hwang Sican? What is this name…"</br>
</br>
Muthari couldn't understand the Korean written on the front, but fortunately, there was English phonetic notation.</br>
</br>
"Probably a Korean. Regardless, you can exchange it for military merit anyway." His comrade stuffed another soldier tag into his bag, and then quickly searched the Korean to confirm that there was nothing left, then he spat on the ground and stood up.</br>
</br>
"The target was found, two NATO soldiers, both are down."</br>
</br>
After Muthari reported to the headquarters with his voice suppressed, he glanced at the corpse on the ground, shocked by the scene.</br>
</br>
Not only red liquid flowed out, but also white stuff oozed out, yellow liquid as well.</br>
</br>
Good lord, one probably hit the sack.</br>
</br>
No wonder he howled so miserably before he died...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
That afternoon, after the two received an order, they returned to their base of operations on Highland 421.</br>
</br>
They came to a tent in the corner of the barracks. Muthari walked in with his comrade and handed the tag to the Celestial Trade officer.</br>
</br>
The officer took the tag and examined it for a moment, then he opened a notebook, and searched for Muthari's number and name. He took a pen and added a line to a word. When Muthari saw this, a bright smile appeared on his face as he revealed his white teeth.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't recognize what the word meant, he understood the meaning of the lines.</br>
</br>
The line represented one hundred Xin New Dollars, which was almost equivalent to their monthly salary. At the end of the month, the money would be directly deposited to their personal account. Even if they were killed in battle, their families would receive the money.</br>
</br>
It was a reward for the guerrilla soldiers. At this time, it was either NATO scouts or elite soldiers on special operations who were active in the rainforest. They were all high-value targets.</br>
</br>
</br>
When they first heard the news, the Moro soldiers almost started to sing in celebration. It even got to a point where after someone downed a soldier, they took the head instead if they couldn't find the tag.</br>
</br>
This kind of disgusting and inhumane behavior was quickly banned by Celestial Trade. Photos were used instead if tags were missing. It was not until this ban was introduced that the remains of the poor NATO soldiers were spared.</br>
</br>
But soon, Muthari raised his eyebrows and cried at the notebook.</br>
</br>
"Hey, why does he have one more than me, it's not fair!"</br>
</br>
It was the same tag, but his comrade received one more stroke than he did, which immediately caused his dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
"Because his tag belongs to the 13th Marine Corps Infantry Brigade," the officer said expressionlessly and pointed to a sheet on the table. "The rules are here."</br>
</br>
"This...this also works?" Muthari was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Even canine earned them a stroke...</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay, man, I'll buy you a drink." The comrade next to him was also a little embarrassed, and patted him on his back. Before the officer started to show annoyance, he dragged Muthari outside.</br>
</br>
It was not a good idea to argue with Celestial Trade officers.</br>
</br>
Although these people were not directly on the battlefield, even their commanders were polite to them.</br>
</br>
Back in the tent, just as Muthari sat down on his bed, their squad leader walked in and dropped a cloth bag on the ground.</br>
</br>
The soldier at the door stood up and curiously flipped through the cloth bag. He looked at the steel wire ball inside and asked with a confused expression.</br>
</br>
"What is this?"</br>
</br>
"There is a large-scale military operation tonight," the squad leader glanced around the tent, confirmed that everyone was there, then pointed to the steel wire meshes on the ground, and said, "I don't know exactly what it is. The headquarters asked us to stuff all our electronics into this stuff before five o'clock."</br>
</br>
Worried that these boneheaded soldiers would not take this order seriously, the squad leader paused for a moment and emphasized it again with a serious expression.</br>
</br>
"Remember, all electronic products, this is an order."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
A week had passed since Moro soldiers landed in Colombia.</br>
</br>
After the setback in the attack on Pamplona, ​​NATO immediately reflected on its strategic deployment. It placed intelligence warfare and counter-guerrilla warfare at the core of its strategy, and sent special forces to search for FARC firepower points and tunnels in the jungle, especially high-value targets such as mortars and anti-aircraft artilleries that provided suppression.</br>
</br>
In terms of firepower, NATO still had the clear upper hand.</br>
</br>
But the Andes were so big, the rebel guerrillas were also cunning. The two sides turned from the initial muscle-to-muscle collision to a stealth warfare. Danger was hidden in every bush, and the smell of blood permeated every inch of the South American jungle.</br>
</br>
Not just guerrillas, poisonous insects, pythons, crocodiles... these were nothing to the people who have lived here for a long time, but they were quite troublesome for NATO soldiers. The environment here was worse than the desert, and mosquitoes the size of thumbs drove people crazy.</br>
</br>
In a sense, Timochenko's words were indeed fulfilled.</br>
</br>
The Andes and the rain forest had not only become the nightmare of the UA, but also the nightmare of all NATO.</br>
</br>
However, the newcomers who had just arrived here were often more optimistic. For example, Koreans who responded to the call not long ago showed confidence beyond their ability in front of the majestic mountains of Colombia. They did not take FARC and Moro seriously at all.</br>
</br>
"Our soldiers are all experts in counter-guerrilla warfare." A South Korean officer narrowed his eyes and laughed, "You can rest assured that soon their position will be clear to us."</br>
</br>
For a long time, in order to match the so-called "guerrilla powerhouse" in the north, the South Korean Army always regarded counter-guerrilla warfare as the focus of military training and attached great importance to special operations forces. As a result, almost every army in Korea contained a special operations battalion.</br>
</br>
In addition, Koreans often established a special operations division to perform special operations tasks such as counter-terrorism operations, protection of dignitaries, punishment and retaliation.</br>
</br>
He had the confidence for this very reason.</br>
</br>
But he overlooked one point.</br>
</br>
Moro soldiers did not receive any serious training, but all of them crawled out from piles of corpses. Now they were equipped by Future Military, while their weapons were not the most advanced, it was not far behind the NATO soldiers' gears.</br>
</br>
"I hope so." The old man with a hooked nose replied nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Obviously, as a Marine Corps Colonel, he was not convinced by the newcomer.</br>
</br>
A war is not a TV series. Disregard the Descendent of the Sun, even if you are a descendant of the Milky Way, you'll only have one life on the battlefield. Especially in the tropical zone with visibility of less than ten meters, it is a severe test for the soldiers' detection and counter-detection capabilities.</br>
</br>
Whoever is discovered first will die. No one will have mercy because everyone wants to live.</br>
</br>
The old man gazed into the sunset in the distance and a frown appeared on his face as his eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
It was almost dark.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he had a hunch.</br>
</br>
Tonight will be very long.</br>
</br>
He rolled up his sleeves and looked at the electronic watch on his wrist. However, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
The number on the electronic watch was frozen at five o'clock in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
He pressed it a few times but there was still no response. Then he muttered to himself with his frown growing more apparent.</br>
</br>
"Is it broken?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1324"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1324: Code Named: Firefigh</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Colonel Gibson was right, his watch was indeed broken.</br>
</br>
And it was not just his electronic watch</br>
</br>
As night began to settle, the entire base gradually became dark.</br>
</br>
Sergeant Duke took his comrades and exchanged positions with the patrolling soldiers. He shouted at the patrol on duty on the sentry tower.</br>
</br>
What happened? Why didnt you turn on the light?</br>
</br>
I dont know the power system seems to be malfunctioning. I have sent someone to notify the repair team. Damn, is my walkie-talkie broken too? I have to ask logistics to get me a new one.</br>
</br>
Yours is broken too?</br>
</br>
What do you wait, yours is broken too?</br>
</br>
Sergeant Dukes expression gradually became serious, and sweat began to ooze out from his forehead.</br>
</br>
He started to realize what may have happened, and he believed that the headquarters must also realize what may have happened.</br>
</br>
It was just that as a soldier, when he started to realize the seriousness of the problem and didnt receive any communication</br>
</br>
It might be too late.</br>
</br>
At the same time, on the runway in front of the hangar on the other side of the military base.</br>
</br>
Inside the cockpit of the F35 fighter jet, the pilot who was on an airstrike mission pressed the buttons on his control panel, and the confusion in his eyes started to become apparent.</br>
</br>
Strange.</br>
</br>
The engine did not respond, and some of the instruments seemed to be broken as they no longer changed.</br>
</br>
This is Gladiator-1, the aircrafts ignition system has malfunctioned, mission is terminated</br>
</br>
There was no response from the command tower.</br>
</br>
The pilot took off his helmet and was about to open the cockpit, but his extended hand stopped in mid-air.</br>
</br>
When he looked up in the air, his pupils gradually enlarged, his lips moved slightly, but he only let out one word.</br>
</br>
Reflected in the dilated pupils were rows of emerald green flare.</br>
</br>
God</br>
</br>
The operation codenamed Firefight was a direct response to NATOs Operation Torch.</br>
</br>
In the mountainous region east of Bucaramanga, the 14th NATO Mechanical Battalion and the 27th Infantry Brigade of Colombia, stationed on the 772 Heights, were relentlessly bombed by Moros firepower.</br>
</br>
There was no warning, only the tail flames in the air announced the beginning of the bombing.</br>
</br>
The mighty and invincible Type 63 multiple rocket launcher once again rewritten its legend on the Colombian battlefield. When the hurricane-like rocket rains ravaged on the NATO forces, other than the raging dust and shrapnel, nothing else was visible.</br>
</br>
DAMMIT! How did they get so close! Where did our patrols go!</br>
</br>
Curled up in the foxhole, the battalion commander of NATOs 14th Mechanical Battalion tightened his helmet.</br>
</br>
Not far from him, an armored vehicle that had just driven out of the garage was penetrated by a 107mm rocket after it failed to dodge. The rocket hit the ammunition rack, and the explosions skyrocketed, and the shock even ripped off the turret.</br>
</br>
</br>
The flames of the exploded armored car reflected from his pupils, and a trace of despair appeared on the face of the battalion commander.</br>
</br>
Until now, he had not seen any reinforcements, nor had he seen fighters whizzing past his head to harvest those arrogant rocket launchers.</br>
</br>
What happened?</br>
</br>
What happened?</br>
</br>
The patrols stationed under the high ground were also confused.</br>
</br>
Walkie-talkies, night vision goggles, even the red dot sight on the rifle, all electronic products were completely useless, it felt like returning to the Stone Age in just a night. When they heard the sound of rockets roaring in the air, the punishment from the guerrilla also arrived.</br>
</br>
Just as the nearby support artillery launched a relentless bombardment of Highland 772, a squad of NATO soldiers was facing a siege from a company of Moro soldiers in a post four kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The bullets dented the wall and peeled off the cement from the steel frame.</br>
</br>
Sergeant Charles pulled his wounded comrade from the pool of blood as he returned fire with his rifle, but he was quickly suppressed by the heavy machine gun.</br>
</br>
Another RPG hit.</br>
</br>
A house ten meters away was hit directly, and the M249 light machine gun framed in the window, as well as the wall, collapsed from the explosion. Another soldier fell. In less than five minutes, they had lost more than half of the squad.</br>
</br>
This is Warrior-1, we are under attack! I repeat, we are under attack! SH*T!</br>
</br>
There was no response to the hoarse roar, and only panic remained on Sergeant Charless face.</br>
</br>
Guerrilla soldiers could fight till the last person without fear of death, but it was impossible for him who came from a first world country.</br>
</br>
He cut open his clothes with a dagger in a panic, and tore off most of the white shirt.</br>
</br>
He tied his shirt to the butt of his rifle, grabbed the muzzle and raised it up, and shouted in his broken Spanish.</br>
</br>
Surrender! Surrender! Ceasefire!</br>
</br>
What is that guy even saying? The Moro soldier asked the Colombian next to him.</br>
</br>
He said theyve surrendered and is asking us to ceasefire. The FARC soldier understood Spanish and already lowered his guns.</br>
</br>
The same scene took place at every post and firepower point on Highland 772. In the absence of reinforcements, lack of firepower support, and zero communication from the command headquarters, almost no one could fight to the end.</br>
</br>
It was not due to the lack of the NATO coalition forces combat capability.</br>
</br>
On the contrary, their combat effectiveness was very strong.</br>
</br>
If they hadnt been blindfolded, mouths covered, and ears blocked, the guerrillas that left the cover of the tropical jungle would only be sitting ducks for the fighters and artilleries.</br>
</br>
However, there were not so many ifs on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
The NATO coalition forces, whose communication system was paralyzed, had no way to call for artillery support or direct airstrikes.</br>
</br>
Moro and FARC easily crossed the defense line of the Colombian government army. They dragged out the soldiers trembling under the artillery bombardment from the trenches, foxholes, and concrete fortifications.</br>
</br>
Most of the armored vehicles were destroyed by the rocket launchers.</br>
</br>
But the remaining vehicles was happily accepted by Moro soldiers.</br>
</br>
Of course, Moro soldiers were the most delighted by the captured prisoners.</br>
</br>
The prisoners of the Colombian government army were left to FARC, but the guests from afar were treated nicely.</br>
</br>
Under gunpoint, the NATO soldier handed in their tags in confusion, and squatted against the wall with their hands on their head.</br>
</br>
They didnt know why these people were so fascinated by their tags, would they use this as chips for poker?</br>
</br>
They also wont know that they were already priced by Xins officers.</br>
</br>
How much for the dead, how much for being alive, everyone was priced clearly</br>
</br>
July 11th, 2020 was definitely the darkest day in Colombia since the 21st century.</br>
</br>
The literal definition of darkness.</br>
</br>
Because of an EMP, the power system was completely paralyzed from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in northern Colombia to the central Andes. Over 50% of all electronics were damaged. The more sophisticated the equipment, the more serious the damage, and the direct economic loss exceeded 500 billion dollars</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said that they would bear the consequences.</br>
</br>
And now, they paid the price.</br>
</br>
Just one hour after the detonation of the EMP, Celestial Trade issued a weather warning on its official website.</br>
</br>
At five oclock in the afternoon on July 11th, the Celestial Trade Astronomical Telescope observed a strong solar wind passing through Earth. Please protect all electronic products such as phones and computers</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Although a house with its windows blown open by the wind could withstand the violent storm as a whole, the strong wind would still make the inside of the house a mess. The Earths magnetic field was just like a house prone to leakage in front of the solar wind, and its holes would continue to leak for several hours for charged particles from the Sun to enter the Earths atmosphere and disrupt communications and power systems.</br>
</br>
However, whether it was the solar wind or Celestial Trades EMP weapon, the NATO Coalition Force stationed in Bucaramanga did not have time to investigate. The Moro soldiers had already taken control of Highland 772 and cut through their last line of defense outside Bucaramanga.</br>
</br>
Until the flare of the final offensive rose into the sky, not a single NATO soldier got the news in advance</br>
</br>
Highland 772 was captured by the Moro effortlessly.</br>
</br>
Behind this high ground was the military base of the NATO Coalition Force.</br>
</br>
The night quietly arrived.</br>
</br>
Without the slightest warning, Type-63 rocket launchers landed on the runway of the military base airport and blasted the fighters stranded on the runway to pieces.</br>
</br>
Artillery bombarded from all directions and the noise of explosions and homing shells quickly flooded the bases intermittent broadcast. The NATO Coalition Forces with paralyzed command system had to fight separately in the military base hundreds of acres wide.</br>
</br>
The NATO force armed with night vision equipment should not be at such a disadvantage fighting at night. However, after the EMP strike, the night vision goggles and thermal imaging scopes all turned into scrap metal. Not only was it useless, but it also obstructed the soldiers movement.</br>
</br>
Tanks suffered the same fate.</br>
</br>
There was no command, no infantry support, and even one of the thermal imaging scopes was broken. The M1A2 main battle tank that rolled out of the garage was like a blindfolded bull. With explosions all around, it was unaware whether if it would hit the enemy or friendly units.</br>
</br>
Although armored units could effectively resist EMP strikes, it did not include the communication equipment placed outside the armor. If the tanks were prepared ahead of time and equipped with the anti-pulse attachment developed by the Advanced Projects Agency, it was not impossible to protect these pieces of communication equipment.</br>
</br>
But obviously, they didnt expect an EMP strike at all.</br>
</br>
What would happen to a modernized force without any information support?</br>
</br>
Reality proved that it was like a blind man.</br>
</br>
Muthari followed the 21st Infantry Brigade into the north gate of the military base. He fired in front of him and quickly suppressed the sniper hiding behind the military truck. The comrades behind him skillfully took out the RPG-7 launcher with the high-explosive warhead and fired it at the truck.</br>
</br>
The flames of the explosion lit up the night.</br>
</br>
</br>
As soldiers advanced deeper, the supporting artillery from the rear began to shrink towards the center of the military base. The NATO coalition forces that defended the military base were completely blinded. Some soldiers started to retreat toward the port of Barranquilla, while the rest were either killed or captured by the guerrillas.</br>
</br>
Mutharis company was the first to penetrate a building suspected to be an important target.</br>
</br>
The resistance of the NATO soldiers stationed in this building was quite tenacious. Both sides suffered a lot of casualties in the exchange of fire, and the exchange entered a stalemate for a while.</br>
</br>
However, everyone knew that for these people trapped in a dead-end, their final fate was almost inevitable.</br>
</br>
The NATO soldiers that crawled behind cover fell one after another. But for Moro and FARC, the reinforcement arrived one by one.</br>
</br>
With the firepower on the opposite side was getting weaker and weaker, the Moro guerrillas seized the opportunity to rush in. They soon squashed the remaining resistance.</br>
</br>
This seemed to be the command post of the NATO coalition forces. There were offices and conference rooms on both sides of the corridor.</br>
</br>
Pewpewpewpew</br>
</br>
Muthari unleashed his bullets and turned an officer that attempted to fire back into a sieve, then he stepped into the office.</br>
</br>
At this moment, he suddenly discovered that there was something moving under the table</br>
</br>
Mutharis eyes turned brighter as he pointed his gun at the desk and leaned forward.</br>
</br>
He gestured a cover me to the comrades behind him and his left hand reached under the desk. After he grabbed onto something, he pulled the man out from under the table and threw him to the ground; two rifles quickly were aimed at that mans face.</br>
</br>
Dont kill me, dont kill me! I surrender!</br>
</br>
Dont move! Put your hands on your head, and stop screaming! Muthari kicked the officer to the wall. When he heard him speak, he was infuriated and hit the officer with his stock.</br>
</br>
I finally caught an officer, but he is Korean?</br>
</br>
What a loss!</br>
</br>
The sky was about to turn bright, and the battle that lasted all night was over.</br>
</br>
The outcome of this battle was stellar.</br>
</br>
Ten M1A2 main battle tanks, more than thirty LAV-25 light armored vehicles of various types, and self-propelled artillery that did not explode in the shelling, even the armed helicopters on the tarmac and the F35s parked in the hangar, all the equipment was captured by Moro soldiers, and most of them were transported back to the rear by trucks.</br>
</br>
Except for tanks and armored vehicles, gunships and F35s were unable to participate in combat due to electronic malfunctions.</br>
</br>
But again, even if they were not broken, there was unlikely anyone in Moro capable of operating one.</br>
</br>
Nearly 8,000 prisoners of war were also transported into the depths of the Andes with trucks. Most of them were from Turkey, and the rest were mostly from the UA, Britain, Fran and other European countries.</br>
</br>
It was ultimately unrealistic to completely defeat all of the NATO soldiers.</br>
</br>
When the guerrillas were about to occupy the military base, the Ford aircraft carrier battle group deployed in the Gulf of Mexico had already noticed the situation on the front line, and sent F35s to the occupied military base, dispatched the Osprey and the remaining marine units to cover the defeated coalition soldiers retreat to the Gulf of Mexico.</br>
</br>
It was definitely the worst defeat in NATO history.</br>
</br>
The entire communication system collapsed, and the command structure was lost. The soldiers didnt know whether they should withdraw or defend. An EMP strike effectively turned the most elite soldiers on the planet into third-rate forces. Moro and FARC guerrillas relied on their absolute advantage in numbers, firepower, and experience as third-rate forces to defeat the NATO forces.</br>
</br>
The good news from the frontline soon spread to the back.</br>
</br>
Even Timochenko himself could not believe FARC and Moro soldiers actually took over the NATO Coalition Force military base in Bucaramanga.</br>
</br>
It was the infamous NATO</br>
</br>
And more than 8,000 prisoners of war</br>
</br>
The high number of prisoners even felt like hot potatoes in his hands</br>
</br>
After he smoked five or six cigars in a row and paced back and forth in the cave, he finally calmed down his excitement and sat down.</br>
</br>
After they crossed Bucaramanga, to the north, it was Bogota, the capital of Colombia. He seemed to be only one step away from the Presidents throne</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1326: The Divided Coalition Force</br>
</div></br>
</br>
July 12th, 2020, was definitely the most humiliating day since NATO was founded.</br>
</br>
With the fall of the Bucaramanga military base, the Colombian government force and the NATO Coalition Force stationed in this area had to strategically retreat. However, with their communication completely collapsed, it was nearly impossible to obtain first-hand information anywhere on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
After a force saw a friendly army withdraw from the frontline, they had the following dialogue.</br>
</br>
Hey, which country are you from? Where are you going? Why cant we find the signal for the command post?</br>
</br>
Italian XX Brigade. We are heading to the Port of Barranquilla. Dont ask, we dont know why</br>
</br>
Then shall we continue to station here or retreat?</br>
</br>
You ask me, who do I ask?</br>
</br>
The order to retreat was indeed issued. Through the carrier-based helicopters on the Ford aircraft carrier battle group, the most primitive methods were used, which was to notify each combat unit. However, due to the collapse of the command system, they could only notify down to the battalion level, not to everyone.</br>
</br>
This also led to another situation.</br>
</br>
It was possible for Company A to receive an order to remain stationed in an area, while Company B, which was responsible for backup support in the same area, received an order to withdraw. When the person with a retreat order to Company A arrived, he discovered that the rebel guerrillas were already here and in the midst of the battle. Company A must be wondering where did Company B go</br>
</br>
Based on the map, NATOs defense line shrunk to the coast near the Gulf of Mexico in just one day as they re-established their positions around the Port of Barranquilla.</br>
</br>
The NATO Coalition Force re-established the command system. While they issued equipment, all the equipment was protected by a metal sleeve, and they strictly required every soldier to store all equipment in the metal sleeve during non-combat periods.</br>
</br>
It was the most primitive and effective method to counter EMP strikes. The principle was probably the same as the steel ball sent to the guerrillas. A Faraday cage could shield the entire electromagnetic field.</br>
</br>
There were 100,000 troops when they first arrived, but fewer than 60,000 evacuated to Barranquilla. In addition to the captured and those who died in crossfire, some soldiers may had be retreating while others may have retreated with the Colombian government force to Bogota.</br>
</br>
A disastrous defeat was no longer enough to describe the losses suffered by the NATO Coalition Force.</br>
</br>
While the repair team was busy repairing the equipment that was withdrawn from the front line, FARC and Moro soldiers did not just sit around.</br>
</br>
NATO left a large amount of equipment and supplies at the military base in Bucaramanga. After they graciously accepted these equipment and supplies, the Moro and FARC troops split into two. Moro soldiers marched northward through the mountains to surround the NATO Coalition Force along the Gulf of Mexico.</br>
</br>
</br>
FARC followed Jiang Chens order and moved south through the Andes. They aimed straight to the Colombian capital with the goal to push Timochenko onto the throne of the president as soon as possible. They strived to end the war as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
With the FARC heading south, panic started to spread across every developed city in western Colombia.</br>
</br>
Everyone knew that the rebels were coming, but they didnt know how far away they were. They could see what happened on the front line through Twitter before, but now they couldnt even open their phones.</br>
</br>
In a modern society extremely dependent on the Internet, when even the most basic electricity was lost, not only the channels for obtaining information were affected, but as well as peoples daily life. The supermarket was tightly packed by the panicking crowds, prices soared, and supplies that shouldnt be scarce started to experience shortages. The United Nations had to start taking care of the mess left by NATO as the discussion on humanitarian reliefs began.</br>
</br>
Of course, NATO countries panicked the most.</br>
</br>
The more modern the army, the weaker its resistance to EMP attacks. Although countries were researching EMP and anti-EMP weapons, and the anti-pulse capability of existing equipment, the EMP weapons only made its appearance three years ago, and it took time to finish the research.</br>
</br>
The Advanced Projects Agency of the Department of Defense was ahead in the research, but in a wide-area EMP attack scenario, their efforts still seemed inadequate. Unless the entire army was thrown into an airtight iron box, it was impossible to completely avoid the impact of EMP.</br>
</br>
After all, even Celestial Trade would not be able to fully mitigate the impact of EMP weapons</br>
</br>
ESA has conducted a forensic investigation on whether the solar wind has passed through the border on July 11th, and it has yet to find conclusive evidence to confirmWe have submitted the latest investigation progress to the European Union Commission, hoping to help the authorities.</br>
</br>
The European Space Agencys hesitant statement reflected the conflicted position of the European Union.</br>
</br>
They thought they were just going to South America with their ally to pick a guaranteed fight, but they didnt expect to be dragged into such a big mess.</br>
</br>
There were more than nine thousand prisoners of war.</br>
</br>
Excluding Turks that made up half of the number, there were more than a hundred of them spread among each country.</br>
</br>
And the families of the fallen soldiers</br>
</br>
The thought alone was devastating.</br>
</br>
Differences were appearing in the European Union as to whether or not they should continue to be involved in this war.</br>
</br>
The strong stance of Celestial Trade on the South American issue had already far exceeded their expectations</br>
</br>
As for the UA, they still chose to remain tough.</br>
</br>
The Capitol Spokesperson made a statement immediately and took aim at Celestial Trade with NASAs report.</br>
</br>
NASA has not observed an active solar wind and is investigating the matter further. At the same time, we are shocked and angry at what happened in Colombia. I warn certain rogue organizations not to take chances and try to use natural phenomena to confuse the audience, if the disaster that happened last night turns out to be a self-directed farce, they will pay the price for their careless behavior!</br>
</br>
Investigation?</br>
</br>
It was impossible to investigate.</br>
</br>
The solar wind is a continuous phenomenon. Only when the two magnetic fields are in a state of magnetically reconnection will it cause the Earths magnetic field protection barrier to create a gap, thus causing the solar wind to affect the surface. This gap opens and closes at all times, and the size and position of the opening are not fixed, and it is also related to the magnitude of the solar eruption.</br>
</br>
With the dependency of many variables, the impact may be serious or minimal. For example, in 1991, the gust of solar wind almost blew up the nuclear power plant in Maine, but in 2010 it only produced quite a spectacular aurora over the United Kingdom.</br>
</br>
But the Capitols statement made Jiang Chen a little relieved. The strength and advantage of Celestial Trade finally made the ruler of the old world a little hesitant in its actions.</br>
</br>
If this happened ten years ago, the UAs aircraft carrier battle groups would have long entered Xins water to investigate weapons of mass destruction. Why would they still debate whether it was a solar wind or EMP that caused the incident?</br>
</br>
As for whether the infuriated NATO would launch a full-scale war on Celestial Trade, Jiang Chen was not worried at all.</br>
</br>
The EMP launched in Colombia was also a deterrence to NATO.</br>
</br>
Many different opinions existed on the area coverage of the wide-area EMP strike. The opinions included how destructive the electromagnetic pulse warhead carried by the Peacemaker was and what was its deterrence capability? How does it compare with nuclear missiles?</br>
</br>
And now, Celestial Trade directly used its fist to tell NATO the power of this weapon.</br>
</br>
It was very, very, very powerful</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>

</br>
Just as global attention was focused on South America, the offensive in Syria began.</br>
</br>
With the help of Yerif, the 11th Special Operations Division made up by Celestial Trades Mercenary Corps successfully entered Syria and assisted the government force to suppress the extreme forces and rebels.</br>
</br>
Unlike the shackled Russia and the UA special force, these stateless mercenaries didnt care whether an extreme organization was mild or harmful. The moment that extreme organization was deemed as the target, they fought without hesitation.</br>
</br>
Another advantage of fighting in war-torn areas was that there were no people interfering.</br>
</br>
In addition to Russian fighters airstrikes, Celestial Trades Seagull-class transport ships in synchronous orbit occasionally use electromagnetic pulse cannons or missiles to support their operations.</br>
</br>
The combat effectiveness of this special combat division made Yerif full of jealousy. If this army served him, what opposition could he not silence?</br>
</br>
After the situation in Syria stabilized, Jiang Chen promised that he will become the next employer of this army. This force would help him secure this position as the king, and become his sword and shield in his goal for secular reform</br>
</br>
While the world watched Colombia and 9,000 prisoners of war, Jiang Chen, who was at the center of controversies, was focused on another matter.</br>
</br>
Just two days ago, news came from the Mars Colony.</br>
</br>
The expeditionary army equipped with new weapons finally pushed the tunnel to the suspected position of the Gaia civilization, where they found the fabled database of the Flowers of Memory.</br>
</br>
It was the legacy left by a civilization three billion years ago, and its value could no longer be measured by wealth. As Dr. Amos said, if the Flowers of Memory really carried all the knowledge of their civilization as described by the Gaia civilization, these memories from three billion years ago would be enough to allow the human civilization to enter the next era.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the space elevator to Celestial Trade and met with Kelvin stationed at the Space Command Center. Once they met, he was straight to the point.</br>
</br>
Whats going on at Mine 071?</br>
</br>
The reinforcement of the main structure of the ruins has been completed, and now it has entered the final stage of excavation. Kelvin pointed to the holographic screen in front of him and smiled. We are just doing excavation work on the wall, and well find out very soon whats inside.</br>
</br>
On the screen, there were the real-time images returned from the excavation site of the Gaia civilization tens of millions of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
A tunnel densely paved with steel plates surrounded the space below the entire ruins. The heavily armed Celestial Marines leaned on the outside of the ruins, they formed a line against the wall as they cautiously watched the area.</br>
</br>
</br>
The field engineer carried a toolbox forward and used a special instrument to observe the inside of the ruins. After he confirmed that there was no living thing or any obstruction, he said a few words to the person in charge next to him, and then backed away.</br>
</br>
Soon, under the escort of a group of soldiers, a strangely shaped vehicle drove into the circular tunnel from the main tunnel.</br>
</br>
It was strange because its appearance was too abstract.</br>
</br>
Its cuboid shape looked like a container with wheels added. From the appearance alone, it was difficult to associate this vehicle with the task opening door.</br>
</br>
The head of the vehicle was attached to the outside of the ruins, and the wheels on both sides were immediately retracted, and the whole body then gently rested on the ground. A thumb-sized drill bit protruded from the front of the vehicle to drill a hole, and the hole was quickly closed after.</br>
</br>
In order to avoid the influence of external air pressure on the ancient relics in the ruins, the Mine 071 site project team was very careful. They took into account almost all possible scenarios. After they confirmed the air pressure and composition inside the ruins, the cuboid vehicle attached to the wall quickly simulated its own internal air environment, and then after a muffled bang, a hole enough for a person was formed on the wall.</br>
</br>
The tunnel is successful constructed, and the conditions of the ruins are confirmed to be normal!</br>
</br>
A voice of relief came from the command center. Many people took off their headphones and wiped the nervous sweat on their foreheads. Many smiles also appeared on everyones face.</br>
</br>
At this point, the most difficult stage of the excavation work was completed. The rest of the work only required sending a remote car inside to confirm if it was safe. The final stage was to send hundreds of scientific researchers to the colony to accept the legacy of the former civilization.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen left the Space Command Center, he stayed with Celestial Trade for a few days as he started the selection process of the candidates that will accept the Flowers of Memory.</br>
</br>
Because of its association with the Gaia civilization and the existence of the Flowers of Memory, this task was ranked as the highest confidential information in Celestial Trade. The information was not accessible to most.</br>
</br>
Based on the principle of voluntariness, Jiang Chen sent Ghost Agents to assess the loyalty of the groups scientists and sent an invitation letter to all the scientists who were confirmed to be reliable. The purpose of the invitation was for training on Mars.</br>
</br>
If they accepted the groups dispatch, they would be automatically listed as a candidate for the Flowers of Memory. They would be informed once they boarded with relevant information such as, what the Flowers of Memory are, and what the Gaia civilization is</br>
</br>
Since it was memories from three billion years ago, there was still a degree of risk.</br>
</br>
In the scientific research system of Celestial Trade, in addition to loyalty to the group, most of the scientists who received the invitation letter were middle-level scientists, who had the capability of accepting knowledge, were between 30 and 40 years old, and had high training value</br>
</br>
Put my name on the list, Amos said when he arrived at Jiang Chens office. We agreed that if the ruins are successfully excavated, I get a copy of the scientific research from the former civilization.</br>
</br>
There is still a high degree of uncertainty in the security status of the colony. I can let people send the Flowers of Memory back, Jiang Chen looked at Amos as he tried to persuade him, If you dont change your mind then, its not too late to inoculate in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
If possible, he did not want to send important talents to risky places.</br>
</br>
In the research of Klein particles and neural bridging, even Lin Lin, a digitalized human from the 22nd century, praised him for his accomplishments. Give him time, and his future achievements in the scientific community would not be inferior to those of the great scientists who have left their names in history.</br>
</br>
However, Amos did not change his mind as he shook his head.</br>
</br>
Scientific research itself is full of uncertain risks. If you fear the risks, its counterintuitive to what we believe in.</br>
</br>
With the certainty in Amos tone, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment, then let out a sigh as he put his name on the list.</br>
</br>
If you insist.</br>
</br>
Thank you. As he saw the list, Amos smiled from the bottom of his heart, then he joked in a relaxed tone, Are you not going to send me an invitation letter or something?</br>
</br>
No, you get special treatment.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The eerie blue jet flame pushed the Seagull-class carrying the hope of human civilization towards the endless darkness. In addition to three hundred scientific researchers, the space elevator components designed by Future Heavy Industries for the Mars colony were also loaded on-board.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen watched the starship depart, he left the port of Celestial City.</br>
</br>
In order to determine the candidate for the inoculation of Flowers of Memory, he had already spent more time than he planned for, now it was time to return to the surface.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to his mansion on Coro Island, it happened to be late at night.</br>
</br>
He saw the lights in Xia Shiyus office were still on, so he gently opened the door and walked in.</br>
</br>
Just after she finished signing a document, she yawned, leaned back against the chair, and stretched out to relax herself.</br>
</br>
A pair of hands was gently placed on her tender shoulders, and the unexpected Xia Shiyu almost fell off the chair.</br>
</br>
She turned her head to see a smug smile and revelation appeared on her face as she gave him a hard stare.</br>
</br>
You didnt say a word when you came in.</br>
</br>
I was afraid to disturb you.</br>
</br>
You already disturbed me, okay?</br>
</br>
She closed her eyes and gradually relaxed her body. With a sweet smile, she quietly enjoyed the massage from the big hands on her shoulders.</br>
</br>
Why are you up so late?</br>
</br>
Its because of you.</br>
</br>
Me?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at the pile of documents on the desk in a puzzled manner. He only saw the words 2020 Xin International Defense Expo and Planning Document written on the pile of signed documents left upper corner.</br>
</br>
When he saw this, he realized what happened.</br>
</br>
He actually personally instructed this matter.</br>
</br>
We have invited 47 countries to participate in the expo, 39 countries have confirmed their attendance, and 789 companies have confirmed that they will appear in the expo. The closed eyelashes trembled lightly from comfort; she said in a lazy tone as she reported the events progress to Jiang Chen. The venue and time for the event have been finalized, and it will be held in the Heart of the Sea on Coro Island in September.</br>
</br>
It was the first international defense expo hosted by Xin. The invited countries were either members of the Earth Defense Alliance, or the countries with intention of joining the alliance. The purpose of this defense expo was not only to strengthen military cooperation among member states, but also to find overseas buyers for the burgeoning arms giant, Future Military.</br>
</br>
It was the first time Future Military was open to arms sales.</br>
</br>
In addition to creating profit, the sale of arms itself was also a way to expand influence.</br>
</br>
It was almost foreseeable that EMP weapons and kinetic skeletons would become the stars of this defense expo.</br>
</br>
Of course, all weapons sold to foreign arms were export models specially designed by Future Military. In terms of technical capability and performance, they were naturally inferior compared to the Celestial Trade models. The equipment was more similar to the ones used by Madagascars mercenaries.</br>
</br>
</br>
Dont stay up too late, Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
With a relaxed sniffle, Xia Shiyu joked.</br>
</br>
I suddenly realized that you are quite good at taking care of people.</br>
</br>
You just realized? Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
What what are you doing? With his hands that started to venture into other territories, Xia Shiyu bit her lower lip and blushed. She glanced at the door, and then whispered, Dont be silly.</br>
</br>
If you are worried about Lilith hearing us, you can rest assured. Jiang Chen smirked and quietly whispered in her ear as he watched the red hue cover her face, When I went upstairs, she was playing games.</br>
</br>
You, you havent showered yet</br>
</br>
I want you to help me.</br>
</br>
It was a quiet night.</br>
</br>
The next day, Jiang Chen slept until almost noon before he got up.</br>
</br>
After he washed up and ate the lunch Ayesha prepared, he went to the living room.</br>
</br>
Lilith, on the sofa, saw Jiang Chen moving towards her, so she moved her legs to make room for him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat down next to her, comfortably leaned back on the sofa, and turned on the holographic TV.</br>
</br>
It just so happened that it was international news.</br>
</br>
The Colombian government force and FARC exchanged fire in the central region. Because they had lost the support of the NATO Coalition Force, the government force retreated under the offensive of the guerrillas. They retreated to a place less than 20 kilometers from Bogota.</br>
</br>
At present, NATO attempted to start a dialogue with Moro on the issue of prisoners of war, but Moro refused at this moment. Italy and Greece were considering withdrawing from the NATO Coalition Force, as well as launching peace talks with FARC as independent nations in order to redeem their captured soldiers.</br>
</br>
After all, the two countries just sent a battalion each symbolically. It was purely to join in on the fun and respond to their allies. Now the situation was turning south, it was clearly not in their interest for the war to continue. Compared with the common interests of NATO, domestic political interests were much more crucial.</br>
</br>
Are things developing as you expected? Lilith, who was on the sofa with her legs curled up, suddenly asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Not at all, Jiang Chen smiled, but at least the general direction has not gone south.</br>
</br>
Really? Lilith said thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Ayesha walked into the living room, glanced at Lilith on the sofa, and then sat down on the other sofa.</br>
</br>
Bernice called. The UA Department of Defense issued a document to all UA soldiers, requiring the strict implementation of the requirements to platoon-level combat units. All electronic equipment, especially communication equipment, must be strictly stored in a Faraday backpack during non-usage time Ayesha turned on the holographic screen on her watch and pushed the news to Jiang Chen, Here is the original document.</br>
</br>
She can even get this information. Jiang Chen was a little surprised as he extended his finger with interest and fiddled with the scroll bar on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the UA was indeed terrified by the EMP attack, otherwise, it would not implement this method.</br>
</br>
The benefits of doing this were obvious. There was no need to worry about Celestial Trades EMP attacks destroying the eyes and ears of the military. The tradeoff, however, was that it hindered real-time communication, such that it was necessary to agree upon a communication time and so on.</br>
</br>
In addition, the report also mentioned that the UA Department of Defense ordered a batch of old-fashioned communication equipment from domestic communication companies to respond to emergencies. At the same time, the country also invested 10 billion dollars to develop a more advanced, more convenient, and lower-cost optical transmission system, intending to solve the threat of Celestial Trade EMP weapons at the root.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was skeptical about whether or not the UA could really achieve this.</br>
</br>
Their direction was indeed correct. There were only two measures to deal with EMP weapons in the apocalypse. One was to replace telecommunication components with optical transmission components, and the other was to make key electronic components as small as possible.</br>
</br>
However, it was still impossible to completely resist EMP strikes, unless the electromagnetic field could be completely shielded</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Compared with these minor details, Im more concerned about the election. Jiang Chen retracted the holographic screen, smiled and said casually, After all, we put a lot of chips on Joseph.</br>
</br>
Not particularly optimistic, Ayesha shook her head and whispered softly, The situation in South America is heating up, and there has been a large influx of Colombian refugees into the UA. It is inevitable that the support rate of the war hawks will rise. Whats more, it just happened to be at the time when there are tensions in the relationship between the UA and Xin</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded but remained silent.</br>
</br>
He did not consider the refugee effect brought about by the war, and the UA was undoubtedly the first choice in the hearts of the Colombian people, followed by Canada. The influx of refugees would inevitably bring poverty and crime to the UA and cause a series of social problems. Now, it was also the critical moment of the election campaign. These problems would definitely impact on the election.</br>
</br>
It did appear that Mr. Kennedys opponent seemed to be a big proponent for anti-refugees.</br>
</br>
One of his campaign promises was to build a Great Wall along the border</br>
</br>
A meeting was taking place in the in the top military office in the UA.</br>
</br>
Not only high-level officials from the Ministry of Defense, but the president and his advisors and cabinet ministers were also present.</br>
</br>
It was quite interesting since just three days ago, the same people in the conference room had just met at the presidents office. Now in a different place, another meeting was being held. Although the topics discussed were different, there was no change in the objectives of the discussion.</br>
</br>
A meeting manuscript was placed in front of everyone, and there was also a brochure next to it, with words 2020 Xin International Defense Expo written on it.</br>
</br>
This brochure was designed by Future Military and was distributed by Xins National Defense Department through its embassies. However, the photocopied version placed in front of everyone was obtained by the CIB from an invited country.</br>
</br>
If it were any other countrys defense exhibition, it would not trigger a reaction this scale to have an emergency meeting.</br>
</br>
The key issue was the kind of weapons that certain country planned to sell at this defense exhibition</br>
</br>
Future Military intends to sell EMP weapons and kinetic skeletons to the member states of the Earth Defense Alliance. Secretary of Defense Carter looked around the colleagues around him and said with a solemn expression, Although it is currently uncertain what version of the weapon they are intending to sell, we still have to put heavy emphasis. I believe you all know what it means to us once EMP weapons proliferate.</br>
</br>
The senior officials of the Department of Defense and the ministers looked at each other in shock. It was obvious that they had already felt the concern in Carters words.</br>
</br>
</br>
After the military advisor hesitated for a moment, he requested to speak and said while he spun the pen in his hands.</br>
</br>
Conversely, does this mean that we also have the opportunity to obtain their EMP weapons? Our technical bottleneck in the development of EMP weapons has not made any effective progress. If we can find a way to buy some from them</br>
</br>
Impossible, Carter shook his head and smiled wryly, Not a single military-industrial complex company has been invited, and our purchasing department is obviously not on their invitation list.</br>
</br>
Not just the UA, no NATO member states had been invited. The 47 invited countries were all members of the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
In a sense, the behavior of Xin had indeed confirmed the UAs speculation.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade was not satisfied with the Earth Defense Alliance being only an organization with the purpose to defend against extraterrestrial civilizations. First, it used the space elevator and the global grid to kidnap the economies of the member states, and now it was beginning to strengthen the military cooperation between member states.</br>
</br>
They were uncertainty whether their goal was to become the second United Nations, NATO, or a combination of the two. However, they were strongly alerted by the series of actions taken by Celestial Trade</br>
</br>
The Olympic Games will be held in Yoto soon, President Hill, who had been silent, suddenly broke the silence on the meeting table, I will go to Yoto to attend the opening ceremony. I will talk this opportunity and speak with that man in person.</br>
</br>
The war that took place thousands of kilometers away did not affect the prosperity of Coro Island. Only foreign soldiers participated in the war with no Xin national soldiers involved.</br>
</br>
It was just that the impact of the war, after all, was blown onto the beaches of Xin with monsoon. Everyone was discussing whether there was going to be a war, and whether Xin would send a volunteer army like Moro. In addition, how would NATO react?</br>
</br>
After all, the Colombian authorities had detained the delegation of Xin under the direction of the CIB to blame Juans death on Xin. It was the FARC who rescued the delegation and sent them to the border of Ecuador.</br>
</br>
At least the mainstream media in Xin reported it this way.</br>
</br>
Whether it was public opinion or official message, they all sided with and supported FARC. Even the call to send troops to Colombia was gaining an increasing amount of support on Celestial Trades official site.</br>
</br>
The people of Xin were not really concerned over the war. It was because it seemed that Celestial Trades overseas military operations had never lost, and the aftereffects of the war had never been brought back to Xin. Only those immigrants from the UA or Europe still had mixed feelings about the international war operations.</br>
</br>
One side was their homeland, and the other was the country they now live in. Apart from calling for peace, there seemed to be no better choice for them.</br>
</br>
Time quickly arrived in August.</br>
</br>
The Yoto Olympics was about to begin, and the athletes of Xin had arrived in the Yoto training grounds in mid-July for a week of adaptive training.</br>
</br>
Because Xin was sending athletes to participate in the Olympics for first time, the country attached great importance to this event, and both the government and the people had shown considerable enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
About two years ago, when the crisis took place in Yoto, people all over the world were not optimistic that the country could walk out from the shadow of the T virus. The real estate price of Yoto plummeted to an extreme, and it was also at that time that Jiang Chen took advantage of the fact that Future Biology had yet to disclose the vaccine, and went on a purchase spree in the Yoto real estate market.</br>
</br>
In order to support Xins sports, Jiang Chen specially called the agent who helped him manage his real estate in Yoto and offered a five-star hotel not far from the Olympic Village under his name. Xins athletes could live for free.</br>
</br>
Living outside the Olympic Village during the Olympic Games was generally the privilege of big-name athletes. For example, the Dream Team, which competed for the first time in 1992, has never lived in the Olympic Village. However, it was the first time in the history of Olympic Games that more than 200 athletes and more than 100 coaches, team leaders, and medical personnel lived in an entire five-star hotel.</br>
</br>
Even Saudi Arabia had never flaunted wealth like this</br>
</br>
Future Group Presidents moves successfully shocked all the netizens in the world. While people lamented the luck of the athletes from Xin, they couldnt help but exclaim at the wealth of this president.</br>
</br>
It got to the point where an athlete from another country, who did not want their name to be disclosed, said bitterly in an interview with the media.</br>
</br>
They are not here to compete at all, they are here to show off their wealth</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1330: New Ride</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On August 2nd, a silver private jet appeared over Yoto International Airport.</br>
</br>
The long triangular wing slowly extended from the planes nose to the tail. The bowl-shaped engine at the end was lined with blade-like metal pieces. When it was ignited, an eerie blue light arc thrusted the plane forward. The streamlined body and the unique ion propulsion engine made this jet appear more like an aerospace plane than a private jet.</br>
</br>
It was not wrong.</br>
</br>
It was an aerospace plane.</br>
</br>
This private jet named Aerospace G100 was specially built for Jiang Chen by the Space Science and Technology Department of Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
Its flight principle was also different from that of most airplanes today. For flights longer than 800 kilometers, the Aerospace G100 would first enter the relatively low-pressure stratosphere, then enter the mesosphere, exosphere before it cruised at a speed of several Mach above the ozone layer.</br>
</br>
As far as the cruising attitude of long-distance flight is concerned, the Aerospace G100 had already surpassed most aircraft. It could quickly reach any place in the world within two hours and it did not need to apply for airspace rights for countries along its path.</br>
</br>
However, the most critical point was its cruising speed. The cruising speed of the Aerospace G100 could reach 25 Mach at an altitude of 100 kilometers (the first cosmic speed is about 23.2 Mach), so this aerospace plane could not only be used to travel to and from ground airports, but could also go to and from any airport on the ground to Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Only one aerospace plane was manufactured at this point, but mass production models would be available to the billionaires around the world. Many rich people would be interested in this type of sophisticated aircraft, since especially for the rich, time is money.</br>
</br>
Many people in the airports terminal lobby noticed the weird-looking aircraft.</br>
</br>
Many people exclaimed when they saw the plane with the blue flaming tail as it lowered its landing gear.</br>
</br>
Dear, look, what kind of plane is that? A blond woman pulled at her partner and excitedly pointed her finger at the plane outside.</br>
</br>
Am I seeing things? Why did an aerospaceplane land here. The tourist with a travel bag behind his back rubbed his eyes, and his nose was almost touching the window.</br>
</br>
Wait, look at the symbols above I recognize it! One is Future Heavy Industries and the other is Celestial Trade!</br>
</br>
In other words the person sitting inside is?</br>
</br>
Theres no other possibilities!</br>
</br>
Because the Olympic was about to start, visitors all the world had gathered in Yoto, but no one could recognize the model of this plane. Driven by curiosity, some people wanted to go up to and take a photo, but without exception, they were stopped by heavily armed soldiers.</br>
</br>
The day before Jiang Chens new plane arrived, the government blocked the runway where the aerospace plane landed and increased the police presence at the airport.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that even if the UA President was assassinated here, they did not dare to let Jiang Chen experience any problems here.</br>
</br>
No one wanted to be the second Colombia, and no one wanted the next solar wind to blow on their face.</br>
</br>
The Nippon Foreign Minister Kishida looked at the parked plane and greeted him with a huge smile. He extended his right hand and held onto Jiang Chens hand while he bowed and shook vigorously. Welcome! Haha, we welcome Mr. Jiangs arrival in Yoto to participate in our opening ceremony. Your arrival will definitely add sparks to the Olympic!</br>
</br>
I dont dare, Jiang Chen smiled modestly. After he shook the foreign ministers hand twice, he wanted to withdraw his hand.</br>
</br>
However, Foreign Minister Kishida was so enthusiastic that he continued to hold his hand and refused to let go, and he kept saying compliments. Obviously, he either worked hard to improve his Mandarin, or he stayed up late and memorized a few thousand words of manuscript</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the diligent Foreign Minister Kishida and started to feel goosebumps. The smile on his face twitched, and finally he withdrew his right hand calmly.</br>
</br>
Mr. Kishida, you dont have to be so polite. Our companys convoy is waiting for me outside the airport corridor, do you think</br>
</br>
It wont delay you for a long time. As Kishida spoke, he took an exquisitely crafted invitation letter from his assistant and handed it respectfully to Jiang Chen. This is just a little gesture to show our appreciation. We hope Mr. Jiang will come.</br>
</br>
A State Banquet Invitation?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen vaguely recalled that they seemed to have held one when Zhang Yaping came a few days ago.</br>
</br>
I am just a citizen. Such a grandiose gesture is too much. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
That is not a problem! With a warm smile, Kishida continued to say flattery words without feeling awkward at all, Guests from all walks of life are looking forward to your arrival. Please dont refuse</br>
</br>
Looking at his fiery eyes, Jiang Chen started to get goosebumps again.</br>
</br>
Wait a second, is this guy?</br>
</br>
How come I didnt realize before</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didnt know that the EMP he dropped in Colombia not only frightened NATO, but also frightened Nippon on the other side of the Pacific. Up to now, half of the power grid in Colombia was still paralyzed. The country was sent back to the early electrification age from the information age and had to rely on the humanitarian aid to pass through this difficult age.</br>
</br>
They must not be an enemy of Celestial Trade!</br>
</br>
This point of view had reached a consensus among high-level Nippon officials, and in a sense had even further accelerated the end of the Nippon-UA Security Treaty and the disintegration of the Nippon-UA-Korea Triangle Alliance. If the Nippon intelligence agencies had previously only turned a blind eye to the spy war between the CIB and Ghost Agents in their own country, it was starting to lean towards Xin.</br>
</br>
The nation had a history of being extremely vicious to the weak and bowing down to the strong.</br>
</br>
While Kishida sent Jiang Chen to the car, he suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
I wonder if Mr. Jiang plans to live in a mansion in the suburbs, or stay in a hotel in the city?</br>
</br>
The mansion under Mount Fuji was too far away from Yoto. It would take at least four hours to drive back and forth. After all, this time, he was not here for leisure</br>
</br>
Ill be in Yoto, whats the matter? Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
Its nothing, please dont mind it. Foreign Minister Kishida bowed again and with a mysterious smile on his face, he added, Mr. Jiang came from afar and therefore must lack a guide. We will send you a commissioner to take care of your daily life and travel safety to ensure stay feels at home.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen took a moment to process the information, he responded with a respectful smile.</br>
</br>
Thank you.</br>
</br>
The bodyguard standing on the side closed the door, and soon the convoy started to move slowly and left through the special passage of the airport.</br>
</br>
While watching the convoy disappear on the road, Kishida lifted his head in relief. He then took some wet wipes from his assistant, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and threw it into the trash can next to him</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1331"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1331: Who Could It Be?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the convoy entered the highway, it slowly rose and entered the maglev track.</br>
</br>
With the gradual expansion of overseas exports of maglev roads by Future Heavy Industries, there were no more vehicles on the roads of Yoto, because most vehicles, except buses and trains, floated in the sky. Now not only the Luer Group but also internationally renowned automobile brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Tesla, Toyota also begun to enter the maglev car market.</br>
</br>
The core of the magnetic levitation technology was mainly on the pillars underneath the highway. On the contrary to popular belief, the technical difficulties of the maglev vehicle were not particularly high. After top international auto manufacturers obtained the relevant patent from Future Heavy Industries, they could also manufacture vehicles capable of meeting the standard of the maglev roads.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was fully aware that he could not monopolize the market, so he was not stingy in technology licensing, just like when he opened the technology licensing the graphene. Fifty percent of the worlds chips now used architecture derived from Future Technology. The same was true for maglev cars, except that almost 100% of maglev cars used the Future Standards.</br>
</br>
In addition to allowing major auto manufacturers to be labeled as Future Heavy Industries, this decision also brought huge profits to Future Group.</br>
</br>
Take Mercedes-Benz as an example. For every maglev series vehicle produced by Mercedes-Benz, it not only had to obtain quality certification from Future Heavy Industries before it could be sold, but the company also had to pay a technology licensing fee of one percent on the price of the vehicle before tax.</br>
</br>
In the vehicle, Jiang Chen called Ayesha to inform her that he landed safely.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to hang up, he received another call.</br>
</br>
When he saw the name on the holographic screen, he took an extra second to read the name again before he picked up the call.</br>
</br>
That plane is yours? Yerif immediately asked as soon as the call was connected.</br>
</br>
Plane? Jiang Chen was confused as he didnt understand the question, Which place are you referring to?</br>
</br>
The Aurora-20? Or a Russian fighter?</br>
</br>
He instinctively linked Yerifs words with the situation in Syria.</br>
</br>
Yerif had an odd expression when he heard the confusion in Jiang Chens tone.</br>
</br>
You didnt look at the news?</br>
</br>
I just arrived in Yoto, on the car back to my hotel, what news are you talking about. Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
Wait, Ill send you a link, see for yourself</br>
</br>
Yerif hung up shortly after.</br>
</br>
Not long after, his watch buzzed, and an email was sent to Jiang Chens email address.</br>
</br>
There was only a link in his mail. From the domain name, it was from YouTube</br>
</br>
With full of confusion in his mind, Jiang Chen clicked on the video.</br>
</br>
The video was from a waiting lounge at an airport.</br>
</br>
</br>
Probably because it was shot with a phone, the quality of the video was poor. The person who shot the video was obviously not a professional photographer as the camera was shaking. However, the unreasonable part was how viral the video became.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paid attention to the time when the video was uploaded.</br>
</br>
In less than an hour, the number of views exceeded one million.</br>
</br>
Even with YouTubes traffic, it still shocked him.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen suddenly paused.</br>
</br>
Because he saw a familiar outline in the video.</br>
</br>
Wait, Isnt this my G100?</br>
</br>
There was a dumbfounding expression on his face. He understood the reason why Yerif called. His tone sounded so serious that he thought something must have happened in Syria. After the mercenaries from Madagascar arrived in Syria, the Aurora-20s would fly over to check in every day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slid down the screen and glanced through the comments section.</br>
</br>
Many people recognized from the logo on the plane that it was a product of Future Heavy Industries. Although people were no longer surprised by the dark technology of the Future Group, they were still amazed by the fact that he rode an aerospace plane.</br>
</br>
[The richest man is indeed rich. He takes an aerospace plane for longer trips]</br>
</br>
[I just want to know how much this plane costs? Although I cant afford it even if I know]</br>
</br>
[Haha, interesting, Future Heavy Industries is looking to steal business from Gulfstream. Following the automotive industry, is the aviation industry going to experience a bloodbath?]</br>
</br>
[To be honest, if this thing is not expensive, it will sell like crazy]</br>
</br>
[I feel that my future has been contracted by Future Group.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile when he saw the top comments, then he called Yerif back.</br>
</br>
My friend, now you know which plane I am talking about. Yerif grinned.</br>
</br>
I see, Jiang Chen made a helpless expression, I guess, you are planning to buy one too?</br>
</br>
TEN!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost choked as he had to cough to conceal his shocked state.</br>
</br>
Do you know how much one costs?</br>
</br>
How much? Yerif was taken aback.</br>
</br>
I will provide you the personnel training and supporting maintenance equipment for free. This Aerospace-100 is the price of five Gulfstream G650s.</br>
</br>
Five Gulfstreams?!</br>
</br>
Yerif brows twitched.</br>
</br>
Even if the Saudi Royal Family was rich, it was also royal money. Now old king viewed Yerif positively, if everything continued smoothly, he would be the next king. But at this moment, if he spent more than 3 billion Xin New dollars to buy ten private jets, even the old king would probably rethink this decision.</br>
</br>
Then lets have two. Yerif debated for a moment and decided to pay for it out of his own pocket, I want them in black, you know, in our country, black represents nobleness. One of them will be plated with my fathers name in gold. I plan to give it to my father as a birthday present</br>
</br>
As the richest man in the world, the old king lacked nothing. Every year Yerif had to think hard about his birthday because he really didnt know what to give. He gave an elephant the year before last year. Last year his brother gifted a tiger. This year, there seemed to be another lion, so he couldnt just gift more pets. The palace was almost becoming a zoo!</br>
</br>
Ahem, please send it to my mailbox with your requirements, Jiang Chen interrupted him and said, I cant remember all in my head.</br>
</br>
Thank you! My friend, Yerif said gratefully. This is a great help to me.</br>
</br>
Is it that serious?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head while containing his grin, then he hung up.</br>
</br>
The hotel where he stayed was one of his assets, and it was only two blocks away from the National Stadium. From the floor-to-ceiling windows in the presidential suite on the top floor of the hotel, the runway and greenfield were even visible.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen arrived in the room along with the hotel waiter, he tossed his suit on the hanger. He was about to take a shower first, and then lay down and rest for a while. The bodyguards downstairs called his watch and said that someone who claimed to be a reception commissioner sent by the government was visiting.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow as he recalled what Foreign Minister Kishida said to him at the airport.</br>
</br>
Then he casually said, Let him up.</br>
</br>
Yes.</br>
</br>
Who could it be?</br>
</br>
He was very curious.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1332: A Very Simple Way</br>
</div></br>
</br>
About a month ago, Miss Kwai, who was already working for the Yoto Metropolitan Police Department, was called to the office of the Ministry of General Affairs. She was informed that there was an important task assigned to her. Miss Kwai, who hadnt been assigned any key tasks, eagerly rushed to the office in excitement.</br>
</br>
Her boss politely invited her to sit down, then put a document on the table. He tapped the document lightly with his finger but didnt open it. He instead just explained.</br>
</br>
A very important foreign guest will visit Yoto on August 2nd, and you will be his security advisor.</br>
</br>
Thats fine, but why am I selected? Kwai was slightly taken aback and asked in confusion.</br>
</br>
Shouldnt security advisors be selected from the Intelligence Department? Why am I chosen with just a police background?</br>
</br>
I dont know. This is a document issued directly from the above. Both the Cabinet Intelligence Research Office and the Ministry of Defense signed the document, The boss touched his nose and said.</br>
</br>
Can you show me the mission book? I need more details in order to better complete the task.</br>
</br>
The expression on the bosss face was a little subtle, he coughed, put the file in the drawer, and looked away while he continued.</br>
</br>
No, the task itself is not very difficult. I believe that Miss Kwais strength is more than sufficient without more details. What you need to do is be responsible for solving some legal problems that the foreign guest may encounter during his stay here. People from the Self-Defense Forces and the Intelligence Department will be responsible.</br>
</br>
I understand, I promise to complete the task!</br>
</br>
Although she wondered why he couldnt show her the mission log, Miss Kwai still accepted this mission with confidence.</br>
</br>
It was just that for some strange reason, the old boss, who had always been aggressive towards his subordinates at work, was afraid to look her in the eyes</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was her Illusion?</br>
</br>
In any case, it was the first big task in her career. If she could complete this task to perfection, it would definitely be a highlight on her resume. With 120% enthusiasm, Miss Kwai also studied a month of Mandarin. Because she heard that the foreign guest she was in charge of spoke Mandarin, she thought it must be a high-level foreign guest that was coming here to participate in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.</br>
</br>
However, Miss Kwai never expected that when she arrived at the hotel where the foreign guest stayed, with anxiety and excitement, that shed meet someone she didnt want to see.</br>
</br>
No, he should be called the devil!</br>
</br>
I guess you are hesitant about whether or not you should run away, Jiang Chen looked at the shaking Kwai in the hallway, as her slender shoulders trembled. Jiang Chen touched his chin as his lips curved, But I guess you will choose to stay.</br>
</br>
Im a police constable now Miss Kwai said nervously, Please be respectful. I can forget the things that happened before but from now on</br>
</br>
</br>
Because she was too nervous, she accidentally bit her tongue.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed as he looked at the lady with red cheeks. He walked to the sofa and sat down, turned on the TV, and asked casually while changing the channel.</br>
</br>
Police constable? What is that?</br>
</br>
A rank The corner of her lips raised, as she was obviously quite proud.</br>
</br>
She indeed could be proud.</br>
</br>
In Nippon, women did not have an advantage in the workplace. She graduated from the police academy less than two years ago and was able to go from the lowest rank, an inspector, to a constable before she was twenty-four. Even if this was a drama, her promotion path was quite rare.</br>
</br>
Oh, Jiang Chen nodded thoughtfully and laughed, It seems that they are taking good care of you.</br>
</br>
Taking care? Kwai was slightly taken aback.</br>
</br>
She didnt realize that she was promoted so quickly in the workplace because of someones work.</br>
</br>
Lets not talk about this, Jiang Chen smiled and turned off the TV that hadnt been on for too long, Since there is still time before nightfall, we might as well do something interesting.</br>
</br>
What do you want to do? There was a noticeable panic in her eyes and Kwai subconsciously took half a step back. However, when she saw the smirk on Jiang Chens face, she was agitated. She worked up her courage and stared back at Jiang Chen. In a threatening tone, she said, Even if you have diplomatic immunity, if news spreads that youve done something to a police officer, Im afraid you cant get out of it.</br>
</br>
The more powerful, the more they cared about their reputation.</br>
</br>
Kwai was certain that Jiang Chen would definitely make the right choice in front of personal and group reputation. However, when she saw his eyes, Jiang Chen shattered her self-confidence with only three words.</br>
</br>
Are you sure?</br>
</br>
Are you sure?</br>
</br>
Kwai started to panic.</br>
</br>
Even she herself didnt know why she started to question herself.</br>
</br>
I will tell my boss that Ill give up this mission.</br>
</br>
Her glistening teeth clenched tightly together, and she bowed deeply. Kwai left this sentence and ran to the entrance. However, when she reached for the doorknob, she realized that she couldnt open the door.</br>
</br>
I told you to come in, Jiang Chen shrugged, stood up, and said slowly, But I never told you to leave.</br>
</br>
Kwai hurriedly took out her phone as she saw Jiang Chen walk towards her.</br>
</br>
Dont worry, you have one minute to call now. Ill allow you to ask anyone for help, Jiang Chen said with a smirk, By the way, if you call the police or call your colleague or boss, I promise you it wont work. If you call your family, I will let you go. Everything that happened before will be wiped clean, and I will promise you a reasonable request.</br>
</br>
The hand that held onto her phone trembled, and Kwai shuddered as she watched Jiang Chen approach her. She moved back again and again before her back was against the door.</br>
</br>
I still have a bottom line. I never force anyone to do anything. Jiang Chen walked to her and brushed a strand of her hair behind her ear. As he watched her panic like a squirrel, shrunken in the corner, he slowly took away the phone she was holding, then whispered into her ear while blowing on her soft earlobe, It turns out you are still looking forward to it, arent you?</br>
</br>
Kwai said in a shaky voice.</br>
</br>
You, you devil</br>
</br>
Devil? I dont think so. Jiang Chen shrugged, dropped the smartphone in his hand on the cabinet at the entrance, and glanced at her with interest. He then said, In fact, there is a very simple way to verify my reasoning.</br>
</br>
Whwhat reasoning?</br>
</br>
The reasoning that you are actually expecting me to do something to you.</br>
</br>
Kwais breathing was choppy as she squeezed these words from between her teeth.</br>
</br>
That is impossible.</br>
</br>
Dont deny it right away. Jiang Chen looked at the stubborn and dazed look that interchanged on her face. Then, he raised her right hand and showed it to her with the same smirk, Let me teach you what to do. You can go to the bathroom and verify it yourself.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1333: Part of the Fun</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It didnt take long before he heard the toilet being flushed in the washroom, followed by the roar of the hairdryer.</br>
</br>
He smugness of his smile was very apparent.</br>
</br>
It seemed that he had guessed right.</br>
</br>
He was curious when she got wet.</br>
</br>
Did it start when she stepped into the room, or when she was in an internal struggle the moment she held onto the phone?</br>
</br>
This answer may only be clear to her.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen had a feeling that he would hear it directly from her one day.</br>
</br>
As for now, he certainly wouldnt do anything to her.</br>
</br>
He still had a state banquet in the evening to attend to and he did not want to smell like perfume. Since it was part of the fun, he was not in a hurry anyway. He still had to stay in Yoto for a while, so he considered it as a sideshow in this trip.</br>
</br>
It was quite enjoyable to appreciate the righteous pretty face gradually become confused in the contradiction between resistance and pleasure and begin to doubt everything she had insisted on and finally turn into a mess.</br>
</br>
After all, if he just needed to vent his desire, it would be too low for his current status. If he just signaled, the number of people who would recommend themselves would be lined up from Coro Island to Celestial City. It was rare to see someone like Miss Kwai, who could possess her dignity for so long.</br>
</br>
Although it was just part of his wicked humor</br>
</br>
After Kwai came out of the washroom, her chest was pumping up and down violently. Her face was completely covered in red clouds of shame, and a hint of lostness. The shame was because of Jiang Chens frivolity, and the lostness was because she had always believed in what she insisted.</br>
</br>
She thought she was being forced, and she resisted this devil.</br>
</br>
However, her bodys reaction completely denied this.</br>
</br>
She didnt know how to face Jiang Chen, or even how to face herself like this</br>
</br>
I will go to the New Otani Hotel in the evening. You can arrange this time by yourself. Qian Xia will be here soon. You can go back and get a change of clothes. After all, you are the tour guide sent to me, so of course, you have to live here during this time.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen finished this sentence, he glanced at the blushing Kwai at the door of the bathroom, and deliberately not looked at her expression, he instead just pointed to the sofa next to him, Why are you just standing there? Are you afraid of me? Or, are you expecting me to do something to you?</br>
</br>
Just when Kwai was blow-drying her hair, besides calling the little maid Qian Xia who was going to school, Jiang Chen also received an email from Yerif. It was evident that the crown prince was very invested in his fathers birthday gift. In less than two hours, he had already sent the orders.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Kwai, who had sat far away from him. He forwarded the email to Future Heavy Industries CEO Yang Guangleis email, as well as emphasized the priority of this order. Then he returned a call to Yerif to urge him to send pilots for training on Ange Islands Space Training Center as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
</br>
Different from traditional aircraft, the Aerospace G100 that could reach the synchronous orbit could obviously be classified as a space shuttle, and the pilot must naturally possess the identity of an astronaut. Even for an experienced pilot that controlled multiple models of aircraft, it was necessary to attend training for further enhancement.</br>
</br>
Considering that Saudi Arabia was an important part of the Celestial Trade Middle East strategy, Jiang Chen did Yerif a favor and waived the pilot training costs, as well as the costs of maintenance equipment. If all these costs were added together, it would cost at least half of a Gulfstream.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat there writing his emails, while Kwai sat in the corner of the sofa with her head lowered. The quiet atmosphere lasted for a long time until someone knocked on the door to remind Jiang Chen that it was time to leave.</br>
</br>
The banquet was held at the New Otani Hotel.</br>
</br>
With only five minutes left before the six oclock start, five black cars stopped at the entrance of the New Otani Hotel. After the motorcade stopped, a bodyguard stepped forward and opened the door for Jiang Chen, and stood respectfully aside.</br>
</br>
The Foreign Minister Kishida walked forward, just like he did at the airport. He extended out his hand from a long-distance away. Behind the minister were politicians and elites in different industries who Jiang Chen couldnt name nor interested in meeting.</br>
</br>
After a polite greeting, Kishida gestured to the entrance of the New Otani Hotel and enthusiastically invited Jiang Chen inside.</br>
</br>
The superfluous flattery often was the pretense for something else.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen certainly didnt think that Mr. Kishida dared to think anything malicious, but his flattering attempt made it difficult to not suspect any ill intentions.</br>
</br>
However, what surprised Jiang Chen was that from the time he got off the plane, this guy didnt say anything else except for some flattering words, which really didnt fit their style.</br>
</br>
Maybe he is planning to bring the topic up at the banquet?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought.</br>
</br>
The banquet hall was quite spacious, and if the tables were removed, it could be turned into a ballroom.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as Jiang Chen took a seat at the table, the banquet began.</br>
</br>
There was a strange tradition in Nippon. Although the country has a rich food culture, in most of its state banquets, the cuisine of choice was often French, or at least French cuisine with local characteristics.</br>
</br>
In their own words: The relatively closed cooking method, like the culture, was difficult to change once an impression was formed, let alone be accepted by foreigners. In addition, for the safety of diners, the local cuisine was generally not used in diplomatic settings.</br>
</br>
In short, they were worried that foreign guests would experience food poisoning or an upset stomach after eating sashimi.</br>
</br>
As the dining carts passed one by one, the dishes on the table gradually became dazzling.</br>
</br>
Beside the table, Jiang Chen did not touch his cutleries yet before he unexpectedly saw two acquaintances.</br>
</br>
One was Hiroto Mitsui, the owner of the Mitsui Foundation, and the other was Sumitomo Kenichi, the eldest son of the Sumitomo Foundation.</br>
</br>
The first was self-explanatory. When the T-virus crisis broke out, after Tanaka was removed by Jiang Chen, Mitsui Hiroto promptly removed himself and his family from the owner behind the Kurofune and submitted a list to Jiang Chen in exchange for Jiang Chens promise to not further pursue this incident.</br>
</br>
The two did not meet again afterward. At this moment, Mitsui just smiled at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
In contrast, Sumitomo Kenichi was much more enthusiastic.</br>
</br>
As the representative of the power cooperation with Celestial Trade, his prestige had grown to the point where he was considered one of the brightest leaders in the younger generation of the Sumitomo Foundation. After he had signed the transmission cable contract with Celestial Trade, the Sumitomo Foundation had grown tremendously. They were the actual controllers of the countrys third-largest power company, and now they had monopolized most of the energy market with ultra-low-cost electricity prices.</br>
</br>
If everything proceeded smoothly, he would become the patriarch of the family.</br>
</br>
And at this moment, the heir to the Sumitomo Foundation was working hard to discuss the next new deal with Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1334: I“m Being Watched</br>
</div></br>
</br>
We are very interested in your companys concept of Future City, especially the logistics drone. I have been following your drone logistics pilots in Xiangjiang and Wanghai and the drone hive is an ingenious design! Full of excitement, Sumitomo Kenichi did not hesitate to give his praise, There is also drone medical care! Currently, Sumitomo Group is investing heavily in logistics and medical care. Is Mr. Jiang interested?</br>
</br>
If your company plans to introduce drone systems, then, of course, we welcome it. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Great. If Mr. Jiang doesnt have any special arrangements after the banquet, please allow me to take some of your time. With a happy expression on his face, Sumitomo Kenichi looked at Jiang Chen and said sincerely, I hope to discuss with you in detail.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was about to find an excuse to refuse the meeting, but he saw a hint of pleading in Sumitomo Kenichis eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thoughtfully examined the candlestick on the dining table while he pondered. He then changed his mind and raised his glass with a smile.</br>
</br>
Of course.</br>
</br>
The caution with EMP weapons, the NATO Coalition Force caught in the mess in Colombia, and the expectations for the collapse of the UA-Nippon-Korea alliance continued to escalate. Everyone was keeping a close eye on Celestial Trades next move to catch small details that could predict future trends.</br>
</br>
In a sense, Jiang Chen participating in a state-level banquet held for him was already sending a certain signal to the rest of the world. As for the banquet itself, it was not so important.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this very reason, Jiang Chen clearly felt many people were observing him secretly at the banquet. Those eyes were mixed with a hint of confusion, but more so, they revealed: obviously, this makes sense.</br>
</br>
It was not a secret that Nippon was seeking to join the Earth Defense Alliance in order to avoid high defense taxes and enhance the market competitiveness of its aerospace companies in the space race of the new century.</br>
</br>
Based on the structure of the Earth Defense Alliance, new member states must be reviewed by the four primary member states by voting, and a one-vote veto system was implemented. On the premise of abandoning disputed territories and establishing a correct view of history, Nippon already gained the approval votes of Hua and Russia, and Frankbergs abstention.</br>
</br>
The only vote in question was Xin. However, now that Jiang Chen was sitting here, it showed that the vote at least wont be an objection, and the possibility of Nippon entering the Earth Defense Alliance was quite high.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was curious about how the UA media would react after tonight.</br>
</br>
But he was certain that regardless of the outcome, it wont be an optimistic view</br>
</br>
When the banquet was approaching its latter half, Jiang Chen won several additional deals for Future Group, with a total value of more than 100 billion Xin New dollars. The projects were drone systems, smart wearables, graphene materials, as well as space mining.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, he only showed his intention to work together. As for the specifics of the agreement, it depended on the negotiations with Future Groups subsidiaries.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu would verify the outcome, and Jiang Chen rarely interfered with the specifics of the agreement.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, I have a question that I dont know if its appropriate to ask, Kishida Fumio asked with a smile on his face.</br>
</br>
It depends on the question, Jiang Chen responded with a respectable smile.</br>
</br>
I dont intend to be offensive, Kishida Fumio smiled, Its just that I heard that the relationship between Xin and the UA has been tense recently, and it has gradually escalated from the military level to the economic level. I dont know if Future Groups interests in the UA have been affected by this?</br>
</br>
Of course there are influences, but they are all within a controllable range, Jiang Chen shrugged, then said with a smile, They can refuse to buy Future phones, but they cannot refuse to buy Phantom helmets, nor can they refuse to purchase the medical drones that makeup one-third of their healthcare system. No matter how unreasonable their tariffs on us may be, we dont really mind. After all, its consumers in their country who pay the bills. Unless they can find a substitute, they have no choice.</br>
</br>
Hahaha, Mr. Jiang can certainly read the situation, cheers. Kishida Fumio, slightly intoxicated, raised his glass.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also raised the glass slightly, but when he drank, he threw the liquor into the storage dimension</br>
</br>
In the melodious symphony, the banquet was approaching the end.</br>
</br>
Since it was getting late, Jiang Chen was not interested in staying any longer. After exchanging goodbyes with Kishida and the others, he got up and headed to the door.</br>
</br>
After he left New Otani Hotel, he walked toward the convoy at the entrance of the hotel. Unsurprisingly, Sumitomo Kenichi, who had previously hinted at something, also followed him.</br>
</br>
It was unclear what kind of concerns Mr. Sumitomo had. After he was next to Jiang Chen, he didnt say his intentions directly, nor did he even talk about the drones that he had mentioned earlier. He just chatted casually on some non-related topics. After Jiang Chen got into the car, he also opened the door on the other side and sat next to him.</br>
</br>
The door closed.</br>
</br>
Only until this moment, did Sumitomo Kenichi remove the mask on his face. His stiff smile slowly relaxed, he leaned on the seat, and let out a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a long look at the eldest son of the Sumitomo Financial Group, and then he said with a comforting tone.</br>
</br>
Dont worry about being overheard here, you can speak freely. But before you speak, I have to say something in advance. If you are going to talk to me about something boring, its better not to say it.</br>
</br>
Im being watched! Sumitomo Kenichi hurriedly said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was slightly stunned, then he laughed.</br>
</br>
You got the wrong guy.</br>
</br>
For what reason would the eldest son of a large consortium be watched?</br>
</br>
Apart from the power struggle within the consortium, Jiang Chen could not think of a better reason.</br>
</br>
The relationship between Celestial Trade and Sumitomo Group could only be described as a friendly partnership. Jiang Chen only knew Sumitomo Kenichi as a partner, and he was not interested in participating in their internal power struggle.</br>
</br>
To put it bluntly, no matter who the next owner of the Sumitomo Group is, it would have no impact on Celestial Trades Global Power Grid plan. The Sumitomo Group was not the only company capable of taking on this project in Nippon. The submarine power transmission cables were already built. If the Central Power Company was no longer a suitable partner, Celestial Trade could still work with Eastern Power and Western Power.</br>
</br>
With many nuclear power and thermal power plants shut down, Nippon no longer had the final say in electricity.</br>
</br>
No! I didnt find the wrong person! Sumitomo Kenichi stared at Jiang Chen, and said in a pleading tone, Please let me finish.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen motioned for him to continue.</br>
</br>
You might think this is an internal struggle within our family, and Im asking you for help, right? Am I such an idiot? Can those idiots beat me? With a self-deprecating grin, Sumitomo Kenichi took a deep breath, sorted out the thoughts in his head, and stared at Jiang Chen with seriousness, The CIB is targeting me</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1335: Takeda Pharmaceutical“s Servers</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the entrance of the New Otani Hotel, guests with flamboyant appearances left one after another.</br>
</br>
Many people were euphoric because they had signed a big deal, while many people were disappointed that Jiang Chen left too early. Under the streetlight outside the main entrance, Hiroto Mitsui stood beside a black car like a sculpture, his eyes narrowed as he followed the direction Celestial Trades convoy left in.</br>
</br>
His bodyguard opened the door for him and stepped aside respectfully.</br>
</br>
Hiroto Mitsuis assistant with black frame glasses, who stood behind him, stepped aside and reminded his boss softly.</br>
</br>
President, the car is ready.</br>
</br>
The silence continued until the few car lights disappeared at the end of the street. Mitsui Hiroto seemed to have made up his mind and nodded slowly.</br>
</br>
Mhmm.</br>
</br>
The CIB?</br>
</br>
A look of interest appeared in Jiang Chens eyes.</br>
</br>
What is the reason for the CIB to waste resources on the eldest son of a consortium? Although the Sumitomo Consortium had cooperated on the Global Grid Plan, it was purely an economic exchange. He didnt think there was anything worth investigating.</br>
</br>
Go on, Jiang Chen quietly said as he leaned back.</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi took a deep breath and sorted out the words in his head.</br>
</br>
Remember the tragedy two and a half years ago?</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen smiled and said softly, Im afraid no one in this world will forget the tragedy that day.</br>
</br>
Two and a half years ago, an explosion occurred in Shinagawa, Yoto. Tens of thousands of people were directly or indirectly infected by the T virus and were turned into the living dead. It was the second tragedy that happened in the world after what happened in City K, and panic was once again set off worldwide.</br>
</br>
It was also from that time that the term Takeda Pharmaceutical along with the Nippon authorities were pushed to the midst of controversy. Abe, who was still seeking re-election through constitutional amendments, was also forced to step down because of this, and a year later, he went to jail. The speech made by the leader of Kurofune, Tanaka, made the whole world aware of the word Kurofune and made this word surpass the word Taliban to become the worlds number one terrorist organization.</br>
</br>
Later, that incident, the previous City K Tragedy, and the later Finnish Mother Nest, were generally regarded as three unpleasant contacts between earth civilization and extraterrestrial civilization. To a certain extent, it indirectly promoted the establishment of the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
What I want to talk about is exactly that, Sumitomo Kenichi looked at Jiang Chen with a solemn expression, and narrated the complete story, Just two months ago</br>
</br>
This is what happened.</br>
</br>
Just two months ago, one of Sumitomo Groups cargo ships that was about to set off from Nagasaki Port to Los Angeles, was detained by customs at Nagasaki Port. The detainment was on the grounds that prohibited items were suspected to be on board. At that time, Sumitomo Kenichi, who was in charge of handling this matter, felt it was very strange. Sumitomo Kenichi had been the president of Sumitomo Shipping for many years and this was the first time his ship had been detained by customs for transporting embargoed items.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was not until later that he went to the scene to understand the situation and realized the seriousness of the problem.</br>
</br>
What exactly was in the container in question? Jiang Chen asked while he tried to piece everything together.</br>
</br>
Its just a bunch of obsolete servers, but the problem lies with these servers, said Sumitomo Kenichi with a dumbfounded expression. Those servers were the assets sold by the bank when Takeda Pharmaceuticals went bankrupt. Based on reliable sources, these servers came from a laboratory code-named Dark. I believe you dont need me to say more for you to know where that is.</br>
</br>
The birthplace of the T virus? Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Thats right. Sumitomo Kenichi nodded.</br>
</br>
When Kurofune issued a declaration of war on all of mankind, in order to prevent Takeda Pharmaceutical from creating an antidote based on his research results, Tanaka formatted all the servers in the laboratory after he took the virus samples.</br>
</br>
At that time, due to the mismanagement of the Yoto government and the resignation of the ruling party, after Takeda Pharmaceutical was seized, these servers were inexplicably labeled as auction assets together with other assets. They were purchased by an export trade company two years ago, then they disappeared.</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi never expected these servers would appear on his ship.</br>
</br>
But why are the CIB people after you? Jiang Chen frowned and asked.</br>
</br>
At that time, I thought that I should avoid trouble, so I bribed the customs. Before the customs reported the involved goods, I switched the container with brand new servers, and I was ready to destroy the old servers. But I didnt expect At this point, Sumitomo Kenichis smile was bitter, I escaped prosecution by customs, but I didnt escape the eyes of the CIB.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen listened to Sumitomo Kenichis description, he became deep in thought.</br>
</br>
Strictly speaking, these servers were definitely harmless. After all, all data had been formatted. However, there was still a hidden risk. People could use special techniques to restore the deleted data from the server with a probability to successfully restore the data.</br>
</br>
And now, someone attempted to smuggle these servers on Sumitomo Groups ship to Los Angeles, which made this situation even more intriguing.</br>
</br>
The Kurofune became small independent units that fought on their own. They were like rodents that feared the light with the constant pursuit of agents around the world. Jiang Chen did not imagine they could have the ability to use the legacy left by Tanaka to revive the organization.</br>
</br>
As for another possibility</br>
</br>
This batch of servers, that should have been sent to Los Angeles, was the work of the CIB.</br>
</br>
Where are these servers now? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Theyve been taken away by the CIB, Sumitomo Kenichi squeezed out a bitter smile, I thought it would be fine if they took the server, but it didnt take long before my bodyguard found trackers in my bedroom and on my car. I dont know what they want to do, but I dare say they are not up to anything good</br>
</br>
Yes, Jiang Chen laughing and said jokingly, I bet if you were just a nobody, you would have now been fished out from a sewer ditch by the police.</br>
</br>
That is not a funny joke, Sumitomo Kenichi said with an ugly expression.</br>
</br>
Im not joking with you, Jiang Chen shrugged and said with a smile, If I were the CIB, you may have been silenced Then, is there any other clue?</br>
</br>
When the bug was first discovered, I hired a private investigator to trace the source of those servers. I wanted to know who smuggled those things into my container. However, in the end, I found something unexpected.</br>
</br>
What did you found?</br>
</br>
Rokawa Electronics, the supplier for these servers, Sumitomo Kenichi took a deep breath. The private investigator I hired found out that they are funded by</br>
</br>
The Mitsui Consortium, right? Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichis eyes widened as he looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, you are</br>
</br>
You want to ask me how I knew, right? Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head, raised his chin, and gestured to him in the direction of the rear-view mirror with his eyes. Dont look at me as a businessman. I have experienced a lot. I think my counterintelligence ability is quite strong.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroto dared to follow him?</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen spoke, he opened the holographic screen of his watch, edited a short message, and sent it to Gill, the person in charge of Ghost Agents in Nippon. Then, he said to the uneased Sumitomo Kenichi, Beginning tomorrow, I will send someone to secretly ensure your safety. As for other things, I dont need you to do anything for the time being. When I need you, just cooperate with me.</br>
</br>
Thank you. Sumitomo Kenichi said gratefully.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome, Jiang Chen smiled and said softly, Where are you going, if its not far away, I can ask my driver to drop you off. Of course, if I were you, I would get off immediately.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the hotel, it was already ten oclock in the evening.</br>
</br>
To his surprise, Miss Kwai decided to leave. Only Qian Xia dressed as a maid was in the room.</br>
</br>
Where is our policewoman? Jiang Chen asked casually as he opened his arms.</br>
</br>
Ms. Kwai said that if you need anything, please call her. She wont stay here tonight, Qian Xia replied with her beautiful voice as she took Jiang Chens coat and hung it onto the hanger.</br>
</br>
She left?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lowered his open arms and he grinned.</br>
</br>
He remembered telling her before he left to stay tonight.</br>
</br>
Why didnt you keep her? With a smirk, Jiang Chen rubbed Qian Xias chin with his finger.</br>
</br>
I didnt know master wanted her to stay. Master, if you need, Ill call Ms. Kwai Qian Xia said with panic in her voice.</br>
</br>
This is your negligence as a maid for not knowing your masters thoughts, Jiang Chens finger slid down her chin as he smiled evilly, Forget it, anyway, its all the same. Originally, I planned to punish her tonight, but youll have to take the punishment instead.</br>
</br>
Qian Xias cheeks turned red.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, Jiang Chen called her by the name Qian Xia. If he called her by the identity of a maid, then most likely he was thinking of naughty things.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia closed her fine eyelashes, lowered her head, and whispered in her gentle voice.</br>
</br>
Master, please punish me</br>
</br>
In the early morning of the next day, Jiang Chen slept till eight.</br>
</br>
Just after he ate the breakfast delivered by the hotel, he was about to check the days itinerary when Foreign Minister Kishida called.</br>
</br>
As soon as he picked up, Kishidas laughter entered his ear and he asked in a rather ambiguous tone.</br>
</br>
I wonder if Jiang Chen san was satisfied last night?</br>
</br>
Of course,  not satisfied! Halfway through, Jiang Chen suddenly changed his words and said with seriousness, The person you sent has had a very bad attitude. I obviously asked her to stay. However, when I came back to arrange the next days itinerary, she left without saying a word!</br>
</br>
Kishida hurriedly apologized, Im really sorry! Im sorry for the inadequate hospitality, but I hope Jiang Chen san will not be offended. We will immediately switch</br>
</br>
You dont need to switch, Jiang Chen shook his head as he resisted the urge to laugh. Then he coughed and said with the same seriousness, She will still be my assistant during the coming days. But Kishida san, please remember that my tolerance is limited.</br>
</br>
Yes! Yes!</br>
</br>
Kishida sweated profusely as he apologized, but in his mind, he scolded the police superintendent and Kwai countless times.</br>
</br>
They actually messed this up.</br>
</br>
Did they not know that Mr. Jiang was an important guest!?</br>
</br>
Alright, you called me not just to ask me if I was satisfied last night. Lets talk business.</br>
</br>
Yes. Mr. Prime Minister hopes to meet with you to discuss matters related to the UA military stationed in Nippon as well as the opportunity to join the alliance. I wonder if Mr. Jiang is free now? Kishida said quickly.</br>
</br>
</br>
How does this morning sound? I will go there now. Jiang Chen glanced at the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
No problem! We can do it anytime!</br>
</br>
After he hung up the phone, Jiang Chen looked at Qian Xia who tried to get up from the bed and help him dress. Last nights exercise was a bit too intense for the girl who hadnt worked out for a long time so her mind was still a little dizzy.</br>
</br>
Master, I will help you</br>
</br>
No, you can sleep a little longer. Jiang Chen was not the kind of person that didnt care for others. He grinned and buttoned up his clothes. Miss Kwai may be here in a bit. You can buy her a drink.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia was slightly taken aback, then cutely opened her mouth.</br>
</br>
After she saw Jiang Chens smirk, she suddenly realized what he meant as she giggled.</br>
</br>
Master, you are so bad.</br>
</br>
It was probably the third time Jiang Chen had visited the Nippon Prime Ministers residence and the third time he had seen the Prime Minister.</br>
</br>
And something more interesting was that every time he visited, the Prime Ministers smile gave him a completely different feeling.</br>
</br>
The first time, there seemed to be a knife hidden behind the smile. Nippon did not want to connect to the global grid. The second time it was compromising in reluctance because the Sumitomo Foundation used public opinion and Congress to force the government to make concessions on national security issues.</br>
</br>
As for the third time, Jiang Chen didnt know what meanings were hidden in his smile.</br>
</br>
There was a little caution, a little attempt to flatter, as for other meanings, he couldnt fully read him.</br>
</br>
After some greetings, the Prime Minister invited Jiang Chen to sit, then sat down and asked the assistant next to him to make a cup of matcha for the two.</br>
</br>
I want to talk to you about the UA military bases and the troops stationed in Nippon. With a warm smile, the Prime Minister said with straightforwardness, I believe Jiang Chen san must also be very concerned about this matter.</br>
</br>
While he spoke, he took the map from the assistants hand, spread it out on the coffee table, pointed his finger at the red dot on the map, and said sincerely.</br>
</br>
The UA military stationed in Nippon has 88 military facilities and bases, with a total number of more than 40,000 troops. The headquarters is located at Yokota Base in Yoto. If you can find a way to get rid of them, we can sublet 44 of the military bases to you guys!</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen listened to his proposal, Jiang Chen sneered in his mind.</br>
</br>
On the surface, this proposal seemed to be great. The 44 military bases were more than sufficient for Celestial Trades troops, or even somewhat excessive. However, the issue was not the number of military bases, but the word sublet.</br>
</br>
When were these military bases leased to the UA? In that case, how can you talk about subletting? If Celestial Trade can get rid of the UA on Nippon soil, youre not going to pay for protection fees, and youre going to charge rent?</br>
</br>
Im not here to do charity.</br>
</br>
For a long time, Nippon shouldered the bulk of the UA military expenditure, even far higher than its own military expenditure. In this sense, it was unfortunate for the Nippon people. While they paid for protection fees, they also enjoyed the protection of the UA soldiers.</br>
</br>
With the help of Celestial Trades knife, he could not only get rid of the UA from Nippon soil, remove the financial burden, and completely join the side of the Earth Defense Alliance. Mr. Prime Minster certainly came up with a great plan.</br>
</br>
But would Jiang Chen really bite?</br>
</br>
You may have made a mistake, Jiang Chen smiled, Celestial Trade is the worlds largest military contractor, it is not the Red Cross.</br>
</br>
Do you mean The Prime Ministers expression was a bit stiff. It was obvious that they just wanted to get rid of the UA riding on their heads and did not want to pay for the military expenses of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Thirty military bases, Jiang Chen raised his three fingers and said in an irrefutable tone, You are the bridgehead of the UA in Asia, but for us, its our doorstep. We dont need to station so many troops here. In addition, we dont plan to scam your money. You paid five billion dollars in military expenses last year. From now on, you only need to pay us half, so 2 billion Xin New dollars.</br>
</br>
As the Prime Minister was about to throw out a counter-offer, Jiang Chen gave the last carrot before he could speak.</br>
</br>
If you agree to my terms, then I can also assure you that Nippon will definitely get my vote to join the Earth Defense Alliance. Jiang Chen smiled at the Prime Minister who was not in the best mood and smiled, Of course, you can also get rid of the UA yourself through diplomatic means. We will not use that vote to kidnap you. We have stated from the start that there is only one condition for Nippon to join the Earth Defense Alliance, that is cancel all UA military bases on your soil.</br>
</br>
We dont like countries sitting on the fence, please be more certain with your position.</br>
</br>
East or west, you better decide as soon as possible.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1337: Nip It In The Bud</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Since the bankruptcy of Takeda Pharmaceutical, the Mitsui Consortium had fallen from grace and turned from a first-class consortium to now a second-rate consortium. If it werent for the ancient family name, the head of the Mitsui family would not even be qualified to sit at the banquet with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, when Mitsui Hiroto was auctioning off Takeda Pharmaceutical, he hid some tricks under his sleeve and bought the servers with a shell company. At that time, he didnt think too much; it was just an attempt to hedge for the future. After all, Takeda Pharmaceutical spent a lot of money on research and development for these formatted virus materials.</br>
</br>
But not long ago, the CIB found him and suddenly asked about those servers.</br>
</br>
After he considered the recent international situation, Hiroto Mitsui immediately understood the CIBs intentions, so he gladly stated that he was the owner of those servers, and at the same time graciously expressed that he was willing to donate these servers. He was even willing to help the CIB, who was now in an awkward position in Nippon, ship these servers out of the country.</br>
</br>
Taking refuge in the CIB was a gamble.</br>
</br>
Just as he put his bet on Jiang Chen at that time and believed that Celestial Trade could completely eradicate the Kurofune, he did not hesitate to hand over the list in exchange for a promise from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
If he chose to side with the UA on this matter, with the support of the Capitol, the Mitsui family could make a potential comeback. Whats more, he himself was very disgusted with what the current authorities were doing now. He was a staunch supporter of the UA-Nippon alliance. He was also an extremely right-leaning supporter. Otherwise, he would not invest in Tanakas project to help the development of the T-virus.</br>
</br>
Early the next morning, Mitsui Hiroto called the CIB.</br>
</br>
Last night, I saw Sumitomo Kenichi get into Jiang Chens car</br>
</br>
Yesterday? Fu*k! Why did you just call me now! The man on the other end of the phone was very angry, as he interrupted Mitsui Hiroto. You let Sumitomo Kenichi be with that man all night!</br>
</br>
The person on the phone was in charge of the CIB operations in Nippon and his name is Frank. Under normal circumstances, the CIB kept Sumitomo Kenichi under surveillance, but last night was an exception. Where Jiang Chen appeared, Ghost Agents would definitely be on standby nearby. Therefore, it would have been no different than a suicide mission to request someone to go to the New Otani Hotel, so he asked Mitsui Hiroto.</br>
</br>
As the owner of the Mitsui Group, it was not an issue for Mitsui Hiroto to attend the state banquet, and he could even sit at the same table as Jiang Chen and Sumitomo Kenichi. Whats more, Mitsui Hiroto was also involved in the smuggling of servers.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroto was a little embarrassed when Frank called him out.</br>
</br>
Last night, he did want to call the CIB to inform them of the intelligence. However, he suddenly received a call from the company on his way home, so he had to change his itinerary at the last minute to deal with the matter. Unfortunately, he ended up forgetting the matter and only remembered this morning.</br>
</br>
</br>
He didnt stay for too long, I followed them for some distance, and finally Sumitomo Kenichi got out of the vehicle midway, Mitsui Hiroto coughed to hide his awkwardness, Maybe he didnt reveal the secrets of those servers. As the heir of the Sumitomo Foundation, there is no need for him to risk it for something that has nothing to do with him.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Mitsui Hiroto continued.</br>
</br>
And as I just said, he didnt ask Jiang Chen to take him home last night. If he stupidly chose to inform, he would definitely not get out of the car and take a taxi home without a bodyguard. They probably just chatted about business matters. At the banquet, Sumitomo san stated that he planned to import medical drones.</br>
</br>
As Mitsui Hiroto attempted to excuse his mistake, Frank was about to explode. His hand holding the phone couldnt stop shaking, and he almost smashed the phone against the wall.</br>
</br>
You followed Jiang Chen?</br>
</br>
When did you become 007?</br>
</br>
I need you to analyze the situation?</br>
</br>
There was no need to guess at all. Jiang Chen already confirmed Mitsui Hirotos link with the servers. He wouldnt even be surprised if this phone call was being tapped. Regardless of how far the little mouse hired by Sumitomo Kenichi had gotten, once the Ghost Agents were on the case, they would definitely follow the lead from Mitsui Hiroto.</br>
</br>
The only reason why he was not captured by Ghost Agents on the spot was for this very reason.</br>
</br>
What a dumba*s teammate!</br>
</br>
Frank scolded the old man countless times. He finally took a deep breath, calmed his mind and tone, and continued.</br>
</br>
Its hard to say whether Sumitomo Kenichi has leaked the information. We cant take this risk. To continue waiting would only force us to be in a more awkward position. We must ship the servers out of the country as soon as possible. I already have a plan, but we need your cooperation Come to Ginza immediately, and we will meet in the same place.</br>
</br>
I will leave now. Mitsui Hiroto nodded.</br>
</br>
Frank didnt hesitate after he hung up the phone. He immediately looked at the assistant beside him and said coldly.</br>
</br>
Hiroto Mitsui has been tracked by Ghost Agents, sent someone to take him out. He is a bit sensitive, so remember to do it cleanly.</br>
</br>
Yes! The assistant nodded and immediately walked out of the office.</br>
</br>
After Mitsui Hiroto hung up, he left his office immediately and called his butler.</br>
</br>
Get the car immediately, I need to go out.</br>
</br>
The bulter quickly prepared the car.</br>
</br>
Without the time to eat breakfast, Mitsui Hiroto rushed to the garage in the basement. Before the bodyguard opened the door for him, he opened the door himself and sat in.</br>
</br>
At this moment, all of Mitsui Hirotos thoughts were on the servers. He didnt even notice that just as his car left his mansion, a black car followed him.</br>
</br>
Gill maintained a safe distance behind Mitsui Hiroto. She freed up her right hand holding the steering wheel and pressed lightly on her collar.</br>
</br>
Target has left the residence, Group B and Group C follow up.</br>
</br>
Roger that.</br>
</br>
Two clear replies came into her ear.</br>
</br>
The cars that were waiting on the next two streets also started their engines slowly and trailed Gills vehicle.</br>
</br>
Perhaps to prevent being tracked by Celestial Trade, Mitsui Hiroto drove a fuel-powered car without a magnetic levitation function. Gill and the others did not activate the magnetic levitation device on their cars as they mixed with the sparse traffic on the street.</br>
</br>
Gills eyes were locked on Mitsui Hiroto. She gestured to her teammate next to her to release the drone. The drone jetted along the bottom of the magnetic levitation lane to prevent losing Mitsui Hiroto.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, something unexpected happened</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1338"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1338: Speed of Life and Death</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroto rolled up his sleeves and glanced at the diamond-encrusted gold watch on his wrist, and his sparse eyebrows gradually twisted together.</br>
</br>
From the moment he left the mansion, he had a feeling of anxiety that lingered in his mind.</br>
</br>
How long before we arrive?</br>
</br>
It depends on the traffic. At most half an hour The driver really wanted to scorn,If you are in such a rush, why dont you let me drive the magnetic levitation model Toyota. However, he could only curse in his mind.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a black car next to them suddenly sped up and overtook them.</br>
</br>
Do you know how to drive! The driver cursed under his breath as he was about to turn the steering wheel to overtake again.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, two black cars sped up simultaneously and sandwiched him in the middle as they blocked both lanes on the side.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroshi knew something was wrong.</br>
</br>
The bodyguard next to him already realized something was wrong. He put his hand into his jacket and held onto the Glock while the other hand patted the drivers shoulder, he said in a calm and collected voice, The two cars next to us are</br>
</br>
Before he could finish, the windows of the two cars shattered at the same time. Without the slightest warning, two muzzles sneaked out from the shadows and aimed at Mitsui Hirotos car.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hirotos pupils shrank in an instant, but he and his bodyguard did not have time to react before orange flames burst out from the muzzles</br>
</br>
Dadadadada!</br>
</br>
In just two seconds, a brand-new Toyota was turned into a sieve. The windows shattered into glass shards and there were dense bullet holes on the doors, hood, and trunk. Blood covered every corner of the car, whether it was the driver, the bodyguard, or the owner of the Mitsui Consortium, they were all covered in blood.</br>
</br>
The Toyota that lost its driver was like a wild horse without its reins. It slammed into a street light next to the highway. Not all the bullets hit the car, and many stray bullets flew into the crowd on the street, wounding innocent pedestrians.</br>
</br>
MURDER!</br>
</br>
AHHHHH!</br>
</br>
Help! My legs</br>
</br>
People screamed in all different languages and fled in different directions. No one thought that this kind of incident would happen. No one thought that this kind of incident would happen in Yoto and on the eve of the Olympics</br>
</br>
The unexpected event completely stunned Gill as she continued to follow the car. Then she slammed the gas without hesitation as she sped up to a hundred kilometers an hour and chased after the three fleeing vehicles.</br>
</br>
Lu Wei, mark them!</br>
</br>
Im already on it. The ghost agent next to her clicked on the tablet in her hand, selected the three vehicles with three different colored boxes, and then transmitted the information to the Skyeye X1 observation satellite. The moment she completed her actions, the three cars ran a red light at an intersection and headed for three different directions.</br>
</br>
</br>
Attention, Group B, Group C, the target vehicles have been marked, capture the targets! You have permission to fire!</br>
</br>
Gill pressed the button around her collar and ordered. At the same time, she slammed the gas even harder and chased the black car straight ahead.</br>
</br>
Sirens echoed on the streets, but because the location was busy downtown, it was not easy to set up roadblocks to stop the murderers. These assassins also obviously had accomplices helping them, as they created traffic incidents to slow down the Yoto Police.</br>
</br>
Gill pressed down the gas to the limit, and in the downtown area, she started street racing with the obviously modified black car.</br>
</br>
The black car noticed the chaser behind it. When the car that previously blocked Mitsui Hirotos vehicle realized that it could not get rid of its tail, it suddenly drove to the middle of the road. At the same time, a gunman smashed through the car window with the gun stock, leaned out his body, and smoothly took out the automatic rifle on the door.</br>
</br>
The pupils above the mask revealed a deep desire for blood!</br>
</br>
Dadadadada!</br>
</br>
Flames spurted from the muzzle as the gunman fired at the hood and tires of Gills car.</br>
</br>
The bullets directly deformed the hood and left thumb-sized cracks on the front window. These bullets were obviously a special kind, but fortunately, they still failed to penetrate the nano-ceramic bulletproof layer designed by Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
Whatever!</br>
</br>
Gill bit her tongue and immediately turned her steering wheel. She drove onto the lane next to the black vehicle to get into the gunmans blind spot. Just as the gunman was about to change sides, she shouted at her teammate next to her.</br>
</br>
Lu Wei, make it stop!</br>
</br>
Roger that!</br>
</br>
With a sneer, the short-haired girl next to her pressed the button on the tablet.</br>
</br>
DAMM*T! Its the Ghost Agents! The target entered the shooters blind zone, and Chuan Yuanxing immediately retracted the rifle into the window, smashed the window on the other side, and leaned his body out again, Keep it steady! Let me get the tires.</br>
</br>
Im already trying my hardest to stabilize the steering wheel</br>
</br>
The person driving cussed under his breath while his hands tightly grasped the steering wheel and his eyes fixated on the road ahead. However, a drone suddenly appeared in front of him and slammed into the window of the car with its chassis. Whats that</br>
</br>
Before he could let out a scream, the dazzling white light and harsh sonic boom robbed him of his sight and hearing. He felt like a heavy hammer just smashed his head.</br>
</br>
In a panic, he subconsciously turned the steering wheel, and the assassin that leaned out of the car window was thrown out and collided directly with an oncoming van. He couldnt be more dead. The out-of-control car slammed into the guardrail next to the highway and the whole car spun in the air before it landed upside down and slid forward.</br>
</br>
The car was completely deformed, and the wheels stopped turning. The surrounding crowd screamed and fled. The employees hiding in the shop hid under the counter and called the police with trembling fingers.</br>
</br>
The door of the drivers seat opened, and the man in a blue jacket struggled to get out of the crashed car. As he looked up with his bloodstained face, he drew the pistol in his pocket and attempted to aim at the Ghost Agents vehicle. However, before he could even raise the gun, he passed out due to excessive blood loss and fell unconscious.</br>
</br>
Gill slammed on the brake and stopped twenty meters near the crashed vehicle. Gill was the first one to rush out as she aimed directly at the vehicle with her foldable assault rifle. She then gestured to her teammate and approached the overturned car from both sides.</br>
</br>
There was a piercing alarm bell from afar; these assassins had nowhere to escape.</br>
</br>
Use EMP first.</br>
</br>
She gestured Lu Wei to stop, took out a grenade from her belt, and was just about to pull the fuse.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, flames burst into the sky.</br>
</br>
With a loud boom, the explosion of molten flame engulfed the car completely. Gill and Lu Wei searched for shelter as they leaned against the car parked on the side of the road, and escaped the raging explosion.</br>
</br>
Gill stood up, bit her lower lip, and stared straight at the destroyed car. Then she slowly lowered her rifle.</br>
</br>
The flame was still burning, and the ground and surrounding shops all turned black because of the high heat</br>
</br>
There was no possible way for those assassins to survive with the power of the explosion.</br>
</br>
After a while, Gill finally squeezed out a word from between her lips.</br>
</br>
Fu*k</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1339: Nippon“s Compromise</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Nippons Prime Minister finally agreed to Jiang Chens request.</br>
</br>
Thirty military bases were transferred to Celestial Trade with a symbolic rent of one Xin New dollar. At the same time, Nippon agreed to pay two billion in military expenses for a total of 30,000 Celestial Trade mercenaries each year. On the contrary, Mr. Prime Minster finally received the vote he dreamed about every night.</br>
</br>
A happy ending.</br>
</br>
Everyone got what they wanted.</br>
</br>
Although when he nodded, Mr. Prime Minsters expression was quite reluctant, as if he had eaten a fly.</br>
</br>
On the Colombian battlefield, the NATO Coalition Force were already in direct combat with Xins younger brothers, which made the situation almost identical to the war in 1950. Todays Earth Defense Alliance was just like the original Warsaw Pact, and NATO was still the NATO, but the balance between the two sides quietly tilted.</br>
</br>
If one day the UA and Xin started a war, the UA operated a total of 88 military bases in his country, and the headquarters was located in the capital Yoto, and the Seventh Fleet would inevitably depart from Nippon. If this lunatic decided to throw an EMP to Yoto, and then use the sun as the scapegoat again</br>
</br>
It was hard to say what would happen to the UA, but Yoto would indeed cease to exist.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Mr. Prime Ministers compromise was also a helpless move.</br>
</br>
Even if the decision was not impacted by the Earth Defense Alliance, he must remove his country from the two big gangsters before the relationship between the UA and Xin deteriorated further.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left the Prime Ministers residence with pleasing results.</br>
</br>
Negotiations went smoother than expected. Originally, he was prepared to put pressure on Nippons Prime Minister through external forces, but it was not necessary for the time being. Next, he just needed to ask Zhang Yaping to make a visit and implement the terms they had discussed</br>
</br>
The next issue of discussion would be removing the UA troops stationed in Nippon.</br>
</br>
However, just as Jiang Chen walked out of the Prime Ministers residence, he suddenly received a call from Ayesha on his watch.</br>
</br>
As soon as the call was connected, he heard Ayeshas hasty tone.</br>
</br>
Hiroto Mitsui was assassinated!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a second to process the information. Then he subconsciously looked around, and after confirming that there was no one nearby, he walked quickly towards his car and lowered his voice, Hiroto Mitsui? Dead? Who did it?</br>
</br>
Ayesha simply recounted to Jiang Chen what happened just ten minutes ago. She started with Ghost Agents monitoring of Mitsui Hiroto and tracking him to the meeting with the CIB. However, no one thought that murder in broad daylight would happen.</br>
</br>
Gill, who led the team on the mission, confirmed the identity of the assassin and confirmed that it was the CIB.</br>
</br>
In fact, there was no need to prove that at this time, only the CIB possessed the motive for the murder.</br>
</br>
</br>
No survivor? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Im very sorry, Ayesha lowered her head apologetically, and said in a quiet voice, They set up a bomb in the car. When it was confirmed that there was no hope of escape, their unseen accomplice detonated the bomb remotely.</br>
</br>
This is not your fault, dont blame yourself too much. When he heard Ayeshas disappointment in her voice, he comforted her, By the way, no one was hurt, right? I mean our people.</br>
</br>
No.</br>
</br>
Thats good. Arrange a meeting with Gill for mewait, forget it, Jiang Chen gestured to the driver while in the car. After he debated for a moment, he continued, Ask her to see me at the embassy tomorrow. I will go to the embassy to meet Zhang Yaping at about ten oclock. After meeting Zhang Yaping, I will personally ask her what happened.</br>
</br>
Okay. Ayesha nodded.</br>
</br>
Also, let me think Jiang Chen touched his chin and said after a moment, We will send more people to protect Sumitomo Kenichi. His identity can still be used. If there is nothing else, thats it. Your first task is to find the whereabouts of those servers. Im now very worried that it has been shipped out of Nippon by the CIB through special means, although this is unlikely</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen considered a possibility.</br>
</br>
What if the CIB put the server in the UA military base in Nippon</br>
</br>
Where is the UA Seventh Fleet now? Jiang Chen asked abruptly.</br>
</br>
Ayesha thought for a moment and quickly gave a response.</br>
</br>
The fleet arrived at the military base in Yokosuka two days ago, and now it is probably resupplying at the port.</br>
</br>
Yokosuka?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the holographic map of the watch, then zoomed the map out to Nippon. He finally stopped at the Yokosuka Prefecture.</br>
</br>
Is it next to Yoto?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed his chin as he said thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
In fact, as long as they could identify the location of these servers, once these servers were shipped, Celestial Trade would have full control of the outcome. No one could escape the eyes of Skyeye X1. It was not difficult for Aurora-20s to sink a cargo ship.</br>
</br>
If an ordinary cargo was destroyed, as long as Celestial Trade did not claim responsibility, the UA would also not blame the attack on Celestial Trade. Unless they admitted to the content transported on the ship. But it was obviously impossible because they were servers holding T-virus information.</br>
</br>
Based on this thought process, the UA must certainly have recognized the situation.</br>
</br>
He was most worried about these servers being already shipped to the Yokosuka military base because the UA may deploy the Seventh Fleet to escort those servers that may restore T-virus data.</br>
</br>
Should he gamble?</br>
</br>
If he really found these servers in the UA military base in Nippon</br>
</br>
There was a dubious smile on Jiang Chens face</br>
</br>
There was no way for the UA to escape this bucket of dirty water.</br>
</br>
The headline of the day was already reserved for Mr. Mitsui Hiroto.</br>
</br>
Three people in a car were killed, and three cars fled frantically after the assassination. They staged a Fast and Furious scene in downtown Yoto with Ghost Agents who assisted the Yoto Police. The assassins eventually suicided and the event shocked the entire country.</br>
</br>
Almost everyone was speculating whether this incident was a targeted vendetta or a terrorist attack.</br>
</br>
This happened just a week before the Olympic flame that symbolized unity and peace was ignited, which undoubtedly cast a shadow over the Olympics.</br>
</br>
In front of the media, Mitsui Hirotos wife was in a state of trauma. His eldest son roared angrily in front of the media and he swore that he would use all the power of the Mitsui Consortium to trace the identity of the murderer and the person behind the assassination</br>
</br>
The only suspicious point now was the call that Mitsui Hiroto made before he left home. Public opinion generally agreed that the call may become the key to solving the case.</br>
</br>
But would it be so simple?</br>
</br>
The Yoto Police held a press conference to explain the case in detail, and at the same time urged the mass to remain calm</br>
</br>
Yoto Police will investigate this bloody incident that took place on the streets of Ginza, find the suspects responsible, and provide an explanation The Police Superintendent was sweating profusely as he answered the countless questions directly at him while he smiled bitterly in his mind.</br>
</br>
The case could have been solved long ago; and of course, he knew who was behind the assassination.</br>
</br>
But could he solve this case?</br>
</br>
The Ghost Agents were on one side while the CIB was on the other. As a small superintendent, there was no way for him to get into their mess.</br>
</br>
He could only sweep this under the rug!</br>
</br>
If he was a little careless, as the superintendent, he may have to step down to take the blame.</br>

</div></br>
In the lobby of the hotel, Kwais right hand gripped her left arm tightly, and her eyes were filled with grievances and unwillingness as she stared at the elevator door.</br>
</br>
Just now, she was scolded by her boss on the phone.</br>
</br>
The cause was that she reported to her boss that Jiang Chens inappropriate behavior caused her to be uncomfortable and proposed that a male police officer take over her job.</br>
</br>
However, she did not expect that such a reasonable request was not only ruthlessly rejected, but she was also scolded for it.</br>
</br>
How could Jiang Chen do that kind of thing! It must be your attitude! Besides, he is the president of Celestial Trade and Future Group, the worlds richest man, and a distinguished guest of Nippon! Why are you dissatisfied and unpleased? I dont know how many people envy your job! If it werent for the Cabinet Minister, how could you take on this job?</br>
</br>
I order you to immediately correct your attitude and return to your post. This is not only my order but also the order of the Foreign Secretary! You can weigh it yourself.</br>
</br>
Kwai couldnt believe what she just heard, she stared dumbfoundedly at the phone that already disconnected.</br>
</br>
How could that meticulous old police officer say such nonsense?</br>
</br>
Also, when was the cabinet able to intervene in the justice system so blatantly?</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the boss didnt reprimand her for a long time and quickly hung up the phone. There seemed to be a big case in Ginza. The entire police department was working on this case.</br>
</br>
She put down her phone as if she had just lost her soul and she drove to the hotel.</br>
</br>
She didnt know what kind of emotion she had when she got into the elevator. She passed through the watchful eyes of the bodyguards, headed to the door of that room, and pressed the doorbell.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, it was Qian Xia who opened the door and not that demon.</br>
</br>
Officer Kwai? Qian Xia smiled as if she was expecting her, You are here to see the master? He left early in the morning.</br>
</br>
The word master made Kwai feel quite awkward, but she didnt say anything more about it and simply asked with a standoffish vibe.</br>
</br>
When will he be back?</br>
</br>
I dont know, he didnt tell me the specifics, Qian Xia shook her head, still with the same smile, Anyway, please come in.</br>
</br>
Kwai took off her shoes, put on the slippers Qian Xia had prepared for her, and went to sit on the sofa in the living room</br>
</br>
Qian Xia went into the kitchen, and soon brought her a cup of black tea.</br>
</br>
After Kwai expressed her gratitude, she stood up to take the cup from her and then sat back down. With both her hands on the teacup, she took a small sip.</br>
</br>
The scent of tea calmed her mind and made Officer Kwais depressed mood slightly better.</br>
</br>
She hadnt drank much water since she got up, and she was indeed thirsty now.</br>
</br>
</br>
The self-proclaimed maid  Qian Xia, was indeed an expert in tea craft. Even if she didnt understand the tea culture, she still tasted the difference in this cup of black tea from the fragrance that diffused at the tip of her tongue.</br>
</br>
What are you thinking about?</br>
</br>
When Kwai heard the voice across from her, she looked up at the smiling Qian Xia. Then she immediately lowered her head with thoughts in her mind.</br>
</br>
Why is Miss Qian Xia working for him? You should know that he is With the hot teacup in her hands, Kwait wanted to use the words devil and pervert to describe the demon. However, she couldnt decide which one was more appropriate.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, it was only because of work. As for what happened later, Qian Xias cheeks showed a tinge of red, and her index finger rested on her lips as she spoke embarrassedly, Probably because I felt very happy?</br>
</br>
Happy? Kwai was stunned. Her eyebrows twitched slightly and she said somewhat awkward, Eh? Do you call that happiness?</br>
</br>
Of course, Qian Xia nodded and smiled frankly. Why isnt Miss Kwai franker?</br>
</br>
Franker? Kwai frowned slightly, I dont understand what you mean.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia smiled and tapped her index finger on her lower lip.</br>
</br>
Well, maybe the master is fascinated by you at this point. Even I start to admire you a little.</br>
</br>
Kwai looked at Qian Xia in a daze. She inexplicable felt a strangeness from her sweet smile and it made her uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
She didnt know why.</br>
</br>
Just instinctively, she felt a trace of fear</br>
</br>
Sorry, I I have to go now. She put the cup on the table and as she was about to stand up and bow to say goodbye, her head suddenly felt dizzy, her legs turned soft, and she sat back down again.</br>
</br>
Ah, are you leaving this early? Qian Xia smiled and stood up slowly.</br>
</br>
Kwai looked at Qian Xia who was walking towards her and a trace of panic crossed her cloudy eyes. She struggled to sit up, but the sofa behind her seemed to be magical as it firmly imprisoned her weak body into the softness.</br>
</br>
What did you put in the cup?</br>
</br>
Kwai exhausted the last bit of strength and squeezed these words from her throat.</br>
</br>
Something that can make you franker. Without changing the way she smiled, Qiao Xia bowed slightly, Im very sorry, please forgive the master for his waywardness.</br>
</br>
Dont dont come to me.</br>
</br>
Miss Kwai, I apologize.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1341: Toss and Turn</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Before Jiang Chen left the bedroom, he turned on the TV on the wall and set the sequence of the movies. After he completed these steps, he turned around and smiled wickedly at Officer Kwai, then clapped his hands to signal his victory and left the room.</br>
</br>
Kwai, who laid in the darkness, watched the door close with confusion in her eyes, at the same time, she was secretly relieved.</br>
</br>
Soon, a line of red English text and a small white print that could not be read clearly appeared.</br>
</br>
FBA Warning?</br>
</br>
What is it?</br>
</br>
But as soon as she heard the sound from the TV, her face instantly turned red.</br>
</br>
The indescribable picture, mixed with moaning, played right in front of her eyes. As the only source of light, unless she closed her eyes, it was difficult to not look. But even if she closed her eyes, it was impossible to block the noises shocking her eardrums.</br>
</br>
By the way, in order to prevent her from falling asleep, Jiang Chen deliberately turned the volume to the maximum before he left.</br>
</br>
In this beautiful agony, the sweaty Miss Kwai tossed and turned until the latter half of the night before she finally fell asleep in fatigue</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen went to Kwais room to take a look.</br>
</br>
Based on the water stains on the bedsheet, he smirked.</br>
</br>
He was now more and more certain. Officer Kwai with a strong sense of justice was actually a masochist deep down, eager to be treated roughly and bullied by someone stronger than her.</br>
</br>
Of course, maybe she was not a masochist from the start, but he developed this fetish for her</br>
</br>
After he returned to the bedroom next door, Jiang Chen saw that Qian Xia was already up, so he ordered.</br>
</br>
Help her change the sheets later and feed her something. Other than untying her, meet all of her demands. If one person is not enough, you can get the hotel to send a maid to help you, Ill let the hotel manager know. Also, I wont be back until very late so you dont have to wait for me.</br>
</br>
Yes, master.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia kneeled on the bedding, naked, and replied submissively.</br>
</br>
Minato Ward, Yoto</br>
</br>
The Xin Embassy in Nippon.</br>
</br>
In the office of the Xin Embassy, Jiang Chen met Zhang Yaping who arrived in Nippon two days earlier than him.</br>
</br>
They have agreed. This is the drafted agreement, you can take a look. Jiang Chen handed over the documents to President Zhang. He sat on the sofa across from him, raised his leg, and crossed his fingers on his knees, Tomorrow, you just have to be there, and he will sign it.</br>
</br>
2 billion Xin New dollars, a symbolic lease of 1 Xin New dollar They actually accepted this, its amazing, Zhang Yaping couldnt help but exclaim as he turned the agreement, Okay if you dont have supplementary terms, I will discuss those with them based on this.</br>
</br>
They have to accept it because we have the vote they need most, and they are eager to take themselves out of NATO before the international situation deteriorates further, Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
</br>
Im going to the Westin Hotel in a bit to see our athletes. Are you going to stay here or take a tour with me?</br>
</br>
I still have a few more things to do, so I wont join you, Jiang Chen smiled, Say hello to the athletes for me.</br>
</br>
Then its almost time, Ill ask the assistant to make a cup of coffee for you, Im going to leave.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, dont worry about me.</br>
</br>
After Zhang Yaping said goodbye, he left.</br>
</br>
It didnt take long before a lady in a suit came in with a cup of coffee, she greeted Jiang Chen before she left the office and gently closed the door.</br>
</br>
He took a book out of the shelf and flipped through it on the sofa. When the clock reached ten, a girl with a ponytail knocked on the door, and after she received Jiang Chens consent, she came in.</br>
</br>
Are you Gill? Jiang Chen closed the book and smiled at the careful girl, and gestured her to sit down across from him, Im not used to others talking to me while standing, please take a seat.</br>
</br>
Thank you. Gill nodded with gratitude and sat down, feeling restrained.</br>
</br>
As the top of the second group of students, she was the Director of the Intelligence Office in Nippon promoted by Ayesha. In other words, she was the head of the Ghost Agents in this region. Because she always served on missions overseas, she saw the fabled character on pictures more than in-person. Even if she did see him, it was from a far distance.</br>
</br>
So tell me, I want to hear what happened yesterday. As Gill sat down, Jiang Chen asked straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
Gill nodded and explained.</br>
</br>
After receiving your order, we immediately started monitoring Mitsui Hiroto. Yesterday morning, we monitored his phone call with the CIB and learned that the CIB asked him to meet at the usual place to discuss the servers. After we saw Mitsui Hiroto come out, I immediately followed, but I didnt expect that the CIB to be so outrageous that they would send assassins to intercept Mitsui Hiroto in the downtown area.</br>
</br>
After Gill retold the story, Jiang Chen nodded and tapped lightly on the armrest of the sofa.</br>
</br>
I see. I remember that your equipment can locate the signal source in binary coordinates, so have you found the people who called Mitsui Hiroto?</br>
</br>
They moved when we arrived, Gill shook her head regretfully.</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Jiang Chen leaned back on the sofa and continued to speak after a moment of thought.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroto Forget it. Although it is a pity that we lost this lead, the key for us now is to find those servers, at least pinpoint their locations before they leave.</br>
</br>
Now Jiang Chen was already certain why the UA wanted those servers.</br>
</br>
Even if they did not do anything, the knowledge of a powerful contagious and destructive virus was a strategic deterrent in itself. Although Future Biology had developed vaccines for the T and TT viruses, they were only effective against these two viruses.</br>
</br>
With genetic engineering and other methods to modify the sequence of the T-virus, it was not difficult to develop an improved T-virus that can be immune to the current vaccine with the current biotechnology.</br>
</br>
The pressure of Celestial Trades EMP weapons made the UA search for something to supplement its already weak nuclear deterrent. Although using the virus as a deterrent was dirty, it was not the time to care about that.</br>
</br>
It seemed necessary to head to the military base in Yokosuka</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed his chin in thought.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
MatchingMatching complete.</br>
</br>
The photos flashed through Jiang Chens tactical eyepiece one by one, and finally froze on an unsmiling face.</br>
</br>
[Frank, the highest-ranking CIB official in Nippon, commanding over 400 field agents.]</br>
</br>
In the Ghost Agents database, there was only a brief sentence about him. Even Gill did not obtain more information about the area head in Nippon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then performed facial recognition on several other CIB agents. Three of them did not show up in the database due to minimal activities. After Jiang Chen established profiles for them, he focused all his attention on Frank, as well as the two navy officers approaching them.</br>
</br>
[Thomas, Lieutenant Admiral, Commander of the UA Seventh Fleet, Resume: Graduated from the University of California with a bachelors degree in civil engineering, and later received a masters degree in national security studies from the National War College]</br>
</br>
[Howard, Major Admiral, Chief of Yokosuka Military Base, Resume: ]</br>
</br>
A lieutenant general, a major general, plus a senior CIB offical.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows slightly.</br>
</br>
Things seemed to be getting more interesting.</br>
</br>
The tiny probe protruded from the bottom of the Hummingbird drone, aimed at the window of the car, and projected invisible infrared light. Jiang Chen pressed his headset and soon he listened in on the three peoples conversation.</br>
</br>
If youre worried, we can send a ship to transport these servers to Guam, and then ship it back to Los Angeles by air.</br>
</br>
We cannot ship by air! You must use a submarine! We must! Frank said immediately, Only a submarine can ensure that these servers can be safely delivered to the Los Angeles Research Center! In addition, the Seventh Fleet must cruise to Guam and create the illusion that these severs were sent to Guam!</br>
</br>
I dont understand, Major Admiral Howard frowned. No matter how arrogant Celestial Trade is, do they dare to directly attack our plane?</br>
</br>
Humph, Frank sneered, and the eyes above the hooked nose pierced sharpness, You dont know them. They never played by the rules. They may not dare to shoot our plane down blatantly, but they can make us never find where it went.</br>
</br>
Are these servers so important? Lieutenant Admiral Thomas asked seriously. It is not a trivial matter to mobilize the Seventh Fleet. It requires documents from the Department of Defense. Although Secretary Carter asked me to follow your orders, the mobilization of the fleet has exceeded your authority</br>
</br>
Im here for this very reason. As Frank spoke, he took the briefcase from the agent next to him and handed the document he took from the briefcase to Lieutenant Admiral Thomas. This is the authorization document signed by the Department of Defense, Capitol, and Congress. I hope you take this matter seriously.</br>
</br>
Under the streetlight, Lieutenant Admiral Thomas looked through the document with a serious expression. After about five minutes, he passed it to the officer next to him and showed a stern look.</br>
</br>
</br>
Tomorrow morning, Ill verify with the Department of Defense. If it is true, Ill follow everything as you order.</br>
</br>
The three said something more and then walked to the barracks.</br>
</br>
They were certainly quite dedicated to distracting Celestial Trade by using the entire Seventh Fleet as a cover for those servers. The question now was where those servers were. If he couldnt locate the servers, it would be like searching for a needle in a haystack, and he would have to monitor every single nuclear submarine that may set off at any moment.</br>
</br>
He had to admit that Franks analysis was spot on. Jiang Chen possessed the means to hack both planes and ships, but he could not do much to nuclear submarines. Even with Celestial Trades technology, to locate a completely silent submarine would be no easier than finding a needle in the Pacific.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hesitated as he looked at the patrolling Marines.</br>
</br>
He was by the port warehouse, about a kilometer away from those people, and he did not want to sneak into an enclosed building. Because they set up countermeasures for optical invisibility, in addition to infrared rays, there must be other countermeasures he was not aware of in these sensitive areas.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, Gill would have penetrated in long ago.</br>
</br>
As for those drones</br>
</br>
As long as they were not blind, the drone would be easily spotted if it descended by even a few meters.</br>
</br>
What to do?</br>
</br>
He suddenly had an idea and pressed his helmet.</br>
</br>
Lilith, can you hack into these peoples electronic devices?</br>
</br>
Turn on the drones data transmission laser and aim it at the electronic device that you intend to hack into. Lilith yawned on the living room sofa and said with a tone that lacked interest, The boss fight is about to start, quick.</br>
</br>
Liliths words almost made Jiang Chen choke on his saliva.</br>
</br>
Fu*k!</br>
</br>
Is your boss fight more important or is my ask more important? Are you not afraid I would ask Ayesha to cut the internet?</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen was busy finding suitable electronic devices for Lilith, he suddenly discovered a very serious problem.</br>
</br>
None of those people wore any wearables. He didnt know whether or not these people brought phones, but no one had their phones out at this moment.</br>
</br>
Fu*k!? Can someone make a call so I can hack you?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was desperately looking for solutions as those people were about to enter the building. He randomly pointed the laser at the sunglasses of the agent behind Frank. However, the word [transmitting] appeared on his screen.</br>
</br>
He guessed right and that the sunglasses were indeed an electronic device with a built-in storage device, built-in camera, and Bluetooth chip. The camera was probably used to take pictures. After all, a professional, such as an agent, shouldnt use their phones to take pictures while on intelligence missions. The agent probably would have never guessed that his own tool would become a loophole for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
But then again, only advanced artificial intelligence would be able to install a backdoor in a tiny memory space in such a short amount of time and bypass the private encrypted security layers.</br>
</br>
Even Chief Security Engineer Xie Lei couldnt do this.</br>
</br>
After all, it was no longer a field that humans could reach.</br>
</br>
Its done.</br>
</br>
Soon, Liliths voice entered his ear.</br>
</br>
The words, like heavens blessing, let Jiang Chen breathe a sigh of relief. He looked at the picture on the tablet, and a smile appeared.</br>
</br>
With the help of the Bluetooth chip, the data was transmitted back to the drone in real-time, and it transmitted directly to Jiang Chens tactical eyepiece. Although he couldnt hear anything, Jiang Chen had completely entered the perspective of Agent A who, at this moment, followed Frank.</br>
</br>
Although he didnt know where they were going, Jiang Chen believed that it must be related to those servers.</br>
</br>
The servers were the key for Celestial Trade to remove the UAs influence in the Western Pacific. As long as Nippon fell, the only thorn in front of the Earth Defense Alliance would be South Korea.</br>
</br>
And most critically, he could not allow the UA to get T-virus data!</br>
</br>
It was a ticking time bomb. Even if they didnt use it on others, they may kill themselves with it, and it would be a detrimental lose to the world.</br>
</br>
Regardless of the reason, Jiang Chen was determined to get those servers!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before we load the container, all servers will be placed in the confidential archives room. Not even a fly can get in, let alone Ghost Agents. You can rest assured. This is not the first time we have stored your package, Major Admiral Howard said.</br>
</br>
The opponent is Celestial Trade, we have to be more cautious, Frank said.</br>
</br>
Major Admiral Howard shrugged and continued to lead the way.</br>
</br>
They chatted along the way, but regardless of what they said, Jiang Chen couldnt hear it. The electronic sunglasses had a built-in camera, but obviously, there was no built-in microphone. The detective must have something like a headset on him, but it was neither turned on nor taken out.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen, from the perspective of Agent A, tried to read what they said by reading their lips, because this perspective was focused on the back of the three officials, he ultimately gave up on this idea. He maintained a distance of fifty meters between the drone and the signal source as he patiently waited for them to stop.</br>
</br>
Not long after, they stopped at the door numbered 014. Major Admiral Howard took out the key, said a few things to Frank, and personally opened the door.</br>
</br>
Just as the iron gate opened, Jiang Chens pupils shrank.</br>
</br>
His eyes looked over Major Admiral Howards shoulder and there was a row of servers in the middle of the room.</br>
</br>
Maybe an EMP could take care of it?</br>
</br>
Cant</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly rejected this idea.</br>
</br>
He was not on the Colombian battlefield. He was in the Yokosuka Military Base, the headquarters of the UA Army in Nippon, and the location of the Seventh Fleet.</br>
</br>
The global situation was already quite tense. Although the Capitol was afraid of the strength displayed by the Celestial Trade, it didnt necessarily mean that they would continue to tolerate their actions without a bottom line. If Celestial Trade really dropped an EMP here, World War III would start soon.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen had an idea as a devilish grin emerged.</br>
</br>
Just now, an evil idea suddenly came to his mind.</br>
</br>
Dont you want T-virus data?</br>
</br>
Then I will help you.</br>
</br>
Lilith.</br>
</br>
What do you want? Im busy, Lilith replied.</br>
</br>
Dont pretend, I know you can work while playing games.</br>
</br>
But then I wont be able to enjoy the fun of the game Halfway through the conversation, Lilith shuddered as she felt the murderous vibe that traveled from the network cable, and she quickly changed her tone, Is there anything I can help you with?</br>
</br>
I want to hack those servers, can you do anything about it? Jiang Chen said, without being bothered by the previous incident.</br>
</br>
You gave me a great question, even I cant hack through the air, Lilith let out a frustrated sigh, then she paused for a second before she continued, Listen, well, first of all, you have to make sure that these servers are connected to a power source. Secondly, you have to make sure that I can establish a physical connection with these servers, a data cable would work best.</br>
</br>
</br>
Does it have to be connected to a power source? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Not necessarily, Lilith said blankly. If you cannot guarantee the power supply, you can also choose to transmit through small pipes like lasers.</br>
</br>
How do lasers work?</br>
</br>
Because lasers can generate a microcurrent on the electronic device and directly write onto the hard disk, Lilith explained patiently.</br>
</br>
I see. Jiang Chen nodded as he understood the mechanics.</br>
</br>
What are you going to do? Lilith asked, Do you want to transmit viruses to it?</br>
</br>
Youll know tomorrow. Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Well its up to you.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recalled the drones and then threw both the tablet and the drones into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
Originally, Jiang Chen planned to wait for Frank to take him away when he came out of the military base, but now he could live for a few more days.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went back the same route, quietly left the military base, and returned to the parking lot at the entrance of Mikasa Park. Just as he was starting the vehicle, he turned on the holographic screen of his watch and called Sumitomo Kenichi.</br>
</br>
The suburbs of Yoto.</br>
</br>
In an ancient traditional building.</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi was in his pajamas as he sat on the wooden floor at the entrance of the backyard. He stared at the moonlight reflecting off the lake, but his thoughts already drifted elsewhere.</br>
</br>
A graceful beauty kneeled behind him. She held a pot of sake on the plate with both her hands, as well as a few of his favorite dishes.</br>
</br>
Kenichi Kun, please eat something, The woman in a kimono said softly.</br>
</br>
If it were any normal day, he would not mind hugging his favorite beauty, sitting in the moonlight, drinking a few shots, and enjoying the delicious dishes.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, both the beauty and the dishes were both tasteless and dull to him.</br>
</br>
The old fox of the Mitsui family was dead, and it was undoubtedly the CIB who started it.</br>
</br>
Secular wealth was futile in the wrestle of superpowers. From the start, the UA never treated the Nippon financial groups seriously. Mitsui Hiroto was killed without even a consideration; would the little foxes of the Mitsui family dare to seek revenge from the CIB?</br>
</br>
He was 100% certain that he was the next target. He didnt even dare to let his father or the people who loved him know, otherwise he was very likely to be abandoned by the family as a precaution before the CIB took action.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that his life and death now depended entirely on Jiang Chens attitude.</br>
</br>
If there was a Ghost Agent secretly protecting him, then he should be safe.</br>
</br>
But who knows?</br>
</br>
After all, Mitsui Hirito died under the eyes of Ghost Agents</br>
</br>
Dont bother me, I have no appetite.</br>
</br>
He replied in frustration as he rudely pushed aside the plate that the woman in the kimono handed to him.</br>
</br>
With a cry, the plates were knocked on the ground and smashed into pieces.</br>
</br>
The girl did not know how she offended the young master, she lowered her head in fear, and didnt dare to clean up the mess on the ground. She only apologized repeatedly, not knowing what she should do.</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi couldnt help but feel agitated.</br>
</br>
Just then, his butler came over with a phone.</br>
</br>
Master, your phone-</br>
</br>
Im not picking up. Sumitomo Kenichi impatiently waved his hand.</br>
</br>
But, its Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
Wait! Give me the phone! His eyes turned red in an instant, and Sumitomo Kenichi immediately darted up. Before the butler walked to him, he snatched the phone from the butlers hand.</br>
</br>
Get out, GET OUT!</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi blasted the kimono woman and the butler out and walked into the yard barefoot.</br>
</br>
After he took a few deep breaths, he tried to squeeze a smile that was not much better than crying, then pressed the pickup button with his trembling fingers.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as the call was connected, there was an impatient tone.</br>
</br>
Why did you take so long to pick up?</br>
</br>
Sorry, I</br>
</br>
Its okay, Jiang Chen was not interested in listening to his explanation. He turned his headset on as both of his hands held onto the steering wheel. Ill explain one thing to you, and youll do it right away.</br>
</br>
Yes! Sumitomo Kenichi was overjoyed, As long as you tell me, I will do it right away!</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichis attentive attitude made Jiang Chen a little surprised, but he soon understood why.</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hirotos death must have scared him.</br>
</br>
Without saying anything, Jiang Chen just smiled, and said casually, Are you familiar with civil rights organizations?</br>
</br>
Yes! Of course, Im familiar! Sumitomo Kenichi nodded quickly, The Sumitomo Foundation supports more than two hundred civil rights organizations</br>
</br>
I need you to help me create controversies. Jiang Chen interrupted and directly said.</br>
</br>
Slightly confused, Sumitomo Kenichi felt something was odd, but he couldnt explain where the feeling came from. He hesitated for a second, then swallowed a lump in his throat before he quietly sounded Jiang Chen out.</br>
</br>
Can I ask what kind of controversies?</br>
</br>
Controversies about the UA, Jiang Chen concisely responded.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1345"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1345: Surround The Base</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was quite sure about Sumitomo Foundations influence.</br>
</br>
When Celestial Trade chose them as a partner on the Global Power Grid, they were the ones that influenced non-governmental and civil rights organizations to protest and demonstrate at the entrance of the Prime Minister Residence. They were the ones that stated the threats of nuclear power plants, thus indirectly pushed the countrys connection into the global grid.</br>
</br>
He planned to use the same tactic.</br>
</br>
It was difficult to remove the UA military stationed in Nippon through the behind the scene effort of Celestial Trade alone; the situation required a catalyst. A catalyst that would ultimately end the security treaty, as well as turn the UA into a scapegoat. The catalyst had to be convincing, so that it would be difficult for them to prove their innocence, and could even cause suspicion among their allies.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt the T-virus data was that catalyst. It just so happened that Nippon was one of the victims of the T-virus. After the country learned that the UA military stationed in Nippons role of restoring the T-virus data, it was not difficult to imagine the reaction Nippon and even the world would have.</br>
</br>
The plan would be to use the public to pressure military bases and build momentum for the removal of UA troops stationed in Nippon. Then the Nippon government would take advantage of this momentum to raise objections to the security treaty. Finally, Celestial Trade would be the final straw. Even if the UA was determined to stay, it would be difficult to gain a firm footing on this Pacific Island.</br>
</br>
As for whether the UA would use other excuses to justify its actions, Jiang Chen didnt know, but regardless of their plans to defend themselves, he had plenty of ways to ensure they remained in the center of controversies</br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
Outside the Yokosuka Military Base, crowds blocked the main gate of the base. The soldiers on duty stared nervously at the crowd outside. They formed a line at the gate to prevent the emotional people from storming in.</br>
</br>
A soldier, wearing a helmet and holding a rifle, silently spoke to the comrade next to him.</br>
</br>
Sh*t, what the hell do they want to do?</br>
</br>
Who knows man?</br>
</br>
I bet it must have been some idiot who brought a woman he had a one night stand with back into the base.</br>
</br>
Who can read whats on the sign?</br>
</br>
It was not the first time that they have encountered an incident like this. To be precise, it happened several times a year. But this time it was obviously different because there were too many people at the gate. Not only did non-governmental and civil rights organizations in Yokosuka show up, but they also saw groups that came all the way from Yoto.</br>
</br>
Things clearly got out of control.</br>
</br>
As the soldiers at the gate chatted amongst themselves, Major Admiral Howard, Commander of the Yokosuka Military Base, had already made more than a dozen calls to the Nippon government. He demanded the police to maintain order, but he only received ambiguous responses.</br>
</br>
</br>
It did not take long for the police to arrive.</br>
</br>
But it was not only the police, but also microphones and cameras from major news agencies.</br>
</br>
Major Admiral Howard had a feeling something was wrong.</br>
</br>
It was no longer an ordinary protest. Not only was Nippon media on the scene, but even reporters from Reuters, AFP, Xinhua News Agency, and other international news agencies made an appearance.</br>
</br>
Good lord, three of the worlds four major news agencies were here.</br>
</br>
It seemed that todays incident could not be downplayed.</br>
</br>
Whats happening outside? Thomas, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, walked into the room and stared at Major Admiral Howard. The Department of Defense just called me and asked me to clear the trouble at the gate as soon as possible. I just want to ask whats going on out there.</br>
</br>
Its those servers, Major Admiral Howard rubbed his brows and dropped the phone on the table. You can see for yourself. Also, I received a call from the Department of Defense</br>
</br>
With a frown, Thomas picked up the phone.</br>
</br>
On the screen was the interface of Future 1.0, and it was the news section.</br>
</br>
[Shocking! The UA troops stationed in Nippon carried out such a horrific experiment at the Yokosuka Military Base]</br>
</br>
When he saw this headline, Thomass eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
What is this article?</br>
</br>
However, after he clicked on title and read down the line of English, his expression became more and more serious. Especially when he saw the picture attached to the news, the look on his face completely changed.</br>
</br>
The room in the picture was none other than the room they visited yesterday. And the person in the photo was no one else but, in the order of priority, Major Admiral Howard holding the key, himself standing at the back, and Frank next to him</br>
</br>
And the servers were in the middle of the room.</br>
</br>
Thomas took a deep breath, took out the satellite phone, and called Frank</br>
</br>
There is a mole in your people.</br>
</br>
I know, Frank said with a sullen expression.</br>
</br>
He also saw the news.</br>
</br>
Based on the angle of the photo, Frank knew who betrayed him immediately.</br>
</br>
And just now, he personally killed his long-time confidant, and then immediately changed his hiding place to a place that only he knew.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that those photos were taken with CIB electronic sunglasses.</br>
</br>
Although these photos were processed to some extent, with the specifications and resolutions modified, and even erased the passwords hidden in the photos to indicate the identity, the angle of the photo betrayed the identity of the photographer. Frank clearly remembered who stood in that position at the time and who pressed the shutter of the electronic sunglasses</br>
</br>
Frank just couldnt believe how deep the Ghost Agents had penetrated the CIB, it was like putting a dagger right against his throat.</br>
</br>
The media asked us to verify the authenticity of these photos. After all, Major Admiral Howard and I are in the photos. Its relatively difficult to deny. I want to ask your opinion on what we should do now.</br>
</br>
Hmph, let them verify it, Frank sneered, Blame it on me if they find anything.</br>
</br>
All the servers were replaced with new casings, and the numbers of internal parts were all modified to other numbers by special means. Even if they dismantled the servers to pieces, it was absolutely impossible to find any problems. Before the technology experts in Los Angeles recover the formatted data in the servers, there was absolutely nothing they could find.</br>
</br>
When Frank heard the news, he actually chuckled to himself.</br>
</br>
Because in his opinion, Celestial Trade was already out of solutions, and it was their attempt at a last-ditch effort with a lack of intelligence.</br>
</br>
The UA could easily prove that these servers had no problems and once they prove their innocence, would Nippon take Celestial Trades words seriously even if they found new evidence?</br>
</br>
You mean, open the military base to the media? Thomas frowned, But if</br>
</br>
Open with reservations! Frank did not make anything certain. Choose a few credible new agencies, allow them to send two reporters in, and assign an information technology expert to them. After that, you can send a few Hummers here to take them directly from the gate to the place in the photo.</br>
</br>
Remember, keep a close eye on these reporters, from when they enter the door to when they leave the door! Prevent them from playing any tricks on the servers!</br>
</br>
If Celestial Trade plans to use us as the scapegoat, they will definitely use this opportunity. And once their Ghost Agents fall into our trap, Jiang Chen will be the scapegoat!</br>
</br>
Frank squeezed these words through his teeth as anger gleamed in his eyes.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1346: Open The Base</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Outside the Yokosuka Military Base, police cars lined up in a row, and police officers in explosion-proof suits pulled up yellow police line on the road at the entrance of the base, armed with batons and explosion-proof shields. The sheriff of the city personally stood at the very front as he shouted to the emotional demonstrators, urged people to stay calm, and stopped the protesting crowd from marching forward.</br>
</br>
Citizens of Yokosuka, please remain calm! Dont believe the rumors on the Internet! Our Prime Minister has contacted the UA Ambassador and asked the UA to give a reasonable explanation on this matter! Please trust us, trust the Prime Minister! He will definitely give you a satisfactory answer</br>
</br>
Sheriff Fujiyama shouted into the speaker. As he watched the indignant crowd, he started to feel the heat of the situation.</br>
</br>
He had been in the police force for more than twenty years, and he had encountered crowds gathered around military bases many times, but rarely did the number of demonstrators exceed 500. After all, the military base in Yokosuka was close to Yoto, and only naval units were stationed here. Most of the disturbing aircrafts such as the Osprey were generally deployed in Yokota and Okinawa.</br>
</br>
And the scene in front of him was an endless crowd. Based on his own estimate, there were more than 10,000 protesters at the entrance. It was the first time in his two decades of working that he had encountered a situation like this.</br>
</br>
Sheriff Fujiyama almost lost his voice from shouting into the speaker, but the protesters obviously didnt buy it.</br>
</br>
Anyway, you only speak for the UA, right?</br>
</br>
Kneel down! Apologize!</br>
</br>
Get out of Yokosuka! Get out with your virus! The citizens of Yokosuka are not your white rats!</br>
</br>
As Sheriff Fujiyama looked anxiously at the people who began to push the police, the checkpoint at the gate of the military base finally raised its bar. A Hummer slowly drove out and stopped behind the human wall, he took the speaker from an officer and shouted to the crowd.</br>
</br>
Please be quiet!</br>
</br>
The ear-piercing sound shook the eardrums of the protesters in the very front, and for a moment it actually overpowered the slogans chanted by the protesting crowd. Many people stopped talking, put down their fists, stared at the man at the front, and waited for his next sentence.</br>
</br>
I am Thomas, Commander of the Seventh Fleet. You may recognize my face, or you may know nothing about me. But these are not important. What is important is that I stand here on behalf of the entire Yokosuka Military Base to respond sincerely to the citizens of Yokosuka. While he said everything in his not-so-fluent speech, Thomas glanced at the speech written in phonetics in his hand and continued.</br>
</br>
Some photos and irresponsible reports circulating on the Internet may have caused your misunderstanding. Here, Im issuing a statement on behalf of the UA that those are all unwarranted accusations. We will hold those who spread rumors accountable through legal means!</br>
</br>
</br>
There was a boo in the crowd.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the citizens were not satisfied with the arrogant response. They demanded an explanation, not another diplomatic message.</br>
</br>
Thomas coughed slightly, turned the speech to the next page, and continued.</br>
</br>
I declare once again that the UA Army stationed in Nippon absolutely did not receive Takeda Pharmaceuticals servers, nor did it assist the CIB in collecting information about T-virus.</br>
</br>
In order to prove our innocence, we are willing to open our military base to the media, and the process of investigation and evidence collection will be broadcasted live in real-time. Whether you believe us or not, you should always trust your eyes</br>
</br>
The boos outside the military base gradually died down.</br>
</br>
Weird expressions appeared on everyones faces, wondering if they had heard it wrong.</br>
</br>
Open their military base?</br>
</br>
Real-time live broadcast investigation and evidence collection process?</br>
</br>
Is this still the Yankees way of doing things?</br>
</br>
This is too abnormal</br>
</br>
Many people hesitantly put down their raised fists and slowly lowered the sign in their hands. Thomass speech had made them question themselves. If they had really hidden the servers with T-virus data, would they dare to open the military base?</br>
</br>
Who can guarantee that the servers we see are the same as the ones that appeared in the photo? At this moment, a loud voice appeared in the crowd, Who can guarantee that you did not switch the servers?</br>
</br>
We can guarantee that not a single server you see in that room has been replaced, and even the orientation of the servers has not changed. Thomas immediately responded to that voice, After we discovered the rumors on the Internet, we immediately secured the room, and no one has moved the servers inside. Our surveillance video can prove this. Anyone who doubts this point is welcome to check our footage.</br>
</br>
At this point, many people were moved by Thomass sincerity.</br>
</br>
To be honest, many of the people had already suffered from Stockholm syndrome. All the UA soldiers who committed crimes in the country had been sent back to the UA and tried in military courts, but they were soon acquitted.</br>
</br>
Now, the UA was willing to open up their military base to prove their innocence, which made them feel like their opinion actually mattered. Since it was the first time they openly expressed their willingness to allow the media to investigate and collect evidence!</br>
</br>
Of course, the premise of all trust here was based on the fact that everything Thomas said was true, and that the servers were not associated with Takeda Pharmaceutical and the T-virus. But if the results did prove that the UA was collecting T-virus data, then their stance would not change the slightest.</br>
</br>
Except before the investigation began, most of the protesters had already believed Thomass confident statement</br>
</br>
The Yankees were not joking.</br>
</br>
After Thomas finished his speech, two officials, escorted by UA soldiers, came to the medias broadcast vehicle and began to arrange the investigation process.</br>
</br>
After all, it was a military facility, and it was definitely impossible for a large group of people to enter, so only ten news agencies were granted permission to enter.</br>
</br>
In this case, the question of who to choose became very important.</br>
</br>
If they chose all UA-based news agencies, no one would be convinced by the result.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of their absolute confidence, only two news agencies named were based in the UA, and even two news agencies from Hua were selected despite the opposing views.</br>
</br>
After the list was announced, all representatives present no longer expressed objections.</br>
</br>
In addition to the four major news agencies of Reuters, AFP, Xinhua, and the Associated Press, there were also broadcasting companies that were equally influential, such as BBC, NHK, and CTV. As far as the list was concerned, it was fair and square.</br>
</br>
As to whether the investigation process was truly transparent</br>
</br>
It would be determined once the result was released.</br>
</br>
The unusual cooperative attitude of the UA made the crowd, especially those who wished to see the downfall of the UA, feel hesitant. Including Sumitomo Kenichi and all representatives of anti-UA garrison organizations, everyone did not expect the UA to cooperate in this unprecedented manner. Because usually, even if they were amid controversies, they often had a strong stance.</br>
</br>
But this time, they justcooperated?</br>
</br>
Sumitomo Kenichi picked up the phone anxiously and dialed Jiang Chens number.</br>
</br>
As soon as the call was connected, he hurriedly said.</br>
</br>
They opened their military base</br>
</br>
I know, so what?</br>
</br>
So what?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens nonchalant response made Sumitomo Kenichi confused.</br>
</br>
Do you think I am betting that they will never compromise? They will never open their military base and carry this bowl of dirty water from Yokosuka back to their own home soil?</br>
</br>
Are you not?</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen said this, Sumitomo Kenichi had a strange expression on his face, because Jiang Chen had already said what he wanted to say.</br>
</br>
Use your mind to think about it, Jiang Chen sighed softly; he was about to say something, but he quickly changed the topic and laughed, Forget it, why am I explaining this to you. Just enjoy the show.</br>
</br>
After he left the bewildered Sumitomo Kenichi with this sentence, he hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1347: A Grand Presen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the list was announced, Jiang Chen walked towards Reuters television production truck.</br>
</br>
He used a holographic camouflage system to distort the light and shadow of his facial details and completely turned his face into a different one.</br>
</br>
Although he could always hide behind the scenes and assign the task to a Ghost Agent, since they were at the last step before they boot out the Yankees, it would be too boring to enjoy the show as a spectator.</br>
</br>
When the reporter, who was testing his equipment, saw a stranger walk to him, he asked with a frown.</br>
</br>
Is there a problem?</br>
</br>
Subconsciously, the British journalist thought he was a representative of a certain organization, because many Asians who spoke Japanese-accent English had come to him and made some strange requests for his evidence collection.</br>
</br>
Subjectively, he was very disgusted with this type of behavior, especially when a layman decides to tell him how to do his job. At this moment, when another man approached him, of course, he was not too pleased.</br>
</br>
After the interview starts, please point your camera at the server, and stay on each server for at least two seconds. After Jiang Chen rehearsed this in his mind, he adjusted his English-level and spoke this in fluent English with a Japanese-accent. He had directly put forward his requests.</br>
</br>
Give each server a shot? Is there any purpose? The Reuters reporter sneered and said unceremoniously, as he put his equipment aside, I dont need a layman to tell me how to do my job. I will ensure every second of my footage will give the most objective perspective!</br>
</br>
Its very meaningful, and it doesnt conflict with anything, Jiang Chen put on a serious expression when he answered the reporters question, and said, We have to make sure that every server is inside the room. You just need to give all the servers a close-up shot before the interview. Then, after the interview is over, Ill purchase the material in your memory card for a price of 10,000 pounds per second.</br>
</br>
Deal!</br>
</br>
Without any hesitation, the reporter agreed to Jiang Chens request.</br>
</br>
Ten thousand pounds a second!</br>
</br>
This is basically raining money!</br>
</br>
And all he needed to do was to give a close-up shot of the servers and the man did not request him to put the shots in the interview. In principle, this action would not violate his professional ethics.</br>
</br>
Only a fool would not earn this free money!</br>
</br>
There were twenty servers in the photo</br>
</br>
I understand, Jiang Chen took out his phone, shook it, and smiled in the reporters zealous sight. I will pay you the deposit for twenty servers first. Based on the agreed two seconds, the total is 400,000 pounds. As for how much you can get, its all up to you.</br>
</br>
The transfer was completed quickly.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen watched the reporter leave, a subtle grin remained on his face and he gave an okay gesture to Gill, who was standing next to him. The latter looked at Jiang Chen in a daze at this moment. Her look of respect had turned into an expression of worship.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just half a minute ago, while Jiang Chen took out his phone and transferred money to the reporter, Gill had quietly installed the data transmission laser probe on the camera the reporter had been working with.</br>
</br>
At noon, the organizations distributed water and food to the protesters for free. The money for the purchase of food and water came from donations received from society. As for who made these donations, it was naturally the Sumitomo Foundation.</br>
</br>
With his eyes fixed on the demonstrators outside the military base, Sumitomo Kenichis fists were clenched, and he kept praying in his mind, praying that the man was really as confident as he was, and he could finally defeat the CIB.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, his decision to rashly use the influence of the Sumitomo Group to stand with the wrong crowd was enough to tank the reputation he had built in his family, and cross him off the list of candidates for the future head of the family.</br>
</br>
Two hours passed, and it was two oclock in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
The invited reporters and experts entered the military base under the escort of soldiers.</br>
</br>
To prevent someone from taking photos along the way, everyones electronic equipment must be turned in before they arrived at the destination. After they reached the destination, their equipment would be returned to the reporters hands.</br>
</br>
Since they entered Room 014, the UA soldiers had been keeping a close watch of Xinhua News Agency and CCTV reporters.</br>
</br>
In their view, without inviting the Xin media, only these people could help the old cunning fox Jiang Chen and his Ghost Agents play tricks.</br>
</br>
In the Yankees distrustful sights, those reporters from Hua were naturally quite dissatisfied and stared back. The French stood aside, and several reporters gathered around a computer expert to comment on these servers.</br>
</br>
As for the British</br>
</br>
The BBC reporter set up their camera properly, while the Reuters reporter entered the room and scurried between the servers like a treasure hunter. He was very persistent and gave each server a close-up shot.</br>
</br>
The UA soldier stared at the strange behavior of this British reporter and was somewhat confused, but he did not question his behavior.</br>
</br>
One was because the two countries had always worked closely together, and Reuters had always followed the direction pointed out by the British government. The second was that giving each server a close-up was meaningless in the eyes of Thomas and the others because from when the photo was taken till now, no one had ever touched these servers.</br>
</br>
Not even a single touch!</br>
</br>
Although there were ten media companies in attendance, there were only four protagonists here. Ten cameras were ready and aimed at the row of servers, and the British journalist finally ended his treasure hunt at this moment and returned to the Reuters team.</br>
</br>
The terminal to access the servers was provided by the UA military.</br>
</br>
Since Thomas was certain there was no problem with these servers, in order to cooperate with the media on the investigation process with more transparency, he specially brought the projector from the conference room and projected the interface of the terminal onto the white screen.</br>
</br>
In order to avoid suspicion, the experts appointed by the Associated Press were selected last to go.</br>
</br>
The first to examine the servers was the expert appointed by AFP.</br>
</br>
After Thomas had the server plugged in, the curly-haired French expert pressed the power button and stepped forward in a responsible manner. After about half an hour, the expert finally shook his head, walked back to the AFP reporter, and gave a rather conservative answer.</br>
</br>
From the program, I dont see any problems. At least for now, it can be proved that there is no T virus data in these servers.</br>
</br>
The next one up was an expert from Hua.</br>
</br>
The information technology expert also stepped forward to check carefully, but the result was the same as the previous French experts conclusion. However, he still had doubts about whether the UA had committed fraud, as the expert said.</br>
</br>
There is no problem with the software. Im requesting permission to disassemble the server and check the hardware to define the source of these servers</br>
</br>
Request rejected. Thomas said without hesitation, All inspections are limited to a software perspective. This is our bottom line! We cant allow you to do something on our server because of your unprovoked accusations.</br>
</br>
The expert was forcefully removed, and a British expert was up next.</br>
</br>
The first two experts had done their best, and the British expert obviously did not look too confident. After he had operated on the terminal for some time, he shook his head and gave his spot to the expert from the UA.</br>
</br>
When Thomas saw that the expert appointed by his side step up, there was a triumphant smile on his face</br>
</br>
At this moment, he could already conclude that they have won this round of confrontations.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade may be betting that they will not open the barracks, or they may be waiting for an opportunity to enter the military base and get their hands on the servers, but no matter what the calculations they had a minute ago, when the last expert started to operate on the terminal, they lost all chances of winning.</br>
</br>
In the sight of Lieutenant General Thomas and Major General Howard, the expert appointed by the Associated Press stood forward.</br>
</br>
The old man over fifty years old pushed his glasses, walked to the camera, and spoke slowly.</br>
</br>
The first three experts didnt see any problems. I dont think I can find anything either.</br>
</br>
After a pause, the information technology expert from California shrugged, and then said, From the beginning, I thought it was a farce, and now it seems that there is nothing wrong with my inference. Someone tried to pour dirty water and obviously, they have shot themselves in the foot. However, in a responsible manner, I will follow-through with the inspection process to the end.</br>
</br>
As he spoke, he coughed slightly, straightened his collar, and walked to the terminal connected to the servers.</br>
</br>
Then, Ill restart the server first.</br>
</br>
As he spoke, he pressed the reset button.</br>
</br>
Just like the previous few times, the green signal light turned on, and the servers were operating stably.</br>
</br>
When Mr. Tanaka was deleting the T virus data, he formatted the server quite thoroughly and did not leave any clues that may connect it back to the T virus. If it were not for special means, with several days or even months of hard work, it was impossible to restore the formatted data.</br>
</br>
When the Hua expert proposed to disassemble the machine, it could have been a good way to prove that the servers were from Takeda Pharmaceuticals, but the UA would never agree with this request. Even if everyone was reluctant to accept the truth, they could only watch as the restart button was being pressed and wait for Thomas to proclaim his victory.</br>
</br>
But at this moment, the UA expert was stunned.</br>
</br>
Thomas and Howard were stunned.</br>
</br>
Everyone was stunned.</br>
</br>
As well as people who were in other parts of Nippon and even around the world that watched the broadcast live.</br>
</br>
The start-up screen was still the same, and the interface did not change.</br>
</br>
However, a line of words popped out on the screen and stung</br>
</br>
[T virus database, restarting]</br>
</br>
[Restart successful, loading]</br>
</br>
A long stream of data spewed out from the text box on the left side of the screen, and the rotating three-dimensional image on the right side was the morphological structure of the T virus and the RNA molecular chain. At this moment, all this data was projected on to the white screen.</br>
</br>
Thomass eyes turned red, and he rushed to unplug the power, but it was too late.</br>
</br>
The ten media companies on the scene were all live broadcasting this event, and this scene had been broadcasted to every corner of the world.</br>
</br>
The UA expert was completely dazed as his finger still hovered above the restart button.</br>
</br>
He had yet to recover from the fact that</br>
</br>
He had done a huge favor for humanity</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1348: Out Of Control</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The live broadcast was interrupted.</br>
</br>
The public was in an uproar.</br>
</br>
The citizens of Yokosuka, who still possessed a hint of friendliness to the UA military, almost smashed their phones in anger, and the signs that had been put aside were raised again. The police, who persuaded the citizens to stop moving forward, revealed mixed emotions and also wavered.</br>
</br>
The indignant people shoved the police line as they shouted.</br>
</br>
Get out of Yokosuka!</br>
</br>
Liar! Shameful liar!</br>
</br>
Im petitioning to Lift the security treaty!</br>
</br>
Yokosuka is not a guinea pig, get out!</br>
</br>
Not only the gates of the Yokosuka military base, but demonstrators had started to converge in front of the gates of military bases in Yokota, Sasebo, and even Okinawa. With wooden signs held up high, they shouted protest slogans. While they responded to the people of Yokosuka, they shouted an easy to understand phrase to the soldiers in the military base</br>
</br>
GET OUT!</br>
</br>
In the UA.</br>
</br>
The man in front of the TV watched the news as he covered his head with both his hands in despair.</br>
</br>
T-virusGod, tell me this is not true.</br>
</br>
He could not believe that his country really tried this.</br>
</br>
Originally, he still firmly believed that this must be a malicious campaign by Celestial Trade to smear the UAs image. After all, it was not the first day that Future 1.0 criticized the UA. However, with the evidence in front of his eyes, it was impossible for him to close his eyes and ignore it.</br>
</br>
In the comment section of major websites and forums, the keyboard warriors were already battling.</br>
</br>
Why does the CIB want to get T-virus data? Unbelievable, what do the politicians in the Capitol want to do?!</br>
</br>
The United Nations should take over these servers immediately! No, thats not right! They should be destroyed immediately!</br>
</br>
I dont agree with surrendering the servers. The T-virus can be used as a deterrent, as long as we are cautious enough not to really use them. Its like a nuclear warhead in a silo</br>
</br>
Both sides held their own opinions. One side believed that national interests were above all else and understood the CIBs collection of T-virus data. The other side believed that humanitarianism was the priority. Regardless of the purposes, biological weapons should not be used for military purposes.</br>
</br>
In a sense, the polarization of opinion also reflected the confusion of the UA people on whether they were leaning left or right. And this is the reason why Trump almost caught up in support of Kennedy in less than half a year.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how polarized opinions were on the Internet, the people of California were obviously not satisfied with using the keyboard to express their political views. In particular, citizens of San Francisco and Los Angeles took to the streets and surrounded the state government and CIB buildings with slogans and protest signs.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on the information disclosed by Future 1.0, these servers were originally planned to be shipped back to Los Angeles. So, no matter how the UA authorities and the CIB planned to deal with these servers, the final destination, California, was a dangerous location.</br>
</br>
Even as a fanatical zombie culture lover, no one really hoped to see the day where the walking dead really happened</br>
</br>
Different from the polarization of opinion in the UA, public opinion abroad was relatively more unified, almost overwhelmingly disappointed in the behavior of the UA.</br>
</br>
Especially the Finnish people, who suffered because of the Kurofune, took a clear-cut stance against the UA this time. The Finnish Prime Minister even publicly condemned the CIBs behavior, calling their action a crime against humanity</br>
</br>
In a mansion on the outskirts of Yoto, Sumitomo Kenichi stood in his study, with a phone in his hand, and casually chatted.</br>
</br>
Yes, father, I sent them.</br>
</br>
My reason is very simple. The UAs hegemony is fading, and now is not the time to be cautious! If we stand firmly on the side of Celestial Trade, they, as the winners, will definitely not forget the contributions we have made!</br>
</br>
This is not gambling on the future of the family. In my eyes, it is a win-win situation. I just sold the favor to our ally. The UA must withdraw from Nippon within two years. There is a high possibility that Celestial Trade will be the replacement!</br>
</br>
As for my personal safety, it is nothing in the interests of the family!</br>
</br>
He did all he could to resist the urge to laugh as he made an awe-inspiring statement.</br>
</br>
His fathers praise made him feel a little airy, especially when he heard that the old stubborn uncles in the family had gradually changed their views of his young and vigorous character. His heart was pumping so proudly that it was about to jump out of his chest.</br>
</br>
After he hung up, he couldnt restrain himself anymore and laughed hysterically.</br>
</br>
This is amazing! Amazing! So amazing!</br>
</br>
Out of all those who wished for the downfall of the UA, Sumitomo Kenichi was the most excited at this moment.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, when Jiang Chen asked him to instigate the people to protest, deep down, he was reluctant. Not a single consortium dared to go against the UA before the CIB and the UA military left Nippon, let alone as the eldest son of the Sumitomo consortium.</br>
</br>
In contrast, these Nippon financial groups would rather offend the prime minister of their own country than offend the commander-in-chief of the UA military in Nippon or the Chief of Staff of the CIB in Nippon. Because any actions of the former could not bypass the National Diet, while the latter could directly bypass National Diet and even all the rules and regulations</br>
</br>
Mitsui Hiroto was an example.</br>
</br>
Hiroto was still the owner of a big consortium, Kenichi himself was just the eldest son of a consortium.</br>
</br>
But even if he didnt dare, he had no other choice at the time.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen was very clear, it was his only path to survive.</br>
</br>
He had to bite the bullet.</br>
</br>
After he bypassed the head of the Sumitomo Foundation, also his father, Sumitomo Kenichi directly used his influence on the civil rights organizations funded by the Sumitomo Foundation to organize protest activities at the military base.</br>
</br>
After he had done all of this, he completely shut himself in the study of his private home while he waited nervously for the final result of this event.</br>
</br>
From the time when the number of protesters exceeded 10,000, to when the UA made the odd decision to open up their military base, his uneasy heart pumped rapidly with every media report.</br>
</br>
Especially half an hour ago, when he saw experts from three different countries all unable to find any evidence before the UA expert decided to try, Sumitomo Kenichi also drowned in the feeling of hopeless.</br>
</br>
However, what he never expected was that the plot actually reversed at the last minute.</br>
</br>
The UA was caught in the hands of its own people.</br>
</br>
The dumbfounded information technology expert made him almost sing in joy. He immediately turned on his phone that was turned off and called his father who had been dialing.</br>
</br>
Everything felt like a dream.</br>
</br>
Until last night, he was still living under the death threat of the CIB.</br>
</br>
However, he did not expect that in less than twenty-four hours, he was already amongst the winners</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1349: Contradiction in Logic</br>
</div></br>
</br>
What the hell is going on! Carter yelled at Lieutenant Admiral Thomas, Why did you open the military base? Are you stupid! You could have blocked out the annoying cameras outside of the base, why did you give them the opportunity to obtain evidence? When do we need to explain our actions to others? Have you forgotten who you are loyal to? Take a good look at the national emblem on your own hat!</br>
</br>
But Frank</br>
</br>
Lieutenant Admiral Thomas face was flushed as he tried to justify his actions. However, before he could finish speaking, Secretary Carters roar interrupted his speech.</br>
</br>
That idiot Frank is fooling around, and you are following him?! Lieutenant Admiral Thomas, and Major General Hogg, I dont want to say more about your stupidity, now, no, immediately! Block the military base immediately! Prohibit any one from coming in and out! I mean anyone!</br>
</br>
Didnt you ask me to cooperate with the CIB?!</br>
</br>
Thomas cursed in his heart, but he dared not to say anything and had to accept the order.</br>
</br>
Carters chest was pumping violently up and down and he had to change the hand holding the phone. Then he leaned against the chair for a moment to calm his breathing down.</br>
</br>
Maybe he cursed, or maybe he just didnt want to hear Thomas voice, he broke the silence.</br>
</br>
So thats it, do what I just said.</br>
</br>
Wait, wait a minute, Thomas hurriedly said as Secretary Carter was about to hang up.</br>
</br>
What else? Carter said impatiently.</br>
</br>
What should we do about the reporters? They are still under our house arrest in the military base, Lieutenant General Thomas said immediately.</br>
</br>
Confiscate their memory cards, then kick them out, Carter said with a headache as he pressed his fingers against his sore temple.</br>
</br>
Yes</br>
</br>
Although he doubted the usefulness of the action, Lieutenant General Thomas nodded.</br>
</br>
After he hung up, he took a deep breath, suppressed his burning anger, and dialed Franks number.</br>
</br>
If possible, his wished to grab the guy by the collar and question the idiot to see how he could come up with such a foolish plan. If he didnt handle this properly, there was no doubt that he and Major Admiral Howard would be used as the scapegoat behind this incident, and may potentially end up in military court.</br>
</br>
He only regretted the fact that he chose to believe in that idiots plan in the first place</br>
</br>
To his surprise, the phone rang more than a dozen times and still did not connect.</br>
</br>
Thomas dialed the number again, but the busy tone on the other side remained the same.</br>
</br>
FU*K! WHERE DID THIS IDIOT GO! After Thomas cussed out, he slammed the phone down.</br>
</br>
Major Admiral Howard, who stood next to him, looked to him solemnly and asked, Whats the matter?</br>
</br>
Who knows what hes doing, Thomas swore, dropped the phone on the table, then put his head down on the desk as he grabbed his hair in pain, God who can tell me what I should do now.</br>
</br>
</br>
The key person disappeared.</br>
</br>
Based on Secretary Carters request, he should release those reporters?</br>
</br>
Its okay to release them, but what about after?</br>
</br>
How should they explain to the protesters who surrounded the base? How should they explain to the Nippon government? How should they explain it to the Capitol, Congress, and even military courts?</br>
</br>
And Secretary Carter did not tell him anything about these unanswered questions</br>
</br>
How did you come up with this plan?</br>
</br>
In the office of the Xin Embassy.</br>
</br>
Gill looked at Jiang Chen with eyes of disbelief as she stood in front of the desk; there was a touch of admiration on her face and it became more and more obvious. Although she also came up with many plans to destroy those servers, she never imagined such a creative solution.</br>
</br>
Even when Jiang Chen explained the whole plan to her, there were still many doubts in her mind.</br>
</br>
It wasnt until time passed that she gradually realized the brilliance of the whole plan</br>
</br>
My idea was very simple. If they chose to be a turtle and respond to all doubts by ignoring them, then I would prevail in the publics eye and continue to use them as scapegoats until they are completely annoyed and flustered. However, with their attitude, its very unlikely for them to do that. Since an opportunity to prove their innocence lied in front of them, they can easily use me as a scapegoat, and I dont believe they can withstand this temptation. Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Especially when they had not won against Celestial Trade in a public opinion battle for a long time.</br>
</br>
Being on the edge of victory always made people lose sense of their surroundings.</br>
</br>
If we hadnt done anything, would they have discovered issues with those servers? Gill wondered, They were so confident that they couldnt be exposed?</br>
</br>
You can say that, Jiang Chen nodded. Its impossible to recover the formatted data without a whole technical team working day and night. Just relying on a few experts with a terminal is not enough to get anything, let alone just having an hour.</br>
</br>
The only chance to spot any issues was to disassemble the servers check the electronic parts in the case one by one, and look for clues about the connection between this batch of servers and Takeda Pharmaceutical. But you have also seen it when the experts from Hua made the request to disassemble the machines for inspection, the Lieutenant Admiral refused without hesitation.</br>
</br>
But what about those servers? The T-virus data is contained on it. If they copy that data Gill wondered.</br>
</br>
Its impossible, Jiang Chen shook his head and said slowly, I only said that I would give them a big gift. When did I say that the virus data I gave them is real?</br>
</br>
Gill took a second to process before her eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
With her cleverness, she instantly understood what Jiang Chen meant.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen used the same logic as the UA military.</br>
</br>
The UA military used the point that experts appointed by media would not be able to prove that these servers contained T-virus data in a limited time to prove their innocence. And Jiang Chen also took advantage of the fact that no one would be able to verify the authenticity of the data within a limited period of time to trick them.</br>
</br>
Yes, the data Lilith transmitted to the server was fake.</br>
</br>
Other than the structure diagram of the T virus and the RNA molecular chain, which had long been published, the information transmitted to the server was a forgery from Celestial Trade, and some of the information in this fake virus was also missing.</br>
</br>
It was impossible for the UA to prove the fact the virus was fake unless they produced favorable evidence. However, under what circumstances could they prove this? It would only be possible given one scenario.</br>
</br>
And this correct answer, in turn, would make the fact that they collected T-virus data a reality.</br>
</br>
It was a contradiction in logic.</br>
</br>
Therefore, they had to accept the fact that they were forced to be the perpetrator</br>
</br>
Gills pupils flashed with a light of admiration. If she only respected Jiang Chens strategy before, she had full admiration over his abilities now. It was that she hid everything in her heart and did not show any obvious emotions.</br>
</br>
The next step is to get rid of Frank, and then force the UA military out. We have almost won this confrontation. Jiang Chen, who stared at the ceiling, leaned back on his chair and thought about it for a moment, then he said, As for those servers Regardless of whether they take that piece of data seriously or not, I will send it to them as a consolation prize.</br>
</br>
Even if they successfully restore the data deleted by Tanaka, they would still be confused by the fake data transmitted by Lilith. Therefore, the possibility that they could restore the T virus data was infinitely small, and it was no longer meaningful to destroy those servers.</br>
</br>
Whats more, the fact these servers were still in the UAs hands was more beneficial to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
I see, Gill said seriously.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the opening ceremony of the Olympics will be in a few days. I hope to end this mess soon, preferably before the torch symbolizing peace is lit, Jiang Chen smiled at the serious-looking Gill. He joked humorously, After all, as an amateur athlete, I also want to cherish this hard-won opportunity.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>

</br>
As an amateur athlete, Jiang Chen was not joking.</br>
</br>
Just a few months ago, he became a part of the Xin Olympic Committee and participated in the Olympic Games as an athlete.</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, he might had been the first person in the history of the Olympics to appear in the opening ceremony as an invited guest and athlete at the same time.</br>
</br>
Xin was only founded as a country a few years ago, and this Olympics was the first world-class sporting event for Xin athletes. As a small country, the base number of athletes in Xin itself was very small, to the point where many events had no participants.</br>
</br>
Someone may ask, why not give all the athletes the genetic vaccine, or let Celestial Trade soldiers sign up. Sports with skill requirements such as football and basketball would be hard to guarantee a victory, but it would be no exaggeration to say that Xin could dominate all track and field events.</br>
</br>
In addition, with their existing technology, it was absolutely impossible for the Olympic Committee to detect the genetic vaccine. Unless they compared the difference in DNA of germ cells and somatic cells, it was possible to detect a trace of difference.</br>
</br>
But was this meaningful?</br>
</br>
If he gave the vaccines to athletes, the game itself would lose its meaning.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen did not care about how many gold medals Xin could win. On the premise that he could let all the legal citizens of Xin live in the envy of the people of the world, he did not think he or Zhang Yaping still needed to rely on gold medals to boost national self-confidence.</br>
</br>
If the athletes won, they deserved to be cheered.</br>
</br>
If the athletes lost, just work harder next time.</br>
</br>
The process of competing in the Olympic games was something enjoyable, there was no need to make them into products on the assembly line.</br>
</br>
With this mentality, when he saw that there was a category that no one registered in, Jiang Chen decided to sign himself up.</br>
</br>
As for the category?</br>
</br>
It was not track and field nor weightlifting, because competing in these two categories would serve no meaning at all. The genetic vaccine could allow him to run at a superhuman level, and there was no point in weightlifting at all. His various body stats had reached the limit of mankind in the 21st century a few years ago. Even if he did win, it would not bring him any sense of accomplishment</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was in the Xin Embassy office casually chatting with Gill about the next steps, an emergency meeting was taking place in the Capitol.</br>
</br>
The meeting place was in the President Office.</br>
</br>
The meeting was attended by the outgoing Hill, Secretary of State Kerry who had competed with her for the presidency, the summoned CIB Director Henry Wilmot, as well as Secretary of Defense Carter and Advanced Projects Agency Director Melvin Laird, who both were involved in this matter.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Henry entered the room, he eyed Kerry. The former was a part of the latters presidential campaign, but the latter looked away subtly at the moment.</br>
</br>
A slight disappointment appeared in Henrys eyes. He lowered his head for a moment as if he had made some kind of decision then he raised his head again.</br>
</br>
Henry Wilmot. With a sharp gaze locked on Henrys face, Hill said harshly, Do you know why you are standing here?</br>
</br>
What should come always comes.</br>
</br>
Henry knew that he could not escape his fate.</br>
</br>
It was the consensus of the international community to oppose the T-virus. After a scandal of this scale broke out, it was not enough to rely on sincere apologies. Someone had to take the blame for the scandal, and this person could not be the righteous Capitol, nor the Department of Defense that followed orders, so there seemed to be only one suitable candidate left.</br>
</br>
It was time to settle everything together. In the Colombian Crisis, the CIB was certainly also responsible.</br>
</br>
Isnt it because Im the CIB director? Henry, who had completely thought everything through, despite the different gazes that were focused on him, he shrugged and laughed out loud, Besides this reason, I cant think of anything else.</br>
</br>
The Director of CIB was directly appointed by the President, and the position also served as a senior intelligence advisor to the President and Congress. The position was often referred to as the ear of the President. Although the position required a nod from Senate, kicking him from this position only required a nod from the President.</br>
</br>
You have three minutes to defend yourself. If you cant make a convincing explanation of what happened at the Yokosuka Military Base, you may have to go to the independent prosecutor to explain yourself. Hill didnt look Henry in the eyes, but instead, she flipped through the papers on the desk blankly.</br>
</br>
There is nothing to explain, Henry stared into Hills eyes, and said emotionlessly, I will be responsible for my mistakes.</br>
</br>
From the moment he stepped into this building, he had anticipated what might happen today. No matter what kind of explanation he gave, the final outcome would not convince anyone, and he would be used as a scapegoat.</br>
</br>
It was the only option to reduce the stain on the country.</br>
</br>
Mike Pompeo will take your place, Hill said.</br>
</br>
I have no objection, Henry said softly.</br>
</br>
The young man who had been standing in the corner of the office stepped forward, nodded slightly to Henry, and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
Mike Pompeo, Senate. Thank you for your continued efforts in the nations interest.</br>
</br>
Now its up to you. Henry shook the extended hand and looked Mike in the eyes. His previously relieved voice now carried a tone of solemnity, This position is far more dangerous than you think.</br>
</br>
Ill perform my duties as if Im walking on thin ice, Mike said politely, but the upturned corner of his lips still couldnt hide the sense of pride.</br>
</br>
Henry keenly noticed the upturned curve, but he just smiled and shook his head.</br>
</br>
First of all, congratulations. But before that, as your predecessor, I have to give you some advice.</br>
</br>
Mike did not reply, but slightly lifted his chin and motioned him to continue speaking with his eyes.</br>
</br>
Stay away from that man, you know who I am talking about. Including me, my predecessor, Mr. Naomi, and his predecessor, Henry said as he shook his three fingers. His originally serious expression suddenly burst into laughter; he shook his head and laughed in self-mockery, Since the establishment of the CIB, this is unprecedented. In less than five years, three directors have been forced to step down, and all because of the same man</br>
</br>
Mr. Wilmot, Hill coughed and said expressionlessly, If this is your advice to your successor, then your speech is over.</br>
</br>
Yes, Madam President. Henry bowed gracefully, gave Kerry one last look, then left the room.</br>
</br>
No one stopped him. They only watched the losers departure with coldness and indifference.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Mike suddenly felt that the back of the man leaving the meeting room was so bleak</br>
</br>
A coolness gradually rose in his heart, and Mike nervously gulped .</br>
</br>
The moment the door slammed shut, he suddenly understood why he felt this way when he should be enjoying this glorious moment in his life.</br>
</br>
Because from Henrys back, he vaguely saw the shadow of another person.</br>
</br>
That person was no one else but himself</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

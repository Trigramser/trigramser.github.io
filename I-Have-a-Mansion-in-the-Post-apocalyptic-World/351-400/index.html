</div></br>
</br>
Carmen looked at his old father sawing wood in front of the wooden hut. Then he walked up and looked at the stack of wood in confusion.</br>
</br>
"My dear father, you are doing… what?"</br>
</br>
"Building a vessel… A miniature version." Jacono wiped the sweat from his forehead as he stared at the yet to be assembled keel beside the lake.</br>
</br>
"Building a vessel? What's the purpose of that?" Carmen looked at his father, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"If the work that had conquered the Atlantic ocean has no purpose," Jacono said bluntly, "Then including us, including everything, all would be without purpose."</br>
</br>
He said something with an ambiguous meaning. But Carmen seemed to be accustomed to his father saying things people didn't understand, so he didn't express his attitude as he only sighed in reply.</br>
</br>
"… Okay, but do you know how to build a vessel?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know." Jacono laughed delightfully; he pointed his saw at the keel starting to take shape. "Don't underestimate it because it's just a ship, there are a lot of tricks to be learned. Including how to treat the wood and how to connect the wood. To construct this keel, it took me an entire year. Although I failed many times, the process was surprisingly fun."</br>
</br>
Carmen looked at his father in surprise, then he looked earnestly at the keel.</br>
</br>
"Hard to imagine… Did no one help you?"</br>
</br>
"Cides wanted to find me a boatman, but I rejected the proposal. I wanted to explore by myself on how the vessel worked." He flung the saw in his hand to the side as Jacono picked up the bottle of water on the tree trunk and took a few big gulps.</br>
</br>
Carmen looked at his father immersed in the activity; he was silent for two seconds before he said,</br>
</br>
"I heard you needed to see me-"</br>
</br>
"Give up on that prophecy. Jacono didn't look at him, but rather at the keel.</br>
</br>
Carmen was shocked because of his father's abrupt words.</br>
</br>
After a moment, he said with difficulty,</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
Jacono's sight returned as he looked at his son's eyes keenly.</br>
</br>
"The infant would have to leave the parents one day and learn how to walk by himself. They told us a lot, but they can't tell us more. If we continue to follow this path, the future we face might be more upsetting than the situation they had gained."</br>
</br>
"…But if we listen to the wise words of the intellect, wouldn't it save us the trouble of going through detours?"</br>
</br>
"Who said detours are wrong?" Jacono asked back.</br>
</br>
Carmen fell into silence.</br>
</br>
Seeing that his son didn't speak, Jacono continued to speak about things with deeper meaning, "Humans should build on the intelligence of its ancestor and not depend on the future to further the future."</br>
</br>
"Although history has changed, the trend will not change." The next twenty years belong to artificial intelligence; then a technological explosion led by breakthroughs in material science, and then-" unable to agree with his father's perspective, Carmen said softly.</br>
</br>
</br>
"That might not be the case." Jacono scorned before he picked up the saw on the ground. "Did you see this keel? If I told you how to build a vessel, how to build a steam vessel, if "I" died one day, would you be able to build an aircraft carrier?"</br>
</br>
"That's the scientist's job," Carmen said with an indifferent voice.</br>
</br>
"Science and capital were tied together from the very beginning. Technology determines the space human live in, and capital expands the space. That is the nature of the science and capital. Did you give back all your economic knowledge to your Harvard professor? I suggest you reread the Schumpeter function chapter."</br>
</br>
The old father returned to working in front of the tree truck and ignored his son.</br>
</br>
He stood beside the lake for a long time. It was not until the sky in the distance began to turn yellow did he finally turn around and leave the wooden hut of his father.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen took a flight to Australia. Because of the combination of airport size and traffic, the airport located in Coro Island only had flights to nearby Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, to travel from Han to Xin, he would have to the first fly to Australia.</br>
</br>
After a rather lengthy journey, Jiang Chen finally got out of the plane at Coro Island. It was midnight.</br>
</br>
When he walked out of the airport, Ayesha was already waiting for him.</br>
</br>
"Head to the presidential palace," Jiang Chen said directly after getting on the car.</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded and started the car.</br>
</br>
"Do you not need to go home and rest? As she drove, she nonchalantly asked.</br>
</br>
"There is no need. If they don't see me, someone might lose sleep because of it," Jiang Chen mocked before leaning back in the seat with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
Ayesha grinned as she didn't speak for the remainder of the trip.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the presidential palace, he explained his identity, and the guard immediately let him pass through. With an attendant's reception, Jiang Chen arrived in Zhang Yapin's office.</br>
</br>
After a few days apart, the guy was more haggard. It was clear that the troubles had gotten the better of him. When he saw Jiang Chen, he looked relived as he couldn't wait to greet him.</br>
</br>
"You're finally back." Zhang Yapin smiled bitterly when he looked at Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
"Don't ask me what to do yet, explain to me the situation first," Jiang Chen said concisely.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin nodded and began to explain to Jiang Chen what has happened in the last few days.</br>
</br>
First, after Ivan ordered to take out the fishing boats obstructing the construction of the military facility and led the force in a standoff with the country F coastal guards. The F coastal guards were first extremely aggressive and hostile, they didn't think the three Xin fast boats were competition.</br>
</br>
Just as they were about to enter the Xin territory to demand people, Ivan took out the weapons without wavering.</br>
</br>
They were dumbfounded. They didn't think Xin would have the courage to do this as they were without a plan. Although the coastal guards were equipped with light weapons, the coastal guards didn't dare make a decision that could cause a severe repercussion in their diplomatic relationship. Since once the first shot is fired, it would be a regional conflict. So they could only remain in a standoff, at the same time, reporting the message to their superior.</br>
</br>
Finally, the F president Aquino came in contact with Zhang Yapin. But Zhang Yapin didn't realize what had happened at New Moon Island since the national defense was the responsibility of Celestial Trade Company.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin realized something was off immediately and got in touch with Ivan before he learned about the event.</br>
</br>
Okay, he had to admit that when Ivan sunk the reckless fishing boats looking for trouble – Oh no, pirate boats – he too did curse in his mind. "This feels fu*king great." Although the relationship between the Pannu Islands and country F was not a generational feud, the grudge has been building among the public for a while.</br>
</br>
But he was the Xin president, after all, he had to consider national interest above his personal emotions. After he calmed down, a drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead.</br>
</br>
Just the day before, Aquino notified him that if the recovery work could not be commenced within the next three days, country F retain the option of solving this through military means to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of their citizen abroad are maintained.</br>
</br>
But when Zhang Yapin said the last sentence, Jiang Chen was immediately unhappy.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k the legitimate rights and interests," Jiang Chen cursed out, "Military means? Funny, I will teach them a lesson."</br>
</br>
He hasn't cursed like this for a long time.</br>
</br>
"Country F has an enlisted military of one hundred and twenty thousand people… We might not even beat a battalion of theirs," Zhang Yapin said in a small voice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glared at him and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Who said we would fight them."</br>
</br>
"But they are already threatening us like this," Zhang Yapin said with a bitter face.</br>
</br>
"Country F always maintained an image of being a victim in sea territory disputes to garner the compassion of the international society. They would never send out their military force to start a war with us."</br>
</br>
"But-"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was still not convinced, but Jiang Chen interrupted him.</br>
</br>
"Also, the key is still Han and UA. Do you remember what I told you? Maintain neutrality and don't sway to either superpower. If country F decide to take military actions against us, it will force us to join Han as an ally, and Han would definitely not let go of an opportunity to break the first and second islands' chains and proactively provide us with assistance. The UA would be reluctant to see the Han gaining a military base in the western Pacific Ocean, so they must restrain its ally from being too reckless.</br>
</br>
Culturally, Xin was more similar to Han, but ideologically, it was more aligned with UA. This situation resulted in both superpowers think the country would join forces with them.</br>
</br>
"Because we haven't chosen a side yet, we are safe," Jiang Chen patted president Zhang on the shoulder as he said with sincere words.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen had his reasons, Zhang Yapin still thought it was a bit forced.</br>
</br>
"But why don't we stand by the UA and continue the diplomatic strategy of the previous regime?" he asked in a low voice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised.</br>
</br>
"Because I don't fu*king want to."</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 352: Refuse to Apologize</br>
</div></br>
The private military contractor was the legal term for mercenary, it was also a term that gave all the head of the states a headache, but they were unable to part away from it.</br>
</br>
They act ruthlessly and treat war like a business. To complete the mission, they could ignore international laws, disregard civilian casualties, toss aside any moral concerns, and complete the most challenging task using the lowest costing method. They have a despicable name, but their hirer would not need to burden their terrible reputation. They were more effective than an army.</br>
</br>
Talking about the mercenary, the UA must be mentioned here. There is no other country that has a better understanding of mercenaries than them. Similar to how only thugs could understand gangsters.</br>
</br>
From the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan, the reason why the black blood flowing among the steel parts could successfully move from Third World countries to the First World was that half the effort could be attributed to the lawless mercenaries.</br>
</br>
Not only on a battlefield, but in any area with politically unstable conditions, the UA's mercenary could be seen. As long as there was a need, the private military contract company would appear in place of the Pentagon. When it was not appropriate or inconvenient for them to appear, the contractor would carry out the military and foreign diplomat missions for the UA military. Even if it failed, they could deny any connections with the government. It was indeed more convenient compared to the marines because sending out ground force to another country would be a war activity, but not when it was a mercenary force.</br>
</br>
And the privatization of the military would bring serious implications to the world. It was an unrealistic hope to demand private mercenaries from following international law.</br>
</br>
In 2006, the UA shooting Iraq civilians brought massive commotion to the internet. But it was proved that the perpetrators were two military contractors from Clover Jungle. As to the reasons for committing the crime, it was absurd to the point where it was daunting. A colleague of the perpetrator confirmed that he said he was going to kill someone because he didn't hit anyone in Iraq.</br>
</br>
But regardless, the UA military dodged litigation with human rights group, because the killers were not enlisted soldiers.</br>
</br>
Although for the UA military had a despicable reputation to begin with, it was not a big deal.</br>
</br>
Right now, the international problem between Xin and F was the same.</br>
</br>
Disregarding the fishing boats that trespassed into the military zone, disregarding Ivan's "one-minute warning", which fit the standards of "effective warning", it was still undetermined internationally if the military actions of mercenaries should be considered an act of war.</br>
</br>
Then the problem arose. Xin hired private mercenaries for its national defense, and the private mercenary group executed according to the law and sunk the F country fishing boats disregarding the warning, is Xin really at wrong for this incident?</br>
</br>
</br>
Any country has the right to shoot trespassers of its military facility, but only a few countries would execute this right. The most humanitarian way was to remove the trespassers, or capture and deport them to avoid international conflict.</br>
</br>
Is there any country that executed this right? Of course, on July 11th of 2008, a South Korean tourist accidentally entered a military zone of North Korea and was shot on site by North Korean soldiers. Although North Korea was not wrong, unfortunately, the South Korean government immediately announced a restriction of all South Koreans from visiting North Korea.</br>
</br>
But what Xin faced was much less severe, because it was the private military contractor that sunk the fishing boats, not the Xin army.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin's newly formed cabinet must be praised for their work in handling emergency public relationship issues.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only had an order, it was to "Never compromise on territorial issues, never give in to the question of sovereignty, and never apologize for the lack of mistakes". However, the politicians ended up being the defenders of the policy internationally.</br>
</br>
Although Xin's defense minister had no troops to work with, he still offered constructive comments. For example, shifting the blame to solve the problem. Insisting that it was the Celestial Trade Company that sunk the ships and not the order of the department of national defense.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the responsibilities were blamed continuously on the other party.</br>
</br>
The situation dragged on for over half a month before Jiang Chen permitted the wreckage recovery process to begin.</br>
</br>
Although they didn't permit country F boats from entering the territory to assistant with the recovery process, Xin still invited some international media stations to participate to ensure the process was "just".</br>
</br>
But what shocked everyone was that there were assault rifles found on the F country's fish boats.</br>
</br>
As to why there were assault rifles on the fishing boats, the media teams all had varying opinions ranging from the fishermen being framed to they actually possessed those weapons. In the end, no consensus was formed.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the reckless acts of F fishermen near New Moon Island were organized and published, including several acts of intentionally sinking Xin fishing boats. The 50-minute documentary included a dictation from the son of the victim and documented records. It was published on a social media platform before Future 1.0's news platform transmitted the video to the world and attached to it a visible headline.</br>
</br>
&lt;Pirates or fishermen? The reckless acts of F country fishermen with the support of the government.&gt;</br>
</br>
The video was only published for a day before it surpassed ten million views. Other media stations all began to transmit the video as it caused massive controversy internationally. Almost all the opinions compassionate to country F turned into criticisms of country F's crimes.</br>
</br>
The F government immediately jumped out and blamed Future International for the lack of truth and exaggeration in the video, as well as the lack of neutrality a media should possess. They should not have a bias just because they have a construction contract with Xin.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the F country spokesperson demanded Future International immediately delete all associated comments and issue an apology.</br>
</br>
Would country F apologize to a bunch of monkeys? The answer was of course not.</br>
</br>
Future International issued a statement stating that the video did not represent the views of the company. Future 1.0 is only a platform and not the publisher of the video. Future International will not bear any responsibility. At the same time, Future International, with the justification of freedom of speech, refuse to delete the video and refuse to apologize.</br>
</br>
Although the action caused strong discontent from country F, it certainly gained the support of other parties.</br>
</br>
Because of this, Future International didn't suffer any losses but instead benefited from this dispute.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"You pigs!" Aquino cursed at the foreign minister of country F, "How many times do I have to say this, remain strong on the stance! Pressure their government! We have an army of one hundred and twenty thousand soldiers, that's more than six times their population!"</br>
</br>
"But president… we are already aggressive in our statements, some of the statements could even be viewed as an act of aggression, but they don't seem to be afraid of us," the foreign affair minister said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
Aquino paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Looks like it is time to teach them a lesson. These monkeys in the Pacific don't know any better," the defense minister said wickedly.</br>
</br>
"But the UA wants us to remain restrained on this issue. Excessive pressure may cause the neutral nation to lean towards Han," the foreign affair minister reminded.</br>
</br>
"But if we don't do anything, our citizens will be unhappy," the defense minister argued back.</br>
</br>
Aquino fell into deep thought as he debated the cabinet members' arguments.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a grimace look flashed through his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Mercenaries… Mercenaries, right, excellent."</br>
</br>
He already had an idea in his mind.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In this month, Xin was indeed in a turbulence of problems. Because of too many headlines originating from there, a lot of the press decided to send a reporter to the station to acquire first-hand information.</br>
</br>
Other than that, there were more tourists interested in exploring this not-yet-developed island out of curiosity. The streets of Coro Island were filled with tourists in backpacks.</br>
</br>
A country with only nine islands and a government that didn't control its armies - some of the far-thinking organizations even expressed that this was a jewel of a true democracy… The expression on the puppet president's face would certainly be interesting when he heard these words.</br>
</br>
The news was a form of advertisement -there weren't a lot of chances for the country to make headlines in the international section.</br>
</br>
Before that, no one had ever heard of Pannu Islands in the Pacific Ocean but following the recent series of events as well as Future International's role in purposely stirring up the conversation, a lot more people began to have an impression of the small Pacific country.</br>
</br>
Regardless if the impression was positive or not, it certainly paved the way for future marketing. Once the basic and tourism infrastructure completed development and the political situation stabilized, there certainly would be a crowd willing to come to the mystical island, enjoy the beauty of the west Pacific, and experience the unique culture.</br>
</br>
With the current rate of construction, the soonest they could be ready was within half a year, slowest within a year.</br>
</br>
The day wasn't far away.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
While Zhang Yapin had a headache to deal with, the perpetrator of everything, Jiang Chen, was enjoying his life. Although he promised he would take care of this, he only left Zhang Yapin with one clear instruction of never apologizing before he abandoned the issue.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen headed to New Moon Island for a few days and who knows what he did on the island.</br>
</br>
Regarding country F's potential impending revenge, he didn't seem to be concerned as the major shareholder. Zhang Yapin was unsure whether he was confident or just plain arrogant.</br>
</br>
From the perspective of the Xin president, he obviously wanted him to be the former.</br>
</br>
In the next few days, Jiang Chen spent his time on a boat around the islands. Of course, it wasn't for fun but rather, for business.</br>
</br>
Because of the ten billion dollar project, he became the largest real estate owner of Pannu with 110 square kilometers on the main island, 70 square kilometers on the other island in addition to the sea territory near the equator becoming part of his assets. Whether he would develop his territory personally or sell it to other people would all be based on his discretion.</br>
</br>
Of course, with this much land, he alone certainly wouldn't be able to develop it all. If left to its own devices, the land would only accumulate weeds. He toured all the land he owned in the past few days and decided how he should develop the land.</br>
</br>
</br>
After completing all this, there was also good news from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
After half a month of research and experimentation, the improved recipe of nutrient supply was successfully developed. When he heard the news from Lin Lin, he immediately returned to the apocalypse and took a helicopter to camp 27.</br>
</br>
When he arrived underground, he found the director of the research team in the empty fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"I heard you finished it?" When Jiang Chen saw the slim middle-aged man, he hastily jumped to the topic.</br>
</br>
Wang Fangpin looked at Jiang Chen in excitement as he quickly nodded his head.</br>
</br>
"We finished it - yesterday, we completed the trial process. It's hard to believe we did it; we previously thought we were just improving on the recipe, but we somehow made a technological breakthrough in the live cell preparation field."</br>
</br>
"Technological breakthrough?" Jiang Chen took a moment to digest this before his face turned to shock.</br>
</br>
In the apocalypse covered in ruins, it was a feat to replicate the technology from before the war, let alone make any technological breakthroughs. But now, Wang Fangpin told him that the research team managed to do just that.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Wang Fangpin nodded in excitement. "Following your requirements, to compress the production cost and improve the nutrient supply, we chose to use seaweed that has the most yield and shortest growth cycle. But when we were in the process of induced differentiation of the seaweed cells, surprisingly, we created a new type of seaweed."</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen was drawn into it.</br>
</br>
"A type of seaweed that can generate electricity!" Wang Fangpin said, ecstatic.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was truly stunned.</br>
</br>
Energy was always a critical priority in development, whether it was in the wasteland or the modern world. At the end of the 21st century of this world, biological power generation was the research priority of the three countries before there was a miraculous breakthrough in nuclear fusion power generation and before the first space elevator was built. It was only then that Hydrogen-3 was continually transported back to the earth to create the relatively cheap nuclear fusion battery. It cooled down the investment in biological power generation.</br>
</br>
One gram of hydrogen fusion generation created an equivalent power equal to the complete combustion of 11.2 tons of standard coal along with preserving the environment. Such a massive amount of energy was leagues ahead of other types of power generation techniques. Because of this, although other power generation methods all possessed the theoretical potential to develop further, no one conducted more research.</br>
</br>
But whether it was in the wasteland or in the modern world, renewable clean energy dominated the large market! Just like in Pannu Islands, since the area was designated as a tourist area, the coal-fired generation plant with relatively high pollution would not be built on the island. The island could only use the high cost and low-efficiency tidal power generation combined with solar power to meet the energy needs of the islands.</br>
</br>
But if this existed, the Pannu Islands' massive sea would provide Xin with an endless amount of energy! Xin would no longer need to worry about power.</br>
</br>
It was certainly a pleasant surprise to make a breakthrough in biotechnology during the nutrient supply recipe development process. Jiang Chen was astonished.</br>
</br>
"The seaweed cells during photosynthesis cause a special photographic effect, creating a trace amount of electricity within the content of the cell. Although the electricity of a single cell is negligible, it is substantial for an entire seaweed plant." Wang Fangpin began to explain the theory behind this type of seaweed. Although he explained it in simple terms, Jiang Chen was only interested in the last sentence.</br>
</br>
"What's the power generation amount per area?" Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask.</br>
</br>
"The current power generational efficiency is relatively low; it can only achieve 0.1 kilowatts per square meter. Most of the power is converted into heat, diffusing and increasing the temperature of the nearby water region, and there are also concerns about electricity diffusion under water. But with the prediction of the mathematical model, if all these problems are fixed, it would generate up to 1 kilowatt per square meter."</br>
</br>
"1 kilowatt per square meter!" Jiang Chen was again stunned.</br>
</br>
If it were solar generation, 10 kilowatts of energy would require 40 panels with an area approximately equivalent to 64 square meters. Therefore, the energy generation would equate to 0.15 kilowatt per square meter! The "biological generator" used solar energy, but its electricity generation was 6.6 times better than traditional solar panels!</br>
</br>
With the stunned look on Jiang Chen's face, Wang Fangpin was relieved.</br>
</br>
When they learned that there weren't a lot of nuclear fusion batteries on the surface and that the base primarily used solar panels for power generation, he immediately thought of the stagnated power generational technology at the end of the 21st century. He happened to be a scientist in biotechnology as his first idea was biological power generation.</br>
</br>
While the technology was yet to be completed, it wasn't a hard task to create it standing on top of the giant. Just like a math problem that couldn't be done by an elementary student could easily be solved in high school.</br>
</br>
Because of the disconnect between moon and earth, the outdated power generation technology again had its purpose.</br>
</br>
To be honest, their research team had completed the nutrient supply recipe five days ago. The reason why they chose to report their findings five days later was to research about seaweed power generation. It wasn't a coincidence that they discovered the cell, but rather the result of genetic modification. He was afraid of telling Jiang Chen because he feared this dictator would penalize them for using up excessive research resources and intentionally delaying the reporting of the research findings.</br>
</br>
Now that Jiang Chen was pleased with their research, he felt relieved.</br>
</br>
With this, because this topic gained the traction, there was hope to continue their research; they would no longer need to live back on the surface and suffer.</br>
</br>
But their concern was excessive, Jiang Chen didn't mind them doing "personal work," since their research all belonged to him in the end anyway.</br>
</br>
"You guys did a great job! Excellent, what rewards do you want?" Jiang Chen laughed as he patted Wang Fangpin on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"No need for rewards." Wang Fangpin shook his hands and smiled. "Just let us stay in the fallout shelter to continue our research. We have some achievements in the biological field."</br>
</br>
"I must reward you for your contribution to the base." Jiang Chen thought for a moment before he had an idea.</br>
</br>
"I have an idea. To reward you for your outstanding contribution to the base's energy problem, I will reward you five with the honor of "outstanding scholars," and a "knight emblem." From now on, you will be the knight class of the Fishbone base. Don't underestimate the outstanding scholar name; it would mean that you're permitted to freely enter and leave the fallout shelter without the permission of the camp leader. Even without working on this research project, you can live inside.</br>
</br>
Wang Fangpin was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, General!"</br>
</br>
He had no interest in becoming part of the knight class. He never visited the Fishbone base before nor did he want to. His only wish was to stay in the safe and comfortable fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"No need to thank me now, I will only grant you the honor after you complete the project." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Count on us, we'll definitely complete this project!" Wang Fangpin promised.</br>
</br>
"Then I will wait for your good news. Let's not talk about this anymore. Take me to see the improved nutrient supply."</br>
</br>
Seeing the nutrient supply was the priority of Jiang Chen's trip. The faster it was produced, the sooner he could make money. He didn't forget that he had thirty billion in debt.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 354: Nutrient Supply Plant</br>
</div></br>
Ange Island, located at the southern tip of Pannu Island near New Guinea, was the third largest island of Xin.</br>
</br>
The island was shaped like a pear and the mountain sat at the east end of the island while south of the mountain was the cliffs. The island was covered in dense vegetation with only the plains on the north side settled with people. The population of the island was 5372 in the municipality Ange City, the second largest city of Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
Although it was the second largest city after Coro Island, the economy of the island was still comprised of mostly fisheries along with sugar cane, banana and coconut plantations as the secondary industry. Regarding the crops and meat, the island relied on shipments from Australia's Darwin port. The island didn't possess a deep water harbor, but it had a harbor capable of docking vessels with a smaller displacement.</br>
</br>
For the residents of Ange Island, today marked the start of a new chapter.</br>
</br>
Why? Because after a month of construction, Future International's subsidiary, Future Biology, completed construction of their pharmaceutical and seaweed growth plant. But for the people of Ange Island, they were focused on the plan to hire locals.</br>
</br>
To Ange Island that had a history of a high unemployment rate, it was certainly great news.</br>
</br>
&lt;50 people with high school diplomas get a monthly salary of 1000 USD per month. 20 people with university degrees get a monthly salary of 1500 USD per month. The contract is signed for twenty years minimum. During this time, the employees must sign a confidentiality agreement and are not permitted to leave the job or the country. At the same time, employees will enjoy the luxury apartment provided by the company, along with a free medical insurance and pension plan…&gt;</br>
</br>
When the hiring information was posted, the entire island erupted in cheers.</br>
</br>
To the poor locals, the benefits of the job could be described as insane. They only made a max of 500 USD per month fishing, and the job was also tiring. Even if they didn't know what the job was like, it must be less tiring compared to fishing from morning to night.</br>
</br>
Not permitted to leave the job or the country? A lot of people didn't even leave the island for their entire life, let alone the country. They wanted the job to be longer, maybe for their whole life.</br>
</br>
Because of the high number of applicants, Future Biology added some additional requirements. For example, high school diploma holders had to know how to dive, drive a boat, be familiar with the sea product farming process, must be a local, and have a family. The first two requirements were a given since almost all the residents on the island lived alongside the sea for their entire life. Although the last two conditions were strange, they were certainly not unacceptable.</br>
</br>
After a rigorous selection process, Future Biology quickly hired 70 employees. With Jiang Chen's organization, everyone arrived at New Moon Island for training. The training was just an instructional video recorded at camp 27 with an examination afterwards.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
While the workers diligently studied the growing process they never learned before, Jiang Chen stood on the dock on the port at Ange Island as he waited for the boat in the distance to approach.</br>
</br>
To the person who came down from the boat, Jiang Chen greeted him with a smile and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Doctor Zhan."</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie, 31 years old, Medical student at Tsinghua University life science department majoring in molecular cell biology. He published five papers in the SCI and also published in the famous academic journal "Nature" in the scientific community.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen never minded an extensive amount of talents. To the top student graduating from Hua' s top university, Jiang Chen generously offered a salary of half a million USD per year.</br>
</br>
The young man wasn't tall and he wore a frameless glasses. Although he had a high academic profile as a doctor, he didn't have the "Confucius arrogance" typical of a lot of top students. He looked like someone easy to get along with.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang." Zhan Shujie smiled and warmly held onto Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
Regarding the legendary individual who achieved a net asset of over ten billion by just the age of 23, Zhan Shujie had heard tales of him before. Previously, he thought this boss would be somewhat prideful, but he was actually easy to talk to which made him quite impressed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, let's cut the flattering words. Do you need me to take to where you'll be living?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"No need, I want to first take a tour of the … pharmaceutical plant, is that okay?"</br>
</br>
When he talked about the pharmaceutical plant, his eyes were flashed with fervor.</br>
</br>
"Of course, as you wish. This car will belong to you from now on, and this is the driver." Jiang Chen sat back into the car.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade's bodyguard was the driver and he was injected with E-grade genetic vaccine. Whether in armed combat or just close body combat, he met the standards of the special force. As the driver of doctor Zhan Shujie, his job was to protect his safety and monitor him.</br>
</br>
Since what Zhan Shujie would present to the world would shock the entire world, he already signed a confidentiality agreement, but just in case, it was better to be safe.</br>
</br>
The car soon arrived at Future Biology's pharmaceutical plant. At the top of the structure inside the wall, Zhan Shujie saw the name of the plant.</br>
</br>
&lt;Future Biology Nutrient Supply Plant&gt;</br>
</br>
[Nutrient supply? That's an interesting name…] Zhan Shujie muttered to himself despite reading about the company before he came.</br>
</br>
The two security guards on duty at the pharmaceutical plant were also from Celestial Trade. They wore carbon nano-injected bulletproof vests with Reaper Assault Rifles and tactical helmets.</br>
</br>
"Is it not safe here?" Zhan Shujie anxiously looked at the two soldiers as he said, worried.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, it's extremely safe here. But just in case, I hired two security personnel to protect the safety of the employees and to also protect the security of the high tech equipment inside.</br>
</br>
When they got off the car and walked into the plant, the soldiers at the door subconsciously wanted to salute to Jiang Chen, but Jiang Chen stopped them with a look.</br>
</br>
They walked to the empty ground of the plant as Jiang Chen first pointed at the direction near the coast.</br>
</br>
"The plant is a seaweed farm, used to breed our company-developed DH-type seaweed. This seaweed is derived from the induction of the differentiation of Sargassum, which can produce and accumulate a variety of animal proteins in seaweed cells-"</br>
</br>
"That's impossible!" Zhan Shujie was stunned as he looked at Jiang Chen skeptically. "As far as I know, in the field of the preparation of plants for animal protein, Hokkaido University in Japan is currently at the forefront of the field. But they are only able to do it with the production of a plant to produce interfering hepatitis virus protein animal protein and they're only in the experimental stage. Also, I've never heard that someone could use a plant to produce a variety of animal protein! Also, seaweed cells aren't embryonic liver cells, so how could the orientation-induced technique work? In theory, this wouldn't work!"</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie blasted at Jiang Chen, while Jiang Chen tilted his head and shook his finger to show off.</br>
</br>
"Nothing is impossible, especially in my company. If you don't believe me, just take a sample yourself."</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie looked at Jiang Chen still with skepticism and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll believe it once I see it. But I have another question: growing the new species with the open environment - would that affect the biological sphere of the nearby sea?</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen shook his head. "Since it's induced differentiation, the genes of this DH seaweed still belong to Sargassum, so the spores produced by the progeny are also Sargassum. The telomeres of this DH-type seaweed are precisely targeted like cancer cells, which are theoretically infinite. The task of workers is to feed nutrients every day, then trim the 'leaves.'</br>
</br>
This was what the researchers at the fallout shelter told him, and he didn't have the knowledge to explain much further, so Jiang Chen changed the topic and pointed at the structure the size of three basketball fields.</br>
</br>
"The key equipment is inside. Your work is to coordinate the entire pharmaceutical plant's production, take samples to examine if the DH seaweed is thriving, and take samples to ensure the quality of the nutrient supply… Of course, all of the details are in the work manual. I will give you a USB and the videos on it will teach you how to control the equipment inside the plant. If there are any problems you can't solve, please contact me."</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen spoke, he took Zhan Shujie inside the pharmaceutical plant and pointed at the machine in the center.</br>
</br>
"This is it - the production line of nutrient supply, the core of the entire plant."</br>
</br>
On the left was the organic converter with the shape of a cylinder; it could extract nutrients from the specially produced seaweed to process into the nutrient supply. On the right hand was an assembly for bottling as it would place the extract into coin-shaped plastic tubes before they were sealed.</br>
</br>
Regarding this set of equipment, Zhan Shujie didn't seem to be too interested, but regarding the organic converter, it completely drew all his attention.</br>
</br>
"The molecular filter from the legend is inside this machine?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, not from the legend. Our company's molecular orientation screening technology is mature. The molecular filter is only one of the parts of the organic converter - there are also other devices inside." Jiang Chen came up with an elaborate story.</br>
</br>
"What else?" The fervent passion once again appeared on Zhan Shujie's face.</br>
</br>
It was the zeal a scientist possessed when he wanted to learn about a technology he didn't know about.</br>
</br>
"Trade secret," Jiang Chen said straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie paused for a moment as he realized that he was overzealous, so he apologized, "Sorry, I got too excited."</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I understand how you feel," Jiang Chen said gently.</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie walked in front of the organic converter as he put his hand on the cold steel. He exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Hard to believe… that this breakthrough technology will first be used in the civil field to produce a drink. This… this is a waste of God-given technology."</br>
</br>
To be honest, two reasons drew him here. The half a million salary and the technology Future Biology said they possessed.</br>
</br>
Plant cell orientation induced differentiation could produce a variety of animal protein algae. High-precision molecular screening technology - any of technology here - could contend for the Nobel prize.</br>
</br>
But this guy wanted to use these to produce a drink?</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 355"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 355: Trade Secret</br>
</div></br>
"Ahem, let me clarify. This isn't a drink - it's a type of healthy food that can allow you to lose weight," Jiang Chen reminded Zhan Shujie.</br>
</br>
It was disrespectful to call the era-breaking liquid food a drink. This was the standard military food in the 22nd century. Not only was it used in the military, the liquid food was also used extensively in the aerospace field. To bring as much food as possible within the allocated space, the nutrient supply was undoubtedly the first choice for all astronauts…</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didn't deny the ridicule of Zhan Shujie stating it was a waste of God-given technology. Regardless, right now, he only planned to sell this as weight loss medicine.</br>
</br>
"Is there a difference?" Zhan Youjie stared at Jiang Chen emotionally. His persona as a non-talkative researcher faded as he almost spoke to Jiang Chen with a lecturing tone, "Let's disregard everything else. Just the seaweed cell directed differentiation technology - do you know how it would shake up the scientific field? Without any exaggeration, it would cause an earthquake in the biology academic world!"</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie let out a sigh. "And that molecular filter. While I'm not studying organic chemistry, I can't say much but I can be certain of one point - if our university lab had this, our ability to research in the chemistry field would increase substantially!"</br>
</br>
"So?" Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Zhan Shujie was dumbfounded before he realized.</br>
</br>
Even though he said that much, so what?</br>
</br>
It belonged to him, and if the Xin government permitted the technology to exist in a private establishment's hands, everyone could take the technology away from him.</br>
</br>
"I'm only a businessman, and you are my employee. You just need to remember this point. Since this technology belongs to me, I have the rights to decide where I should use it," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
If the technology became public, it would undoubtedly cause unnecessary trouble. Therefore, in terms of production, Jiang Chen planned to keep the technology low-key. From the outside, the plant was only growing a type of Sargassum, and the pharmaceutical plant would process the Sargassum.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Zhan Shujie said helplessly.</br>
</br>
Considering how disappointed Zhan Shujie looked, Jiang Chen walked up and patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Don't be disappointed; if you work diligently, maybe I will permit you to learn more about the top technology."</br>
</br>
"Hopefully, one day that will happen... If I want to study the structure of the DH seaweed cell, would you mind?" Zhan Shujie looked at Jiang Chen keenly.</br>
</br>
"Of course not. I'll even sponsor you to build a lab here. Of course, this is on the condition that you follow the rules of the company and not take a single cell out of that door." Although he used a joking tone to say these words, he didn't look like he was joking at all.</br>
</br>
</br>
The two soldiers at the door were there to prevent thieves, both inside and outside.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I'm only curious about how plant cells produce animal proteins. I can guarantee with my morale that I won't disclose what I see to any third parties," Zhan Shujie said.</br>
</br>
"I trust you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had no qualms about allowing Zhan Shujie to study it since it was impossible to reproduce it with current technological capabilities. Just like how no matter how much you observed the cells inside you, you could not produce them at will.</br>
</br>
"Thank you. If I can't understand how it works, I might even lose sleep at night." Zhan Shujie looked at Jiang Chen graciously.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I hope you can sleep well at night… Also, don't research during work hours."</br>
</br>
"I will do it outside of work."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, pleased. He hired people to work for him, not research the technology he possessed. Of course, if Doctor Zhan could achieve some inspiration from the research, it would still be beneficial to Jiang Chen. Since he signed the confidentiality agreement, Jiang Chen would not let him walk.</br>
</br>
After he took Zhan Shujie to the seaside mansion he would be living in, Jiang Chen spoke a few more words before he left.</br>
</br>
Currently, Future Biology was only an empty shell. Although the pharmaceutical plant was completed, the team responsible for marketing, strategy, and management had yet to be established. All this had to be finished. Although he could contract the work out to headhunters, he wanted to hire the individuals personally.</br>
</br>
Of course, if he left the work to Xia Shiyu, he knew she would take it. But it wasn't nice, especially since she had a lot on her plate already with Future Technology. If he gave her something entirely unrelated to a tech company, he was afraid that she might be overworked.</br>
</br>
He took his private boat back to Coro island and returned to the mansion that previously belonged to Johnny.</br>
</br>
When he purchased the mansion from the auction, the blood on the wall was already cleaned. The furniture was also replaced and the daunting bullet holes were filled in. Just from the appearance alone, the signs of a violent battle previously fought there were non-existent.</br>
</br>
Since it was a "haunted house" with people dead inside, out of filial respect, Jiang Chen would not make his parents live inside. But as a non-spiritual believer, Jiang Chen didn't mind making this mansion his own. At least until the mansion on New Moon Island was finished, he would live here.</br>
</br>
Then after the mansion on New Moon Island was completed… It wasn't a terrible decision to make this place into the "Xin Revolution Museum" and fool some tourists.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen walked into the kitchen, Ayesha was cooking fish with an apron wrapped around her.</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on Ayesha's usually expressionless face when she heard the footsteps from the door. Without turning her head, she said, "You're back."</br>
</br>
With the delicious smell of the dishes, all his worries were swept away as he approached the pot, drooling.</br>
</br>
"Looks like today is going to be a great meal."</br>
</br>
"It'll be done soon." Ayesha stirred the flavorful, thick soup with a spoon. The tip of her mouth curved up as she said tenderly, "I learned this from aunt Li. She said you really like to drink fish soup, so I wanted to try to make it."</br>
</br>
"I miss the taste." Jiang Chen looked at the white fog rising as he exclaimed.</br>
</br>
He remembered when he was young, his father occasionally went fishing with his coworkers and his family would drink fish soup for two days. Now that he had money, he ate a lot of extravagant food, but this nostalgic feeling was hard to come by these days.</br>
</br>
&lt;The taste of freshwater fish and sea fish should be different… &gt; Jiang Chen stared at the pot of soup as his mind drifted off.</br>
</br>
"If you like it, I can cook it for you every day," Ayesha said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha…"</br>
</br>
Touched by her gentleness, Jiang Chen hugged her from behind.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Ayesha closed her eyes as she felt the warmness on her back.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen first just wanted to hug her, but he started to feel aroused as soon he touched her body.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's face began to heat up as she felt the naughty hands wandering around her body. She turned around and rolled her eyes before she put down the spoon and set the heat to low.</br>
</br>
Although she acted timidly on the outside, when it was just the two of them, her passion was no less than Sun Jiao's.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was prepared to investigate her body, the phone rang.</br>
</br>
The intimate atmosphere suddenly cooled off.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen awkwardly took out his phone and prepared to pick up.</br>
</br>
But Ayesha snatched the phone, threw it in the fruit basket then kissed Jiang Chen and pressed him against the fridge.</br>
</br>
Just like a naughty sheep falling into the arms of the big bad wolf.</br>
</br>
The temperature began to rise again.</br>
</br>
The phone rang and rang…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 356: Unknown Militants</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Right now, inside the New Moon Island command center, the light on the screen flashed while ten workers busily worked in front of the computer. On the big screen of the command center was a vessel with 400 tons of displacement. It had no flags and just a few people were on deck.</br>
</br>
It was the image captured by the hummingbird drone.</br>
</br>
Based on the analysis, the destination of the vessel was Xin's New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
A month ago, Jiang Chen set up a Wide Range Life Signal Detector on the island to monitor the life signals within a 500 kilometer radius. The device was certainly useful in a sea territory. If it were set to the life signals of the fish, no fish would escape this device. The same would go for any human if it was set to detect humans.</br>
</br>
Since the technology was already mature on the wasteland, it wasn't hard for the Fishbone workers to assemble an enhanced version. It was easy to censor one's signal as a chip inside the EP could do the job. However, in the modern world, no one would escape the eyes of this device.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the technology widely used in the 22nd century for search and rescue became radar technology for Jiang Chen. As long as it wasn't drones, no living creature would escape its eyes.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes ago, the radar station detected the information of this vessel. It was a transportation vessel, but they caught the signal of one hundred people onboard.</br>
</br>
During this sensitive period of time, any of the vessels near their territory would be monitored.</br>
</br>
When the vessel was still 50 kilometers away from the border, after confirming that the vessel wasn't traveling through a standard international route, the soldiers at the command center first determined that the vessel may be smuggling goods, so they immediately contacted the patrol boat in the nearby territory and approached the ship.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes later, the vessel entered Xin's border. Then it adjusted its course and headed straight to New Moon Island under the cover of darkness.</br>
</br>
The patrol boat approached the vessel four kilometers away and attempted to enter the radio channel of the vessel. However, the vessel entered radio silence and ignored all communication attempts. The patrol boat, realizing the oddity of the situation, did not take the risk of approaching the boat but instead, released hummingbird drones.</br>
</br>
Under the night's veil, the drones flew across the ocean surface, approached the vessel suspected of smuggling, and entered the vessel.</br>
</br>
The image transmitted back shocked the entire command center!</br>
</br>
The boat didn't contain smugglers, but instead, fully equipped soldiers! The disguised sailors on deck were all equipped with pistols and wore bulletproof vests.</br>
</br>
There were a total of 100 unknown militants.</br>
</br>
The vessel was also equipped with landing boats and other military equipment. Other than the lack of country identification, it was a force no inferior to an actual army.</br>
</br>
</br>
Realizing the oddity of the situation, Ivan immediately ordered New Moon Island to enter combat ready state. All soldiers were fully equipped and gathered at the airway, waiting for the order.</br>
</br>
Barkary put down the phone and looked anxiously at Ivan.</br>
</br>
"Boss isn't picking up."</br>
</br>
He couldn't reach Jiang Chen. With Jiang Chen's C-grade genetic vaccine improved body, it would take at least one hour before he "finished."</br>
</br>
Ivan silently looked at the screen in the command center. The vessel was approaching New Moon Island at high speeds. There was only two hundred kilometers of distance between the enemy and the island. It only took a moment before they were 80 kilometers inside the border.</br>
</br>
Judging by the situation at hand, they came with not the friendliest intentions.</br>
</br>
"The boss is purposely not picking up." Ivan seemed to have understood something as he told Barkary in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Purposely not picking up? Why?" The black young man was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Boss provided us with the most advanced equipment and told us how to handle the situation. If we cannot even handle this small problem and have to call him every time, then I am not fit for the job of a commander." Ivan adjusted his hat as his stare on the vessel in the screen became more determined.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The rumbling sound of helicopters breaking through the sea waves roared. Four black shadows forming into an arrow formation headed to the vessel trespassing illegally.</br>
</br>
Four lights shined from afar and lit up the deck of the vessel. When they realized they were discovered, the crew on deck all hid behind containers.</br>
</br>
With their reaction speed, their opponents were no ordinary men.</br>
</br>
"No.0371 vessel. No.0371 vessel. We are the coastal guard of Celestial Trade. We suspect your vessel contains illegal goods. Please immediately stop and cooperate with the search. I repeat. Please immediately stop and cooperate with the search."</br>
</br>
The four helicopters all opened the channel and broadcasted to the vessel.</br>
</br>
But the vessel seemed like it didn't hear anything as they continued to maintain their course.</br>
</br>
At the same time, inside the captain's room of the vessel:</br>
</br>
"How is that possible? We closed all radio devices on board - how could they discover us 200 kilometers away?!" Captain Santos smashed the table.</br>
</br>
Sitting across him was country F Lieutenant, Kluse. He remained silent.</br>
</br>
Half a month ago, they retired from their previous positions with the direction of the defense minister to enter the disguised mercenary force. Their mission was to execute a secret military mission named "Revenge" to punish the criminals who sunk the fishing boats.</br>
</br>
The political purpose of the mission was to demonstrate country F's firm stance to the public. They pretended to be mercenaries to avoid the possible foreign affair problem that could arise by sending the actual army of country F.</br>
</br>
In theory, the mission should not be difficult. The opponent was only a privately held security company. There was no way their combat abilities could surpass the elite soldiers who participated in joint military exercises. Based on the satellite image, although artillery bases were built on the island, no advanced artilleries were installed.</br>
</br>
Approach the island, stop the vessel, drop the landing boats, attack, retreat…</br>
</br>
With their plan, before the sun rose, they would escape at the port of MLL Island and receive the recognition and praise from the defense minister.</br>
</br>
"Someone leaked the mission details?" Kluse remained calm as he looked at the four bright dots with eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
200 kilometers distance.</br>
</br>
Even if the UA Aegis aircraft carrier used its array radar, it could only detect within a radius of 40 km without any blind spots. It wasn't a technical limitation, but due to the curvature of the earth, it was as difficult to detect a boat in the sea 200 kilometers away as pinpointing a piece of gold from the desert.</br>
</br>
Early warning aircraft? That's even more impossible. No country would sell it, especially to a private security company.</br>
</br>
"What do we do?" The captain remained cool.</br>
</br>
"Leave it up to me."</br>
</br>
Kluse picked up the assault rifle leaning on the table. With a wicked smile, he moved his neck and stretched his body before he headed out.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 357: Battle on the Vessel</br>
</div></br>
</br>
As the captain of this interception mission, Wilson stared at the disobedient vessel as gloom shadowed his face.</br>
</br>
"No response," The deputy command said concisely and closed the broadcast outside of the helicopter.</br>
</br>
"Prepare to drop the seal team."</br>
</br>
"Roger… Wait, what is that?"</br>
</br>
A few sailor-looking people ran in front of a container, pushed down the metal plate of the container, dragged out an anti-air machine gun with a belt on the bottom.</br>
</br>
"It's an anti-air machine gun! " The soldier sitting at the hatch of the Black Eagle yelled. At the same time, he raised the Reaper Assault Rifle and began to shoot at the deck. But because of the sea wind and far distance, it didn't hit anything.</br>
</br>
"Stop! Disperse formation! Immediately!" Wilson roared into the radio.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The four Black Eagle helicopters immediately ascended up to stop the forward motion and dispersed their formation.</br>
</br>
The two anti-air machine guns were set up and began to unleash its furious firepower at the four Black Eagles surrounding the vessel.</br>
</br>
But because of Wilson preemptively adjusted distance, the furious firepower didn't cause any injury to Celestial Trade. The bullets flew over a thousand meters, losing its destructive power as it only left a trail of tiny dents on the Black Eagles. Its only purpose was to push the four helicopters three kilometers out.</br>
</br>
"Weak!"</br>
</br>
The country F soldiers cursed, dragged up the cartridge, and inserted a new belt of bullets inside.</br>
</br>
[Only a bunch of monkeys on the Pacific, and you dare to challenge us? Even Hua would have to respect us; you don't know your limit at all!]</br>
</br>
The soldier spat on the deck as he looked at the four bright spots in the distance before he aimed the machine guns again.</br>
</br>
Although they retreated, the target of the helicopters remained locked on the vessel. Immediately 12 figures from the four helicopters jumped into the ocean. Soldiers wearing the K1-b type kinetic skeleton dived into the sea, opened their thrust, and transformed into twelve arrays of white bubbles.</br>
</br>
At the same time.</br>
</br>
Under the veil of nightfall, no one noticed.</br>
</br>
"Did they run away?" A country F soldier holding an assault rifle leaned against the container and grinned at his comrade.</br>
</br>
"Haha, what would they do if they don't run? Be a target for us? Give me a cigarette…" While he said this, another soldier took out a pack of cigarette and handed him one.</br>
</br>
"Feels wet." He cursed and lit up one for himself and one for his comrade.</br>
</br>
At the same time, an unusual buzzing sound began to ring around the two.</br>
</br>
"What is it-"</br>
</br>
Tatata-!</br>
</br>
The bullets left a trail of holes on the two's body.</br>
</br>
The rifles dropped as four drones weaved through in the night. While they maintained their high speed, the machine gun underneath spat out bullets and unleashed its fury to the militants on deck.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Area secured!"</br>
</br>
"Board the vessel."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Hooks hooked onto the edge of the vessel. With the cover fire of the hummingbird drones, twelve soldiers in amphibious kinetic armor immediately boarded the vessel and quickly ran to the back of the containers to secure a corner of the vessel. They began exchanging fire with the militants on the other side.</br>
</br>
"It's the seal team of Xin! Take them down!" A country F soldier disguised as a mercenary crawled behind cover. He shouted while firing back with his rifle.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! What is that- ahhh!"</br>
</br>
The drones freely weaved on the deck as it blended into the night sky. It would dash out from any angle and reap the lives on deck.</br>
</br>
"Dam*it, what are these things!" Kluse fired with his rifle; he gritted his teeth.</br>
</br>
The light from the firing shined onto his distorted face. He didn't have the confidence he had before, only intense fear remained.</br>
</br>
The plate-sized drones not only flew at the speed of a fly; it could also fire?! He had seen a lot of advanced technology from the joint military exercises, but he had never seen such terrifying drones. He swore, not even the UA possessed this.</br>
</br>
It only took a while before ten something F soldiers fell down in pools of blood, but only two or three drones were shot down. They had never encountered such a lopsided battle.</br>
</br>
"Push the machineguns onto the deck! Use heavy weapons!" Afraid of more seals boarding, Kluse yelled into the earpiece as the battle entered turmoil.</br>
</br>
"Roger!" A soldier roared while he lowered his body and ran to the back.</br>
</br>
Soon after, the anti-air machine guns were pushed onto the deck. The metal plate in the front blocked the incoming bullets. The machine gunner with a menacing laugh began firing at Xin soldiers in the distance.</br>
</br>
The bullets shredded the metal containers and suppressed the Xin soldiers from moving forward. Their success was short-lived as a rocket flew up. Like an iron fist, it sent the anti-air machine gun into the sky. Along with it, was the unlucky machine gunner.</br>
</br>
Kluse stared at the sky engulfed in flame, his eyes widened in disbelief.</br>
</br>
These seals brought rocket launchers!</br>
</br>
Kluse regained his attention from the shock and shouted into the radio… "Quick, move the machine guns back!"</br>
</br>
But it was too late, another rocket blew the other machine gun into pieces.</br>
</br>
Their anti-air power was destroyed. The four Black Eagles began to push forward.</br>
</br>
The pitch black muzzles extended from the side of the helicopter. The arm-thick bullets fired from the side. The firepower from the sky revealed the militants hidden behind the containers as the F soldiers all dropped dead.</br>
</br>
With cover fire, the twelve soldiers first boarded stood up behind cover while they maintained their shooting position and pushed forward. They would make sure the remaining militants were finished off. As to the bullets, most were blocked by the polyethylene board.</br>
</br>
With the assistance of the drones, the militants had no fighting chance.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh-! Fu*k, my hand!" Kluse rolled inside the boat. He covered his broken right hand with his left hand. He tumbled and retreated to the bottom of the vessel.</br>
</br>
After confirming all enemy units were cleared on the deck, the soldiers entered the control room to stop the vessel. At the same time, the Black Eagles hovered above the deck as the ground force descended.</br>
</br>
Thirty two Celestial soldiers quickly entered the vessel. Wilson entered the control room and used the broadcasting system to speak to the resisting militants.</br>
</br>
Surrender or die.</br>
</br>
The one-sided battle made all the F soldiers lose their courage to fight. When they reached 50% casualties, they finally collapsed and dropped the rifles in their hands and chose to surrender.</br>
</br>
Everyone was tied up and sent back to the deck. They waited with guns pointed at them.</br>
</br>
The vessel continued its journey to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
But this time, the F soldiers disguised as mercenaries no longer had their original arrogance, the only emotions left were fear and despair.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
No secret can't be uncovered using a single truth-telling serum. If there was, then two truth-telling serums would suffice.</br>
</br>
The F soldiers were also certainly not soft, especially Kluse who has lost one of his hand. He kept his mouth shut about this throughout, but with the truth-telling serum, mental fortitude was useless.</br>
</br>
Celebrate the glory of technology.</br>
</br>
41 F soldiers were captured, and 59 soldiers died in the crossfire. Ivan treated the execution of this mission carefully. Not only did he leave radio communication records, but he also recorded the entire duration of the second warning. Then the subsequent resist to cooperate, and the firing of anti-air machine guns was recorded by the cameras on the helicopters.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was extremely pleased with the way Ivan handled the situation. He needed a commander that would make the "correct judgment" in critical moments like this, rather than a follower that required his direction with any small problems. Sinking the boat that ignored their warnings was the command Jiang Chen had ordered when the Life Signal Radar was established.</br>
</br>
All in all, all the evidence were there.</br>
</br>
Xin had the complete upper hand in the public's opinion.</br>
</br>
There was media coverage on F soldiers pretending to be fishermen, but it was the first time they pretended to be mercenaries to conduct military action against other countries. What made it worse was that they were foolish enough to get caught.</br>
</br>
The international community spurred drastic reactions, including Hua. Multiple governments all denounced country F for their unruly actions and the violation of international law. They stated that they would continue to follow the event closely.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, President Aquino and the defense minister continued to state that they were being framed by Xin. But following the release of 41 pleading guilty videos, along with the protest of the families from the 41 soldiers who had survived, the F government completely went mute.</br>
</br>
The evidence was all out there, it was futile to defend themselves.</br>
</br>
Followed by the tradition of the country, they just would not admit to their actions. But Xin had said that if country F does not give a satisfactory response, Xin will sentence all soldiers who had trespassed or made unlawful entrances into the country to over thirty years in prison.</br>
</br>
This forced Aquino into a corner.</br>
</br>
Continuing to not admit to being guilty, their soldiers definitely would not be able to return home which meant that their families would be unhappy. But to apologize and plead to the Xin government to release the soldiers, Aquino didn't want to lose his face.</br>
</br>
The diplomatic relationship between the two countries entered a turmoil.</br>
</br>
But regardless who looked at it, in this round of exchanges, Xin had the complete upper hand.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In the mansion on Coro Island, Zhang Yapin stood across from Jiang Chen on the sofa. Ayesha poured them water before leaving the living room.</br>
</br>
Perhaps he was thirsty, Zhang Yapin took a sip of the water before he put the cup down.</br>
</br>
"I have to thank you for making me so famous internationally."</br>
</br>
"No worries." The oblivious Jiang Chen didn't grasp his sarcasm.</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, I should worry about it. You killed 59 people this time. If they were not on the wrong side this time, I would be summoned to international court already."</br>
</br>
"Haha, I realize you've become much more humorous." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Making the best out of a worse situation." Zhang Yapin revealed a helpless expression.</br>
</br>
"Okay, don't pretend to be so overdramatic. This event is great for you," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"In what way?" Zhang Yapin laughed.</br>
</br>
"At least you don't have to worry about elections anymore." Jiang Chen crossed his legs as he sunk into the sofa. Then he yawned. "I don't understand much about politics, but after reading so many news articles, I have learned one rule."</br>
</br>
"What's the rule?" Zhang Yapin ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"To increase support, strong foreign policy is much better than economic growth."</br>
</br>
"Isn't that obvious." Zhang Yapin grinned. He initially thought Jiang Chen had a differing perspective, but what he said was common sense.</br>
</br>
'Oh? Looks like I accidentally discovered a principle in international relations?" Jiang Chen laughed proudly.</br>
</br>
It was a bit tough on him to learn about managing a country as a mechanical engineer. To be honest, Jiang Chen has thought about becoming the president. But after careful consideration, he gave up on the idea.</br>
</br>
If he was really to become the president, he had a feeling he would turn the modern world into another apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The hidden figure was more suitable for him.</br>
</br>
"It's still too early to say election, who knows what will happen in five years."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, even if you don't have enough votes by that time, I will help you to become re-elected," Jiang Chen took a sip of his tea and said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin raised his eyebrows but didn't say anything. Although he personally despised these unlawful actions, they were beneficial for him after all. After feeling conflicted, he remained silent.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at the clock in the living room. When he saw it was getting late, he said, "Are you here to complain to me about this?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not," Zhang Yapin took out a piece of folded paper from his pocket, "I am here to talk about compensation. A total of 976 families were effected totaling 2115 people. Among them, a fair number of people lost their only home. They are currently residing in their friends' or relatives' place.</br>
</br>
Objectively speaking, president Zhang was unquestionably a great president. Even in a puppet regime, he still worked for the betterment of the citizens.</br>
</br>
"10% of the people are affected? That's a big problem. Let me think…" Jiang Chen scratched his chin.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin quietly looked at Jiang Chen. He gulped and waited for his response.</br>
</br>
"How about this. Provide me with detailed information about the people registered to receive compensation. To the people that lost their home, every family will be compensated with an apartment the size of 120 square meters and the land will be compensated at 50 USD per square meter. For the people who lost their farming land, they will be compensated at 10 USD per square meter and be prioritized in the hiring process. What do you think about this compensation?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin's eyes widened, but he had to remind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Every family will be compensated with an apartment 120 square meters? What if someone lived in a 90 square meters apartment?"</br>
</br>
"Then they will thank me." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin was amazed by Jiang Chen's words.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath and expressed his gratitude sincerely.</br>
</br>
"…Okay, allow me on behalf of Xin's citizens to thank you for your generosity."</br>
</br>
"No need."</br>
</br>
The reason why he was generous was not that he was a philanthropist, but he had other plans.</br>
</br>
The distribution of the Pannu population was extremely uneven on the nine islands. Most of the people were concentrated in the relatively developed Coro and Ange City. The remaining seven islands had a large habitable area, but the population was extremely scarce. Ten square kilometers of land had less than one hundred people inhibiting it. A store couldn't even thrive, let alone boosting the economy. This move was to reallocate the population density. These new apartments will not be built on Coro and Ange Island.</br>
</br>
As to the cost, it was not high to begin with.</br>
</br>
With an eight-floor high apartment building and eight units per floor, there would be 64 units in the entire building. Even with 1000 families, only16 buildings would need to be built. With the land price and tax being negligible, the average cost of each building would be one hundred thousand USD. It was nothing compared to Jiang Chen's assets.</br>
</br>
Also, he would gain a good reputation because of it, so why not?</br>
</br>
"Speaking of prioritizing the hiring process, does your company have any positions available?" Zhang Yapin continued.</br>
</br>
"After the tourism facility is complete, it is expected to bring eighty thousand jobs here. Let alone lack of positions, I don't think the population here will be enough. Mhmm… Speaking of this, study the possibility of immigration and decide when to open the doors for that."</br>
</br>
"Xin is currently politically unstable. No one would want to come here," Zhang Yapin said bitterly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only smiled.</br>
</br>
"That might not be true. Trust me, in less than five years. This place will become a destination the world longs for. A new land directed by Xin."</br>
</br>
"I have to remind you, this place is only a series of islands."</br>
</br>
"Only for now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen emphasized the word "now".</br>

&lt;The devil that cries war? Xin may be the disruptor of regional stability&gt; - Economic News</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
There were at least ten newspapers on Jiang Chen's table, each displaying an interesting perspective. Especially the Economic News, they did a close up of Zhang Yapin's distorted face. Jiang Chen wondered what he would think when he saw the image.</br>
</br>
As to the narratives… Some remain neutral, some turned the topic domestic, some favored a certain country while others disagreed. Of course, all the opinions were within Jiang Chen's expectation. Since something like this happened, country F would be more cautious. As to how this foreign relationship problem should be handled, and how they would use the international court platform as well as the 41 captives to scam country F, it was president Zhang's worry.</br>
</br>
The door was knocked on gently.</br>
</br>
"Come in," Jiang Chen said as he threw the newspapers into the corner.</br>
</br>
Ayesha in a maid uniform walked in and put coffee in front of Jiang Chen's table. The white lace skirt, as well as the absolute territory hidden underneath the skirt, made Jiang Chen feel a bit thirsty.</br>
</br>
The reason why she wore this was not because it was Jiang Chen's fetish, but purely because Ayesha wanted to.</br>
</br>
That's right, it was her hobby.</br>
</br>
Since they returned from Kane, Ayesha developed a keen passion for pretty clothes. But because of her traditional perspective, she was unwilling to wear revealing clothes in front of other people. So the five full closets became her "pajamas" and when there was no one home, Ayesha's choice of clothing became "odd".</br>
</br>
The maid uniform was okay, but sometimes she would wear a bikini to do chores, and wear only an apron to cook…</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen took the coffee.</br>
</br>
Ayesha smiled back. Walking behind Jiang Chen, she gently massaged his shoulders.</br>
</br>
"You're working every day, take a break once in a while."</br>
</br>
"Once everything is on track, I will be free." Jiang Chen put the cup down after taking a sip of his coffee, closed his eyes, and enjoyed Ayesha's massage.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… Only if I could help you," Ayesha said with slight disappointment.</br>
</br>
In her mind, she always thought women like Xia Shiyu was more ideal for Jiang Chen. Not only could she help him with his business, but her looks were also more suited to Asia's beauty standard. But her, other than the ability to kill as well as the apathy towards life, she had no other abilities.</br>
</br>
</br>
This was the reason why she wanted to drag Xia Shiyu to Jiang Chen's pillow side…</br>
</br>
"What are you saying? You have helped me a lot," Jiang Chen denied her statement without hesitation.</br>
</br>
Ayesha didn't respond, but from her gentle smile, it looked like she was comforted.</br>
</br>
"I am planning to head to Australia at noon, do you want to come along?"</br>
</br>
When she heard that Jiang Chen planned on taking her with him during this trip, Ayesha happily curled up her lips.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Let me go change."</br>
</br>
She then turned around and left.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Steel is the foundation of the industrial industry, even in the highly advanced 22nd century.</br>
</br>
To develop industrial capability, raw materials were necessary. But the limitation of the wasteland's industrial capability was precisely the scarcity of raw materials. Although they could obtain aluminum, copper, iron, as well as other rare metals through recycling, the highly processed nature of the raw materials was not only cumbersome but was also costly. It was for this reason that the power armors had such a high cost. The special plastic steel covering the T-3 power armor was not cheap.</br>
</br>
When he was back in the country, it was unrealistic to purchase large quantities of metal as it was much riskier than purchasing food. But now there were fewer concerns. He could buy whatever amount he desired, and no one would investigate him.</br>
</br>
The iron production of the world was controlled by three mega-companies. The first being Brazil's Vale S.A with 39% of total production, ranking second was Rio Tinto and third being BHP, who accounted for 38% of total production. The first one was too far away in South America; the two latter ones were all in Australia with only New Guinea in between. Based on the consideration of cost, Jiang Chen chose BHP as his partner.</br>
</br>
There was only one flight to Melbourne. While there was an increase in the number of tourists, tickets remained plentiful as Ayesha easily purchased them.</br>
</br>
When they arrived, they checked in at the same hotel.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang." When he saw Jiang Chen, the Australian with a hooked nose extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you too." Jiang Chen gave him a warm handshake.</br>
</br>
Oliver, one of the presidents of BHP. He was the acting executive director of the West Australia division.</br>
</br>
Compared with the mega-company with a 210 billion market cap, Future International was just a small ant. Of course, no one would question the potential of the little ant, just like Microsoft in its early days.</br>
</br>
After a brief introduction, they were quick to head into the main topic.</br>
</br>
"One hundred thousand tons of iron, two hundred thousand tons of aluminum, one thousand tons of 45% purity molybdenum per month…" Oliver scanned through the contract Jiang Chen handed over repeatedly as his eyebrows began to raise.</br>
</br>
"The iron and aluminum are okay. But the molybdenum is a rare metal and production remains low. All of its production per year has been reserved." Oliver showed an apologetic expression.</br>
</br>
"I see." Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Molybdenum has a low reserve on earth accounting for only 0.001% of the mass of the crust, but it had a wide range of applications. Such as microcomputers, microprocessors, offshore oil and gas pipelines, and even fertilizers.</br>
</br>
But a significant use of this was yet to be discovered. Mainly the neural connection of the virtual reality equipment to the human body must use this. Although they could acquire some through recycling in the apocalypse, to mass produce it, they would have to obtain it in the modern world.</br>
</br>
"With molybdenum, I recommend you try your luck in Hua. Hua is the biggest producer of molybdenum right now. Iron and aluminum, our company can provide."</br>
</br>
"I'll see. Let's put the molybdenum aside for now and discuss the price of iron and aluminum," Jiang Chen said reluctantly.</br>
</br>
The Wang family would not let him purchase molybdenum easily. It was too easy to prevent him from buying the metal. From extraction to transportation, and customization. With the Wang family's power, a connection in any part of the system would easily stop him from doing business.</br>
</br>
Where could molybdenum be easily acquired from? Potentially places like Antarctica and the Moon.</br>
</br>
International treaty prohibited one of them, while the other one was unreachable by current technology.</br>
</br>
He would have to search for other means… Jiang Chen deliberated.</br>

</br>
After an hour of negotiating contract prices and details, they finally reached an agreement.</br>
</br>
Iron ore: 52.20 USD per ton, one hundred thousand tons per month with a total cost of 5.22 million USD.</br>
</br>
Aluminum ore: 80 USD per ton, two hundred thousand tons per month with a total cost of 16 million USD.</br>
</br>
The total contract amount was 21.22 billion USD. The shipment would arrive from Port Darwin to Port Ange at the beginning of every month for five years.</br>
</br>
Although Ange Island currently has no deepwater port, Jiang Chen had already invested in its construction as two docks would be built by next month. The population base of Ange Island was relatively high and relatively far away from the other eight islands. Therefore, it was ideal to be built into an industrial island with manufacturing as the dominating industry. Hence, a deepwater port was necessary.</br>
</br>
Oliver was ecstatic as he signed a multi-million dollar deal in one afternoon for the company. After signing the contract, Jiang Chen didn't immediately leave but instead started to chat with him about the mining industry.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's questions, Oliver did his best to answer. He told Jiang Chen the trend of the low volume of iron ore traded in 2016 and the decrease in price for rare metals. All the information could be found online, so it was not a secret.</br>
</br>
"If you don't mind me asking this question, based on my knowledge, your company's primary business is in the tech industry, why would you need to purchase large quantities of iron ore?" Oliver asked.</br>
</br>
"Your company has implications on what the buyer uses the ore for?" Jiang Chen nonchalantly asked.</br>
</br>
"Just a question I was personally curious about. Of course, if it is inconvenient to disclose, then it that is okay. This question doesn't affect our partnership." Oliver saw that Jiang Chen didn't plan to answer as he smiled to apologize for his rather blatant question.</br>
</br>
"I do apologize, this is a trade secret, and I can't answer you… To express my apology, allow me to treat you to dinner," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Haha, it's my honor. I know a pretty good restaurant in Melbourne, take my car…" Oliver gladly accepted Jiang Chen's invitation.</br>
</br>
It was time to get off work, they left the company and headed to a Brazilian Barbeque restaurant near Melbourne.</br>
</br>
From the restaurant's aesthetics, it was no different than the street food stalls found in Han. The half-open system design with a distinctly-not-Brazilian owner roasting the golden slices of meat on the fire drew the passersby with its delicious aroma.</br>
</br>
They sat at the bar, and it didn't take long before the plates arrived in front of them.</br>
</br>
Two cold beers and four plates of meat later, Jiang Chen was thrilled by the food.</br>
</br>
"Is the future of the mining industry not looking so good?"</br>
</br>
"Not terrible, but it will get worse." When they spoke about work, Oliver let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Because of the economic conditions?"</br>
</br>
"It could be categorized as an economic issue, but ultimately it goes back to demand." Oliver took a big gulp of beer in satisfaction, the beer washed away the frustration that accumulated in his chest.</br>
</br>
"Could you be more specific?" With the skewer in his hand, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
He had an interest in mining.</br>
</br>
"For example, if you want to build a 5000 square meter building, it would require 30 tons of steel. But once the building is complete, the potential market of the steel would decrease by that 30 tons. Not only in infrastructure, but from vehicles to screws, they are all the same. Then, the steel plant would decrease production, the mining output would also decrease, and that's how the economy goes down the drain." Oliver laughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what was funny.</br>
</br>
"Is it okay to tell me this?"</br>
</br>
"No problem. I'm off work," Oliver said with confidence, "Also, even if there are layoffs, I won't be cut."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, the overall trend of iron is going down?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. In 2008, per ton had a price of 2.1 USD. Now, it would be lucky to get 0.95 USD."</br>
</br>
"With what you are saying, there is no hope in the mining industry?" Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily true. There is potential if there is a technological breakthrough." Oliver shook his beer glass half filled with beer.</br>
</br>
"Technological breakthrough?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"That's right. Unless there is a major technological breakthrough, such as everyone throwing away their current vehicle, like how everyone gave up on the hand-operated machines or like how everyone abandoned the steam engine… If we were to stretch the example. Sigh, I am pretty envious of you."</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of people envious of me."</br>
</br>
"I am not talking about your money, but your industry. Don't you think that tech is the field that technological breakthroughs are most likely to occur in?" Oliver stuffed a skewer into his mouth and then smiled.</br>
</br>
"It is also the industry most likely to go bankrupted," Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
Oliver took a moment to process this before he started to laugh hysterically. Maybe laughing was contagious for Jiang Chen also began to laugh along.</br>
</br>
The two hysterical people made the rest of the restaurant turn their heads.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the hotel somewhat drunk, it was already ten at night. That guy was surprisingly talkative and was very humorous as well. Jiang Chen and him talked about the culture of Australia, the barbequed fish, and even his hometown Hucheng. They got along so well that while that ate and drank, it was already deep into the night.</br>
</br>
Before they left, Jiang Chen exchanged business cards with Oliver.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen still drenched in the smell of alcohol, appeared in front of the door, Ayesha quickly helped him to the bathroom, took off his shirt, and wiped his body with a hot towel.</br>
</br>
"Why did you drink so much?" Ayesha muttered to Jiang Chen in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"I met an interesting person." Jiang Chen burped and laughed, then he leaned on Ayesha's chest.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's pale skin instantly turned red. Just as she was about to help Jiang Chen stand up, snoring sounds resonating from the bathroom…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It felt terrible to be hung over, but with Jiang Chen's metabolic speed, he only felt awful for a short period the next day before he fully recovered.</br>
</br>
Because the contract negotiation went surprisingly smooth, he had a lot of free time the next day.</br>
</br>
Since everything was done, based on Jiang Chen's promise to Ayesha, he took her to explore Melbourne.</br>
</br>
Photos in front of landmarks, shopping in major malls…</br>
</br>
It was tiring to shop with a woman. But with Ayesha's joyous expression in front of him, Jiang Chen felt all of his weariness wash away.</br>
</br>
The last destination of the trip was St. Patrick's Cathedral. Although it was odd to view an religious building as someone of a different religion, Ayesha's amazement surveying the magnificent cross astonished Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Not all religious people are stubborn.</br>
</br>
And not all stubbornness cannot be forgiven.</br>
</br>
At the peak of the modern day secularization, even an atheist can hold the hands of a believer and praise the glory of the art of the pagan church.</br>
</br>
Seven hundred years ago, the Crusaders fought for the ownership of holy land through a bloodbath. Seventy years ago, the US and Soviet let the iron curtain drop due to differences in ideology.</br>
</br>
Now looking back, nothing seems unforgivable nor unacceptable by the law of nature.</br>
</br>
Just like the uncanny workmanship of the Suzhou Gardens and the vibrancy of the stained glass at the Notre Dame de Paris, the shape and color the world should possess were far more than what people would think.</br>
</br>
If one day, the footstep of humans expanded to the edge of the galaxy, if they look back on the territory conflicts of today, and the ideology differences, would they mock themselves for their past actions?</br>
</br>
But by that time, what would civilization be bothered by…</br>
</br>
… The path to evolution? Or other things?</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought about this, Ayesha gently pulled on his arm.</br>
</br>
He recollected his thought and looked at her. "Hmm?"</br>
</br>
"I want to go in… Is that okay?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
He threw his thoughts into the back of his head and nobly held onto Ayesha's tiny hand.</br>
</br>
They both headed inside the St. Patrick Cathedral.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 361: Meeting an old friend</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Rather than a church, it was more like a museum.</br>
</br>
The church had religious text that could be read, but it had no souvenirs. Perhaps indicating it was a sacred place rather than a tourist attraction. But because today was not worship day, there was no one praying in the church.</br>
</br>
Inscriptions on shrines told the vicissitudes history of the Catholic Church. Jiang Chen held Ayesha's hand while he briefly glanced around.</br>
</br>
"Is this a gothic style building?" Ayesha with one finger on her lips looked up at the magnificent dome.</br>
</br>
"Should be, I don't really know. Why?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Because… I often see gothic style clothing in the magazines," With the tip of her lips forming a curvature. "I think it's cute."</br>
</br>
"Haha, but this building doesn't resemble cuteness." Jiang Chen forced a laugh and scanned his surrounding.</br>
</br>
A priest stood under the altar with a couple standing in front of him. The white-haired priest drew a cross in front of his chest and blessed the two. Ayesha noticed that the couples had a joyous smile on their faces when they left.</br>
</br>
"What are they doing?"</br>
</br>
"Receiving the blessing of the holy light? The couple should be praying or marrying or something." Jiang Chen made something up.</br>
</br>
The priest seemed to have noticed the two looking at him. He kindly smiled and walked to them.</br>
</br>
"Do you need help with something?"</br>
</br>
Considering Ayesha's religion, Jiang Chen wanted to refuse, but the girl blinked her eyes and looked at the elderly father with white hair.</br>
</br>
"Even as a pagan, is the blessing effective?"</br>
</br>
The question was blatant, but the priest only paused for a moment before he spoke with an earnest expression.</br>
</br>
"Of course. It all depends if you love him or not."</br>
</br>
Ayesha's cold expression bloomed into a joyful smile.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. I love him dearly."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt teary.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's honest but innocent confession made him feel a different emotion.</br>
</br>
He never admitted that he was a good man. Not because he was greedy, he just never had a strong mental fortitude.</br>
</br>
The priest looked at Jiang Chen, his eyes seemed to possess the ability to observe everything.</br>
</br>
"Then, do you love her?"</br>
</br>
"I love her," Jiang Chen said affirmatively.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's eyes welled up with tears. She hugged Jiang Chen's arm and rubbed her face against it.</br>
</br>
If he had one positive trait, it would be that he never lied about his emotions. Although there was the suspicion of being a quibble, Jiang Chen didn't plan to explain anything.</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on the priest's face.</br>
</br>
"May the Lord bless you, and you will be happy."</br>
</br>
He drew the cross and blessed them.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When they came out of the church, Ayesha dangled her entire body weight on Jiang Chen's arm, and her expression was exuberant.</br>
</br>
</br>
Among the trees, white roses blossomed along the path, but in front of her perfect smile, it paled in comparison.</br>
</br>
It was rare for her to display such intimacy in public.</br>
</br>
With how happy she looked, Jiang Chen couldn't resist kissing her tender face.</br>
</br>
The face gradually turned red as he a spoiled smile surfaced on his face.</br>
</br>
When night began to fall, Jiang Chen prepared to take Ayesha back to the hotel.</br>
</br>
They still needed to catch tomorrow's plane, so they should sleep early.</br>
</br>
That's right, sleep early.</br>
</br>
But at the same moment, Jiang Chen heard a familiar voice in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Feifei, marry me?" A man with roses kneeled in front of a gorgeous looking girl as he said with deep affection.</br>
</br>
But the proposal in front of the church didn't seem to move the girl.</br>
</br>
"Didn't we agree that once you settle, we'll then talk about marriage?"</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed the voice as he looked at the man beside the bench.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect to encounter his university roommate here?!</br>
</br>
After graduation, the four roommates all chose different paths. While they contacted each other initially for the few months, with the formulation of their new circles, the four rarely contacted each other. Even if Jiang Chen had made a name for himself, the three people still didn't contact him.</br>
</br>
As to why, Jiang Chen made sense of it quickly; most likely because they didn't want to lose face.</br>
</br>
Not speaking with people when they are down, and flattering them once they are successful, it didn't sound good. Especially since their relationship was not deep, to begin with, in addition to the lack of contact two years after graduation. Since the three all valued their face, they didn't contact Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Without contact, at least they could brag to their friends and coworkers –"That guy, we lived in the same dorm. I was tight with him."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still remembered Yang Yuan. Although they were not in the same major, they had a surprisingly good relationship. He was the study god of their dorm and had a good family background. Jiang Chen faintly recalled that after graduated he headed to a renowned university in Australia for a master program. Before he left, he told Jiang Chen to find him if he ever visited Australia and that he would treat him.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen knew it was just out of courtesy.</br>
</br>
Now thinking back, two years passed by and his master should be completed. Since they didn't contact each other after he left, their relationship obviously began to fade. While it was not the first time Jiang Chen was in Australia, he didn't remember to go find him.</br>
</br>
But today's encounter, the feeling of meeting an old friend in a different part of the world, was indescribable.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen just wasn't sure if it would be appropriate to say hi.</br>
</br>
"Give me some more time, I will definitely find a job…" Yang Yuan was a bit anxious as he didn't know what to do.</br>
</br>
"Did you consider my feelings? You said you were already settled here, so I quit my job in China to find you, but what now?" The girl said accusingly with her eyes turning red.</br>
</br>
When he saw his old friend was in a tough situation, Jiang Chen let out a sigh and walked toward him in an attempt to make the situation less awkward.</br>
</br>
"Yang Yuan?"</br>
</br>
When he heard someone call his name, Yang Yuan first paused for a moment. When he saw who it was, he shouted in surprise.</br>
</br>
"… Brother Chen! Haven't seen you in a while."</br>
</br>
Due to astonishment, his voice cracked.</br>
</br>
"Haven't seen you for a while." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"This is… your significant other?" Yang Yuan looked at Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
"Ayesha," she briefly introduced herself.</br>
</br>
"You… you still recognize me." The smile on Yang Yuan was a mixture of bitterness, excitement, and joy.</br>
</br>
The person they didn't believe in now became a big boss and the person everyone thought highly upon now couldn't even find a job. The discrepancy made him feel a bit bitter, but the joyful news was, his old friend still recognized him.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Of course, I still remember I owe you two cup noodles," Jiang Chen recalled their past.</br>
</br>
"Don't mention it." Yang Yuan rubbed his nose out of embarrassment, "I always said that I will treat you to lobster. Now that you are so well off, I'm so embarrassed to say it."</br>
</br>
"You, you are Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that the girl beside Yang Yuan looked at him in excitement, stars were shining in her eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt that he had seen her before, is it an illusion? Whatever.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen laughed and turned to Yang Yuan, "Is this your significant other?"</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen's generation is defined by the single child policy, during university, they casually referred to each other as brothers, while their girlfriend as brother's significant other.</br>
</br>
"I am Su Fei, a fan of Little White," Su Fei said while blinking her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Yang Yuan's expression was somewhat awkward.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed that he didn't want to speak too much on this as he diverted the topic.</br>
</br>
"It's rare to see you, how about I'll treat you to dinner."</br>
</br>
"No, no, I said I would treat you."</br>
</br>
"It's okay! I'm just repaying for the two cup noodles," Jiang Chen interrupted Yang Yuan.</br>
</br>
He could see that Yang Yuan's economic situation was not too great. He only wanted to find a way for them to catch up, if he burdened his old friend, it would be against his original intention.</br>
</br>
"Oh… Okay." Yang Yuan saw Jiang Chen's intention and nodded.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
They arrived at a restaurant by the sea. From the exterior design, it was easy to see the luxury of this restaurant as well as the extravagance of the price. Yang Yuan's expression was unnatural when he looked at the servers in suits. But with how happy his girlfriend was, he didn't have the heart to tell Jiang Chen to change a place.</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen didn't look "pained" or dissatisfied, he finally felt relieved.</br>
</br>
He was worried that Jiang Chen would have the idea that "I haven't seen you for a long time and you want me to pay for a big meal," but the worry seemed extraneous. He also had a headache due to the wayward and extravagance of his girlfriend, but he couldn't bring out the courage to restrain her.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan was obviously facepalming. Jiang Chen was not stingy to the point where he wouldn't pay for a meal.</br>
</br>
On the dinner table, other than Ayesha not speaking too much, the other three had a great conversation. Su Fei continually proposed a toast to Jiang Chen to demonstrate her energetic side, but at the same time subconsciously or consciously began asking about his private life. However, Jiang Chen managed to divert the questions smoothly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen has seen too many similar situations.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't know why his old friend would like a woman like this, he still had his own boundaries. Therefore, he maintained his distance with Su Fei. Seeing that her attempt to get close was unsuccessful, Su Fei put her attention on Ayesha and tried to befriend her. But to her warmness, Ayesha's was unmoved.</br>
</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan seemed to be slow in this area as he didn't sense anything. After downing a few beers, he began chatting about what happened after graduation.</br>
</br>
Because he was drunk, Yang Yuan dragged him to the balcony of the restaurant. With the refreshing sea breeze sweeping across their face, they continued to chat.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long before the conversation changed to "the start of the company". Jiang Chen selectively skipped the sensitive topics and summarized the process of creating Future 1.0 and only spoke about the details of when the company started to become successful.</br>
</br>
"Damn! The prom queen of the business school, Xia Shiyu, you managed to date her! Wow, this Brother Chen title is certainly deserving." Yang Yuan exclaimed in a loud voice laced with drunkenness.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean? "Jiang Chen joked, "She is the CEO of my company. But… our relationship might be a bit different."</br>
</br>
There weren't as many concerns when men spoke to each other.</br>
</br>
"But isn't that your S.O?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was a bit awkward, "Uh, she is too."</br>
</br>
"… So corrupted." Yang Yuan took a long time to process his words before he punched Jiang Chen on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, we like each other, it is not being corrupt. Let's not talk about this… Speaking of you, what's going on with Su Fei."</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Nothing's going on. Just like this."</br>
</br>
"I feel like I have seen her before."</br>
</br>
"She is also a graduate of Wanghai University, two years younger than me. I only asked her to come abroad at the end of last year, you probably have seen her in school." Yang Yuan said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"I see… Could be."</br>
</br>
"I originally thought that I got a metal bowl (Referring to a stable job), but I didn't even take a scoop out of it before I lost the bowl. I should have just signed when PetroChina interviewed me." There was regret in Yang Yuan's words.</br>
</br>
Although state-owned enterprises' salary was lower compared to foreign companies, the stability was undoubtedly a plus. Even if it were operating at a loss and heavily subsidized, the government would not allow the workers who worked diligently to contribute to the country to lose their job. Just from this point again, it was more virtuous than working for the capitalists.</br>
</br>
"A metal bowl (1)?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, in the first year of my masters in Australia, I already signed with Rio Tinto. But this year, the mining industry was not looking pleasant, combined with the oil price plunging, Rio Tinto immediately began laying off people. So I, unfortunately, became a casualty."</br>
</br>
[Certainly unlucky… ] Jiang Chen said in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Does PetroChina not want you anymore?"</br>
</br>
"Of course they do, why not? I am a master student who studied abroad majoring in resource exploration. With my family connection, I will be promoted in just two years." Yang Yuan was still confident with his own ability.</br>
</br>
"Then why don't you go back?" Jiang Chen glanced at him.</br>
</br>
A bitter smile surfaced at Yang Yuan's face.</br>
</br>
"I want to go back, but…" As he spoke, Yang Yuan turned to look at Su Fei in the restaurant.</br>
</br>
That girl was dissecting the lobster in excitement while chatting with Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly understood his bitterness.</br>
</br>
"She didn't want me to go back. From her perspective, now that I finally acquired immigration status, it would be a waste if I let that go. Whenever I talk about going back, she would cry and threaten to break up with me…"</br>
</br>
"Is it good like this?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen didn't like Su Fei's personality. He didn't know what was attractive about this type of girl. But since Yang Yuan likes her, he couldn't say anything.</br>
</br>
"What could I do?" Yang Yuan's bitterness deepened.</br>
</br>
"Do you love her?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
He didn't know that the engineer was such a devoted person. Back then, Jiang Chen just thought he was unexpressive, he didn't think he had this quality.</br>
</br>
"… Then try to satisfy her, though it might be an endless pit."</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan let out a sigh, "I know. I just want to wait until tomorrow, if the market picks up again, there will be demand for employment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fell into deep thought as he listened to Yang Yuan's words.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he happened to be worried about molybdenum. Other than molybdenum, niobium ore, tungsten ore and even rare metals all have a big gap in the wasteland. But based on what Oliver said, those ores would be hard to obtain in any country, so Jiang Chen had the idea to extract them himself.</br>
</br>
Pannu Islands' ocean resources were extremely vast and rich. While no oil and gas existed in its territory, the mining deposits underneath the sea were yet to be explored. It would be hard to believe if there were not a single bit of deposits in the vast ocean territory. Since iron and aluminum had a low cost, Jiang Chen didn't mind paying. But for rarer metals, if he were to buy, it would certainly pain him.</br>
</br>
As to how to extract the ores from the seafloor, Jiang Chen already had an idea in mind, though it still remained in the research phase…</br>
</br>
Could the deposit distribution of the apocalypse be the same as the modern world?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen never thought about this before. Because the history of the two worlds was completely different, he selectively ignored the possibility of using the information from the future to his advantage.</br>
</br>
Lottery? The amount and number might even be different. Suck up to future leaders? Pac never existed. Music? That's more absurd. Would India's pop music be popular in China? If not, then the music from PAC would be the same.</br>
</br>
But mining resources were different! It would not change because of human activity. Therefore, the mining beds dug clean before the war may not have even been drilled or explored yet.</br>
</br>
The more Jiang Chen thought about it, the more he wanted to hit himself for not thinking about this earlier. Selling ores and oil location would be much more profitable compared to gold! Just that it would be hard to explain the source…</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, I happen to have a job, are you interested?"</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan shook his head.</br>
</br>
"I don't know tech at all. Thank you, but I will not bother you."</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan was an honest person, he knew he didn't have any ability in that area.</br>
</br>
"Who said I wanted you to go to Future Technology? Asking an exploration major to do tech, it would be asking for trouble." Jiang Chen rolled his eyes. "I am talking about Future Mining, are you interested?"</br>
</br>
"Future Mining?" Yang Yuan was shocked.</br>
</br>
"That's right," Jiang Chen said affirmatively.</br>
</br>
Although he could just hire a headhunter to do it for him, he trusted the people he knew more. As to technology, the one thing he never lacked was technology.</br>
</br>
"Are you being serious?" Yang Yuan put on a stern expression.</br>
</br>
"Of course. But do you know anything about sea exploration?"</br>
</br>
When he talked about his major, Yang Yuan immediately turned ecstatic.</br>
</br>
"Yes, my professor at the university is researching sea exploration, whether it is space mining deposits or space oil deposits, I have studied both."</br>
</br>
"Then let's do this, I will go back to Xin and register Future Mining… Mhmm, I will also register one in Australia." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What, you haven't registered that company yet?" Yang Yuan facepalmed.</br>
</br>
(1) Metal Bowl - A stable job from a state-owned enterprise.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Yang Yuan's contract was negotiated immediately after.</br>
</br>
Although he was skeptical with Future International entering the mining sector, he didn't question the truth of Jiang Chen's words. It must be true - would a billionaire trick a poor guy just for fun? Yang Yuan accepted the job without a second thought.</br>
</br>
He would get a monthly salary of ten thousand AUD with a bonus based on sales. Although Yang Yuan expressed that he didn't need that much, Jiang Chen still insisted on giving him a high salary. One reason being that he wanted to help his old friend, the other reason was to reinforce their relationship.</br>
</br>
It was always the better deed to help someone in need rather than add on to their success. For example, it was far more meaningful to drag him up when his career and relationship were at their worst rather than giving him a raise when he had a salary of over one hundred thousand.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, when Su Fei heard that Yang Yuan would work for Future International, she was naturally very excited. But when she heard the work was in a place called Pannu Islands beside New Guinea, her face immediately turned sour.</br>
</br>
Then she heard she could live in a mansion by the beach with a salary of ten thousand AUD with flights back to Australia for vacation covered by the company. She became happy again, her mood changing as fast as a summer storm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know what to say.</br>
</br>
Since Yang Yuan liked her, he couldn't do anything about it.</br>
</br>
The dinner cost 1000 AUD, which Jiang Chen paid before taking off. Yang Yuan would report to him at Coro Island five days later, so it was his job to register the company in Australia in the next five days.</br>
</br>
Future Technology, Future Biology, Future Mining - the three subsidiaries meant that Future International finally had the umbra of an international conglomerate. In the future, Jiang Chen planned to establish Future Heavy Industrial, Future Communication and allow Future International to expand in all areas of human economic activity. Of course, he had to take it one step at a time.</br>
</br>
"Did you have fun today?' On their way back, Jiang Chen tousled Ayesha's hair and asked.</br>
</br>
"Very fun."</br>
</br>
Whenever she recalled the blessing in the church and his "I love her," a curvature known as happiness would surface on Ayesha's lips.</br>
</br>
"We'll head back tomorrow. Is there anything you want to do or any place you want to go? There's still some time before it gets completely dark."</br>
</br>
"No need." With a blushing face, Ayesha moved her eyes into the distance. "Let's go back now."</br>
</br>
[Is she tired?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen initially didn't understand the meaning behind Ayesha's words. It was only when the door of the hotel room closed that he personally experienced the passion hidden underneath her coldness.</br>
</br>
Only the soaked sheets told the intimacy of the night.</br>
</br>
</br>
The next day, they boarded their returning flight to Xin and got off the plane on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
After he settled down the weary Ayesha, Jiang Chen left the mansion and headed to the nutrient supply plant located on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
It was the hottest time of the day, and the workers at the plant were all on break, but Zhan Shujie still stayed in the lab and carefully examined DH seaweed cells under the microscope. He didn't even notice Jiang Chen standing behind him.</br>
</br>
'"Did you discover something meaningful?' Jiang Chen sighed with a helpless expression.</br>
</br>
"No." Zhang Shujie shook his head in honesty.</br>
</br>
He researched this for over half a month, yet he was still without any clue. He didn't know how the mechanism worked.</br>
</br>
"It's normal for you to not make sense of it. If you could understand it in this short period of time, the technology would be worthless."</br>
</br>
"The RNA transcribed from the single-stranded DNA doesn't match the DNA. A protein found in an animal cell divided in a plant cell. How does this work?" Zhan Shujie's eyes shined with frenetic flames as he asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don't look at me like that; I'm only a merchant, it wasn't me who researched this technology." Jiang Chen shivered at the thought of a man watching him like that.</br>
</br>
"Could I meet him?"</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen rejected it without any room for compromise.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, he thought Zhan Shujie would insist on meeting the scientist, but after being rejected, he only sighed.</br>
</br>
"Okay… I thought I reached the boundaries of science, but it looks like I don't know anything after all. Such astonishing technology exists in this world. Did you know this is like an art?" Zhan Shujie took off the glass under the microscope as he praised its magnificence.</br>
</br>
"Art? It's that valuable?" Considering what he said, Jiang Chen was afraid now.</br>
</br>
[Nutrient supply is going to be sold to the masses. If people start examining it with microscopes…]</br>
</br>
But thinking about it more deeply, he rejected the possibility. Cells could not pass through the molecular filter, and that thing filtered at the particle level.</br>
</br>
"Valuable?" Zhan Shujie shook his head. "It's not just valuable - do you know what it means to be able to produce animal protein from plant cells?"</br>
</br>
"What does it mean?"</br>
</br>
"It means that beef could grow from the ground."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed. Even in the 22nd century, it was pure fiction to grow beef from the ground.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about these irrelevant things, I'm just here to grab some samples," Jiang Chen interrupted him.</br>
</br>
Although Zhan Shujie was displeased with Jiang Chen's choice of words, he knew his place - he was still his boss - so he went to the bench and picked up a nutrient supply pack containing ten tubes.</br>
</br>
"This is it. It tastes weird - would people even want to drink this?" Zhan Shujie ridiculed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began laughing.</br>
</br>
"You don't understand. You're underestimating women's determination to pursue beauty. They could starve themselves for a few days if necessary, so this is nothing, especially since this doesn't taste that bad."</br>
</br>
After he left Zhan Shujie, Jiang Chen took a boat back to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
He got off at the port as he headed straight to the Celestial Trade Corporation's warehouses near the port.</br>
</br>
He calculated that he was away from the wasteland for two months already. While he did occasionally travel back to meet with Sun Jiao, visit Yao Yao, and tease Lin Lin, he never stayed for too long.</br>
</br>
He wanted to test the sample at the fallout shelter to see if there were any errors on the production side, but on the other hand, he needed to grow his force on the wasteland. Provided with the resources of the modern world, limitations on the apocalypse's industrial capabilities would be removed entirely.</br>
</br>
He closed the door of the warehouse and put on the bracelet Lin Lin gave him. Jiang Chen took a deep breath, staring at the small mountain of food.</br>
</br>
"Storage dimension activated."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 364: Return to the Apocalypse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Storing all the food, he didn't need to move an inch but the supply of food in the warehouse slowly depleted. With the interdimensional mass teleportation device, it was much easier to transport goods to the apocalypse. When he had to constantly travel back and forth, not only was it inefficient but it made him feel dizzy and it wasted more crystals too.</br>
</br>
Now, it was a much easier process. After ten minutes past and 1000 crystals used, Jiang Chen emptied two warehouses full of supplies.</br>
</br>
The capacity of the storage dimension seemed to have hit some bottleneck and stagnated at 30 cubic meters. Regardless of how many crystals Jiang Chen used now, he couldn't expand it by even a cubic millimeter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind since 30 cubic meters of space was plenty for him. Perhaps the bottleneck could be broken by a future opportunity, so he didn't worry.</br>
</br>
He left the warehouse and called Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Soon after, Ayesha drove to the warehouse with the Lamborghini. From the exhaustion on her face, she evidently had yet to recover from last night.</br>
</br>
"Are you feeling bad?" Jiang Chen asked caringly as he sat in the car.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… Are you planning to head to that side?" Ayesha acutely saw through Jiang Chen's thoughts.</br>
</br>
"I'm planning to take care of something on that side… Let's go back to the mansion."</br>
</br>
"Be safe."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused before a smile emerged.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
When he returned to the mansion, Jiang Chen changed his clothes. Just like his usual routine, he laid on the bed, closed his eyes, and commenced travel.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Behind his back was still the soft bed, but the oppressive radiation dust outside the window told him explicitly that he wasn't in the peaceful modern world anymore.</br>
</br>
He stood up and before he managed to gain his balance, ferocious footsteps came from behind the door.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao pushed open the door, dove into Jiang Chen's chest and pushed him back onto the bed.</br>
</br>
"I missed you!" She rubbed her face against Jiang Chen's shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Honey, it's not like I haven't been back before."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stroke her silky hair and hugged her.</br>
</br>
Just like a cat, she escaped Jiang Chen's hug agilely. Sun Jiao sat on the chair and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"How long do you plan to stay?"</br>
</br>
"Probably for a while. Also, how did you know I was coming back?"</br>
</br>
A proud smile appeared on Sun Jiao's face, "I heard sounds coming from the warehouse in the backyard and they continued for a while. When I checked it out, I saw a bunch of stuff appear, so I thought you must be preparing to come back."</br>
</br>
"How have you been?"</br>
</br>
"Very well, or rather, too well." With her chin against the back of the chair, Sun Jiao exclaimed.</br>
</br>
To be able to live such a comfortable life was unimaginable before. It was two months until an entire year passed after meeting Jiang Chen. This year was the happiest she'd been since she left the fallout shelter. Although a lot of things happened during the process, they managed to make it through intact.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just like a miracle, the soil tainted by war welcomed order again.</br>
</br>
After he said hi to Yao Yao, Lin Lin, and Sun Xiaorou, Jiang Chen headed to the warehouse in the backyard.</br>
</br>
This place was previously the base's warehouse, and now it was modified into a building similar to a "transport array." Two old warehouses were bulldozed and built into a metal shed around 500 square meters big. Inside contained the magnified version of the "interdimensional mass transportation device" Lin Lin designed.</br>
</br>
Right now, the warehouse was filled with containers of canned food, fresh vegetables, fruit, and meat. Jiang Chen sent Wang Qin a message on the EP, directing 15 workers from the logistics department to transport the food.</br>
</br>
"Last quarter, we produced 2000 Reaper Assault Rifles, 400 Hummingbird Drones, 20 Type-50 Electromagnetic Pulse Cannons, 10 T-3 Power Armors, and 1 Sample T-4 Power Armor." Wang Qin pushed up her glasses as she reported to Jiang Chen the recent production figures.</br>
</br>
"The T-4 Power Armor is finished?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
The defense ability of the T-3's armor was something Jiang Chen always criticized. While the front armor was enough to defend against light weapons, it was nowhere enough in a battle against the Death Claw. Jiang Chen demanded that the new model had to replace the plastic armor with the more durable C-type steel without sacrificing mobility.</br>
</br>
Just like he expected, the problem that couldn't be solved by researchers at Sixth Street was no trouble for the scientists at the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"The difficulties with the engine were solved by researchers at the fallout shelter; the improved crystal fuel rod increases energy efficiency by 20% and engine output by 15%. This solves the problem of lack of mobility. The weight of the armor was increased to 700 kilograms to reach the threshold for land-type power armor specs. The total defense increased by 50% while ammunition decreased by 10%.</br>
</br>
"What about the attached weapon models?"</br>
</br>
"It still has the revolving machine gun on the left arm as the primary weapon, but based on this, the researchers at the fallout shelter also added a five-round grenade launcher on the same side. The grenade is capable of heat-seeking."</br>
</br>
It was a moving fortress.</br>
</br>
[Insane, but I like it!] Jiang Chen thought to himself.</br>
</br>
"What are the weaknesses compared to T-3?"</br>
</br>
"While the front armor is reinforced more strongly, the armor in the back has been decreased. Also due to the weight of the armor, the acceleration provided by the engine is weaker compared to before - it can't perform the high mobility dodging maneuvers T-3 could. It may feel unresponsive when dodging anti-armor weapons, so our research added reactive nitrogen armor on four different sections of the T-4 power armor.</br>
</br>
Improving its defense meant sacrificing its mobility, but it was a worthwhile sacrifice. Since not all people could perform the dodging action in less than 0.1 seconds, most of the soldiers in power armor would require the armor to take damage directly and act as a moving shield for the light infantry. It was the role power armor played in combat.</br>
</br>
"What's the cost of producing a T-4?"</br>
</br>
Wang Qin's finger pressed on the screen and a number appeared in the center.</br>
</br>
"27130 crystals."</br>
</br>
"That's so expensive." Jiang Chen was shocked by the figure.</br>
</br>
It was almost three times the amount compared to T-3 armor.</br>
</br>
But Wang Qin couldn't do anything about that fact.</br>
</br>
"The price of iron and rare metal continues to climb at the Sixth Street to the point where there's a shortage. Based on the information provided by Chu Nan, although there's been an economic boom as well as other factors, there's also been an increase in the number of scavengers, so there's still a significant gap to meet industrial demands."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 365: Virtual Reality Online</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Fishbone Base's metal resources primarily depended on imports from the Sixth Street. With the influence of the economic boom last fall as well as the formation of the bank at the year's end, countless factories emerged. The garbage dumps left unmanaged for many years were swept clean by all the major factories. After the hunters that hunted for crystals and mercenaries that protected trade routes, professional scavengers became the hottest profession at the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
This was unfathomable before because no one imagined that so many factories would emerge at the Sixth Street practically overnight.</br>
</br>
"The current production capacity of the base is restricted by the lack of raw materials. A lot of scavenging teams already signed a contract with the factories. Although I suggested Chu Nan to forcefully purchase the resources that Fishbone Base requires at a premium, he rejected the proposal. He said that unless you made the decision, he wouldn't interfere with the contract between private companies and scavengers." Wang Qin sighed.</br>
</br>
"What he did was right," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan was undoubtedly an interesting individual - although he was just a pilot, it was surprising that they shared a similar thought process. One trait that most survivors shared on the wasteland was that the moment they saw something nice, they would steal it. This was the reason why most people spent their life picking through garbage.</br>
</br>
Of course, looking at the question from another perspective, the actions of the survivors were reasonable. Due to the scarcity of survival resources, they might not even be able to survive without robbing others.</br>
</br>
Wang Qin looked at Jiang Chen, not understanding. From her perspective, they were already nice enough to purchase the supplies at a premium - at least they weren't trying to rob them. Fishbone base was the controller of the Sixth Street, didn't they have the authority to do whatever they wanted?</br>
</br>
"Only freedom and goodwill can inject the long-lasting energy needed for the Sixth Street's economic growth. We would only lose credibility if we attempted to interfere with the economy and its supporting industry. And to a regime like ours, the latter is obviously more important than the former."</br>
</br>
She didn't understand what the boss said, but she thought it was deep… That was what Wang Qin's expression showed.</br>
</br>
"Credibility... what's the purpose of that?"</br>
</br>
"Too useful." Jiang Chen laughed. "Let's not talk about this. How much iron and aluminum are we missing? Just give me a list. These two resources will no longer be imported from the Sixth Street - I will solve the problem myself."</br>
</br>
"You-you can obtain iron?" Wang Qin's eyes widened in disbelief as she couldn't hide her surprise.</br>
</br>
But she was quick to realize her rudeness as she covered her mouth with her hands to express her remorse.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind and answered with a casual voice.</br>
</br>
"That's right, I can transport it starting next month. I can't solve the problem with the rare metals though, so see if you have any solutions."</br>
</br>
She pushed up her glasses as the surface reflected a cunning spark.</br>
</br>
"Let the scavengers of the base take care of it. We should give up on recycling iron and aluminum and shift our focus to electronic equipment and high precision devices - these things contain a higher amount of rare metal."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll leave it up to you." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Transportation of goods into the warehouse was almost complete, so Wang Qin saluted before she left.</br>
</br>
As it was getting late, Jiang Chen took a big stretch before returning to the mansion.</br>
</br>
He needed to bring the nutrient supply to the fallout shelter the next day and ask Han Junhua's opinion. Then he would visit the Sixth Street to examine Chu Nan's current work progress.</br>
</br>
He pushed open the door to the living room to see Yao Yao and Lin Lin sitting at the table. The two small heads were both deep in thought as they engaged in a discussion about a blueprint.</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at it?" Jiang Chen came closer out of curiosity.</br>
</br>
"Ahh, big brother is back. Are you done for the day?" Yao Yao smiled gently at Jiang Chen as she turned her head.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin proudly straightened her back and kept her chin high.</br>
</br>
"We're currently researching a magnificent technology but since it requires some computer knowledge, I have to ask Yao Jiayu-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen expected Lin Lin to boast, so he chose to ignore her and directed his gaze at the cute Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Hello! Stop ignoring me!" Lin Lin protested.</br>
</br>
"It's about a database converting brain waves to electronic signals, it's nothing special," Yao Yao timidly said.</br>
</br>
"Database?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Sorry for troubling you guys so much."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou walked out of the hallway dressed in a light purple floral dress. She lowered her eyes apologetically.</br>
</br>
"Not at all, it's not troublesome. " Lin Lin felt awkward by Sun Xiaorou's sincerity as she scratched her face.</br>
</br>
Although it was Tingting in her body who destroyed the chip causing Sun Xiaorou to become like this, she still bore some responsibility for not controlling the bug. Even if Sun Xiaorou never blamed her, she always felt guilty.</br>
</br>
While Lin Lin had a big mouth and was somewhat arrogant, she was still a kind person deep inside.</br>
</br>
"No problem at all, Yao Yao also hopes that sister can start walking soon." Yao Yao nodded her head earnestly.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, everyone," Sun Xiaorou said emotionally.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed they had a good relationship with each other -was it because they lived together for so long?</br>
</br>
"Thank you too."</br>
</br>
"Eh? Me?" Jiang Chen looked in surprise at Sun Xiaorou smiling at him.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. It was only because of you that I reunited with my sister and meet so many lovely friends and also…a cute brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
Her eyes turned into two crescents. The smile was sweet, but Jiang Chen felt the smile gave a vibe similar to her sister.</br>
</br>
The devil-like smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped as he shivered uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, does that count as teasing me?]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After dinner, Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao went to the third-floor gym. Inside were two virtual reality training chambers.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was told that the virtual reality MMORPG was finished. Of course, he couldn't wait to experience it as he dragged Sun Jiao along.</br>
</br>
was a name created by Du Yongkong. He didn't create the content himself because a lot of the data and models were already available. All he needed to do was replicate the famous virtual reality MMORPG on the new engine.</br>
</br>
Although it sounded easy, it was a large amount of work. To complete the project, Du Yongkong requested ten something people who previously worked in game design to assist him.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Jiang Chen also increased the difficulty of his work.</br>
</br>
To better fit the culture of the modern world and people's spiritual needs, Jiang Chen downloaded a library of Xuanhuan web novels and made Du Yongkong read through them. He asked him to try his best to "recreate the passion" when he designed the game.</br>
</br>
This troubled Du Yongkong greatly. While Jiang Chen enjoyed the novels, Yongkong didn't understand the fun of them at all since he was forced to read millions of words just to complete his assigned task.</br>
</br>
Regardless, after half a year of work, the beta version of the game was finally finished. Whether it was fun or not, Jiang Chen was determined to figure that out himself.</br>
</br>
Translator's Thoughts</br>

</br>
Sorry guys, computer went out and just got a new one. Five chapters today to make up for the delay.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Although it was an MMORPG, aside from the NPC that possessed basic artificial intelligence, there were only two players. The two virtual reality chambers connected directly to the server which acted as a private server.</br>
</br>
The game content was easy to understand and follow.</br>
</br>
It involved two landmasses, four empires, the cultural infusion between the east and west, and a distinct otherworldly land that introduced the background of the world. The opening animation was exquisitely designed, but Jiang Chen didn't want to waste time and decided to skip it and went straight into the character creation interface.</br>
</br>
There was a variety of classes and races that could be selected including most of the usual ones covered in MMORPG-type novels. Because it was a Game Master account, Jiang Chen could directly select the hidden race and class that would normally only open after thousands of special conditions were met.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't want to spend too much time selecting his character, so he chose the most balanced human as well as the warrior profession with a balance of attack and defense abilities.</br>
</br>
A few words flew in front of his eyes.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter One"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter One: Medieval Era</br>
</div></br>
The game would be permanently influenced by the actions of users in the game, pushing ahead of the current progression of the gaming world.</br>
</br>
For example, if a player conquered thousands of hurdles to complete a hidden quest to reveal the "magic steam engine," the NPC would form the progressive party, and the conservative party would take the players who chose sides in an epic battle to determine whether the world would progress to Chapter Two: Steam Era or remain in Chapter One: Medieval Era.</br>
</br>
When an overly-curious player triggered a demigod or destructor to be summoned into the world and caused the "Endless hell" spell to be cast on the entire server, if they chose to "sacrifice their soul to Lucifer," then the game would return to Chapter One: Medieval Era.</br>
</br>
The progression of the world meant that new classes and even new races would be born. Whether the steam era or the magical era appeared was based on the actions of the players in the world. The amount of freedom was almost identical to the real world as endless possibilities existed.</br>
</br>
This level of detail was an impossible task for modern supercomputers because the number of variables and changes would be an astronomical number. But with the technology of the apocalypse, this level of detail was no problem at all.</br>
</br>
No one would choose to miss the opportunity of experiencing a "second life."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could already imagine the craze people would have when they purchased the virtual reality helmet.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
White light illuminated the space and Jiang Chen appeared in the starting village, naked.</br>
</br>
Another white light flashed and Sun Jiao also showed up naked beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ahh! How-how come I don't have any clothes?!" Sun Jiao cried as she looked down to cover her private areas while she trembled with a red face.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Do you like elves?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scratched his chin as he examined the character Sun Jiao created.</br>
</br>
Other than her voice, it was completely different compared to the real her.</br>
</br>
The chin was too sharp to be considered humanly possible, and slim and elegant ears passed through the green strands of hair. It had a slender waist as well as a chest the size of soccer balls - it had the face of an angel but the figure of a devil.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen looked, he nodded, pleased.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, the face creation system must be nerfed since she doesn't look too different from her actual appearance. The idea of an ugly girl with a pretty face speaking sweetly to him gave him goosebumps.</br>
</br>
Also, the gender has to be restricted! He discovered that during character creation, he could choose to create a female account. Is Du Yongkong dumb?</br>
</br>
When he thought about a man with a female account interacting with him, a shiver went down his spine. At least create a separate server just for people like that...</br>
</br>
"Is this the time to say that?! Clothes! Give me clothes!" Sun Jiao cried out in embarrassment.</br>
</br>
It was rare to see Sun Jiao in such a panic.</br>
</br>
Of course, appearing naked on the street would make anyone panic.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, we're all NPC." Jiang Chen extended his finger and pressed into the air. "Also, with the existence of the control center, you can create clothes yourself."</br>
</br>
A long dress dropped on the ground.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, with a speed of lightning, snatched the clothes on the ground and covered her private areas. Then the benevolent elf smiled gruesomely at the shocked crowd and unleashed thunderous strikes.</br>
</br>
Her finger moved.</br>
</br>
Thousands of flame trails dropped from the ground. The level 100 mage's forbidden spell "Endless Hell" burned the entire starting village to dust.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, it wasn't possible to kill people in the starting village, but Sun Jiao ruthlessly abused the infinite abilities of the NPC.</br>
</br>
That was how GM played the game.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to wipe everyone out, there were a few dwarf lolis there." The flames dropping on Jiang Chen displayed a bunch of "0s" - the spell was useless on him.</br>
</br>
"They're programs after all!" Sun Jiao gave Jiang Chen a dirty look as she bared her teeth to display her prowess.</br>
</br>
She was indeed right since all these people were NPC. While they appeared shocked, embarrassed and even had sexual desires when they saw a naked body, behind the characters were just lines of code. All the personality programs were based on DnD's matrix and were determined based on random variables.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you're right."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the scorched earth and collapsed buildings. The smell of burnt meat even drifted into his nose.</br>
</br>
Mhmm… It wasn't good to be too realistic. If blood began to pour out with a single sword cut and a mere flame ball spell burned people, the game wouldn't operate for too long before the Radio and Television Ministry shut this down. Create a less violent version? Maybe they could automatically identify the age and nationality of the user and limit the graphic effects based on local laws of the user.</br>
</br>
"What's fun about this game?" Sun Jiao scrolled with her finger as she worked on her equipment.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't need to ask as he knew she must've put the ten stars god weapon into her inventory.</br>
</br>
A green light was cast out as godly equipment, the Armor of the Elf Queen, was donned by Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
This equipment perfectly demonstrated the idea of "saving clothes for the country." Only a few metal plates covered the private area and most of her skin was exposed under a thin veil.</br>
</br>
Seeing that there was no one around, Sun Jiao didn't consider whether the equipment that resembled lingerie was embarrassing or not, but she teased Jiang Chen with her 36Gs.</br>
</br>
Looking at the naughty Sun Jiao, Jiang Chen scanned the tightly wrapped clothes in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
"Did you drag the chest size up to the max?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, who had her secret exposed, didn't even blush as she rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"I don't believe you didn't drag your thing to the max."</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen hadn't even thought about it. He allowed the system to replicate his look when he created his character.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao reminded him that in the virtual world, he could be a bit bigger.</br>
</br>
His finger drew in the air as the indescribable part began to bulk at an unbelievable speed. Jiang Chen had a smirk on his face.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you test it out?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 367: Recently at the Camp</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The area inside the camp walls more than doubled and extended from outside the square to the bus stop. The four corners of the camp had patrol towers ten meters high. Each of the towers was equipped with four 20mm cannons. The large caliber stationary machinegun could not only easily rip Death Claw's armor, but it could even do damage to Roshan's high-density fat. Of course, the machinegun was primarily targeted towards the Roshan, since the Death Claw was limited in number and hard to hit, while the Roshan could bite with eyes closed.</br>
</br>
Compared to when Jiang Chen left, the changes inside the base were also astonishing.</br>
</br>
The tent area was messy as the ghetto was removed and replaced by rows of concrete apartment buildings. Because of the improvements in living conditions, the mood of the fallout shelter residents was more pleasant - at least few people had despair on their faces while walking on the streets.</br>
</br>
Based on the directions Jiang Chen gave before he left, Xu Lu built another lab on the surface. However, due to lack of experimental equipment, the lab on the surface couldn't be put into service and most of the experiments were still conducted underground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't have to wait too long before Wang Zhaowu and Xu Lu came to greet him.</br>
</br>
After some catching up, Jiang Chen began to ask about the status of the camp.</br>
</br>
"… The number of stationed troops increased from 80 to 200. To adjust for the lack of personnel, a new drone control terminal was established in the camp with an attack fleet of 400 drones being deployed." Wang Zhaowu reported the defense status of the base.</br>
</br>
"Have there been any security concerns?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"The activity of the zombies from Wanghai is increasing. Also, mutants are becoming more active. Last month, there was an incident where a Death Claw attack caused 14 casualties…" Wang Zhaowu lowered his head in guilt.</br>
</br>
An incident like this occurring was completely his fault. The Songjiang area didn't have any Death Claw nests, so no Death Claw should've been active in the area - this was almost common sense to the Wanghai survivors. It was enough of a coincidence that Jiang Chen encountered a Mother of Death Claw last time, but no one expected that another Death Claw would be active in the area.</br>
</br>
"Raise your head, Death Claw attacks weren't your fault. Your responsibility is to react and handle this type of emergency situation. But from what I see, you are doing very well." Jiang Chen scanned the walls surrounding the base.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu raised his head and looked sincerely at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Also, do you have any more intel from the last explosion at the camp?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a sense that the death of the elder man and the Golden Apple might be connected somehow.</br>
</br>
"Not for the time being, but we found a digitalized human body on the adjacent block. While there was no direct evidence linking him and the explosion, based on the time of destruction, the body was destroyed on the day of the explosion," Wang Zhaowu said.</br>
</br>
</br>
[Digitalized human?]</br>
</br>
A frown appeared on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Do you have pictures?"</br>
</br>
Wang Zhaowu nodded, brought out an image from his EP and passed it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils gazed at the distinct figure.</br>
</br>
[Lin Chaoen.]</br>
</br>
Although the face was barely recognizable, from the remaining few facial traits, Jiang Chen could still recognize his identity.</br>
</br>
"We also found a laser sword and a dagger nearby."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Regarding the mysterious digitalized human with ill-intentions, he currently had no solutions. Even with his body destroyed, he could very possibly revive at some unknown location. The bearded mercenary EP provided some clues, but because of their high firepower, the helicopter couldn't get any closer. While Cheng Weiguo did try to investigate the issue through drones, they were still intercepted.</br>
</br>
"Let's put both issues aside. For now, focus on the defense of the camp and ensure the safety of the fallout shelter residents. They are highly-valued experts in different fields. That is all."</br>
</br>
"Yes, Sir!" Wang Zhaowu saluted and left.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen looked at Xu Lu, "What about the internal affair?"</br>
</br>
She smiled with confidence and said, "The research project team has increased from 10 to 17 members. The research results include four sub-projects related to T-4 power armor, 20mm transportable cannon, Tiger II, and improved nutrient supply."</br>
</br>
"Tiger II is completed?" Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. Since it was limited by the lack of raw materials, the test model could not be produced. But the researchers built a mathematical model to verify the combat ability of this Tiger model."</br>
</br>
"Perfect! Where's the lead for this project?" Jiang Chen was jubilant.</br>
</br>
"Inside the fallout shelter. Do you want me to call him up?" Xu Lu said.</br>
</br>
"No need, I have to go down anyways." Jiang Chen waved his hand.</br>
</br>
"Anything else I can help you with?" Xu Lu said.</br>
</br>
"N…. Hmm, take me to the basement."</br>
</br>
"Roger," Xu Lu said respectfully.</br>
</br>
It was already approaching June, but the basement was still cold and damp.</br>
</br>
The guard opened the metal gate for Jiang Chen and he waited outside with Xu Lu.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wavered in front of the door, but he still walked in.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua raised her head and looked peacefully at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"… Are you going to surrender?"</br>
</br>
No response.</br>
</br>
With eyes as composed as still water, she made Jiang Chen frustrated.</br>
</br>
How could one person be stubborn to this extent?</br>
</br>
An evil thought flashed through his head, but he took a deep breath and restrained his desires. The longer he stayed in the apocalypse, the more blurry his boundaries became. Since he had just come back, however, rationality won this battle.</br>
</br>
"I hope you seriously reconsider."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave her a long, meaningful look and left the basement.</br>
</br>
With the closing of the metal door, Han Junhua felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Although she didn't know why he didn't do anything this time, to her, it was a relief.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 368: Tiger II</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the elevator down to the fallout shelter. Just as he was about to send the nutrient supply sample to Wang Fangpin and look at the results of the Tiger II project team, he happened to encounter the two people he was looking for in front of the lab.</br>
</br>
They seemed to be arguing over something.</br>
</br>
"Bring in X1 bacteria inside the fallout shelter?! Are you crazy??!" Tiger II's project lead Fang Wei shouted at Wang Fangpin.</br>
</br>
X1 bacteria controlled the zombies.</br>
</br>
"This is for experimentation, for science! And it's not like you haven't been injected with vaccines - why are you so scared?!" With spit droplets all over his face, Wang Fangpin roared.</br>
</br>
The two were arguing furiously with each other. If it wasn't for someone bumping into them and the guard standing by, the two "educated" people might erupt into a brawl.</br>
</br>
"And then? Create an X3 or X4 immune to the vaccine?" Fang Wei said mockingly.</br>
</br>
"Any experiments are designed safely; I only need a small strand of DNA. This is the distrust and bias of life science!"</br>
</br>
"X1 bacteria was detected on the touch screen of the quantum computer in the lab - do you think it's safe?" Fang Wei was enraged.</br>
</br>
Due to the limited experimentation equipment inside the fallout shelter, there was only one quantum computer capable of handling experiment simulation. The computer was pivotal to research in the 22nd century as a lot of complicated calculation and data modeling could only be completed by it. Although Fishbone base offered a reward of fifty thousand crystals at Sixth Street for anyone who could find an experiment-level quantum computer, unfortunately to this day, no news was heard. Therefore, all 17 research projects had to use the single quantum computer in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
"Oh my god, which dumb*ss didn't wash their hands before they touched the screen? I will investigate this, but-, ahh, boss." Just as he was about to erupt into another debate with his colleague, Wang Fangpin noticed Jiang Chen standing beside them and immediately shut his mouth.</br>
</br>
The people in the hallway dispersed when they saw Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What's going on?"</br>
</br>
Wang Fangpin cut in front of Fang Wei to explain: "This is what happened. Because the seaweed project has stagnated due to a bottleneck, I asked the guards to collect some cells from the zombies' neck to obtain X1 bacteria."</br>
</br>
"X1 bacteria? What does that have to do with the power-generating seaweed?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Because X1 bacteria have high photosynthesis efficiency. To increase the conversion of sunlight in the seaweed, one of my researchers proposed a possibility that from the X1 bacteria's nucleus, the DNA of the chloroplast could be implanted into the seaweed."</br>
</br>
"What if the seaweed ends up displaying similar characteristics of X1 bacteria?" Fang Wei interrupted with a sneer.</br>
</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, that's a big problem!]</br>
</br>
Fang Wei's words made Jiang Chen jump. He first thought that what Wang Fangpin did was right - research must be done at all costs. But when he remembered that this must be grown in the modern world, he instantly became worried.</br>
</br>
He didn't want "Resident Evil" occurring in the modern world.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible, you don't understand genetic engineering." Wang Fangpin's face was red and steamy.</br>
</br>
"But I understand the risk to technology." Fang Wei immediately countered Wang Fangpin's perspective.</br>
</br>
"Enough, stop arguing." Jiang Chen stopped their argument out of annoyance.</br>
</br>
The two of them both shut their mouths. But from the way they stared at each other, they were clearly still heated.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Wang Fangpin. "Transplanting DNA strands from X1 bacteria must be stopped now. Just like what Fang Wei said, research must be carefully designed and executed within safe boundaries. Any DNA samples injected with X1 bacteria must be destroyed.</br>
</br>
"… Yes," Wang Fangpin said reluctantly.</br>
</br>
Seeing as he got the upper hand, the tips of Fang Wei's mouth curved up proudly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted Wang Fangpin's shoulder and used an encouraging tone to comfort him: "It's great to take bold, innovative leaps, but the amount of risk can't be ignored. Also, here is a sample of the mass-produced improved nutrient supply. Take a look to see if it meets quality standards."</br>
</br>
Since his research was discarded, it would be natural for him to feel defeated, but Wang Fangpin wasn't narrow-minded. After taking a deep breath, he bounced back from his negative emotions.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
He took the nutrient supply from Jiang Chen and left.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen turned to Fang Wei.</br>
</br>
"Report this type of incident to the camp and in the future, don't try to solve incidents like this privately. You're not a barbarian - what can arguments solve?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Fang Wei replied, abashed.</br>
</br>
Internal conflicts could only be solved by remaining neutral. Jiang Chen didn't know any other methods to resolve strained relationships between researchers.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about this anymore. I heard the Tiger II's design is completed, so I'm here to take a look. Could you show me the model?"</br>
</br>
"Of course! Please follow me." When he heard Jiang Chen ask about the research project, Fang Wei immediately became energetic and hastily walked to the computer room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed him and saw the quantum computer.</br>
</br>
The quantum computer was similar to the "gaming computer" he picked up at Fallout Shelter 005, but its computation power was clearly a level above the mixed algorithms supercomputer. The machine was the size of a van and connected by all kinds of wires and cords.</br>
</br>
Just from its appearance, the quantum computer looked plain from the outside. But considering how carefully Fang Wei worked on it, it was easy to see how valuable this thing was.</br>
</br>
Quickly, a blue light surfaced from the hologram device and formed a miniature model of Tiger II.</br>
</br>
Different from the previous Tiger, the "Tiger II" was designed with a firing cannon. It had a length of 10.7 meters, a width of 4.1 meters, and the vehicle was rectangular in shape. The turret was located at the back of the vehicle with the barrel parallel to the front armor. It had a weight of 63 tons with the armor composed of A-type steel.</br>
</br>
"The Tiger II battlefield positioning is a tank destroyer while also supporting the artillery. Its defense is mainly concentrated in the front and turret armor. In addition to the main cannon, on the top of the turret is a 10mm machine gun to attack targets in close proximity. Of course, words can't reflect its actual combat ability - let me show you."</br>
</br>
After a brief explanation about the specifications of Tiger II, Fang Wei pressed another button on the control screen.</br>
</br>
The hologram graphics began to change as a dessert appeared underneath the Tiger II. Seven sets of weight-bearing wheels under the steel armor began to rotate as the Tiger moved at full speed in the desert. The environment then changed from desert to city, city to forest.</br>
</br>
"This is the model we created based on simulating real physical environments - it realistically replicates the combat ability of the tank. I'll demonstrate the actual combat effectiveness of Tiger II."</br>
</br>
With a stunned expression on Jiang Chen's face, Fang Wei proudly pressed a button on the screen.</br>
</br>
Giant letters surfaced on the hologram.</br>
</br>
[Battle Simulation]</br>
</br>
The environment changed again as the Tiger II model reappeared in an empty desert. At the same time, four soldiers with "Python" anti-tank rocket launchers appeared in four different directions.</br>
</br>
Four rockets launched simultaneously before they landed on the front, side, back, and turret of Tiger II. Flames engulfed the Tiger II, but when the smoke dispersed, only the back armor of the Tiger II received any kind of damage.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had witnessed the destructive power of the Python before. The "chief" tank destroyed in the civil war had a massive hole blown in its front armor. Though he never personally experienced the war, he saw the image captured by drones from the rocket striking the target.</br>
</br>
"Whether fighting against anti-tank weapons or weapons of other tanks, Tiger II is designed with survivability in mind. Of course, it's not meant to be a tank, so I don't recommend sending it to the front line to fight against the other tanks."</br>
</br>
Then Fang Wei demonstrated Tiger II's survivability against other pre-war tanks, and the results were impressive. Other than being unable to defend against the "Wanderer's" particle cannon, most of the tanks' blows could be absorbed by the front armor of the Tiger II.</br>
</br>
As for the power of the type-50 electromagnetic cannon, Jiang Chen saw it many times already so Fang Wei didn't need to demonstrate it. Compared to the previous Tiger with its cannon on the truck, only the Tiger II's armor was improved -the cannon itself didn't change.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Are you pleased with the Tiger II?" Fang Wei already knew the answer from Jiang Chen's expression, but he still asked proudly.</br>
</br>
Compared to Wang Fangpin's personality, Fang Wei was more extroverted. He had the pride of a scientist when he handled people and things. Although he restrained some of his personality in front of Jiang Chen, the dictator, his personality still subconsciously seeped through.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't mind. As long as people viewed these traits as a weakness, he could accept it.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I'm very pleased. What's the cost?" Jiang Chen smiled in satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"Everything is on this list." Fang Wei handed Jiang Chen a graphene card.</br>
</br>
The first few were okay, but the long list of rare metals gave Jiang Chen a headache. The lack of supply of the rare metals must be solved. It was still too difficult to fill industrials need by simply recycling.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 369: The Rare Quantum Computer</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the surface, he immediately found Xu Lu and explained to her his idea of deepwater mining.</br>
</br>
"Deepwater mining?"</br>
</br>
Xu Lu looked at Jiang Chen, puzzled. All detectable mines on earth have been mined clean. Even if the mantle beneath the deep sea a few kilometers below still has undeveloped deposits, because of the high cost of mining and the severe damage to the geological environment, the operation would be impossible to conduct.</br>
</br>
Also, the existence of space elevators significantly reduced the cost of space. 22nd century's mining operations were all focused on space mining. It was fair to say that deepwater mining was as outdated as coal power generation.</br>
</br>
"That's right, deepwater mining technology, preferably an automated system. Is that possible? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It is certainly possible since it is an outdated technology… But are there mining deposits along the coast of Wanghai?"</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about that, as to where to mine, I have my plans." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen has already spoken, Xu Lu nodded and agreed.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I will establish another research team to focus on the replication of the deepwater mining technology. However, currently there is only one quantum computer, if there is an increase in the project's progression, it will slow down the research speed of other projects."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was lost for a moment as he didn't know what research was currently being conducted and the reliance of the research on quantum computers in the 22nd century. A lot of people born after the war didn't understand either, but since Xu Lu came from before the war, she knew some elements of it.</br>
</br>
Acutely, she read the confusion on Jiang Chen face as she concisely explained the reasoning.</br>
</br>
Quantum computer's power calculation ability is precise enough to simulate the physical environment at quark level which would allow a lot of experiments to be simulated in a pure math state. It was not only easy to eliminate the possible interference in the experiment, but it could also simulate a chemical reaction that usually takes a few days to complete in less than a second. Of course, that's only one of its functions.</br>
</br>
When Xu Lu explained this, Jiang Chen finally understood why all the countries in the modern world dumped endless amount of money in the bottomless pit known as the quantum computer. Once completed, without any exaggeration, the country's research speed would exponentially increase.</br>
</br>
While a lot of organizations and countries all bragged about completing the initial stage of the quantum computer, with IBM and Google as the frontrunners, they were still far from the actual quantum computer. Also, although they are using quantum algorithm, the computer's computation speed can't even surpass traditional computers.</br>
</br>
</br>
Before material science had its monumental breakthrough, any bragging of the development of the quantum computer was merely gloating. Just like without the invention of reinforced concrete, it was impossible for skyscrapers to be built.</br>
</br>
"What's the ideal ratio of one quantum computer to project teams?" Jiang Chen gave it some thought and said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"From experience, the ideal ratio would be ten project teams to 1 quantum computer… But right now it is not feasible."</br>
</br>
There was only one in the fallout shelter with 17 projects all using it. With an additional project in deepwater mining, crowding would be an understatement.</br>
</br>
"Is there production technology for the quantum computer?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but we don't have the production capability," Xu Lu said with resignation.</br>
</br>
It made sense.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also revealed a smile with deep resignation.</br>
</br>
"Okay, since another research team cannot be added, the people on the surface shouldn't do nothing. Although it is hard to complete research without the quantum computer, they can still easily handle wasteland technology retrieving and information gathering."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Xu Lu nodded.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Rural area, north of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
A man walked along the cracked concrete road.</br>
</br>
A grey hood covered his face. However, from his torn clothes, he seemed to have experienced an intense battle not long ago.</br>
</br>
Because of the war, infrastructure such as bridges was mostly destroyed by the blasts, the Binjiang Bridge that stretched across Long River was broken into several segments, but it didn't bother him.</br>
</br>
While throwing a claw out of his right hand, he leaped over unimaginably and agilely swung across.</br>
</br>
Both feet stomped onto the ground.</br>
</br>
He gathered his balance and let out a breath. After he crossed the river, it would no longer be a part of Wanghai territory.</br>
</br>
The screeching howl of Death Claw came from the distance not far behind his back, but it quickly faded.</br>
</br>
He attached the claw back on his belt and took off his hood.</br>
</br>
"Phew, of course, it won't chase."</br>
</br>
The face, it was Lin Chaoen.</br>
</br>
A hologram map appeared two inches in front of his eyes, the mechanical eyes slightly turned as he directed his vision to the west.</br>
</br>
Wanghai rural area's zombie concentration was extremely scattered, but the density of mutants was relatively high. However, the mutants seemed to be different from the ones inside Wanghai; they didn't seem to demonstrate aggressiveness, at least not to the digitalized human.</br>
</br>
A Death Claw was wandering among the shambles, hunting for food. When it passed by Lin Chaoen, it only sniffed its nose before he gave up on the prey made out of metal and silica gel.</br>
</br>
A few survivors, hiding in the dark, fearfully looked at the Death Claw pass by Lin Chaoen. They were baffled at the fact that the Death Claw didn't attack this man.</br>
</br>
His electronic eyes scanned the survivors, but he chose to ignore them and headed to his destination.</br>
</br>
Aside from the two groups of bandits who wasted a few minutes of his time, he had a smooth journey.</br>
</br>
He headed west for two hours before he stopped in front of a warehouse.</br>
</br>
A man with a cigarette in his mouth walked out of the shadows. Along with him were a few soldiers holding rifles. From the symbol on their uniform, they were from the Crimson Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
"You are late." The man with the cigarette blew out a ring of smoke.</br>
</br>
"Got caught up along the way," Lin Chaoen apologized.</br>
</br>
The man glanced at the blood yet to dry on his face. He didn't ask for the reason as he took out his cigarette from his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Then let's start."</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen didn't answer him. He walked around him to the door of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
He put his finger on the circle on the warehouse panel.</br>
</br>
"Fingerprint identification?" The cigarette man asked.</br>
</br>
"Electric signal identification." Lin Chaoen corrected him concisely and backed away a few steps.</br>
</br>
The door opened, exposing the items stored in the warehouse.</br>
</br>
The man's pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
A full warehouse stuffed with B-grade steel. By crude estimation, there were at least 1000 tons.</br>
</br>
"It's hard to imagine how rich you are." Greed flashed across the man's eyes.</br>
</br>
At the Sixth Street, the price of one ton of B-grade steel was already 100 crystals. 1000 tons would sell for one hundred thousand crystals!</br>
</br>
But he thought about what his boss told him as the greed in his mind began to cool down.</br>
</br>
"It's the wealth of my father, purchased before the war." He looked at the cigarette man as Lin Chaoen didn't seem to mind the expression change on his face. Then he said emotionally, "Like our agreement, half of the steel's usage will be determined by you. The other half, I need you to follow my demand and produce the parts I need."</br>
</br>
After a pause, a noble smile appeared on Lin Chaoen's face.</br>
</br>
"Of course, if I don't see what I want to see a month later, some unfortunate events may occur."</br>
</br>
That smile was cruel.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen currently had no better ideas in regards to the quantum computer. He could only do his best to collect more information.</br>
</br>
Before he left, he said a few words to Xu Lu. He especially emphasized the research of military technology, the technology of the recovery of man-made islands, space elevator, and synchronous space station.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen headed to the Sixth Street by helicopter.</br>
</br>
After about ten minutes of flying, the helicopter arrived above the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
With an aerial view, the Sixth Street was indeed different compared to before.</br>
</br>
After Chu Nan became the acting general, he immediately tightened the control of the army and established strict rules. He also extended the free trade policy used by the Group of Ten. Even with a military dictatorship, the government didn't use any authority unlawfully. Compared to before, the military government led by him was fairer and more just.</br>
</br>
The benefits of his action was evident.</br>
</br>
Not only did the survivors from Wanghai city begin to migrate toward the Sixth Street, but even survivors in nearby cities also followed suit. While they increased the labor force, they also brought the technology necessary for the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The skyscrapers in the Inner Circle and the buildings in the Outer Circle began to look more prosperous. Jiang Chen noticed while being in the air that the underground sewerage entrance was now a part of the newly built wall of the Outer Circle.</br>
</br>
Other than that, small camps were surrounding the Sixth Street and scattered across the ruins. The camps were mostly built by businessmen stationed at the Sixth Street. Due to the price of land gradually increasing in the Outer Circle, they built their factories and camps outside of the wall. They paid taxes to the military government, follow the Sixth Street's laws, and accepted protection from the patrolling team.</br>
</br>
The small city was like a seed, spreading on to the barren land and bringing forth the birth of a new sprout known as civilization.</br>
</br>
The guide on the ground waved his signal sticks, notifying the helicopter it was safe to land.</br>
</br>
After coming to a complete stop, Jiang Chen jumped out of the helicopter and saw Chu Nan already waiting at the door.</br>
</br>
When the helicopter first appeared on the radar, Chu Nan immediately rushed over.</br>
</br>
"I haven't seen you in a while… How long has it been?" Jiang Chen exclaimed to his old friend.</br>
</br>
"Half a year already. Do you want to check my place out?" Chu Nan laughed.</br>
</br>
Compared to everyone else, he went through the most significant change. Jiang Chen recalled that when he first freed him from the basement, he still had naïveness on his face. But now, he was calm and reserved.</br>
</br>
"Of course, it is convenient," Jiang Chen gladly accepted his invitation.</br>
</br>
An ordinary looking car stopped in front of them. The driver saluted and opened the door for them.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was a ten-minute drive before the car arrived at the council building. At the top of the council building was the offices of the military government, and two of the rooms were Chu Nan's home.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan warmly invited Jiang Chen inside, and they sat on the sofa. Zhou Xiaoxia in casual clothes walked out to pour water for them. Just by looking at her, the former lone traveler's mental state seemed to have recovered drastically. Although he didn't know if she has regained her memory, at least she didn't live in the misery of the Huizhong Mercenaries anymore.</br>
</br>
The two chatted and began to discuss the development of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Because of the influence of economic growth, the total population of the Sixth Street grew from 53,021 last quarter to 82,102 this quarter. The number of factories increased from 37 to 239; the number of registered merchants went up from 301 to 2000, and there are 29 new mercenaries, 105 hunting teams, and 421 scavenger groups."</br>
</br>
"These are explosive numbers." Jiang Chen couldn't do anything but praise him.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan nodded. "Economic growth primarily benefited from the crusade last fall. The population growth was attributable to economic growth and political stabilization."</br>
</br>
"And your wise decisions," Jiang Chen mocked."</br>
</br>
"Haha, it is your wise promotion," Chu Nan said humbly.</br>
</br>
"Haha, don't give me that, your achievement is your achievement."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan didn't reply, but the smile on his face indeed showed proudness.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan cleared his throat as he continued, "After the good news, there is the bad news."</br>
</br>
"Oh? What's the bad news?"</br>
</br>
"The survivors that escaped from Jia city to the Sixth Street brought information from the west. This spring, the mutated humans attacked the Defenders from the Seventh Area. With the funding of the Dusk Church, they captured Jia city. Because of this, the number of trade routes decreased by 60% from Hang city, and the routes entering Wanghai from the southwest were practically blocked."</br>
</br>
After he listened to Chu Nan's report, he raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Jia city lied in between Wanghai and Hang city. If the mutated humans captured this area, the merchants between Wanghai and Hang must be affected. Compared to the bandits without an organization, the organized mutated humans were obviously more concerning.</br>
</br>
"And your opinion is?"</br>
</br>
"Organize the second crusade with the goal of freeing Jia," Chu Nan said succinctly.</br>
</br>
A rather aggressive proposal.</br>
</br>
"The second crusade? What's there to take away from the mutated humans?" Jiang Chen was somewhat surprised by the proposal.</br>
</br>
"Do you still remember their equipment?" Chu Nan with a smile looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Equipment?</br>
</br>
Other than heavy machineguns, and the armor on their body…</br>
</br>
D-grade steel!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly realized.</br>
</br>
"There are ample amount of steel reserves in the mutated humans' head. There was enough to turn them into armors and treat them as moving fortresses. The last crusade for the source of bacteria brought crystals here and ignited the fire of industrialization. And this crusade will bring the steel that will be necessary to fuel the flame of industrialization.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, it was an attractive proposal.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen could solve the problem of iron ores, C-grade steel required more than just iron; there was a high requirement for rare metals. The mutated humans' C-grade steel was there and available; it was undoubtedly a good choice.</br>
</br>
"When are you planning to act?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Departing in the fall, finishing by winter," He answered quickly.</br>
</br>
This guy clearly has been planning this as he even had a strategy in place. Departing in the fall and finishing by winter, it would leave an ample amount of time to prepare while finishing the battle before the mutated humans gain the advantage during winter. It was also the perfect timing to eliminate the obstacles before the next spring for the trade routes.</br>
</br>
Even excluding economic reasons, the mutated humans were a big concern. Even if the Sixth Street didn't send out a force in the fall, there was no guarantee that they would not invade during the winter.</br>
</br>
But it was approaching June, was there enough time to prepare the crusade?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to deliberate this in his mind.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"If we do fight, what's our probability of winning?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought Chu Nan would give him an accurate response, but he shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Hard to say."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"From the current command structure, even if we mobilize more troops, it would still be hard to win." Chu Nan was straightforward.</br>
</br>
"Changing the command structure… Do you have any recommendations?"</br>
</br>
Before he headed back last time, Jiang Chen had been thinking about this problem, but he didn't really have an idea. He has established the administrative structure, but the militarily one… To be honest, other than knowing how to play a few strategy games, he was completely illiterate in military knowledge.</br>
</br>
"I don't know too much about military command. Didn't you capture a Colonel? She probably knows more than all of us," Chu Nan said.</br>
</br>
A glimpse of awkwardness flashed across Jiang Chen's face as his eyes drifted to the side.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, she still hasn't given up her loyalty to the organization."</br>
</br>
With a slight frown, Chu Nan pondered, "That shouldn't be possible, is there something wrong with the chip… Do you need me to help you?"</br>
</br>
"No need, I can take care of it," Jiang Chen quickly rejected the proposal.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan took a moment to process before he looked at Jiang Chen dubiously.</br>
</br>
"Allow me to be honest, it is not wise to have compassion for the captive. Her knowledge is extremely critical to your cause, I hope general can consider seriously."</br>
</br>
"I will." Jiang Chen gave a vague answer, "I will do my best to reform the command structure. Do you have a preparatory plan for the crusade?"</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't want to continue on the topic, Chu Nan knew it was best to talk about something else, "Of course. First, is military resources. We can use the bank to distribute war bonds in order to fund the war. The payment will be the supplies obtained from the mutated humans. Then we will use the gathered funding to purchase from the major military factories for weapon and ammo, this will inject some life into the stagnate military industry. At the same time, the funding will be used to hire mercenaries and hunting teams, as well as pay for the salary of the soldiers reporting to duty."</br>
</br>
"Not a bad plan." Jiang Chen praised.</br>
</br>
A war that wouldn't cost a single cent, but would instead make money. Using the citizens' money to pay for the military bill of the Fishbone base, and using the orders to promote economic growth. It was a brilliant move.</br>
</br>
"What about the soldiers? How many soldiers can we mobilize?" Jiang Chen continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"Approximately 1000 soldiers."</br>
</br>
A sufficient number, Jiang Chen nodded, pleased. Including the 1000 slaves Jiang Chen purchased, he will have 2000 soldiers. Once training is completed, the Fishbone base's military personnel will more than double.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then the preparation for the crusade will be up to you, if there is nothing else, I will head out now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood up.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was about to leave, Chu Nan also stood up and walked him to the door.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Although he still needed to take care of some things, Jiang Chen was not in a rush. It has been more than a year; he wanted to see how developed the small city has become.</br>
</br>
After exchanging departing words with Chu Nan, Jiang Chen strolled through the Inner Circle before he headed to the Outer Circle.</br>
</br>
Compared to last year, this place did indeed become more prosperous.</br>
</br>
The buildings along the side of the streets were all renovated, a lot of them were bulldozed down and rebuilt into three or four story high buildings. Just by standing here, ignoring the yellowish green radiation dust, it didn't feel like the wasteland at all.</br>
</br>
Busy crowds; a variety of items. The lone travelers with rifles on their backs negotiated prices with the store owners while soldiers in carbon-nano combat suit maintained the order of the market. Other than the everyday clothes worn by the Wanghai survivors, there occasionally would be someone with drastically different looking clothes. Some were from Luzhou 400 kilometers away, some were from the Wu city, some were even from the North Alliance Area.</br>
</br>
While they brought crystals and goods, they also brought missing technology. For example, a useful smart mechanical dog that could carry up to 100 kilograms of supplies in all terrains eased the scavengers from carrying all the garbage. Another example was the silk from a species of mutated spiders. The silk could be produced into the chemical adhesive and used as a replacement to the commonly used adhesive. A lot of private factories already absorbed such technologies and started to manufacture these new goods.</br>
</br>
The former ghetto was already bulldozed down with apartment buildings being built. Most were private properties with a small portion owned by the military government as shelters. There were no more malnourished prostitutes. What replaced them were legally operated entertainment centers and sex workers dressed appropriately. There were no more refugees on the street waiting for their death. As long as the person was able-bodied, they could find a job in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The difference here compared to one year ago was the idea of civilization.</br>
</br>
"Don't miss the opportunity! Fresh shell grains! Take a look!"</br>
</br>
A merchant's shouting drew Jiang Chen's attention.</br>
</br>
A not-so-spacious store was crowded with people. Two mercenary-looking workers were packaging the grains on the scale. The merchant in animal fur shouted while accepting payment from the customer and handing them the bags of shell grain.</br>
</br>
"Shell grain?" Jiang Chen looked at the bags of grains in surprise.</br>
</br>
He got closer and asked the merchant.</br>
</br>
"How much is this?"</br>
</br>
"One kilogram for three crystals, no haggling." The merchant didn't recognize Jiang Chen's face, so he must be an outsider.</br>
</br>
[It is similar to the price of a bag of instant noodles; slightly cheaper than rice.] Jiang Chen thought.</br>
</br>
"Where are these things being transported from?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
The merchant looked at Jiang Chen cautiously and didn't respond right away. He only said, "Are you going to buy it or not? If you are not, then move."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind his rudeness as he took out three grain-sized crystals and threw it in the merchant's hand.</br>
</br>
"Give me one kilogram."</br>
</br>
When the merchant saw the crystals, a smile quickly appeared on his face as he handed him a bag of shell grains with both of his hands.</br>
</br>
With the bag of shell grains in his hand, Jiang Chen stood there for a while before he walked to the warehouse area.</br>
</br>
When he arrived, Zhao Chenwu had been waiting at the door for a while. Beside him was another person, Hu Youde from the giant pit.</br>
</br>
Hu Youde's eyes lit up when he saw Jiang Chen and quickly went up to greet him.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, we meet again. I brought the slaves you wanted."</br>
</br>
"Where are they?" Jiang Chen looked around. There was no one else in sight.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, of course, it is not here. Slave business is usually done at the shelter outside of the wall. It is a rule set by you," Zhao Chenwu walked up and explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Could be a rule established by Chu Nan. Jiang Chen didn't know.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 372"/>

<div class="caption">Chapter 372: Mining Resources Deposition Map</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The three came to the slave trade area at the Outer Circle. After Jiang Chen paid the twenty thousand crystals, the one thousand slaves were transferred under his name. Escorted by Fishbone soldiers, the slaves in shredded clothes walked in the direction of the underground tunnel.</br>
</br>
They will be brought to the Fishbone base and receive three months of military training. If they successfully pass, they will be promoted to lower citizen. For the people that can't pass, they will be transported to the colonies for production work.</br>
</br>
Hu Youde gave an elaborative bow after he received the crystals from Jiang Chen and then left with his back hunched.</br>
</br>
"I bought something from a store at the Sixth Street… Do you know where these came from?" After he dragged Zhao Chenwu to the side, Jiang Chen took out the bag of shell grains.</br>
</br>
"Shell grains? I know about this. It was not until my trade fleet left the province of Suhang did I realize the wasteland was far bigger than we have imagined. In Jinchu land 600 kilometers away, the survivors there all grow these types of crops. Only recently did these crops arrive here." Zhao Chenwu stared at the bullet shell sized grains as he forced a smile.</br>
</br>
"How's the production quantity of these?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"The production quantity is substantial, but there is a strict requirement for soil quality. Only soil with both radiation and contamination below 20 could be used. Thus no soil in Wanghai fits this condition. Even in Jinchu, there is not a lot of land that can produce this crop. Although the plantation tower can grow this, the cost would be high.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu paused and grabbed a few grains out of the bag.</br>
</br>
"The starch of this type of shell grain possess a few types of special plant proteins because of its compact structure. If it were cooked into rice, usually the outside would be overcooked, but the inside would still be undercooked. Therefore, this type of shell grain would usually be used to make flour and then mixed with a special type of butter produced by mutant meat to make bread or cookie, or even alcohol. My trade fleet saw those in Wu city. Of course, when I saw that they could produce food… To be honest, I was surprised. I originally thought that only the Northern Area Alliance and some of the fallout shelters could produce food, but somehow people managed to discover an edible mutated crop."</br>
</br>
Radiation brought too many surprises to this land. Similar to no one knowing what monsters would walk out from the nuclear pit, no one knows what treasures are hidden inside. When the plants from the old world could no longer grow on this piece of soil, new plants of the new world replaced them and prospered.</br>
</br>
"Would this type of mutated plant not accumulate toxins?" Jiang Chen was confused.</br>
</br>
In his impression, the reason why most of the plants on the wasteland land could not be used was due to the toxins in the soil accumulating in the plant itself. It was the reason why mutated fruits were not edible and could only be used as ingredients for nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
</br>
"The shell grain is unique. The toxins are accumulated in the shell of the grain so it can be edible without throwing it into the organic converter." Zhao Chenwu let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
This was not good news. With the crop flowing into Wanghai, it would impact the monopoly that the Fishbone base and Zhao corporation have in the food business. Although the taste was nowhere comparable to rice, for the poor that could not afford rice, it was a good substitute.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was silent, Zhao Chenwu proposed.</br>
</br>
"I recommended Chu Nan increase the tax on shell grains."</br>
</br>
"Oh? His response was?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Free trade." Zhao Chenwu shrugged helplessly.</br>
</br>
"He has the same idea as me."</br>
</br>
"Okay, since this is your business." Zhao Chenwu saw that Jiang Chen was not moved, sighed, and didn't insist.</br>
</br>
Protectionism was meaningless other than making the poor unable to afford the top grain, even if they didn't eat this, it was unlikely they would purchase the food they couldn't afford anyway.</br>
</br>
Subjectively speaking, the shell grains existing in the Sixth Street would be helpful in boosting the population. Only with enough food could it feed more people. From a long-term perspective, its entry is more beneficial.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After he departed with Zhao Chenwu, it was getting late. Therefore, Jiang Chen decided to stay the night at Paradise Island hotel.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen took the helicopter back to the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
One thousand slaves stood at the square in front of the community center, under the statue of the Mother of Death Claw. The slaves' clothes were all replaced with Fishbone's uniform. Although they were not at ease with what was happening, they didn't have room to resist with a rifle pointed towards them.</br>
</br>
Cheng Weiguo was on top of the temporarily installed podium and was lecturing the new recruits. He then announced the rules of the Fishbone base as well as the training plan for the next three months.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen avoided the square and returned to the mansion before he went to Yao Yao's room.</br>
</br>
The bedroom door was open when he walked in. The loli was working on a mechanical helmet.</br>
</br>
"Ahh, big brother is back, is there something you need me for?" Yao Yao's eyes immediately lit up with stars when she noticed Jiang Chen. She took off her welding mask and turned around in joy.</br>
</br>
Her thin legs dangled on the side of the chair as they matched perfectly with her pink dress.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, there is something. What is this?" Jiang Chen rubbed her head.</br>
</br>
"A brainwave signal converter device. If sister Xiaorou could put it on, she could walk without a wheelchair," Yao Yao's large eyes as she said in happiness.</br>
</br>
"Really? Then thank you Yao Yao."</br>
</br>
With a shy blush on her face, Yao Yao smiled. "It is all Lin Lin's work, I only worked on the database and chip processing."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin? He didn't think she would care so much for other people. Jiang Chen was delighted by the thought.</br>
</br>
"Big brother has something that Yao Yao can help with?" Yao Yao blinked her crystal-like eyes as she scanned Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. Sun Jiao copied the library's database to your place right? Could you search for me if there are mining resources deposition maps in there."</br>
</br>
"Mining resources deposition maps? Let me look for them."</br>
</br>
The white stocking covered feet was just long enough to reach the slippers on the floor. Yao Yao slid her chair to the other computer table as she rapidly typed on the screen. A blue loading bar appeared in the middle.</br>
</br>
Half a minute later, 37 search results popped up.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood behind her as he confirmed map by map, but he didn't see anything he wanted.</br>
</br>
"Why are these all production output data… No specific deposition information?" Jiang Chen forced a smile.</br>
</br>
"… Sorry, I didn't manage to help you." Yao Yao lowered her head in disappointment.</br>
</br>
"No, it is not Yao Yao's fault. Perhaps this geological information is too sensitive and not recorded in the city library's database," Jiang Chen comforted her.</br>
</br>
It made sense. How would these key information appear in a library open to all everyone?</br>
</br>
"…if it is not in the library, would it be at the Wanghai Geology Ministry?" Yao Yao suggested. She didn't want to just give up.</br>
</br>
Ministry of? That's a good idea.</br>
</br>
"Could your computer search for the location of it?"</br>
</br>
The map on the EP was only an aerial map. It could only recognize stations, airports, hospital or other prominent landmarks.</br>
</br>
"No problem, leave it up to Yao Yao! The library's database has city maps from before the war… Here it is." As she said this, Yao Yao already dragged out the map and presented it in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"On the outskirt of the city center?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen with a frown stared at the red dot on the map.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 373: Airborne</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The helicopter engine roared.</br>
</br>
Sitting in the cabin, Jiang Chen conducted a final check of the equipment on him. He was wearing the new sample model of the T-4 power armor.</br>
</br>
Pitch black painting and thick front armor. The armor renowned for its defense looked a lot more reliable than the T-3.</br>
</br>
"Weapon system, functional, power system, functional…"</br>
</br>
Lights flashed as Jiang Chen scanned each of the modules of the power armor. Although there were some differences to the operating system compared to the T-3, the look remained mostly the same.</br>
</br>
The cursor in his field vision moved with the focal point of his pupils. After he confirmed that all systems were operational, Jiang Chen grinned at the T-3 across from him.</br>
</br>
Of course, throw the metal box, he knew she couldn't see him.</br>
</br>
"Are you a kid?" Sun Jiao mocked.</br>
</br>
"Eh?"</br>
</br>
"Remember to close your communication channel next time you chuckle like that," Sun Jiao, without any consideration of his dignity, continued to mock him.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao beside Jiang Chen giggled discreetly while covering her mouth. She was not in a power armor but had an earphone attached to her mouth; she could obviously hear their conversation.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang in a carbon nano suit had a Ghost Sniper Rifle in his hand. He sat there without saying a word. From the not-so-expressive face, Jiang Chen couldn't determine if he had no reaction or was trying hard not to laugh.</br>
</br>
As to the two other soldiers in power armor, Jiang Chen guessed they didn't dare to laugh.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao put on the protective suit," Sun Jiao reminded her.</br>
</br>
They were about to enter the high radiation zone.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Yao Yao obediently took out the full grey body protective suit and stepped inside.</br>
</br>
The mission was simple, airdrop at the Ministry of Geology and retreat by helicopter.</br>
</br>
Combat units: four power armors, one sniper, and one hacker.</br>
</br>
To conduct a mission in the zombie concentrated city center, there was no use in having an advantage in numbers. Unless an army was sent, there was no way you could outnumber the zombies. Of course, there was no point to do that just for a resource deposition map.</br>
</br>
Because the helicopter was equipped with the Type-50 electromagnetic cannon, not including the pilots, it could only transport a maximum of six power armors. Because the T-4s weighed nearly double the T-3s, they barely managed to squeeze in four people.</br>
</br>
With the consideration that they could encounter a Death Claw or other problematic mutants, the people executing the mission must have strong combat ability.</br>
</br>
However, while the Fishbone base had a lot of soldiers, most of them were slaves before. They did receive training, but their training was mostly just normal combat. Qingpu's survivors were all experienced hunters capable of hunting mutants, but Jiang Chen never allowed them to learn how to operate a power armor.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on the information security level of the Ministry of Geology, Yao Yao must follow them. She was young, but her gift in programming was not bad to begin with. After a year of extensive studying, no one had better skills than her in the entire base.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao disagreed with Jiang Chen coming along as she stated that she would protect Yao Yao, just like when they robbed the vault together. Nonetheless, Jiang Chen was still worried as it was near the city center. The danger level was nowhere comparable with the banks at Qingpu, so he insisted on going with them.</br>
</br>
"Arriving at the target location," The pilot's voice sounded in the public channel.</br>
</br>
"I am the first post."</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang stood up, grabbed the descending jetpack on his back, and walked to the hatch.</br>
</br>
The hatch opened as turbulence flooded in.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao tightly held onto Jiang Chen's hand and narrowed her adorable eyes.</br>
</br>
Zhang Gang bumped fist with the gunner inside the hatch and then jumped down without hesitation.</br>
</br>
He landed on a skyscraper a thousand meter away from the Ministry of Geology to provide sniping support while guiding the cannon.</br>
</br>
The hatch door didn't close; the helicopter moved forward another one thousand meters before it hovered over their destination.</br>
</br>
"Prepare to depart," Jiang Chen spoke in the public channel, then squeezed Yao Yao's hand, and walked to the hatch.</br>
</br>
"First time parachuting?" Sun Jiao spoke into the private channel.</br>
</br>
"I have tried countless times in the virtual reality training chamber."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned, and then followed the person in front of him, jumping from a thousand meters above ground.</br>
</br>
The chilling wind swept across the surface of the armor, the turbulence screeched beside his ears.</br>
</br>
Different from the training inside the virtual reality chamber, there was no loading here, there was no opportunity to redo once failed.</br>
</br>
"Height 900 meters." Sun Jiao's calm voice transmitted from the public channel.</br>
</br>
"700 meters-"</br>
</br>
"500 meters."</br>
</br>
"Open the descending device."</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen activated the turbine engines behind him.</br>
</br>
The eerie blue flame burst out as the drag force quickly halted the rapid downfall of the power armor. The scenery on the ground gradually increased in size. Through the helmet, Jiang Chen already saw the street tightly packed with zombies.</br>
</br>
The airport was nearby, and before the war, it was a high traffic area. The dead bodies not cleaned up were the culture of X1 bacteria.</br>
</br>
The engine output was at its maximum. Jiang Chen adjusted his landing position with both feet directed at the ground.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Concrete dust scattered everywhere as two giant pits appeared on the concrete ground.</br>
</br>
The zombies' blank stares moved in their direction as their eyes began to turn a bloodthirsty red. The daytime was not its home field, but this didn't mean they will let the living creature beside their mouths escape.</br>
</br>
Without stopping, Jiang Chen immediately raised his left leg and swept away the zombies leaping at him like a hammer.</br>
</br>
The trident revolving machine guns rotated as bullets splashed out like raindrops. It took down a giant area of zombies.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the other power armors all landed.</br>
</br>
"Enter the Ministry of Geology," as soon as she gained footing, Sun Jiao immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
"Understood."</br>
</br>
Three replies echoed as the four quickly moved towards the building.</br>
</br>
Because it was located at the outskirt of the city center, they were uncertain about the stability of the building. The power armor's landing location, therefore, couldn't be chosen on the roof of the building. The threat of a thrower and an acid bug that possessed long-range threat meant that the helicopters couldn't be too close to the ground, so the four could only drop onto the street.</br>
</br>
They dashed into the door. Jiang Chen who was responsible for the securing the backend kicked a few zombies dashing at him to the other side of the street. Then he fired his machine gun at the waves of zombies.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a thousand meter away.</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang crawled onto the roof with the crosshairs at the zombies flooding towards the Ministry of Geology.</br>
</br>
In the scope, a three meters high thrower waved its feeble legs, and giant stomach stumbled towards the door before it threw the infant zombie in its hand.</br>
</br>
The infant sized zombie was aimed directly at Jiang Chen, but it was dissected into several parts by a bullet.</br>
</br>
"Distance 1100 meters."</br>
</br>
Zhao Gang took a deep breath and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
Over 1100 meters in the distance, the sniper rifle bullet penetrated the neck of the thrower without any doubt.</br>
</br>
The black blood splattered everywhere, and the thrower immediately died. At the same time, its stomach blew up as a bunch of zombie infants crawled out and let out terrifying screams.</br>
</br>
It was the monster that was the most difficult to deal with in the city center. The infant zombies would expand rapidly when it approached its target. Then, it would blow up and emit highly concentrated zombie bacteria. Although these type of attacks were ineffective against the power armor that defended against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, it was the most difficult to deal with to the rather slow infantries.</br>
</br>
Not far away in the distance, a few more throwers were moving towards the Ministry of Geology. Even two Roshans were slowly moving in their direction.</br>
</br>
"Should be ready?"</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen's hand signal, Zhao Gang understood. He aimed the crosshair at the waves of zombies as he flipped open the laser mark switch.</br>
</br>
"10 kilograms mass bomb loaded."</br>
</br>
"Fire-"</br>
</br>
Followed by the rumble that broke through the sound barrier, one bomb landed from the sky and smashed into the middle of the zombies.</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
The shells scattered as it completely swept the area.</br>
</br>
When the dust faded, Jiang Chen and the team already retreated into the building.</br>
</br>
The zombies who had lost the target roared for a moment longer before they returned to their slowness.</br>
</br>
"Direct hit, nice shot." Zhao Gang grinned and closed the laser marker.</br>
</br>
Just like the plan, this mission was not difficult.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Using the stairs, Jiang Chen headed up to the roof and placed the airdrop marker on a relatively flat piece of ground.</br>
</br>
After about fifteen minutes, Yao Yao drifted down from the air with the descending jetpack in a trial of blue flames.</br>
</br>
It was her first time parachuting. When the girl landed, her body was still tensed up. Not until Jiang Chen took off her jetpack did her pale face gain back some life.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao observed the zombies returning to peace on the street. "Ok, all is ready, prepare for action," she ordered in the public channel as she took out her tactical rifle.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Including Jiang Chen, the three all took out their weapons, locked and loaded.</br>
</br>
"Don't be afraid, follow me." Jiang Chen comforted the girl in the private channel.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's face turned slightly red as she followed behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The excessive protection and the happiness it brought almost made her dizzy. Although it was not the first time she was out executing a mission, it was her first time with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The space inside the Ministry of Geology was spacious, and the transparent rotating stairs headed deep into the ground. From the design of the stairs alone, Jiang Chen felt the deep ill intention of the designer. It was a statement against people who feared height. But what he didn't know was that these stairs were made mostly for decoration purposes. In the highly digitalized 22nd century, rarely did people choose such an outdated method to move.</br>
</br>
The building design extending down was standard in the 22nd century. To stuff in the ten billion people in PAC while retaining arable land, it was a must choice for history to expand downwards. The wealthy people lived in the skyscrapers, and the poor lived at the base of it. This was the culture before the war.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao without combat ability stayed in the middle with Jiang Chen while a T-4 soldier in front scouted for any dangers in the dark building.</br>
</br>
"Why are there no zombies inside this type of building?" Jiang Chen asked Sun Jiao in the private channel.</br>
</br>
Since they were in the office area, there should be a lot of bodies here.</br>
</br>
"Two possibilities. The people here before the war evacuated on time, or it may be a mutant nest." Sun Jiao scanned the dark zone with her tactical flashlight.</br>
</br>
"Which possibility do you lean towards?"</br>
</br>
"Nobody, should be the first?" Jiang Chen was unsure.</br>
</br>
"Why a questioning tone?"</br>
</br>
"Because there is no absolute in the wasteland. After being peaceful for so long… I feel like my instinct is a bit dull." Sun Jiao sighed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't respond as he was even more alert than before. The mechanical crosshair moved to every corner where danger could arise.</br>
</br>
For some reason, the underground without a bottom made him feel unsettled.</br>
</br>
</br>
15th floor underground.</br>
</br>
When they stepped down the last stair, the five finally came to the bottom. Jiang Chen opened the map to confirm the location of the data center before he walked to the hallway near the wall.</br>
</br>
"Dam*it, what is this?" A soldier poked the egg on the wall with his muzzle as he cursed in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Don't touch anything!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao shouted in the public channel as the soldier immediately moved back.</br>
</br>
"What is that?" Directing a flashlight towards it, Jiang Chen stopped as he looked at the watermelon-sized eggs along the wall.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao went up and examined it carefully.</br>
</br>
"I don't know… I have never seen this before. The database in the EP doesn't show anything yet. Should we collect some for sampling?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned the disgusting eggs that gave him goosebumps.</br>
</br>
"Do it when we leave." If the eggs are connected to the mother somehow, damaging it would create unnecessary uncertainties.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao looked around anxiously. For some reason, she had an ominous feeling.</br>
</br>
Feeling Yao Yao's unease, Jiang Chen comforted her in a soft voice.</br>
</br>
"Don't be afraid, I will protect you."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… I heard a weird voice."</br>
</br>
"Voice?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned, he didn't hear anything.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao said in a low voice, "It's a weird kind of noise. Perhaps it's just my illusion, don't worry."</br>
</br>
Illusion?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hesitantly looked down the hall. Since they were already there, it was not his style to return empty-handed.</br>
</br>
The five people continued to move, with Jiang Chen leading. After the discovery of the eggs of an unknown creature, no one let their guard down anymore as they used 200% of their focus and cautiously looked out for any potential threats.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao still tightly followed behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Although the cold armor didn't feel like his warm temperature, the close distance made her feel more at ease.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, the eggs are everywhere." A soldier cursed out as his rifle pointed at the glass down the hall. The flashlight light up the entire room as the eggs filled the space.</br>
</br>
"Try not to alert them, finish as soon as we can," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
After they passed through the last door, they finally reached the data center.</br>
</br>
Inside the circular room was four screens that pointed in each direction. On the outskirt of the room were computers that stopped functioning. Along the arc-shaped dome, light filtered through. Paper documents and broken touchscreen were scattered everywhere on the floor. Together with the dust. it made a crunching sound when stepped on.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao walked into the room as she gently put her hand on her left chest.</br>
</br>
The sound was getting closer.</br>
</br>
For some reason, the faint static noise made her feel comfortable.</br>
</br>
She wanted to say something, but she clenched her teeth and resisted the temptation. Although she enjoyed Jiang Chen's care for her, subconsciously she didn't want him to treat her as a child that must be protected.</br>
</br>
Two soldiers guarded the door, Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao brought Yao Yao forward.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao took out the backup crystal fuel rod and inserted it into the backup power slot of the server. The faint sound of electricity flowing appeared. After many years, the servers finally flashed the light green indicator light.</br>
</br>
"Start." Jiang Chen encouragingly looked at Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao nodded and walked to the computer.</br>
</br>
But at that time, the screens lit up.</br>
</br>
A familiar face appeared in the middle of the screens.</br>
</br>
"That's surprising, we meet again."</br>
</br>
Looking at the completely shocked Jiang Chen, Lin Chaoen sneered.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 375"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 375: We meet again</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Yao Yao blankly stared at the person on the screen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen subtly raised his muzzle, but Lin Chaoen raised his hands, surrendering.</br>
</br>
"Don't overreact, are you not going to wait for me to finish?"</br>
</br>
"Instinct tells me that it is not words I want to hear." Maintaining his shooting position, Jiang Chen locked right onto him.</br>
</br>
Lin Chaoen?</br>
</br>
Why would this guy appear here?</br>
</br>
"Who is he?" Sun Jiao looked at Lin Chaoen with a frown.</br>
</br>
"A robot that always causes trouble for me. Whether it is intentional or not," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, you may have mistaken." Lin Chaoen waved his hands and smiled, "I don't have any intention to cause anyone trouble, or rather, I am your only destination."</br>
</br>
"Destination?' Jiang Chen had a dubious smile.</br>
</br>
"That's right, nothing is more adaptable than a metallic body in this miserable world. Join us, we'll grant you the perfect body. A body that will never age, and never die." His smile was noble, but it shined the same way as a demon's.</br>
</br>
"Just like you?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Stronger than me." Lin Chaoen's smile was bright.</br>
</br>
[Looks like it didn't take much to convince him. Therefore, the Sixth Street will be part of supreme's territory.]</br>
</br>
"In your dreams." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The smile froze on Lin Chaoen's face.</br>
</br>
"Then that's disappointing." Lin Chaoen sighed.</br>
</br>
As an intermediate artificial intelligence, he didn't have anger as an emotion. Or rather, even his smile was fake.</br>
</br>
As his words died down, a sharp screech came out of the datacenter. Immediately followed by the sound of bubbles bursting.</br>
</br>
"What happened!" Sun Jiao's became alerted as she aimed for the door.</br>
</br>
The two soldiers raised the revolving machinegun on their left arm and anxiously aimed at the empty hallway.</br>
</br>
"Poison teeth spider, an interesting bug."</br>
</br>
The door to the side of the hallway opened.</br>
</br>
The dense sound of the floor being scratched diffused through. Under the light of the flashlight, spiders the size of a shepherd moved its furry legs and flooded the room to the data center at the end of the hallway.</br>
</br>
"Fire!" Sun Jiao shouted and first pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Tatata-!</br>
</br>
The sparks from the bullets wavered in the hall and shredded the spiders into pieces. Flesh could not stand the test of machineguns, but machineguns could not sever the flow of the water. The endless amount of spiders like turbulent floods flowed forward, crushing the dead bodies before them.</br>
</br>
Dam*mit! Too many!</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gritted her teeth; her finger locked on the trigger.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a grenade was launched, and fire exploded inside the hallway.</br>
</br>
Dark green blood and severed corpses splattered onto the two soldiers' faces.</br>
</br>
Four more grenades were launched as flame filled up the enclosed space.</br>
</br>
</br>
After the flame dispersed, the burning smell of flesh filled up the entire hallway. Traces of unextinguished flames still remained on the ground, but not a simple, complete Poison Teeth Spider could be found.</br>
</br>
Burning grenade, the terminator of all carbon-based creatures.</br>
</br>
"When did robots learn how to breed bugs?' Jiang Chen put down the gun and looked at Lin Chaoen in disgust.</br>
</br>
Although he knew that with the mask of the power armor, Lin Chaoen could not see his disgust.</br>
</br>
"I only closed the subwoofer suppresser that prevented these little things from breaking their egg. If you have time, why don't you give the disgusting but cute pets a new name? Since as intermediate artificial intelligence, I don't have any creativity," Lin Chaoen said courteously.</br>
</br>
"Voice… disappeared." Yao Yao released her hand pressed to her chest and stared at the person on the screen.</br>
</br>
Because she spent a lot of time on electronic devices, she was sensitive to this type of noise.</br>
</br>
"That's right, disappeared." Lin Chaoen gently smiled," Therefore, it should come out too."</br>
</br>
The ground began to tremble as a series of sharp glass shattering noises came from the room across the hallway, but then quickly faded.</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen was concerned.</br>
</br>
Shining a light in that direction resulted in emptiness.</br>
</br>
"Are you really not going to consider surrendering? If you are willing to receive the salvation of the supreme, I may consider sparing you." Lin Chaoen smiled.</br>
</br>
"I'm willing." Jiang Chen's face never blushed when he lied.</br>
</br>
"There is a special medicine on the table at the corner. Although it is not prepared for you, drink it-"</br>
</br>
"In your dreams." Jiang Chen lifted the rifle and unleashed the bullets.</br>
</br>
The screens shattered.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao, extract the data." Jiang Chen ordered calmly.</br>
</br>
"Ah, ah! Okay." Yao Yao recovered from the shock as she returned to the screen and her fingers rapidly moved between the keys.</br>
</br>
"Sun Jiao, deploy the drones."</br>
</br>
"Okay!"</br>
</br>
The hummingbird drones were released from the back storage into the hallway.</br>
</br>
After it stabilized its position in the air, the drone flew to the hallway across dein them as it shared the image from its camera to the team.</br>
</br>
But the instant the drone crossed the door, Jiang Chen saw an angry face.</br>
</br>
The deathly silk covered every inch of the ceiling as the giant body filled up the entire room. Its terrifying teeth were like manes as they densely filled the mouth.</br>
</br>
A giant spider.</br>
</br>
The thick hair and teeth gave Jiang Chen a daunting chill down his spine.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't know how to read the expression of a spider, it must be furious right now since he probably just saw them kill all of its children. He then recollected the subwoofer suppressor that Lin Chaoen mentioned as he tried to figure out the relationship between Lin Chaoen and the spider.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Lin Chaoen breeded these spider eggs and then used the subwoofer suppressor to suppress the mother spider at a specific location. While Jiang Chen didn't know why he bred these spiders, it must not be for a friendly purpose.</br>
</br>
The drone suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
Like a mosquito stuck in a spider web, it was glued tight.</br>
</br>
Then a black shadow cut through before the picture turned into a static white.</br>
</br>
"What are we going to do?" Sun Jiao asked on the private channel.</br>
</br>
[With this type of monster, the power armor is probably not enough.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
The girl was completely calm. Her fingers rapidly moved between the screens, hacking the security software.</br>
</br>
"The data is extracted!" It was a young but affirmative voice.</br>
</br>
"Could the subwoofer suppressor be activated?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"… No, it's already deleted." Yao Yao desperately tried to recover the deleted the program, but the opponent completely removed any traces of it.</br>
</br>
"Take the USB and get ready to leave," Jiang Chen reloaded and ordered.</br>
</br>
"But the outside-" Sun Jiao reminded him.</br>
</br>
"Helicopter, fire at the Ministry of Geology!" He connected himself to the pilot channel and immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 376: Retreat</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Fire at the Ministry of Geology?</br>
</br>
But aren't they inside?</br>
</br>
The helicopter crew only hesitated for two seconds before they executed the mission.</br>
</br>
As knights of the Fishbone base, the leader's order is absolute.</br>
</br>
"Target locked."</br>
</br>
"Fire."</br>
</br>
The gunner pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Buzz-!</br>
</br>
The 10 kilograms bomb penetrated through the three-floor high dome. The shattered concrete crumbled like an avalanche and dropped to the lower underground level. The explosion exposed the deep underground structure underneath.</br>
</br>
Rocks and debris rained down and penetrated the web and hit the giant spider on the back. Unfortunately, the slightly off-target bomb got stuck on the wall of the B12 level and didn't directly hit the giant spider, the collapsed concrete debris still destroyed the spider web and pinned the massive beast to the bottom floor.</br>
</br>
"Siiiiiiii!"</br>
</br>
The pained screech came from across the hall. The hurt spider moved its fearsome legs in an attempt to stand up.</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy, if this building collapses, we might-" Sun Jiao shouted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen continued to order, "Continue to fire."</br>
</br>
Boom-!</br>
</br>
The dust caused by the explosion covered the entire hallway. Jiang Chen covered Yao Yao with his arms. At the same time, the rumbling dust swept through the hallway and inside the data center. The falling rocks made a series of clanking sound on the power armor of the two soldiers.</br>
</br>
There was no more noise from the other side; the spider died.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao dusted off the rifle and gave Jiang Chen a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"You almost buried us."</br>
</br>
"I didn't, did I?" Jiang Chen shrugged innocently.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao hidden behind Jiang Chen peeked her head out, quivering.</br>
</br>
"It's okay now," Jiang Chen rubbed Yao Yao's head as he said lightly.</br>
</br>
"Woooo-" But the loli docked down covering her head.</br>
</br>
"Fool, your hands are full of dust," Sun Jiao mocked in the private channel.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had to retract his hand awkwardly.</br>
</br>
[This girl is getting more naughty, I'll teach her a lesson when we go back.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared back at Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
Though with the mask in between, they couldn't see each other's expression.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
He ordered the soldiers to take samples of the giant spider as well as the remaining spider eggs, then Jiang Chen ordered the retreat.</br>
</br>
Although the majority of the structure of the surface had collapsed, fortunately, the collapsed concrete blocks didn't completely drop underground to bury the team alive.</br>
</br>
The rotating stair was destroyed, Sun Jiao hugged Yao Yao, and the four power armors started to ascend with the blue trail of flames.</br>
</br>
It incident didn't alert the zombies, but the four giant metal suits attracted the attention of the throwers. This type of mutated zombie has an acute vision and a natural anti-air unit. It dragged their infant zombies and threw it at Sun Jiao near the shambles.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw this and took out his tactical rifle instantly. With his right hand holding the barrel, he swung the rifle like a baseball bat at the infant zombie.</br>
</br>
Follow by a stuffed sound; the barrel hit the zombie infant back into the air.</br>
</br>
It exploded back to where the zombies were.</br>
</br>
"Wow, this thing's explosive damage is high." Jiang Chen was caught off guard.</br>
</br>
"Thanks." Sun Jiao held the quivering Yao Yao as she playfully gave him a flirty look that he couldn't see.</br>
</br>
"Thank me when we go back." Jiang Chen was aiming at the frightening thrower.</br>
</br>
Bang-!</br>
</br>
A sniper bullet flew by and crushed its neck and managed to secure the kill before Jiang Chen could.</br>
</br>
Then a few more shots flew from the distance and broke the neck of the throwers that were threatening the team of five.</br>
</br>
Realizing what just happened, Jiang Chen gave a thumbs up to the far distance.</br>
</br>
The four power armors cut straight through the ruins. After ascending for 300 meters, they boarded the helicopter before taking off to the skyscraper one thousand meters away.</br>
</br>
After Zhao Gang boarded, the pilot closed the hatch and returned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his helmet when they flew out of the high radiation zone and let out a breath.</br>
</br>
"Did you bring the USB?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Yao Yao nodded.</br>
</br>
"Could you transfer the information to my EP?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
The power armor opened from the back as Jiang Chen squeezed out. He attached the nylon hook to the armor, extended his right arm, and put the EP in front of her.</br>
</br>
The loli took out the hologram computer and transferred the USB information inside before attaching the cord to Jiang Chen's EP.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then realized he performed an unnecessary action. If he knew that Yao Yao brought the hologram computer, it would be more convenient to view the data with that. To strive for stability, the screen of the EP was not only small but also without the hologram function. Looking at the world map was inconvenient.</br>
</br>
As the major economic city of PAC, the Ministry of Geology at Wanghai had a comprehensive set of information. Not only did it include the global mining deposition map, it even included the discovered deposition on the moon and Mars.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen called out the stats with the hologram computer as he found the location of Pannu Islands in this world.</br>
</br>
He filtered the earthquake information and other stats he didn't understand as he selected the mining deposition option.</br>
</br>
When he saw the series of dense red dots, Jiang Chen's expression instantly turned joyful.</br>
</br>
Like what he expected, there had to be mining depositions under the vast ocean territory of Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
East of Ange Island, the area near New Guinea, happened to be a rich deposition. Specifically in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Extending northeast, about two hundred thousand square kilometers deep of ocean territory contained 17 rich, rare earth depositions. The expected rare metal reserve was 9.8 million tons, which was 1.5 times the amount discovered by Japan in South Bird Island.</br>
</br>
Other than rare metals, iron, aluminum, molybdenum, copper, and gold also had an insane amount of depositions.</br>
</br>
It could not be described merely as a treasure; it was money raining from the sky.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to go back now to make Yang Yuan start the preparation of mining to solve the rare metal problem that has been giving him headaches.</br>
</br>
Underwater mining was a difficult task with technology level of the 21st century, but it was not a big deal for Jiang Chen. He trusted that the scientists of the 22nd century at the fallout shelter could solve a small problem like this.</br>
</br>
Of course, he obviously could not return now.</br>
</br>
If he did travel back while being one thousand meters in the sky, he would have to experience freefall the next time he returned.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Arrived at the Fishbone base, Jiang Chen calmed down from the excitement.</br>
</br>
The underwater mining technology was yet to be finished, so there was no use going back now.</br>
</br>
He parked the T-4 power armor in the armory and went to find Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
He handed the giant spider and spider egg sample to her as he asked her to send it to camp 27 as soon as possible for testing.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen stopped in front of the community center for a while as a wicked smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
[Lin Chaoen, playing with me? You really think I can't teach you a lesson?]</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 377: Bombardment</br>
</div></br>
Inside Liuding's radar station, twenty workers in old PAC marine uniforms stared at the screen anxiously.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man with a cap on gravely watched the red dot on the radar as a trace of the same anxious expression appeared between his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Did it launch?"</br>
</br>
"Launch confirmed." A drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead as the worker closest to the general typed on the screen with shaking fingers as it confirmed the reliability of the signal.</br>
</br>
[What did that bit*h Tang Miya do, didn't she say she reached an agreement with that lunatic dictator?] With eyes locked on the red dot ascending, the general cursed the person countless times already.</br>
</br>
"The missile is approaching the Troposphere."</br>
</br>
The general cursed and took out the phone from his waist.</br>
</br>
"Attention Cannon one crew, raise the electromagnetic cannon."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Since the failed mission last year, the heavy electromagnetic pulse cannon were not used for a long time. However, because of the Fishbone base's dangerous act, the cannon was reactivated.</br>
</br>
But everyone knew that if a war were to erupt, Liuding would be the eventual loser. Once the Fishbone tank bulldozed the feeble allies and approached the Bohai aircraft carrier, it would only be a matter of time before they sink Liuding.</br>
</br>
"The missile reached the stratosphere and had started to turn."</br>
</br>
"Landing spot confirmed, the target is Songjiang near the outskirt of the city center."</br>
</br>
"Alarm deactivated."</br>
</br>
In two short seconds, there was a comical turn of events.</br>
</br>
Alarm deactivated? Not target towards Liuding?</br>
</br>
The general was shocked.</br>
</br>
He thought that the dictator at the west of Wanghai finally couldn't sit around any longer as it was prepared to flash its evil fangs at Liuding. But he didn't expect that the ballistic missile's target was not Liuding or Liuding's allies, instead of an unknown force located in the city center?"</br>
</br>
The general processed this for a minute before he ordered.</br>
</br>
"… Attention air division, send a helicopter to investigate the target area."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Dongfeng-76 (Mimic) ballistic missile was developed and constructed by Jiang Lin from the aerospace department. It first displayed its massive destructibility in the war between humans and the mutated humans. With the help of the fallout shelter, Jiang Lin made further improvements to its design, such as replacing the engine, fuel, and modules, to finally complete the Dongfeng-76 (Mimic) ballistic missile.</br>
</br>
The Fishbone base manufactured a total of five and deployed them at low grounds near the rural area to replace the not-so-reliable giant firecracker. Using them to deter the threat of Liuding's massive electromagnetic cannon.</br>
</br>
Right now, in front of the launch pad at the Shenxiang colony, southwest of Wanghai, a few missile maintenance workers were conducting the last launching check.</br>
</br>
</br>
The number five launch pad deployed at Shenxiang received the order from the base leader Jiang Chen and immediately initiated the launch program.</br>
</br>
The green indicator light turned on as the target coordinate was inputted into the central control program of the rocket.</br>
</br>
"Target coordinate locked."</br>
</br>
"Engine ignited."</br>
</br>
"Launchpad separated."</br>
</br>
"Launch!"</br>
</br>
The thick white smoke blew across the street. The six meters high ballistic missile separated with the launch pad and flew towards the sky filled with radiation dust.</br>
</br>
The all grey ballistic missile pierced the cloud like a sharp sword.</br>
</br>
Then, like a thunderous fireball, it smashed into the ground.</br>
</br>
It was the coordinate Jiang Chen obtained from the bearded mercenary, because of their high defense power, Jiang Chen never confirmed if this place had a connection with Lin Chaoen.</br>
</br>
But it didn't matter anymore, Lin Chaoen completely and utterly pissed of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
[Robot? Digitalized human? Whatever your hidden secrets are, go to hell! I will use your base to test my weapon!]</br>
</br>
The radar on the apartment detected the ballistic missile, but before the sentry gun could point at the sky, the missile smashed down like a meteor right through the roof and blew in the middle of the apartment building.</br>
</br>
The high temperature even melted the concrete. The heat wave mixed with the scattered metal shards and concrete debris exploded the apartment into pieces.</br>
</br>
The shockwave of the explosion destroyed the structure of the apartment building.</br>
</br>
Five minutes later, two nearby apartment buildings also collapsed.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Standing inside the camp 27 command center, Jiang Chen watched the ruins on the screen.</br>
</br>
The shockwave of the explosion even made the drone five kilometers away shake.</br>
</br>
"Send a ground force to search the area."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Wang Zhaowu saluted and left the office.</br>
</br>
Just as Wang Zhaowu left, Xu Lu walked in.</br>
</br>
With a smile on her face, Xu Lu opened the tablet in her hand and reported to Jiang Chen, "The sample results are back. The toxin inside the spider egg has a hallucination agent which could cause people to display symptoms such as madness and foaming at the mouth.</br>
</br>
"Hallucination agent?' Jiang Chen said with a frown.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu nodded and continued.</br>
</br>
"Also, based on pharmacological analysis, the toxin's organic components have many similarities to the drug &lt;Happy Time&gt; sold by the merchant with an unknown identity… Based on initial deductions, the spider eggs are the primary ingredient to produce &lt;Happy Time&gt;</br>
</br>
Happy time…</br>
</br>
[The robot wouldn't need this type of medicine so it would be used for humans. Selling drugs to obtain crystals? Doesn't feel right… Lin Chaoen didn't seem like a merchant.]</br>
</br>
And the Dark Red Chamber of Commerce, they seemed to have a special relationship with Lin Chaoen.</br>
</br>
Supreme?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned against the chair and fell into deep thought with his eyes closed.</br>
</br>
If possible, he didn't want to start a war against forces with no conflict of interest. In the apocalypse, people have a lot of ideas. Including the Dusk practicing the escapist ideology, the PLA attempting to restore the 20th-century power, and the supposedly descendent of PAC – The Northern Alliance Area, as well as the force behind Lin Chaoen that represent supreme… From a pure interest perspective, Fishbone had no direct conflict with them.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he suddenly recalled the conversation with Academician Qin.</br>
</br>
"The rebirth of civilization must be accompanied by bloody brutality." Jiang Chen muttered his words.</br>
</br>
Xu Lu, standing not so far away from the desk, silently awaited his instructions.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the phone on the table rang and interrupted Jiang Chen's thoughts.</br>
</br>
He picked up as a soldier's face surfaced onto the screen. He saluted to Jiang Chen and reported.</br>
</br>
"Liuding helicopter entered the target area."</br>
</br>
"Liuding?" Jiang Chen scratched his chin.</br>
</br>
One of the reasons for launching the missile was revenge. The other reason being a deterrence for Liuding. Since the Dongfeng-76 was not cheap, using it simply for revenge against the force behind Lin Chaoen was too wasteful.</br>
</br>
"Don't mind them, continue to search the target area," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The soldier saluted again and ended the communication.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The search result came out soon after and Wang Zhaowu was summarizing and reporting the result to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The search team comprised of 30 soldiers along with an armored vehicle and two modified trucks mobilized to the destroyed apartment building at the outskirt of the city center. After two hours of thorough investigation, the search team managed to obtain some valuable information.</br>
</br>
From the shambles of the explosion, they found the remains of 20 sentry guns and two radars. The actual number would be much higher, but only those could be confirmed.</br>
</br>
Other than that, there was some special production equipment that seemed to be for the production of a particular type of parts. But due to the severity of the damage, the search team could not identify the purpose of the parts. From the mutated fruits used to produce nutrient supply, there were human activities there.</br>
</br>
There was another surprise that came out of the investigation. In a collapsed corner, they managed to found a half-damaged quantum computer. From the specification, the quantum computer appeared to be the experiment model. Although they didn't know if they would be able to fix it or not, they still hauled it onto the truck.</br>
</br>
The helicopter for Liuding didn't interfere with Fishbone's search, it only hovered from afar and didn't even send anyone down.</br>
</br>
The only thing that interfered with the research was the group of zombies that gathered because of the noise as well as a Roshan that happened to wander by.</br>
</br>
But just as they were about to retreat, the fleet was attacked by a group of militants with an unknown identity.</br>
</br>
The militants mostly used laser weapons and launched a sudden attack on the fleet when they were retreating. But the captain of the search team reacted quickly as he ordered the troops to take cover and fire back.</br>
</br>
The crossfire lasted for five minutes. Under the high caliber machine gun's unleashed fire, the search team's firepower was clearly at an advantage. After the militants lost ten something bodies, they quickly dispersed and fleed away.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard that the search team managed to find a quantum computer among the ruins, Jiang Chen immediately meet with the team's captain Zhu Zheng. He personally granted him the knight emblem to honor his contribution to the base.</br>
</br>
After sending the clearly astonished new knight away, Jiang Chen then looked for Xu Lu and used her to find the experts in quantum computers at the base to conduct an assessment of the destroyed quantum computer.</br>
</br>
Luckily, based on what the expert said, while the hard drive of the quantum computer received severe damage, the most critical processor damage was still within the limit of being fixable. Even with the current technology in the fallout shelter, they could fix the quantum computer.</br>
</br>
When he heard the good news, Jiang Chen immediately ordered Xu Lu to gather all resources and prioritize the repair of the quantum computer. For the research teams of the fallout shelter, it had more significant value to them.</br>
</br>
</br>
Especially the experiment level quantum computer, it was a God-sent gift on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
He didn't know Lin Chaoen's base would have this, but regardless, the treasure now belonged to him.</br>
</br>
After he delegated the work, Xu Lu took the elder quantum computer expert and left.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sunk into his chair again and faced the empty office. He took a deep breath and took out the restructure order he had half completed.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh… This is more troublesome than I thought."</br>
</br>
He threw the document on the table as he rubbed his head out of frustration.</br>
</br>
With law experts at the Fishbone base recommending suggestions combined with the political sense he developed during university while being part of controversial forums, he had already organized the rules and laws. It took him three months of work to develop a set of rules that was not too difficult and fitted the society in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The only tricky thing was a reorganization of the command structure.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen swept the pile of documents to the side and picked up the tablet at the corner.</br>
</br>
His finger slid on the tablet before a list of data showed up in front of him.</br>
</br>
"1517 soldiers, 1000 recruits, 323 knights… Eh? I already knighted this many person?" Jiang Chen muttered to himself as his finger continued to scroll.</br>
</br>
The logistic department leader Wang Qin recorded all the arms' information on this list.</br>
</br>
He had no clue at all.</br>
</br>
He sighed, got up, and left the office.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pushed open the basement door as he met the defeated female Colonel.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua's face was free of expression. Just like a marble sculpture, he could read the defined edge, but he couldn't read any emotional colors.</br>
</br>
With the emotionless face in front of him, Jiang Chen lost the ability to speak. What made him feel powerless was not the lack of conversational starters, but the lack of hatred on her face.</br>
</br>
That's right, hatred.</br>
</br>
Without the ability to hate, there would be no fear. If fear didn't exist, then there would be no compromise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to regret the pointless actions he committed.</br>
</br>
In the bright and silent basement, time quietly ticked by.</br>
</br>
"Are you just here to see me?" Han Junhua was the first to break the silence."</br>
</br>
"I… I just don't know what to say." Jiang Chen used an uncertain voice.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't respond, she looked away and seemingly lost interest.</br>
</br>
If she had any interest.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen seemed to have understood something.</br>
</br>
"I can somewhat feel what you feel."</br>
</br>
"Normal people can't." Han Junhua's response was fast.</br>
</br>
"The normal state can't." Jiang Chen paused. "Have you heard of genetic vaccines? You must have, people who are injected with it have a chance of developing a special kind of mutation."</br>
</br>
"The strand of DNA usually unexpressed?"</br>
</br>
"That's right! Hidden genetic code." Jiang Chen finally remembered the name.</br>
</br>
"So?' Han Junhua quietly looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"… Without emotion, it feels hard right?" Jiang Chen asked with a gentle voice.</br>
</br>
After he activated his abilities, it was the emptiness of completely removing his emotion from the body. He only experienced it twice, but the feeling would make him feel chilled every time he recalled it.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen in the eyes. "Rather than hard, empty is probably the better word."</br>
</br>
"Because PAC doesn't exist anymore, right?"</br>
</br>
Not because of her loyalty to PAC, not because of her responsibility, those things vanished the moment she was no longer the leader of the fallout shelter, those things faded away with her duty.</br>
</br>
But because that was the entirety of her life.</br>
</br>
Not until now did Jiang Chen finally realize this point.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't respond directly, but she asked back, "Have you heard of the Mental Commissar</br>
</br>
project?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Engrave ideology with electricity, and write the doctrine into the soul," Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
"No. The Mental Commissar project is targeted at humans, it is known as commander mass production project in the army. To put it in simple terms, it is writing the ideology into the brain like a program. The commander that passed through this project had the absolute right ideology and would not make an error in judgment because of personal emotions in any situation; it would also not bear the burden of responsibility because of the outcome. Normally, we would be used to execute some of the mission that can't be revealed to the world. For example, suppressing separatist, taking out protestors," Han Junhua said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned. He held his breath.</br>
</br>
He saw people who wanted to convert computers into human brains, now he has witnessed making the human brain into a computer.</br>
</br>
"This is…" He didn't know what word he could use to describe this.</br>
</br>
Evil?</br>
</br>
No, there is nothing eviler than the nuclear weapon. The instant war erupted, all morale and boundary became complete jokes. In the digitalized weapon, history may not be written by the victor, but only the victor had the right to judge history.</br>
</br>
He was born in a peaceful era, he couldn't experience the need for decisiveness people faced.</br>
</br>
"There is no need to have sympathy for me, all the people participating in the Mental Commissar project were self-voluntary."</br>
</br>
There was no regret on her face, only her eyes began to be covered in loneliness.</br>
</br>
"Just, after I completed the last mission, I don't know what to do anymore."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent, looking at the emotionless Colonel.</br>
</br>
He had made a mistake about her persistence.</br>
</br>
"Let's make a deal."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen with questions in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Emotions, although I am not a scientist, I trust that science will solve this problem. Help me achieve my ambition, and I will help you find what you have lost. How about that?" Jiang Chen looked at her eyes earnestly.</br>
</br>
"A new Mental Commissar in the brain? I don't think I want that."</br>
</br>
"No, it's regaining the emotion of a normal person." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua fell into a brief silence.</br>
</br>
"How can I trust you?"</br>
</br>
"Even if you don't trust, there are no better choices right?"</br>
</br>
"I want to ask, how can I trust that you can do it."</br>
</br>
"Is it hard to do?"</br>
</br>
"When I accepted the surgery, my commander told me clearly that I will become a being more closer to a machine than a digitalized human. Even if we win the war after everyone welcomed a happy ending, I still couldn't accept comfort other than honor."</br>
</br>
"Even with the most advanced technology before the war, it cannot deactivate the Mental Commissar?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Then you have more reasons to choose me." Jiang Chen snapped his fingers with a grin.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked at him.</br>
</br>
"I will return order to this piece of land. The technological research structure will be restored. Even if the 22nd century cannot solve your problem, I believe that in the distant 23rd, 24th, or even 25th century, your problem will be solved. Once everything is completed, I will arrange for you to enter the hibernation chamber in the future," Jiang Chen stared into her eyes and said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
She closed her eyes and gave it a long thought.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, she opened her eyes.</br>
</br>
"You convinced me."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After a week of preparation, the internal reorganization of the military government began.</br>
</br>
In the morning, under the statue of the Mother of Death Claw, Jiang Chen read the reorganization plan to all the survivors of the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
First was the political structure.</br>
</br>
The reorganization plan clearly defined the Fishbone base as a military organization. The sole military government will control all jurisdiction and divide the territories into two administrative zones.</br>
</br>
One is the economic zone, open to all survivors. It will be stationed with a military government force, established at "election" policy with a parliament. The parliament possesses a degree of rights to create laws, but the military government has the right to veto any laws based on national interest. At the same time, the military government would send out directors to oversee the economic zone. Just like the current structure of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The other is the military zone, closed to non-military personnel, following a militarized management system, and execute the slave to knight citizen structure. Everyone must swear their allegiance to the supreme leader and absolutely obey his command. Other than slaves, all citizens and knights will receive vacations of varying length, and they have the option to live at the economic zone during this time. But within the military zone, there is only order and obedience. The military zones were the Fishbone base, Shenxiang colony, and Camp 27.</br>
</br>
This model divided the hoe and sword but kept them dependant on each other. The tax revenue and source of soldiers would provide the necessity for the military zones, in turn, the factories at the military zones would form an independent company to export the excessive production capacity to the economic zone's market. Therefore, while it maintained the economics at the Sixth Street, it also retained the combat ability of the military zone.</br>
</br>
Also, to ensure this model operated with stability, while Jiang Chen announced this decision, he also provided another benefit policy to the survivors at the military zone which was a salary model. Other than the slave class, all other classes will receive a salary per month. The citizens would receive 10-20, the knights 50, and based on the functionality of the roles, the number would increase.</br>
</br>
Before the Fishbone base only provided food and not salary, but following the economic growth of the neighboring Sixth Street, continuing their tradition would cause the soldiers at the bottom to have other thoughts. So Jiang Chen used this opportunity to introduce this policy. Although it meant that the military government would have a salary expense of hundred thousands of crystals per month, but compared to the food business and the tax from the Sixth Street, Jiang Chen could afford to pay this.</br>
</br>
To the people loyal to him, he didn't mind that they lived a great life.</br>
</br>
</br>
Then, it was the arrangement in management.</br>
</br>
The highest position in the military government was general, and Jiang Chen would be taking the role. The highest administration unit position was the office of the general with Jiang Chen personally nominating people to form it. The office of the general's primary duties was to oversee the operation of other departments as well as the adjustment, promotion, and termination of all governors of each zone.</br>
</br>
The cumbersome departments were all rearranged with the newly reestablished administration department to manage all administrative and construction tasks in the base, while the logistics department was responsible for the production and distribution of all supplies. The administration department was appointed to the previous construction leader Lu Huasheng, and Wang Qin remained as the leader in the logistics department. The two leaders directly report to the general.</br>
</br>
Then it was the reorganization of the command structure.</br>
</br>
To avoid confusion in military command, Jiang Chen formed three corps as well as the relatively independent hunter corp and the soldiers in the base.</br>
</br>
The first corp commander was Cheng Weiguo, the second corp commander was Wang Zhiwu, and the third corp any commander was Zhao Gang. The number of soldiers per corp was set to 1000 for now and was formed with soldiers and armor units.</br>
</br>
The hunter corp commander was Ma Zhongchen, and he will be leading 200 soldiers. The units were primarily comprised of scouts and snipers. They were primarily assigned to special missions as well as supporting the other three company's operations during combat time. The soldiers were mostly lone travelers or Qingpu survivors from before. Their ability to survive alone was higher compared to regular soldiers. Working alone would maximize their value, and hence a separate corp was formed.</br>
</br>
As to Tiger, power armor, as well as other heavy armories, they were distributed to the three companies based on needs. The helicopter was assigned to the hunter corp to increase its mobility.</br>
</br>
Out of the 323 knights, the ones with a military position were distributed to each as lower level commanders. They were all injected with honorary chips.</br>
</br>
As to the specifics of the corps construction, Han Junhua meticulously completed it for him as she created a command structure from top to bottom. Jiang Chen left everything for her to complete by trusting her ability, and she did not disappoint.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the soldiers would never be in a situation of not knowing what command to listen to.</br>
</br>
At the same time, as to the name of the military government, the reorganization plan also clarified further.</br>
</br>
Since it resembled a country being formed, Jiang Chen could no longer use a canned food name as the name of the military government. Therefore, based on the opinion of senior officials and Han Junhua, he chose the name New Asia Corporation as the name of the military government, or in short, NAC.</br>
</br>
From the name alone it was enough to demonstrate a corner of Jiang Chen's ambition.</br>
</br>
These were all contents of the reorganization plan.</br>
</br>
In the era where civilization existed, the aggressive and invasive political body would obviously not form. But on the wasteland without any human rights and morale, there were no problems.</br>
</br>
Everyone was thirsty for a strong voice to create laws that must be followed on the wasteland. Even if it was flawed, at least it could bring the stability people desired.</br>
</br>
But needless to say, the majority of survivors were unwilling to be restrained. They long for stability, but they may not be willing to give up freedom because of it.</br>
</br>
As to how to balance freedom and order between the survivors, only time will tell.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Since the command structure is refined, I can start preparing for recruitment," Chu Nan standing in front of Jiang Chen's office said.</br>
</br>
Because of the significance of this reorganization, as the acting general of the Sixth Street, he would have to personally make a trip back. Of course, his position now was the governor of the Sixth Street, but other than the name, his duties didn't change.</br>
</br>
"How many people do you think we can recruit?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It would have to depend on the price we are willing to pay and the number of people," Chu Nan said.</br>
</br>
"Plan to recruit 3000 people with five-year contracts. All recruits would automatically receive lower citizen status and enjoy a salary of ten crystals per month. After the six months of training, all recruits that pass the test will officially receive the status of NAC soldier and be promoted into an upper citizen with a salary increase to 20 crystals. Try to complete this before mid-June. Is it doable?" Standing beside Jiang Chen, Han Junhua said concisely.</br>
</br>
It was the salary level of the regular soldiers at the three companies. Although the salary could not attract people with the ability to join, it would be attractive enough for people with low income to join. Especially once promoted to the upper citizen, there would be no restriction on supplies, even people with medium level income would be tempted.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan deliberated in his mind before he nodded.</br>
</br>
"It's possible."</br>
</br>
"Also, to the lone travelers, mercenaries, or hunters with outstanding abilities, if they are willing to join the hunter corp, NAC will offer them a salary of no less than 50 crystals. The contract will be for five years as well. Are there any questions?"</br>
</br>
Chu Nan shook his head. "Not regarding recruitment, but I do about the defense at the Sixth Street."</br>
</br>
"The defense of the Sixth Street will be the responsibility of the third corp."</br>
</br>
"What about the other two companies?"</br>
</br>
"The first corp will be stationed in Shenxiang town, responsible for border defense. At the same, Cheng Weiguo will be responsible for training the new recruits."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan agreed. Cheng Weiguo has trained new soldiers before. It would be best for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"The second corp is responsible for the defense of camp 27 and Fishbone base; hunter corp will await orders at the Fishbone base."</br>
</br>
"Also, I have another proposal." Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded as she had discussed this with him a few days prior, it was not a bad time to bring it out.</br>
</br>
When she received the acknowledgment from Jiang Chen, Han Junhua continued.</br>
</br>
"The current militia at the Sixth Street is uncontrolled by the military government, I think they should be controlled."</br>
</br>
"That's impossible." Chu Nan forced a smile. "Mercenaries, hunters, and scavengers have already become an inseparable part of the Sixth Street's economy. Not even accounting for that, we don't have the ability to incorporate them."</br>
</br>
"Not incorporating," Han Junhua crossed her arms and said emotionlessly, "Just better management. For example, use the military government's name to establish the mercenary association, record the information of all mercenaries, hunters, and scavengers on file, and rank them based on their credibility and mission completion record. For these mercenaries, they would have easier access to the missions and no longer need to worry about the delay in payments. For businesspeople, they would also no longer need to be concerned with questionable helpers. For us, we would obtain the sense of them belonging to the entire Sixth Street civil force."</br>
</br>
Therefore, to retain their credibility, the mercenaries with questionable backgrounds would act less reckless. The capitalists that bully and trick the scavengers would be more prudent with the existence of the mercenary association.</br>
</br>
Without considering the security aspect, just from a purely economic aspect, the proposal had many positive implications.</br>
</br>
Also, if it was necessary, he could charge a commission for all missions. Jiang Chen added that in his mind.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan was silent for a long time.</br>
</br>
He then looked at Jiang Chen, exclaimed and congratulated him.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you found a great advisor."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen revealed a bright smile.</br>
</br>
"I think so too."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was deep into the night. Most of the people were already asleep.</br>
</br>
But the Fake Leg Bar located on the business street was crowded.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries and the hunters sat together and drank the three crystals beer made with shell grains. They played poker, and they gloated about their rewards. The scavengers scattered at the corners chatted about the good looting spots they found. The females in revealing clothes leaned sluggishly against the bar counter while they waited for their prey.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping as the bartender stood at the counter and wiped the glass cups. He would occasionally chat with the familiar females. This boss/bartender was renowned among the people that lived on the knife's edge. To the people that caused trouble in the bar, none of them had a happy ending.</br>
</br>
Everyone tried to guess his identity. Some people even gave him a street name "The Bald Bartender".</br>
</br>
Of course, no one would have guessed that his real identity was a spy planted by the actual controller of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Old Li, you just returned from Liuding, did you have fun there?" A mercenary in mutant fur asked his old friend while burping.</br>
</br>
"Same old. It was so boring that it made people want to sleep." The mercenary with a buzz cut took a gulp of his beer and waved his hand.</br>
</br>
Compared with the prosperity of the Sixth Street, Liuding's glory gradually began to fade.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Haha, what about your goddess at the Screw Bar? I remember she was your crush." The mercenary on the side patted Old Li on the shoulder and laughed.</br>
</br>
"I haven't seen her. Probably not around the Wanghai area anymore," the mercenary known as Old Li said with frustration.</br>
</br>
"Hopefully she has not been captured by some bandits and is being used as a sex toy." Someone blew a whistle.</br>
</br>
"If you don't want to have a drink of toilet water, I recommend you close your d*mn mouth." Old Li stood up with a gloomy expression.</br>
</br>
The other mercenary didn't back down, but rather he blew a whistle to provoke him.</br>
</br>
"F*ck. Old Li, he is only joking, just let him go like a fart." The mercenary on the side immediately dragged him down and discreetly pointed at Zhou Guoping who had stopped cleaning the glasses.</br>
</br>
While the Old Li still looked pissed, he sat down. He followed his friend's finger. The mercenary with a foul mouth also retracted his neck and sat back down.</br>
</br>
Anyone that fight here probably doesn't want to live anymore.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping glared at them as they settled down. He then continued to wipe the glass in his hand but mocked them in his mind</br>
</br>
[Dumb*ss, your goddess probably has been played in so many different positions by a rich and powerful.]</br>
</br>
It was certainly a dramatic story. Chu Nan had already worked his way up to become a governor of the Sixth Street, and he still was the boss of the bar. He didn't even accept the notification to attend the reorganization plan.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although among the small characters, the name "The Bald Bartender" was renowned among the circle. But only he knew the exacts, as even compared with Zhao Chenwu, who surrendered to Jiang Chen, he was one class lower.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was afraid of encountering Chu Nan. Since he did touch Zhou Xiaoxia when he was a bandit in the Huizhong Mercenaries. While Chu Nan didn't seem to mind, Zhou Guoping knew well that he was probably worth less than a tenth of what Chu Nan is worth in the boss's heart, it would be easy for Chu Nan to take him out.</br>
</br>
Once the Fishbone base controlled the Sixth Street, the presence of the bar meant to collect intelligence became less and less important.</br>
</br>
Just as he was zoning out, the messenger he put below the bar buzzed.</br>
</br>
Like the usual, Zhou Guoping put the towel and glass aside and glanced at the messenger. When he saw the words on the screen, he took a moment to process it before an ecstatic expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Half a year later, the boss finally remembered him.</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping left the job to the other workers as he put on a coat and left the bar without wasting a second.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
To be honest, to the people with blemished morals, Jiang Chen didn't want to give them important duties. But after careful deliberation, the only subordinate that has worked with the mercenaries on a regular basis was Zhuo Guoping.</br>
</br>
So the position of the mercenary association leader was best fitted for him.</br>
</br>
Currently, Zhuo Guoping stood in front of Jiang Chen's table as he waited for instructions with his head lowered.</br>
</br>
"You are pretty fast." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I can't make you wait, I came immediately after I received the message," Zhou Guoping said while trying to flatter Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a document and put it on the table.</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, it is something good. Take a look at this document."</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping laughed obsequiously as he took over the document. He scanned through a few lines before he stopped.</br>
</br>
"Mercenary association?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. The leader of the mercenary association, I want you to take the position." With hands cupped together on the table, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Thank you bo-, Thank you, General!" Zhuo Guoping was so ecstatic that he almost called out the wrong name as the flattering action was only missing him kneeling down.</br>
</br>
"Okay, save the obsequiousness for later. This is your job. I already assigned the building of the association, it will be built across from the Sixth Street bank. Your job will be to establish it. I want to see results in a week's time."</br>
</br>
"I will complete the task!" Zhuo Guoping promised while pumping his chest.</br>
</br>
"Then go."</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping bowed and turned around. But when he reached the door, he stopped as if he had remembered something.</br>
</br>
"Also, that Fake Leg Bar-"</br>
</br>
"I will find someone to take your position. Your primary responsibility will be the mercenary association."</br>
</br>
"Yes.'</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping exited the door courteously.</br>
</br>
Half a minute later, Jiang Chen leaned in his chair and smiled at Han Junhua who was observing everything.</br>
</br>
"What do you think about giving his position to someone like this?"</br>
</br>
She only used two seconds to think.</br>
</br>
"Just by ability, he is the best candidate."</br>
</br>
Reputation among the mercenaries has more appeal compared to an unknown character. If it were Cheng Weiguo or Zhang Gang that acted as the leader, it would be hard to even form the association.</br>
</br>
"What other aspects?"</br>
</br>
"If I could read people's mind, I wouldn't have lost to you," Han Junhua answered honestly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't disagree.</br>
</br>
"Then lady luck is on my side."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
Han Junhua's home was in a separate apartment building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen satisfied her demands and placed her living quarters as far away from crowds as possible.</br>
</br>
When he asked the reason behind her request, her response was simple.</br>
</br>
"Because I prefer a place that's quiet."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? That's a unique preference," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
When they finished the work, Han Junhua and Jiang Chen walked out of the community center together. It was the last task in the reorganization plan, so work the next day would be much easier.</br>
</br>
"I always wanted to ask - is this Death Claw?" Han Junhua stopped in front of the Mother of Death Claw statue and examined the monster.</br>
</br>
"The Mother of Death Claw. Normal Death Claw is not so big and not so difficult to deal with."</br>
</br>
When he recalled the intense fight at the Like mall, Jiang Chen had mixed feelings. Although the actual killer of the Mother of Death Claw was the type-50 electromagnetic cannon, considering how quickly news spread, it quickly became his trophy.</br>
</br>
"Did you kill it?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her with a perplexed expression, but he still answered with a casual conversational tone, "To be precise, we were even. The actual killer was the type-50 electromagnetic cannon."</br>
</br>
"Is this the strongest mutant in the wasteland?" Han Junhua continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"Probably."</br>
</br>
Perhaps stronger mutants existed, but Jiang Chen hadn't seen any.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua didn't say anything else as she crossed her arms and fell silent.</br>
</br>
They didn't speak anymore along the way. Jiang Chen walked with her for a bit longer before leaving and returning to the mansion.</br>
</br>
Along the quiet trail, Jiang Chen pushed open the mansion door and hung his coat on the hanger by the door.</br>
</br>
"You're back?" Sun Xiaorou, in a long dress, stood at the door and smiled at him.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm…. Eh? Your wheelchair-"</br>
</br>
"Neural bridge. By utilizing a bridge, it circled the damaged brain area and allowed information exchange between the spine and the brain on a circuit board." She turned around and gently lifted her hair covering her neck and exposed a device similar to the neck cover in addition to the whiteness of her skin.</br>
</br>
She was wearing a dress with her back exposed.</br>
</br>
He didn't know where to put his eyes, so he looked away and said:</br>
</br>
"Technology is a magnificent thing."</br>
</br>
"It's compassion that's magnificent. I have to thank Yao Yao and Lin Lin; if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have the opportunity to leave the wheelchair."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou approached Jiang Chen as she put her hand out and adjusted his collar.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen subconsciously wanted to move back, but because of the space limitations, her hand managed to reach his collar.</br>
</br>
Such an intimate motion made him feel slightly awkward. Faced with the eyes that contained the universe, he didn't know what to say.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Where's your sister?" Jiang Chen scanned the stairs to the second floor reflexively.</br>
</br>
"In the virtual reality gaming chamber in the gym." Sun Xiaorou adjusted his slightly untidy collar, but her hands didn't leave Jiang Chen's shoulder. She just dangled them there and watched his eyes cheerfully.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? She said it wasn't fun, but she's actually enjoying it?" Jiang Chen changed the topic awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"That's right. Aren't we all like this?" With her arms moving slightly, Sun Xiaorou closed the distance between her and Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned back on the door.</br>
</br>
Watching her eyes full of passion, Jiang Chen inhaled deeply.</br>
</br>
"Are you being serious?"</br>
</br>
"We made a promise when we were young that we would marry the same person." Sun Xiaorou stared at Jiang Chen's eyes as she smiled like a little devil and teasingly leaned her body closer.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? But if your sister found out that the first thing you remembered was this promise, she might not be so happy." Jiang Chen raised his hands, wanting to stop her, but his hands hovered in the air not knowing where to place them before he had to lower them again.</br>
</br>
"No, she won't mind because she's my sister."</br>
</br>
With her arms around Jiang Chen's neck, the tip of Sun Xiaorou's mouth curled up slightly as her lips got closer.</br>
</br>
The distance was so close that he could even feel her warm breath on his lips.</br>
</br>
Time froze in an instant. Jiang Chen held his breath.</br>
</br>
But to his surprise, Sun Xiaorou didn't kiss him.</br>
</br>
She turned her head slightly and kissed Jiang Chen's cheek.</br>
</br>
"You didn't push me away."</br>
</br>
In an instant, the soft figure agilely escaped away from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Time to shave, brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
She winked at him playfully and breezed away like the wind.</br>
</br>
[This girl.]</br>
</br>
Watching her skipping away, Jiang Chen touched the wetness on his face and the non-existent beard.</br>
</br>
He slowly let out a breath.</br>
</br>
It took a while before his restless head cooled down.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Was it fun?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… So so. Speak your mind, what do you need me for?" Sun Jiao sat up from the gaming chamber and tidied her hair. Even in the way they flipped their hair, the two sisters were extremely similar.</br>
</br>
"It's time to eat - what did you think?" Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
[It wasn't just "so-so" by her look.] But he was certainly pleased with how addictive &lt;The Godly Land&gt; was. With even half of the 3.2 billion netizens playing this game, he'd become the richest man in the world.</br>
</br>
"Eh? It's already 6?" Sun Jiao checked the time on her EP as her face turned red.</br>
</br>
She was exploring the forbidden territory of the City of Elves. When Jiang Chen called her, she was fighting a boss. Although she was by herself, the NPC's intelligence was high enough that it was still surprisingly fun to play in single-player story mode.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard that the "naughty" function was unavailable, he immediately lost interest in the game, so it was Sun Jiao alone who explored the secrets of this MMORPG.</br>
</br>
"That's right, addicted girl, time to eat," Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
"What addicted girl? I'm testing the game for you, thank me!" Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen, displeased.</br>
</br>
She stretched her body.</br>
</br>
The curvature of her body, exaggerated by the stretch, was even more seductive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put his hand around her waist, smirking.</br>
</br>
"What are the test results?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao, leaning on Jiang Chen's body, asked sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"Not bad… Eh? There's a familiar smell on your body."</br>
</br>
"Smell?" Jiang Chen paused.</br>
</br>
He didn't even get a chance to react before Sun Jiao opened her eyes and turned around to sniff Jiang Chen's chest.</br>
</br>
"Xiaorou?" Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen with suspicion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression immediately turned awkward.</br>
</br>
[How should I explain?]</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't know how to deal with Sun Xiaorou's provocations.</br>
</br>
But if he acted like he didn't know anything, it would only worsen the situation. Under Sun Jiao's questioning eyes, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and confessed what happened that day.</br>
</br>
"Was Sun Xiaorou the provocative one? You sure you didn't threaten her?" Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen skeptically.</br>
</br>
"Am I that type of person?!" Jiang Chen didn't know whether he should laugh or cry.</br>
</br>
But as soon as the words came out, he realized it wasn't convincing at all. He took away Sun Xiaorou's first time, although he didn't know at the time that it was her first time.</br>
</br>
"Then how are you going to treat Xiaorou?' Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen with a grin.</br>
</br>
"I… I don't know." Jiang Chen said, embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao seemed to have expected Jiang Chen's reply as she let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"If you want me to reject her, I can-"</br>
</br>
"No, you're misunderstanding me." Sun Jiao shook her head unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Jiang Chen stared at her with a perplexed expression.</br>
</br>
"If she…" Sun Jiao bit her lips with words stuck in her throat.</br>
</br>
"If?" Because he couldn't make out her voice, Jiang Chen pulled his ear closer.</br>
</br>
"Whatever, ahhh! This is definitely too weird!" Sun Jiao covered her suddenly burning face and hastily left the completely confused Jiang Chen there.</br>
</br>
At the dinner table, Lin Lin was as noisy as always while she chewed her food with her mouth full while bantering with Sun Jiao. Sun Xiaorou's seat was right across from Jiang Chen. It was her first time tasting such delicious food, so she praised Yao Yao's excellent cooking skills. Yao Yao timidly smiled like always at being praised, her feet dangling under the table joyfully.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was worried that the kiss at the door would cause some awkwardness between him and Sun Xiaorou, but it seemed like he worried too much.</br>
</br>
Except, the moment their eyes met, Jiang Chen perceived a long and dubious message from her eyes.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After dinner, Jiang Chen went to Jiang Lin's lab.</br>
</br>
He knocked at the door, and seeing as it was open, Jiang Chen waited for a moment before he took out the EP.</br>
</br>
"At the rocket testing site?" He looked at the red dot on the map as Jiang Chen muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Because of the locating function of the chip, he possessed the exact coordinate of every knight. Of course, out of respect for personal privacy, he rarely used this function unless it was necessary.</br>
</br>
He turned around and headed to the location.</br>
</br>
Rocket testing site.</br>
</br>
While the name sounded sophisticated, it was just an empty plot of land circled by concrete walls. There were two tables there with one covered in electronic parts while the other had chemical solutions. Aside from the two tables, there was also mechanical equipment he brought back from the Fake Leg Specialty Store as well as the old parts Jiang Chen funded.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen promised Jiang Lin that as long as he finished the work assigned to him, he would fund his dream to develop a warp drive engine for him. Now that the K1 kinetic skeleton production line was optimized and the mimicked version of the Dongfeng-76 ballistic missile was completed, he obviously had the time to work on his own dream.</br>
</br>
"This is the warp drive engine?" Jiang Chen mocked him as he looked at the large turbine engine Jiang Lin was working on.</br>
</br>
Without turning his head, Jiang Lin flipped a wrench in his hand, wiped off the sweat from his head and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Not even close. This is only a simple propulsion engine - nowhere close to a warp drive. It's not even remotely close to the RF resonant cavity thruster."</br>
</br>
"I thought you created it already," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"I thought I almost created it." Jiang Lin sighed.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen first captured Fallout Shelter no.27, Jiang Lin proposed a research project to Wang Qin. No, precisely, it wasn't a research project - he only provided the theoretical design of the "warp drive" to an aerospace expert to confirm the validity of his proposal.</br>
</br>
But the answer he received was depressing - the expert criticized his design using all fields of knowledge and theory. Jiang Lin didn't give up; he even personally went to Camp 27 to debate with that expert.</br>
</br>
The result was the same. The aerospace expert saw that Jiang Lin didn't believe him, so he personally simulated the design with the quantum computer, comically showing the errors he made in the wrap drive design.</br>
</br>
It was analogous to a junior high student thinking he discovered the truth behind the perpetual motion machine who used his knowledge to draw a blueprint he thought was flawless and presented it in front of a physics teacher with a university degree.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the spirit of daring to try was worth praising. But in the name of science, only the truth stood.</br>
</br>
After he heard Jiang Lin's story, Jiang Chen was silent for a moment before he comforted him in a soft voice.</br>
</br>
"At least you proved that method doesn't work."</br>
</br>
"But it wasn't me who disproved it - back in 2091, someone showed the error in my design philosophy. And in the next 80 years, people showed hundreds of incorrect design principles, but I wasn't aware of this at all." He laughed contemptuously at himself, threw the wrench in the toolbox, and took out a welding gun.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel sad?" With sparks flashing, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No, otherwise I wouldn't be working on this." Jiang Lin grinned as he stood up and patted the thing he had been working for a week.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked beside him and examined the metal, three-person tall object.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"RM-320 rocket engine… mimicked plus miniature version." Jiang Lin had a proud expression looking at the art he created himself. "Although it's technology from the end of the 21st century, don't you think it's like a piece of art?"</br>
</br>
"Technology from the 21st century?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. Based on the explanation of the aerospace expert, the propulsion rocket technology had been abandoned by the end of the 21st century. Space elevators could conveniently send spaceships into orbit from the ground. Spaceship arriving in orbit would then use the RF resonant cavity thruster to boost itself to the moon, or Mars, or someplace even further." Jiang Lin grinned.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to start from the fundamentals?"</br>
</br>
But this was certainly useful for Jiang Chen. Propulsion or not, it was technology lightyears ahead of the modern world. Or it could still be a great booster for the ballistic missile in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
"What's the cost of this rocket engine?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Plus the cost of solid fuel, twenty thousand crystals."</br>
</br>
"Damn, this rocket booster would eat the salary of 1000 people," Jiang Chen cursed.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't look pained, Jiang Lin smiled along and didn't respond.</br>
</br>
After a moment, Jiang Chen examined the rocket engine again and abruptly said:</br>
</br>
"I plan to establish the Aerospace Technology Research Institute with you acting as the director. Do you have any suggestions?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 383: Start with collecting garbage</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Aerospace Technology Research Institute?" Jiang Lin was stunned.</br>
</br>
From the shape of his lips, Jiang Chen could tell that he was asking in shock: Why me?</br>
</br>
"Because I believe in you." Jiang Chen was direct.</br>
</br>
"But-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin wanted to say that compared to scientists before the war, his abilities paled in comparison, but Jiang Chen interrupted him.</br>
</br>
"I know what you want to say, but I want a response now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin held his breath.</br>
</br>
"… Okay."</br>
</br>
"Excellent, your response is what I wanted to hear." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Seeing as his expression was still perplexed, Jiang Chen paused to explain to him.</br>
</br>
"The director of the research institute doesn't have to be the one who has the best research skills - even if your knowledge level is nowhere close to the old experts, I still believe that you will be the one who leads a group of people with the ability to achieve important results. Such as the miniature rocket I saw at your store last time - I still have a vivid impression of it."</br>
</br>
Not just a vivid expression - it was stunning.</br>
</br>
In Jiang Chen's understanding, a rocket would have to be massive like a chimney, but Jiang Lin's observation satellite completely altered his understanding of near-orbital rockets.</br>
</br>
"If you wanted that small thing, you didn't need to start a research institute." Jiang Lin showed a troubled smile.</br>
</br>
"You're misunderstanding me." Jiang Chen shook his head. "It's the imagination that counts."</br>
</br>
"Imagination?" Jiang Lin raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen took out a piece of crystal from his pocket. "Look at this, do you know what it is?"</br>
</br>
"A crystal?"</br>
</br>
"Correct." Jiang Chen smiled and threw this crystal in Jiang Lin's hand. "But before I told the blue skins, they didn't know what it was."</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin looked at the green crystal in his hand as thoughts began to emerge in his head.</br>
</br>
"The entire Wanghai City, or the entire wasteland… The world is no longer the world we were used to. Past ways of thinking wouldn't be adaptable on this wasteland, whether survival or research. I need you to use your creative imagination, your extraordinary vision to develop aerospace technology suitable for this wasteland.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared into Jiang Lin's eyes as he spoke with seriousness.</br>
</br>
It was far more challenging to build a space elevator on the wasteland compared to the modern world. Just in terms of the dangers of the ocean, there was a vast difference between the two. Although he'd never been to the coast before, Jiang Chen heard some stories from Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
Liuding Town was on the better side because it was close to land, so sea mutants were uncommon. But once in the deep ocean, the dangerous level of mutants would rise exponentially. Regarding the battle on earth, only a small portion of the total launched nuclear, biological and chemical weapons actually struck the land. Where did the rest go? It didn't disappear but was intercepted by the ocean.</br>
</br>
</br>
With the influence of bacteria, viruses, and radiation, the mutation of the sea creatures was far more unpredictable than the land creatures. But the foundation of the space elevator had to be built on the ocean surface near the equator.</br>
</br>
Other than that, the space garbage around the near earth orbit and synchronous orbit almost formed a small planetary ring. These factors had undoubtedly increased the difficulty of aerospace exploration.</br>
</br>
"Extraordinary vision? You gave me a hard problem." Jiang Lin smiled, troubled again.</br>
</br>
"If it wasn't hard, why would I need you?" Jiang Chen glared at him.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Jiang Lin inhaled deeply.</br>
</br>
"Could you give me a general direction? The NAC or space technology you require is leaning toward which area?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought momentarily.</br>
</br>
"Start with collecting the garbage."</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Lin looked at Jiang Chen dumbfounded; he didn't know the meaning of this sentence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed up in the sky.</br>
</br>
"Design a rocket that can be sent to the near earth orbit or the synchronous orbit… Whatever you do, I need you to bring the stuff in space down, fix it, and send it up again."</br>
</br>
"This… is rather an unscrupulous thought." Jiang Lin showed his third troubled smile that day.</br>
</br>
"It is possible from a technology point of view, right?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. But no one would want to bring the satellite down to the surface; they'd rather fix it in the space station or just launch a new one…"</br>
</br>
"I said, don't look at the present problem with the past ways of thinking." Jiang Chen waved his hand in disagreement. "Do we have a space station?"</br>
</br>
He patted Jiang Lin on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"I believe you can do it. But first, I need you to create something small for me. Should be really easy for you - just a dumb small missile that can be launched. I need you to create four for me to send communication satellites up… Space junk? No, you don't need to consider that, just design it based on the 'most ideal conditions'…."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen and Jiang Lin were discussing the Aerospace Technology Research Institute, there was also a negotiation in the mansion.</br>
</br>
It was a discussion about life.</br>
</br>
"Xiaorou, can I ask you a question?" Sun Jiao squeezed the body wash in her hand and evenly rubbed it over her sister's back.</br>
</br>
When her sister was paralyzed, she was responsible for bathing her. Although Sun Xiaorou could wash now, she was still worried. What if that thing malfunctioned or came off, wouldn't that be terrible? Imagining her sister being stuck lying in the water - Sun Jiao only gave it a quick thought before her hands turned cold at the idea.</br>
</br>
She finally found the only family she had in this world; she didn't want to lose her again.</br>
</br>
The cold but soft sensation on her back made Xiaorou narrow her eyes in comfort.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gently bit her own lip, but she still asked.</br>
</br>
"Do… Do you like Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
Xiaorou took a second to process it then she turned around with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Of course, he's a great brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
"No, I'm talking about from a relationship point of view." Looking at the smile on her sister's face, Sun Jiao asked with seriousness.</br>
</br>
The smile was gradually replaced with a hint of melancholy. Finally, Sun Xiaorou let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"Did brother-in-law… tell you?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao knew what her sister referred to - what happened a few days ago at the door.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou thought Sun Jiao was asking about what happened that day in her bedroom.</br>
</br>
The two coincidentally misunderstood each other.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Sun Jiao nodded.</br>
</br>
"… Are you planning to blame me?" Like a kid that did something wrong, Sun Xiaorou buried her head.</br>
</br>
The bubbles in the bathtub reflected her sad face as well as her gorgeous figure.</br>
</br>
"No, I just wanted to know your opinion." Sun Jiao hugged her sister from behind, closed her eyes, and whispered.</br>
</br>
Felling the warm hug of her sister, Sun Xiaorou suddenly felt like she was selfish. She couldn't tell if she actually liked Jiang Chen or if she just liked the person her sister liked. Her heartbeat pumped insanely because of the gray moral territory that made her do things she shouldn't have done…</br>
</br>
But just as she thought, a sour feeling emerged from the bottom of her heart.</br>
</br>
[It was him that took my first time, why do I have to bear the guilt?]</br>
</br>
Perhaps driven by some kind of emotion, she spoke out without processing the emotions in her head.</br>
</br>
"Even if they're rather fickle?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Sun Jiao put her chin on her sister's shoulder and whispered into her ear.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou leaned forward, turned around, and faced her sister.</br>
</br>
She lowered her bead while she gently bit her lip.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, she got closer to her sister's ear and spilled the emotions in her heart…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 384: War Bond Issuance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the morning, a bustling crowd gathered in front of the bank.</br>
</br>
Merchants, mercenaries, hunters, even scavengers - everyone surrounded the bank. People's emotions were heightened with excitement evident on their faces. Under the ushering of the security forces in first division uniforms, people formed a long line as they waited for the Sixth Street bank to open at eight.</br>
</br>
The reason why people were so excited was because of an inspiring speech yesterday.</br>
</br>
"… Everyone, in the past 21 years, we used our hands to prove our prosperity." Zhao Chenwu stood at the podium in front of the council building as he used a passionate voice to speak to the crowd gathered.</br>
</br>
"From being abandoned by the PAC to facing the mutant waves alone, to the bacteria that swept across the city, to the despairing betrayal…" He gradually lowered his tone.</br>
</br>
"But we won against all odds!" He tightly clenched his fists and raised his voice again as he used a compelling voice, "We used the new order we established to give the middle finger to the old authorities. We used our high walls and cannons to fend off zombies and mutants. We used our tanks to eradicate the bacteria source that affected our entire city. And we used the laws of the council to punish the traitors!"</br>
</br>
"And we welcomed radiance." He slowed down again as he looked at the crowd with a stern but proud gaze.</br>
</br>
The listeners all held their breaths.</br>
</br>
"But just as we were about to celebrate our prosperity, an unfortunate and remorseful event occurred."</br>
</br>
"As most of you already heard, our friends in Jia city, the warriors who fought against the mutant humans' invasion, have fallen."</br>
</br>
"And right now, the barbarians in the west are swinging their clubs and challenging us: 'look, we caught your little neighbor and cut off his di*k. Are you afraid? Haha, we'll be doing the same thing to you soon!' Right now, tell me, could you all accept this kind of humiliation! Could you?"</br>
</br>
There was no response below the podium, but Zhao Chenwu discerned from the faces of the crowd that they couldn't.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath as he spoke again.</br>
</br>
"It's small compared to the size of the entire wasteland; it couldn't even be considered a grain. But we must protect its growth and care for it so it can radiate its brightness to places even farther. That's right, it is the radiance we see, a radiance known as order! And the first step to reach this great cause is to lubricate the road of our tank with the organs of those bastards! Then, we will free our friends!" His voice changed from deep and somber to high and enthusiastic, completely igniting passion in all the bystanders.</br>
</br>
"Long live the Sixth Street!" people shouted and roared.</br>
</br>
"Long live the NAC!"</br>
</br>
"Kill those di*kless bastards!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
He raised his hand to signal the crowd to settle down as he flipped his script to the next page.ing</br>
</br>
</br>
"Right now, I'm announcing the decision on the council's behalf. The Sixth Street will declare war on the mutated humans in the Seventh Area.</br>
</br>
While he said that he looked at Chu Nan by the side. As the governor, Chu Nan represented the military government.</br>
</br>
According to the constitution of the Sixth Street, the military government had a veto right for motions passed by the council. Of course, it was just ceremonial since the impassioned speech was arranged by the military government.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan stood up and looked solemnly at the crowd below the podium.</br>
</br>
"Granted."</br>
</br>
Thunderous applause erupted.</br>
</br>
With unified public opinion, Zhao Chenwu took the opportunity to announce the war bond and recruitment motions.</br>
</br>
This show went far more smoothly than he imagined.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The crowd outside the window formed a long line from the bank to the council building.</br>
</br>
The bank was located beside the building.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan and Zhao Chenwu sat at the table. There were color printed newspapers on the table and on the cover page was the impassioned speech.</br>
</br>
The newspaper only became popular recently. People loved to gossip, and in an era without the internet, the newspaper could meet the needs of the people. Other than occasional announcements of Sixth Street council decisions, the newspaper published stories of survivors, experiences of hunting mutants, job postings or advertisements.</br>
</br>
"Five minutes before the bank opens." Zhao Chenwu narrowed his eyes to look at the clock on the wall before he glanced out the window again.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to line up with ordinary people. As a big capitalist on Sixth Street, before bonds were publicly sold, he already purchased the portion that belonged to him.</br>
</br>
"Looks like people are passionate about the war that will happen four months from now." Chu Nan smiled.</br>
</br>
It was eight o'clock. The employees of the council building brought a plate of steamy buns and two cups of freshly made soy milk.</br>
</br>
"No one is interested in the war, but people will never say no to shining crystals. Mmm, delicious breakfast." Zhao Chenwu grabbed a bun and took a hard bite.</br>
</br>
He spent 20 years living there already; he knew exactly why people cheered yesterday. It wasn't to free their friends but they cheered for the mercenary contracts, military contracts, and employment opportunities brought by the upcoming war…</br>
</br>
"That's right." Chu Nan nodded as he reached for the plate as well.</br>
</br>
Breakfast at the council building was provided by the military government for free. The food there was always the best in all of Sixth Street. The fresh meat buns and hot soy milk were delicacies of the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"How did you think to use the steel of the mutated humans to create war bonds?" Zhao Chenwu swallowed the food in his mouth. He looked at the crowd flooding into the bank and asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"I got inspired by the crusade dividend model then made some small changes in the process. For example, using the steel that the Sixth Street's currently lacking as collateral." Chu Nan slowly chewed on the food as he casually responded.</br>
</br>
The crystals from the last crusade ignited the boiler for production, now this crusade would bring the raw resources needed for production.</br>
</br>
"How much steel do the mutant humans have?"</br>
</br>
"Based on the information provided by the intelligence team, they have an estimated reserve of more than two hundred thousand tons of C-type steel."</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k, are they living on top of a mine?" Zhao Chenwu couldn't help but curse.</br>
</br>
It was completed C-type steel, not iron ore that still needed to be produced.</br>
</br>
"Not a mine; based on reliable information, it's an underground resources warehouse. PAC's strategic storage somehow landed in the hands of the monsters. But whatever, by fall of this year, the steel will belong to us."</br>
</br>
Outside the window, the line was slowly moving. The bank opened its doors. People, with their personal identity cards, all charged at the bank employees.</br>
</br>
He looked at Chu Nan again.</br>
</br>
"Why's he not making the crystals himself? Don't tell me he's lacking money right now."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu referred to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The food trade brought in over a million crystals of profit per month. As the biggest shareholder of the food business, Zhao Chenwu would rather think that the bank would go bankrupt than Jiang Chen lacked crystals.</br>
</br>
"He's not really lacking money, but council member Zhao must know the saying that in order to collect the grain, the grain must be planted first? " Chu Nan laughed.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu took a moment to process that before he started laughing too.</br>
</br>
"A general with this foresight, it's my honor to be in your presence."</br>
</br>
"My honor too." Chu Nan held up the soy milk cup in a toast.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
Inside the hologram conference room, Chu Nan's projected hologram stood at the end of the long table and reported to Jiang Chen on the first-day sale numbers of war bonds.</br>
</br>
"… Including the presale portion, war bonds worth two million crystals were sold on the first day. Also, the recruitment work is 30% completed; it's expected to be completed within a week."</br>
</br>
"It's almost like picking up money from the ground!" Jiang Chen was amazed.</br>
</br>
"Our credibility worked - all the citizens wanted a bond."</br>
</br>
"No, no, no, credibility only relates to the fact that people believe we will pay. But what made people buy the war bonds wasn't credibility but it's because they supported the war." Sinking into the chair, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Because there are things to be gained?" Chu Nan said mockingly.</br>
</br>
"Partially."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan didn't bother asking about the other reason; he merely smiled and flipped through the documents in his hand.</br>
</br>
" Was this the only thing you needed to report to me?"</br>
</br>
"No, there's another piece of good news," Chu Nan said.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"Do you remember that Hua Weijie? The order you sent him - he completed it."</br>
</br>
When he first occupied the Sixth Street, Jiang Chen promised various benefits to the five council members that surrendered. Zhao Chenwu's food business, Lu Yun's Horizon Corporation's Inner Circle rebuilt project, Hua Weijie's Galactic Technology Company's pre-war technology collection and the development of the Type-51 Transportation Helicopter project.</br>
</br>
"Completed already?" Jiang Chen looked at Chu Nan, surprised by the speed.</br>
</br>
On his expected timeline, the research should've taken at least one year, but they completed the project already.</br>
</br>
"Yes, they completed it." Chu Nan nodded.</br>
</br>
"Direct their technicians to transfer the production process to our factory until the helicopter is successfully built, and send the remaining one hundred and twenty thousand crystals to them," Jiang Chen immediately said with an uncontainable smile on his face.</br>
</br>
The development of the Type-51 Transportation Helicopter meant that the NAC would possess the ability to manufacture helicopters and completely disrupt Liuding Town's domination of the air force. With NAC's production abilities, it wouldn't take long before they exceeded Liuding just on one platform.</br>
</br>
"Okay. Hua Weijie also asked me if there were any new projects for him." Chu Nan nodded.</br>
</br>
"Of course, ask him if he's interested in a joint research project. If he is, talk to him about the development of fighter jets."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan paused for a moment then repeated to confirm.</br>
</br>
"Fight jets?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. Fixed-wing aircraft, the type that could drop a 200-kilogram bomb on the enemy's heads."</br>
</br>
"Let me be honest, the research for fixed-wing aircraft is far more complex than helicopters. And regarding combat effectiveness on the wasteland, fighter jets are no stronger than helicopters." Chu Nan tried to convince Jiang Chen, erring on the side of caution.</br>
</br>
</br>
Since the helicopter research was just completed, the production line hadn't even started, so when would research on fighter jets begin? Chu Nan thought it was better to continue building on the helicopter research with the current model as the prototype while continually improving on its design.</br>
</br>
Fighter jets? The maximum combat radius of NAC was at most fifty kilometers - were fighter jets even necessary?</br>
</br>
But what Chu Nan didn't know was that Jiang Chen planned to bring fighter jets to the modern world.</br>
</br>
"Look further, the enemies in front of us aren't just the mutated humans. The Northern Alliance Area has always been plotting against Wanghai City. Let's look even further at all of Pan-Asia, even the continent on the other side of the Atlantic; no one knows what's there, no one knows what they think over there. We'll have to face them eventually. I don't want to be completely unprepared at that time. Now, do you think it's unnecessary to research fixed-wing aircraft?"</br>
</br>
"You're right, general," Chu Nan immediately responded.</br>
</br>
Regardless if he was right or not, it was foolish to argue.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. "Perfect, then that's that."</br>
</br>
He ended the communication session with Chu Nan and stretched on his chair.</br>
</br>
"Ah… This is tiring. Miss Advisor, could you massage my shoulders for me?"</br>
</br>
"Let me be frank, that's an assistant's work." Han Junhua, standing in the corner of the room, crossed her arms coldly.</br>
</br>
"Isn't the advisor also the assistant to the general?" Jiang Chen said with a joking voice.</br>
</br>
"Your perspective is quite interesting, but allow me to disagree."</br>
</br>
"That's disappointing then."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen exaggeratedly made a disappointed face, stood up, and walked out of the conference room in a good mood.</br>
</br>
"If you want to equip the army with fighter jets, I recommend you build an air force independent of the land units," Han Junhua said in a calm voice.</br>
</br>
"It's still too early - the scientists didn't even create the 'toy' model for me yet."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed with his voice echoing down the hallway.</br>
</br>
As the general, he didn't need to wait in the office for information. He only needed to appear in front of people when it was necessary. As for troublesome tasks, they were perfect for the advisor to take care of… This was what Jiang Chen told himself about his job requirements instead of dealing with his laziness.</br>
</br>
He sat in the office with nothing to do for half an hour before Jiang Chen instructed Han Junhua "let me know if anything comes up."</br>
</br>
It was already early June.</br>
</br>
Estimating that he could return in a few days, Jiang Chen wanted to spend more time with the people he cared for now.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen passed by the square in front of the community center. The training grounds were two hundred meters north of it. There was a row of parked trucks at the door as well as the Tiger, still active in service. The women waited for their husbands here because they would be heading to the front lines soon.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen passed by the door, he saw the training grounds packed with people.</br>
</br>
The First Division was about to depart, so Cheng Weiguo was making his last speech to the soldiers. Once that was done, they would board the trucks and head for the front lines.</br>
</br>
Just yesterday, the general office approved the request for war from the Sixth Street council. The entire NAC entered a state of war. Although the mutant humans undoubtedly didn't receive the information, there was nothing wrong with deploying their soldiers to the front lines.</br>
</br>
In the crowd, Jiang Chen saw a familiar face.</br>
</br>
It was Zhou Jiexi, the wife of Cheng Weiguo. She was the chef of the cafeteria before, but after the cafeteria was reorganized under the logistics department, she began working in that department. Jiang Chen had a faint memory of her - in the beginning, she cooked for the original thirty-something people at the base.</br>
</br>
Now, he noticed a difference from how she looked before - it was her stomach…</br>
</br>
Zhou Jiexi noticed Jiang Chen and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Mr. General."</br>
</br>
"Long time no see." Jiang Chen smiled back as he looked surprised at her bulging abdomen. "How many months?"</br>
</br>
"Already three." Her face was filled with happiness when she talked about her child.</br>
</br>
"Three months already… That guy, he didn't even tell me he's about to become a father," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"You're the general - how could we disturb you with that?" Zhou Jiexi said humbly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a second to process it but managed to recollect his thoughts quickly and smiled at her.</br>
</br>
[True…]</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen said, "Take care of yourself, also… say hi to Old Cheng for me."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I will."</br>
</br>
To a leader, it was indeed valuable to gain the respect and awe of his subordinates. But some distance created by awe was inevitable since the people he promoted, other than Zhou Guoping, weren't naturally servile people.</br>
</br>
[So I need someone who can flatter me?]</br>
</br>
With that sudden thought in his mind, Jiang Chen laughed. Things would be boring with that type of person around.</br>
</br>
[Am I missing a friend? Or a good brother?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
The troops began to move as the soldiers started to board the trucks and wave goodbye to the soldiers at the door.</br>
</br>
At the same time, cradled inside a woman's arm, Jiang Chen saw an infant.</br>
</br>
The ignorant sleepy face and the smile on the mother's face formed a memorable picture in Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
And it was because of that smile that Jiang Chen felt some comfort.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around and left.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 386: The Night</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was late in the night.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned in front of the window with a wine glass in his hand. He stared blankly at the swaying tree branches out the window. The orange liquid swirled in his cup and reflected an unclear face as well as a murky moon.</br>
</br>
"What are you looking at it?"</br>
</br>
He didn't know how long Sun Jiao had been there behind him.</br>
</br>
"I don't know… maybe it's our backyard." Jiang Chen didn't turn around but he just gazed at the buds that would never sprout on the tree branches.</br>
</br>
In the backyard was a trail formed among the short woods; further back was a pool he used to store gold. Of course, the pool was covered by an egg-shaped dome, compliments of Lin Lin's work. He still remembered that he once enjoyed a sun-tanning session there simulated by high tech.</br>
</br>
"Are you tired?"</br>
</br>
Her rare caring side peeked through as Sun Jiao gently hugged Jiang Chen from behind and leaned her face on his broad shoulder.</br>
</br>
Feeling the softness behind his back, Jiang Chen smiled wearily and drunk all the remaining alcohol in his glass.</br>
</br>
"Sometimes." Jiang Chen poured himself another cup as he gave an answer that didn't seem to match her question.</br>
</br>
But Sun Jiao seemed to understand his answer as she whispered to him:</br>
</br>
"Running back and forth between two worlds… must be tiring."</br>
</br>
"A bit."</br>
</br>
The wine glass was filled again and Jiang Chen swirled the transparent liquid. Through the orange color, he gazed at the beautiful face as he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"Different environment, different people, different ways of thinking, different values… I feel like I'm living two lives. Although this ability brought me an endless amount of wealth and dragged me out of a pit in my life… I have no right to complain, but I don't know whether this was a stroke of good fortune or not. Until a few hours ago, I suddenly realized that I don't have any friends here."</br>
</br>
In the beginning, before he established a relationship with Sun Jiao, he didn't think of bringing order to this place. Regardless of how chaotic this place was, he could live a wealthy life on this side… No, he could even be living a more pleasant life.</br>
</br>
He was slightly intoxicated as a cold breeze swept by and roused him from his thoughts.</br>
</br>
"Aside from you," Jiang Chen added.</br>
</br>
"I'm not your friend, I'm your wife." Sun Jiao bit Jiang Chen's ear, displeased.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, sorry, I'm a bit tipsy." He put the wine glass down. With one hand on the window, he used the other to wipe his face.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao is also not."</br>
</br>
"I… I know."</br>
</br>
"Then why don't you eat her?" Sun Jiao's teeth let go of Jiang Chen's ears as she mocked him.</br>
</br>
Although he had so many opportunities when he almost ate that cute rabbit, he didn't end up doing it. Perhaps because she looked too young? It wasn't the primary reason though. Sun Jiao was his first woman, so he cared how she felt.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't respond as he simply put his right hand on the hand around his waist.</br>
</br>
"Because of me?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Jiang Chen responded lightly.</br>
</br>
"I already said I don't mind. Also, it's not like you haven't been eating out secretively." Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression turned awkward.</br>
</br>
"Uh, you knew?"</br>
</br>
"Han Junhua right?" Sun Jiao pouted.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? Why did you think it was her?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
He originally thought she was referring to the diplomat from Liuding Town. He swore that Han Junhua was still a virgin. He didn't discuss any deeper problems with her. Although it wasn't something to brag about, compared to other people in a similar position, the number of people he had sex with could easily be counted.</br>
</br>
"Because one time, I happened to see how she gazed at your back. My instincts told me it wasn't as simple as a subordinate looking at her superior."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and let out a sigh. "You're thinking too much; she has no emotions. It's hard to explain - she's something called a mind secretary."</br>
</br>
"Just like when your second ability got activated?" Sun Jiao remembered that Jiang Chen mentioned the ability he gained after he opened the second level of hidden genetic code.</br>
</br>
"That's right, it's similar to that." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then when you open your second ability, do you have feelings for me?" Sun Jiao asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused.</br>
</br>
He carefully recalled the first time he had Invictus activated in the battle with the lead mutated human. If he really had no emotions, wouldn't the best choice have been to ditch Sun Jiao and retreat? With the speed of the mutant humans, there was no way they could catch up to the T-3 power armor.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps," Jiang Chen answered with uncertainty, but he quickly laughed and tried to change the topic: "Ahem, why are we talking about-"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao closed her eyes and spoke into Jiang Chen's ear, "For me, the only fortunate thing that happened in my entire life was meeting you here that day."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was slightly astonished.</br>
</br>
She then continued, "Sometimes I'm terrified, afraid that one day you'll feel tired and won't return to this side."</br>
</br>
"I… Sorry for worrying you."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's finger gently covered Jiang Chen's lips as she smiled. "No need to apologize."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grabbed her tender hand and fell into silence.</br>
</br>
He stood there for a long time before he turned around and wrapped his arms around her.</br>
</br>
"Do you still remember when we first met?"</br>
</br>
"Were you referring to me tying you up on the chair, or how we fu*ked from the kitchen to the bedroom?" Sun Jiao put her arms around Jiang Chen's neck seductively.</br>
</br>
"I'm talking about when you licked the cans," Jiang Chen jokingly said.</br>
</br>
"Pshhh!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao burst out laughing and rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"It's getting cold," Jiang Chen whispered.</br>
</br>
Although it was June, on the land covered by radiation dust, the temperature fluctuated wildly.</br>
</br>
With a blush spreading across her face, Sun Jiao read Jiang Chen's hint.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, let's go."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The door was not completely closed.</br>
</br>
Behind the door, a small figure hid.</br>
</br>
A coat was tightly held by the figure's hands, covering their chest as they watched through the window. Yao Yao's eyes looked a bit lost as her mouth pouted.</br>
</br>
"Are you a fool or what?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, who appeared behind her, let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Her voice made Yao Yao jump before she looked at Lin Lin, displeased.</br>
</br>
"If you don't act now, you'll have more and more competition," Lin Lin said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
"… like you?" Yao Yao buried her head.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Why-why are you bringing me into this? I-I'm talking about Sun Xiaorou. Last time, didn't she, kiss at the door…" Lin Lin's face instantly turned red as she rambled on listlessly.</br>
</br>
But the more she explained, the fainter her voice became.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao walked forward with her head still buried and stopped beside Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Sorry. I shouldn't… I shouldn't have said that to you."</br>
</br>
"It's okay… It's me who should apologize. Maybe you're right, but I don't even know what I'm thinking," Lin Lin mumbled in a low voice and hugged Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
She admitted that her intentions to encourage her friend were rather despicable.</br>
</br>
The silver-white hair and the black hair mixed together as the two small figures hugged each other.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou let out a sigh looking at the two girls in the corner.</br>
</br>
But not long after, a joyful curvature appeared on her mouth as she turned around and walked to the bathroom.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, a ray of sunshine shone through the ledge of the roof and scattered on Jiang Chen's nose.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows jumped as he opened his drowsy eyes. Almost at the same time, a sour feeling flooded into the back of his head.</br>
</br>
[Hungover again…]</br>
</br>
After showering last night, Sun Jiao drank some more with him. As to what she did to him after he was drunk? Hehe, there was no need to guess.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a deep breath of fresh morning air as he wanted to drowsily rub his sore facial muscles, but his right hand seemed to be trapped by something. He took a moment to process that before he tried to move his left, but it was also trapped.</br>
</br>
Even though Jiang Chen reacted slowly, he realized that the situation was a bit odd.</br>
</br>
He shook himself free of his drowsiness, turned his head and immediately understood the situation.</br>
</br>
"… Up so early." The sluggish voice rang in his ear as the completely naked Sun Jiao didn't let go of Jiang Chen's arm, but rather, she adjusted her body like a cat being fed.</br>
</br>
The messy bed and the marks on the sheets as well as the pillows thrown on the ground gave a glimpse of the intimacy that happened the night before.</br>
</br>
This wasn't the problem.</br>
</br>
The problem was that there was more than one cat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slowly turned his stiff neck and looked at the figure to his left.</br>
</br>
"Morning, brother-in-law," Sun Xiaorou greeted him with a grin.</br>
</br>
This must be a dream.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered to himself and closed his eyes again.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
But it proved to not be a dream.</br>
</br>
Because of the alcohol, his memory of last night seemed scattered in Jiang Chen's head. But after having a good sleep, all the way until noon, he began to recall what happened. First, he held hands with Sun Jiao, but somehow a third person joined in.</br>
</br>
With the sheets around her chest, Sun Jiao confessed to Jiang Chen what happened last night. Sun Xiaorou kneeled by the bed and confessed her affection for him from the bottom of her heart.</br>
</br>
A few days ago when Sun Jiao was washing Sun Xiaorou, Xiaorou poured out her feelings for Jiang Chen. When Sun Jiao heard this, although she was hesitant at first, she still expressed understanding of her sister's feelings.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a question that had been bothering Sun Jiao came back to her. Jiang Chen never ate Yao Yao, so she was afraid that she couldn't keep him in her world just by herself. Having seen the other world through the fourth dimension messenger, she knew that even as the emperor of the wasteland, not to mention the general of NAC, his life here was not comparable to being an ordinary citizen in the other world.</br>
</br>
She then remembered her sister and the feelings she confessed to her that day.</br>
</br>
Although what she did was somewhat despicable, she hoped that he could stay on this side, or at least prevent him from randomly disappearing one day.</br>
</br>
</br>
Therefore, she wanted to give him more reasons to stay.</br>
</br>
That was Xiaorou's thought too, right? She comforted herself like that before she decided to drag Xiaorou into things last night.</br>
</br>
On the bed, Xiaorou stared into Jiang Chen's eyes as she said remorsefully:</br>
</br>
"Do you dislike me?"</br>
</br>
"No, but-" Jiang Chen smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"As long as you don't dislike me." Like the weather in May, a bright smile instantly bloomed on Xiaorou's face.</br>
</br>
Drawn by her bright smile, Jiang Chen stared at her blankly when the sheet dropped from her body.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Sun Jiao hugged Jiang Chen from behind as she said with slight jealousy:</br>
</br>
"You have to thank me. Also, I'm the main course."</br>
</br>
"Ah, I…"</br>
</br>
Because this was all too exciting, Jiang Chen's brain was a mess since words couldn't come out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"That's right, sister is the main course."</br>
</br>
Xiaorou smiled and pecked him on the lips.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt something shattering in his chest.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, something called boundaries.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The intimate night was too short since it was already morning, but the emperor decided to skip the morning ceremony (1). Although this saying described Consort Yang, Jiang Chen felt that it applied to him too.</br>
</br>
The weariness of the past days completely faded as Jiang Chen walked into the community center feeling completely energized. Han Junhua, standing beside the office window, saw that Jiang Chen had arrived, so she walked over with her arms crossed.</br>
</br>
She didn't ask why Jiang Chen didn't show up in the morning as she took out two document packages and put them in the middle of the table.</br>
</br>
"The administration department lead, Lu Huasheng, delivered three construction designs of the general's office."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the document Han Junhua pointed at and took it out along with three graphene chips. The graphene cards stored the 3D models. The three designs each had unique aspects; he couldn't tell which one was better.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?" After putting the three chips on the table, Jiang Chen asked Han Junhua for her input.</br>
</br>
"I don't have any opinion on the exterior appearance, but the office should be reinforced as much as possible. In any circumstance, the commander's office would be the primary target of the enemy," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned through the document and wrote Han Junhua's recommendations in the box for suggestions.</br>
</br>
"Okay, then this one." He picked the card that looked the most pleasing to the eye and stuffed the documents back into the package. With the two cards that didn't get picked, he threw them into the garbage.</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen reached for the other package.</br>
</br>
There was a stack of documents inside.</br>
</br>
"The logistics head, Wang Qin, came in the morning to submit a colonization expansion proposal. The specifics included requesting Shenxiang Colony to expand in the direction of Dianshan Lake with an estimated 15,000 acreage of land to be used for the planting of Carm trees and mutated fruits. She wanted me to let you know that if we initiated this proposal, we'd become the biggest supplier of Carm Treesap and mutated fruits at Sixth Street," Han Junhua described.</br>
</br>
"15,000 acreage? Let me see… it would hit Dianshan Lake directly. We have a battle with the mutated humans in the fall; are there any problems with expanding at the front lines?" Jiang Chen took out a map and looked at the land circled in red with a frown.</br>
</br>
"From a war strategy perspective, there's no problem at all. We're on the offensive side with the battle centered in Jia City. Without any surprises, the mutated humans wouldn't be able to reach Shenxiang at all. In terms of the economics, it's not my specialty, so I won't give an opinion on it," Han Junhua said concisely.</br>
</br>
"It's also not my specialty either, but if there's nothing wrong with it strategically, then I trust my talented staff." Jiang Chen laughed and signed the proposal.</br>
</br>
Carm tree was the primary raw ingredient for the production of plastic on the wasteland. Kinetic skeletons and rifles all needed it.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua quietly watched Jiang Chen stuff the signed document into the package.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to leave?" Seeing Jiang Chen was about to go, Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
"I need to go find Du Yongkong. If Lu Huasheng and Wang Qin are here, just give the packages to them," Jiang Chen instructed her as he stopped at the door.</br>
</br>
"… Okay." Han Junhua crossed her arms and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua paused then shook her head.</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 388: Virtual Reality Helmet Prototype</br>
</div></br>
At the end of the hallway in the community center was a large office modified from a conference room. The discussion behind the half-closed doors didn't seem to stop; it looked quite busy inside.</br>
</br>
Although the reorganization that happened a while ago affected most departments, this was the only department that hadn't changed.</br>
</br>
A board carved with words hung on the wall crookedly: &lt;Godly Land Game Developing Department&gt;</br>
</br>
Right now, the makeshift office was jam-packed.</br>
</br>
"The mission brief is completed. Old Zhang, are you done with the text?"</br>
</br>
"Done. Wait one moment, I'll send it to you."</br>
</br>
"Models Code C10087 to C10129 NPC have been completed. The rest would be here, and a total of 17 AI must be inputted manually, take a look…"</br>
</br>
The conference room was separated into individual offices with boards. Fifty programmers with dark eyebags worked in front of the hologram computers and continued to refine the virtual reality MMORPG.</br>
</br>
In front of a hologram computer, Du Yongkong scanned through the lines of code. As the director of the game, he didn't need to personally type the code like the programmers - he only needed to audit the work of each team and direct game development.</br>
</br>
The work sounded simple, but it wasn't easy at all. The work of fifty people was audited by only him. It was easy to see the impact his workload had on him from the deep eyebags on his face.</br>
</br>
But he didn't mind the tiring work, or rather, he enjoyed it. He was just a chief engineer before the war and never acted as a game director. But life pulled a big prank on him as he finally got his dream position after the war.</br>
</br>
He hadn't shut his eyes for 24 hours already. After he audited the last line of code, he was planning to nap for a bit on the table, but he happened to see a surprising person.</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen at the door, Du Yongkong's eyes lit up as he immediately got up to greet him.</br>
</br>
After catching up for a bit, Jiang Chen finally got to business.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so nervous, I'm just here to take a look. Also, did you finish the server?"</br>
</br>
"Already done." Du Yongkong nodded. The humble programmer didn't know how to flatter people, so he just kept smiling and smiling.</br>
</br>
Although he looked a bit comical, Jiang Chen really liked simple people like this.</br>
</br>
"Let me see."</br>
</br>
"No problem! Please follow me." Du Yongkong bowed respectfully and led Jiang Chen to the adjacent junk room.</br>
</br>
The condition of the junk room was typical of a programmer as there were unorganized paper boxes stacked together. Considering the tidiness of the room, Du Yongkong's expression looked awkward as he scratched his head.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I don't mind. Just let me see the prototype of the helmet."</br>
</br>
"Ah, okay, heh." Du Yongkang laughed, rather embarrassed, as he began to dig through the boxes. He moved away a few boxes filled with papers before he managed to drag out the box that contained five virtual reality helmets.</br>
</br>
</br>
Looking at the helmets in the box, Jiang Chen felt an inexplicable excitement.</br>
</br>
If vessels and cannons were a source of romance for men, then virtual reality helmets were the source of romance all netizens longed for. Jiang Chen could say with confidence that for anyone who read web novels or played MMORPGs or single player games, there wasn't a single person who didn't dream of the ability to use a virtual reality helmet to write their own story in the world created by 0s and 1s.</br>
</br>
"General?"</br>
</br>
"You're not a soldier, just call me boss."</br>
</br>
"Okay boss." Du Yongkong laughed timidly as he scratched the back of his head. "Is this what you wanted?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a helmet from the box as he carefully observed it in his hands.</br>
</br>
It had a tainted crystal surface along with a bluish-black polyethylene shell, resembling an aerodynamic motorcycle helmet. At the back of the helmet was a "small tail" covered in scales, the length was close to neck length, and it could connect one's neural network through microcircuits, interfering with the brain field.</br>
</br>
It weighed around 1-2 kilograms, slightly heavier than a motorcycle helmet. But it didn't matter since the helmet was activated when the user was in REM sleep mode. Therefore, not a lot of people would choose to play this game while standing up.</br>
</br>
"How much molybdenum does one virtual reality helmet require?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Without accounting for improper production material waste, around 300 grams," Du Yongkang said affirmatively.</br>
</br>
"300 grams?" Jiang Chen fell into deep thought as he stroked his chin.</br>
</br>
Therefore, one ton of molybdenum could produce at least 3000 virtual reality helmets. Once he solved the molybdenum mine problem, this could be produced on a large scale. Of course, there was no rush since before this could be launched officially, Jiang Chen planned to conduct an internal test with some volunteers in the modern world to optimize the game.</br>
</br>
Since it was an MMORPG from a different era, the degree of cultural acceptance from the 21st century would differ from the 22nd century; he didn't want to decrease the quality of the game because of lack of attention to cultural appropriateness.</br>
</br>
"… To produce 100 prototypes, the logistics department took apart a chamber to gather enough molybdenum. Why would we not use the chamber as the platform in the game? Compared to this outdated technology, the more advanced chamber would be better in both performance and comfort."</br>
</br>
[What? Took apart a chamber?]</br>
</br>
[That's a big loss…] Jiang Chen cursed in his mind, but he didn't show any of it on his face.</br>
</br>
"Performance? Would playing the game with the helmet make the game lag?"</br>
</br>
"It won't lag. Lag won't be displayed in the game with rather simple physics," Du Yongkong said.</br>
</br>
"Then it would be okay. This type of fantasy game doesn't need to have a realistic physics model. Don't take apart any more chambers though; I only need the one hundred helmets for now," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Du Yongkong nodded. Seeing that Jiang Chen wasn't going to change his mind, he didn't speak any more. He was only making a recommendation for his boss; there was no reason to argue with the boss over it.</br>
</br>
"Then that's all. I'll get people to transport the server and the helmets in a bit. Also, I almost forgot, did you add security measures to the helmets?" Jiang Chen patted his own head and asked hastily.</br>
</br>
"I did - the molybdenum gold dense lead barrier can prevent any scanning. Also, if anyone attempted to open the helmet, the internal security circuit would forcefully overload and destroy all the graphene circuits and chips inside the helmet. It would become a piece of junk…"</br>
</br>
But would anyone really want this outdated technology? Du Yongkong muttered in his mind with skepticism.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen happily patted him on the shoulder. "Haha, good job. Go find Wang Qin in a bit. All the game developers will receive 50 crystals. This is the reward for your hard work!"</br>
</br>
"Thank you Boss!" Du Yongkong was ecstatic.</br>
</br>
50 crystals were equivalent to a NAC knight's basic salary for a month.</br>
</br>
He didn't have any more doubts about the boss' decision.</br>
</br>
Who cares? As long as the boss was happy.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was either a nuclear crater or a circular lake.</br>
</br>
The lake reflected a light green luminescence in the night just like a sea of fireflies - beautiful but ominous.</br>
</br>
The lake was clear but thick like a gel; the occasional wind wouldn't cause any disturbance to its stillness.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the lake, a small mountain floated in the middle.</br>
</br>
It was a small mountain formed by dark red chunks of meat. The blood vessels on its surface wriggled as they sent nutrients to the others parts of its body. The massive body rested on dense tentacles like an octopus or an enormous tree with deep roots in the middle of the lake.</br>
</br>
A tree formed by flesh.</br>
</br>
There was a hair-like structure ten meters long, about as thick as an arm, growing on top. At the tip of it was a meat bubble that could light up. It was like a bright lamp hanging on an antenna. A faint light flickered as it listened to something or called for something.</br>
</br>
No one had visited this place for twenty years since no one could access this place - it was the forbidden territory of life.</br>
</br>
But still, a few mutants could approach the area.</br>
</br>
The Death Claw was one of them.</br>
</br>
Perhaps guided by the faint light, a Death Claw slowly moved toward the nuclear crater.</br>
</br>
It moved while it swung its spike-covered tails as its sharp claws clamped on a feeble survivor.</br>
</br>
The survivor's face was disgustingly ugly - his festered skin had mutated spores growing on top, the high radiation levels mutated every single cell in his body. His bloated mouth moved slowly and murmured undistinguishable words. Following the movements of his facial muscles, skin began to fall off his face.</br>
</br>
His face was miserable, but he was also solemn.</br>
</br>
Just like it was practicing a mysterious ceremony, the Death Claw lifted him up.</br>
</br>
Following the frightened howl of the prey, it threw him into the lake.</br>
</br>
The thick waves spread and quickly engulfed the person.</br>
</br>
Just like usual, after the Death Claw made a tribute, it left.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, something unexpected occurred!</br>
</br>
The thick liquid became turbulent as giant bubbles emerged under the surface just like boiling water. The survivor who sank into the lake was the last match that ignited the entire lake.</br>
</br>
The Death Claw suddenly turned its head as its bell-sized eyes narrowed into a line and its gaze shifted in shock between the rising radiance and the restless chunks of meat.</br>
</br>
At the same time, in a mansion far away, the asleep Lin Lin suddenly opened her eyes.</br>
</br>
Her breathing was still rhythmic as if she was still in a deep sleep.</br>
</br>
But the crimson red in her pupils was particularly visible in the darkness.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was mid-June already, so Jiang Chen wanted to return to the modern world soon. Since everything on the wasteland had been taken care of and the last group of recruits headed to the front lines yesterday, there was no point in him going to the office. As the wife of the general, Sun Jiao would take care of small tasks for him. If there were larger tasks, Lin Lin would message him with the fourth dimension messenger.</br>
</br>
</br>
But he still had to go to the office today as a representative from Hang city wanted to see him.</br>
</br>
"Ha-" Yawning, Lin Lin rubbed her sleepy eyes and walked out of her room.</br>
</br>
"Did you stay up late?" Jiang Chen, who was above to leave, asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"No, I don't know why I'm so tired… Hungry too." Lin Lin rubbed her flat stomach and walked to the kitchen drowsily.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know why but Lin Lin had been tired for the past while. Jiang Chen initially thought she was tired the way regular humans got tired, but Lin Lin told him that digitalized humans didn't get sick.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at her back, puzzled, but he didn't say anything as he left.</br>
</br>
The sky was exceptionally clear today; perhaps the seasonal wind from the Pacific blew away some radiation dust that covered the wasteland. When he arrived at his office, a man in a suit was already waiting for him.</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen, his eyes lit up as he extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his hand with friendliness.</br>
</br>
"Kong Jie, the president of the Hang Merchant Alliance Commerce Chamber." The man shook Jiang Chen's hand for a long time as he introduced himself.</br>
</br>
Judging by the calluses on his hand, this guy didn't seem like a merchant at all.</br>
</br>
Although he'd never been to Hang before, Jiang Chen heard of the Merchant Alliance before.</br>
</br>
There were quite a number of merchants at the Sixth Street who came from Hang. The electronics, tobacco, and adhesives from Hang were all top sellers here. And the majority of the merchants from Hang all belonged to the Hang Merchant Alliance. Having this many merchants as members was indicative of the power of this organization.</br>
</br>
But between Hang and Wanghai City was Jia City, and 150 kilometers to travel was considered far on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, NAC general. Why don't we sit down before we talk?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Haha, of course…"</br>
</br>
After some small talk, the two sat down on the sofa.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen signaled Han Junhua to leave for now. He interlocked his fingers and rested them on his knee as he asked directly:</br>
</br>
"It's so chaotic outside, so why is the president making a personal visit here?'</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't forget that Jia City was still in the hands of the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
"I'm here to bring friendliness and bring crystals. And a personal reason: I wanted to see the rumored King of Wanghai City," Kong Jie said.</br>
</br>
[The King of Wanghai? Flattering words, but I like it.]</br>
</br>
"Haha, is this how people in Hang refer to me?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Of course, the merchants that returned from the Sixth Street all praised you. A dictator who recognized the importance of merchants and who could follow the rules of the game he established. To be honest, when we heard that the Group of Ten Council was replaced by a dictator, we assumed the worst and thought we lost the brightest market, but you proved us wrong," Kong Jie said with humor.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Kong Jie was still not getting to the point, Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised as he continued:</br>
</br>
"It's an honor to receive such praise from your merchants; the Hang merchants will always be our friends. But I think before we flatter each other, we should get to the point."</br>
</br>
Kong Jie laughed.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, before I came, I had a great proposal."</br>
</br>
"And now?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"I changed my mind."</br>
</br>
"Could I hear the proposal you abandoned?" Jiang Chen leaned on the sofa as he stared at the president with a shrewd face.</br>
</br>
"My proposal was for both parties to send out a force to take out the nail that's blocking our trade route."</br>
</br>
"What about now?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Now I realized that you don't seem to need us - you can take out the nail yourself."</br>
</br>
As he said that, Jiang Chen sensed a trace of concern hidden deep in his eyes.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"That's right," Jiang Chen said with straightforwardness.</br>
</br>
He didn't hide the power of NAC because there was no need. Once the NAC flag flew above Jia City, the survivors, merchants, and mercenaries would naturally circulate the unknown but powerful name to the entire wasteland.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was observing Kong Jie while Kong Jie was doing the same thing.</br>
</br>
"I sense danger from you."</br>
</br>
"Could I interpret that as a compliment?" Jiang Chen crossed his legs as he said in a joking voice.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Our merchants are spread all over the wasteland; there aren't a lot of forces that would scare us. The Northern Alliance Area is one of them, as are you."</br>
</br>
"Because of my weapons?"</br>
</br>
"Because of your ambition." Kong Jie stared right into Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
This act was extremely disrespectful in a friendly meeting, but he still did it. He wanted to see if Jiang Chen's eyes could reveal anything that could prove his assumption. In actuality, he did it because Jiang Chen didn't bother to disguise his ambition.</br>
</br>
"How so?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"From the configuration of the base." Kong Jie shifted in his seat as he scanned the room decorations. "As well as this office. For the people who prefer order, they have a high standard of living for themselves and their neighbors. Of course, the best way to demonstrate that is the name 'NAC.' New Asia Corporation? Good name."</br>
</br>
"Do you feel unsettled?" To Kong Jie's comments, Jiang Chen only answered dubiously.</br>
</br>
"That's right," Kong Jie said directly. "Our merchants are all considering one question: if you take out the nail between us, who could promise that you wouldn't step foot into Hang from Jia City?"</br>
</br>
"So your recommendation is?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Let Jia City become the buffer zone between us. Without a land route, our merchants can develop routes in the shallow sea or Tai Lake. But without this nail, we won't sleep well at night." Kong Jie stared into Jiang Chen's eyes, making his proposal with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible." Jiang Chen rejected it right away. "Even if we don't attack them, the mutated humans will launch an attack on us. By that time, they would have a natural advantage; no one could guarantee that the war won't spread across the Taifu river. I won't prioritize short-term peace to risk losing an inevitable war."</br>
</br>
"We could fund you to build up your defenses along the river." Kong Jie raised his finger. "Half a million crystals, on the condition that you won't send your forces west."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not moved at all with this proposal.</br>
</br>
"Then that's unfortunate; we already raised two million crystals through the distribution of war bonds."</br>
</br>
The negotiation was at a stalemate.</br>
</br>
Kong Jie and Jiang Chen stared at each other and fell into silence.</br>
</br>
Moments later, Kong Jie suddenly spoke with a smile.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Do you know how the mutated humans obtained so many weapons?"</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen didn't seem too interested.</br>
</br>
"Based on the data we gathered, an organization named The Dusk that migrated from the Northern Alliance Area is providing support for them," Kong Jie said with an ambiguous smile.</br>
</br>
This information was outdated - the last time The Dusk sent out Sun Xiaorou to assassinate Jiang Chen, he already obtained that information through his unique methods. Regarding the operations of The Dusk, he knew a man called Bo Yu provided help to the mutated humans.</br>
</br>
It wasn't hard to deduce this as the mutated humans were weak industrially, yet they had heavy machines or even cannons. Jiang Chen would never believe they didn't have support from a third party.</br>
</br>
But from Kong Jie's ambiguous expression, Jiang Chen read something else.</br>
</br>
"Are you threatening me?" Jiang Chen said dubiously as he looked into his eyes.</br>
</br>
"I didn't say anything. But as merchants, we retain the right to invest in any projects that can offer a return." Kong Jie shrugged.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sneered.</br>
</br>
Since it was already so obvious, why was he still afraid to admit the truth?</br>
</br>
"You're playing with fire."</br>
</br>
"I am looking for an opportunity to work together," Kong Jie corrected him without backing down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly stood up.</br>
</br>
A trace of anxiety flashed across Kong Jie's eyes, but he quickly calmed down.</br>
</br>
"If you think you can fund the mutated humans to prevent us from removing them from Jia City, you can go ahead." Jiang Chen walked in front of him. He stopped and stared into Kong Jie's eyes from above as he said, "But I can tell you now that if you support the mutated humans..."</br>
</br>
Unable to breathe because of the oppressive atmosphere, Kong Jie held his breath and waited for the next sentence from the dictator.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned and spoke the words Kong Jie didn't want to hear the most.</br>
</br>
"Then there would be war."</br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the office froze, but it quickly faded by the next sentence from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I trust that your party's foresight, you wouldn't make such an ill-advised decision."</br>
</br>
With his eyes wavering for a while, Kong Jie finally nodded in hesitation.</br>
</br>
"Excellent. Welcome back to the negotiation table then." Jiang Chen smiled and sat back down.</br>
</br>
With the tension alleviated, Kong Jie finally breathed fresh air again.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, he realized his entire back was drenched in cold sweat.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The negotiations ended peacefully.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't plan to discuss the details of military operations in the fall but rather, he began talking about how to share trade routes after Jia City was captured. Although the war hadn't started yet, Jiang Chen already considered the city his.</br>
</br>
Kong Jie still expressed concern with the fact that if Jia City was captured by Jiang Chen, Hang would be surrounded by him. But with Jiang Chen's firm position, he couldn't do anything about it.</br>
</br>
After they reached an agreement with the trade routes, supply stations, and patrol stations, Kong Jie hastily left.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Kong Jie had left, Han Junhua walked in.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you just detain him?"</br>
</br>
"Because that would serve no purpose." Jiang Chen yawned and waved his hand. "This is the annoying part about negotiating with such a loose organization - even if you killed its leader, it would just select a new one. Or rather, the leader itself is basically like a mascot. When I shook hands with him, I knew he wasn't a professional merchant."</br>
</br>
A professional merchant would not have calluses from holding guns. Instead of being a true leader, he was a representative pushed forward by a bunch of merchants.</br>
</br>
"You don't seem to be worried about the reaction from Hang?" Han Junhua asked.</br>
</br>
"They need a market, and we have the biggest market in Suhang province. Safety or crystals - they must choose between them, and I firmly believe they will choose the latter. Especially since my attitude towards the Sixth Street merchants seemed to ease his mind. Even if they were taken over by the NAC, their assets wouldn't be compromised… Most merchants would think this way." Jiang Chen walked over to the desk.</br>
</br>
There was someone knocking on the door.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
It was Wang Qin. She had a grave expression.</br>
</br>
"General, information coming from the Sixth Street stated that mutant activities have been on the rise as of late. Mutants including mutated cockroaches and mutated rats are all exhibiting strong, aggressive behaviors. Typically, these mutants wouldn't attack survivors… The information reported that Wanghai City is preparing for the second flood of mutants."</br>
</br>
"Flood of mutants?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
He had never experienced a mutant flood before; he just heard rumors about the terror of it. In the past when the World Alliance Organization had yet to launch the space colonization ships, a mutant flood erupted in Wanghai City. The ex-military army stationed near the city's research institute was driven out by the ferocious mutants.</br>
</br>
The shock also impacted the Sixth Street, but with the equipment left by the World Alliance Organization, they managed to fend off the attack. At that time, the Sixth Street confirmed its rule under the Group of Ten Council.</br>
</br>
But this time…</br>
</br>
Wang Qin nodded.</br>
</br>
"Alert Wang Zhaowu to be on the precautionary side; he's closer to the city center. I will give him permission to open the fallout shelter door and lead the citizens on the surface to retreat into the fallout shelter. At the same time, increase the fallout shelter energy reserve to 100 fuel rods. You will be responsible for that," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Understood." Wang Qin nodded.</br>
</br>
The time between each fallout shelter opening varied; no one knew when the other fallout shelters in Wanghai City would open. If he lost fallout shelter no.27, that would mean that the research abilities of the NAC would decrease substantially. Jiang Chen would not permit such a thing from happening, so if a mutant flood were to erupt, he had to protect the safety of the scientists.</br>
</br>
Whether or not a mutant flood would actually occur, there was nothing wrong with being prepared.</br>
</br>
"Also, establish a temporary emergency shelter underground. Prepare necessary barricades, beds, nutrient supplies, and heaters. Although we know these things probably won't be used, prepare these things just in case."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Seeing that Jiang Chen had no further instructions, Wang Qin quickly left.</br>
</br>
After a brief pause, Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua again.</br>
</br>
"For the next few days… Mhmm, perhaps for half a month, I have something to take care of elsewhere. Just discuss things with Sun Jiao for now since she takes on my responsibilities when I'm away. If the mutated flood does erupt, I'll come back immediately."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought Han Junhua would ask where he was going, but surprisingly, she only nodded.</br>
</br>
"Okay. But my recommendation is that if the mutant flood was to erupt, as the general, you shouldn't return to the areas with high danger."</br>
</br>
"I will return because there are people who are important to me here," Jiang Chen said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"… I will protect them for you," Han Junhua promised calmly.</br>
</br>
"Thank you. But don't be too worried, they may just be rumors."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted her on the shoulder and left the office.</br>
</br>
The door closed.</br>
</br>
Long after watching the door close, Han Junhua squeezed her own face.</br>
</br>
Then she put her hand down.</br>
</br>
"Weird."</br>
</br>
She muttered to herself with an emotionless voice then looked outside.</br>
</br>
It was bright and clear outside; not a single cloud was in the sky.</br>
</br>
But the brightness gave her a surreal feeling.</br>
</br>
This feeling was just like the calm before the storm.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, the skies were clear at the wasteland, but when he returned to the modern world, it was pouring rain.</br>
</br>
The grain-sized rain droplets splashed on the windows and made harsh sounds along with the violent wind. The leaves on the palm trees outside were all blowing to one side and the waves in the sea were rolling thunderously without any sign of humanity.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Ayesha heard a noise in the bedroom, so she slinked into Jiang Chen's room like a quiet cat.</br>
</br>
Her clothes right now were particularly eye-catching, or rather, whenever she was home, her clothes were always eye-catching. She had just a loose white shirt on with two smooth and perfectly shaped legs swinging out underneath. From a psychological perspective, this style not only drew the curiosity of the husband wondering whether she was "only" wearing a shirt, but it would also tease the husband as he watched the legs swinging.</br>
</br>
Combined with a cold expression and passionate sight…</br>
</br>
Okay, Jiang Chen admitted, if it weren't for the fact that his clip was completely empty, he would've leaped onto her and did her on the spot.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood up, laughed and helped her button up one button.</br>
</br>
"Come out with me for a bit. Uhh, do you need to change first?"</br>
</br>
"There's a typhoon outside." Ayesha kissed Jiang Chen as she said gently.</br>
</br>
From her voice, Jiang Chen could sense a hint.</br>
</br>
"Typhoon? Is it serious?"</br>
</br>
"Around three hundred kilometers away from Coro Island and the wind magnitude is level 13… The news recommended reducing travel."</br>
</br>
[It shouldn't be too serious then.]</br>
</br>
Seeing as Jiang Chen didn't respond, Ayesha said in a faint voice, "It's been almost a month."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, of course, knew what she was referring to, so he touched her forehead with his and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Tonight?"</br>
</br>
With her face blushing, a curve appeared on Ayesha's mouth as she buried her face in Jiang Chen's hug timidly.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen changed into somewhat formal clothes before he came into the garage and opened the black Sonata's door. In this hideous weather, he obviously didn't want to drive his Lamborghini.</br>
</br>
Seeing as Jiang Chen got into the car, Ayesha, already sitting in the driver's seat, started the car and drove into the pouring storm.</br>
</br>
Because of the storm, they drove slowly. It took them half an hour before they arrived at the presidential palace and entered the underground garage. After examining their identities, the security courteously allowed them to pass.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived at the president's office, Zhang Yapin was in a heated debate with his lead advisor and vice president. Zhang Yapin stopped for a second when he saw Jiang Chen at the door and came up to greet him.</br>
</br>
"Welcome Mr. Jiang, what brought you here?"</br>
</br>
The vice president and lead advisor weren't too displeased when their conversation with the president was interrupted; they merely examined Jiang Chen with a few curious looks.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook hands with Zhang Yapin before he asked:</br>
</br>
"Are you busy now?"</br>
</br>
"Diplomatic problem. Haha, gentlemen, it's already lunchtime. Why don't we wait until 2 before we start our discussion again?"</br>
</br>
The lead advisor and the vice president exchanged glances before they nodded.</br>
</br>
"No problem." "I agree."</br>
</br>
The two left, leaving only Zhang Yapin and Jiang Chen in the office. Zhang Yapin walked up to the coffee pot and poured two cups of coffee before he sat down on the sofa and gestured Jiang Chen to give the coffee a try.</br>
</br>
"Blue Mountain Coffee."</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen took a drink and leaned back on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I guess you're not here just for me to make you coffee." Perhaps he'd been busy for the past few days, but Zhang Yapin's voice was fast.</br>
</br>
After a few months of experience, the young president finally gave off the vibe of a politician. Although Zhang Yapin didn't say anything yet, he knew Jiang Chen must be here for something.</br>
</br>
Seeing as Zhang Yapin was so direct, Jiang Chen didn't bother making small talk anymore. "Ocean resources development license and mining license - help me take care of these."</br>
</br>
"You're planning to mine? I remember that there's only a low-reserve cooper mine in Pannu Islands," Zhang Yapin said with a frown.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head. "Not above the sea surface, I want to mine under the ocean."</br>
</br>
"Underwater mining?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. The location is south of Ange Island; it won't affect the local ecosystem there."</br>
</br>
"…Okay, I'll take care of this for you." Although he was skeptical whether Jiang Chen could mine, Zhang Yapin still nodded. "Anything else?"</br>
</br>
"I have nothing else." Jiang Chen shook his head. "But you seem to have something."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin had a bitter smile and took a sip of his coffee.</br>
</br>
"The attempts by country F to use the excuses of disrupting area stability and illegally detaining hostages to impose economic sanctions on Xin along with Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia and other neighboring countries. For example, increasing export taxes to Xin would greatly increase the cost of living for ordinary citizens. Also-"</br>
</br>
"What's the reaction of each country?' Because he didn't understand the situation, Jiang Chen interrupted him as he cut straight to the point.</br>
</br>
[Illegally detaining hostages? Fu*k? How thick is your skin to dare to say this?] Jiang Chen cursed in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Because of the stance of Hua, the south sea countries all stand with country F while New Guinea expressed neutrality on this issue, but it wasn't a big deal - we didn't have significant trade with those countries."</br>
</br>
"The problem is Australia?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Zhang Yapin nodded.</br>
</br>
Australia was the major trade partner of Xin; 80% of the products sold in Xin supermarkets came from the ports of Australia. If Australia favored country F, it would be detrimental to Xin's economy.</br>
</br>
"Based on the new arms deal between Australia and country F, F would purchase an out-of-service warship with a displacement of 3600 tons. While Australia didn't express their stance yet, based on the fact that F could use this deal as leverage, Australia has a high chance of favoring country F."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen crossed his legs and deliberated.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yapin's expression looked rather helpless since a small country like Xin had no voice internationally. If Australia favored country F, Xin couldn't do anything about it.</br>
</br>
"Cancel the trial in mid-July and release the 41 soldiers without conditions…? But that's impossible since we already announced the trial date to the international and local media. The international media also all submitted coverage requests to our supreme court already," Zhang Yapin said while rubbing his weary eyes.</br>
</br>
The fact that things had developed to this point meant that there was no possibility of turning back. Once the 41 soldiers were convicted of their crimes, country F would lose all face internationally, and the "strong stance" employed by Aquino would become a complete joke.</br>
</br>
If a small country could slap you in the face, how well does your strong stance work? It was already embarrassing for the invasion to occur, but without remedying the problem, Aquino would have to face the wrath of the soldiers' families as well as skepticism from his own citizens.</br>
</br>
But country F's actions still made Jiang Chen surprised; the incident with the mercenaries still hadn't taught them a lesson.</br>
</br>
"The ruling party of Australia is?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Liberal party."</br>
</br>
"What about the opposition party?"</br>
</br>
"Labor party… Is there any problem?"</br>
</br>
"Good, just leave this to me." A smile suddenly emerged on Jiang Chen's face as he stood on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Leave this to you?" Zhang Yapin was puzzled.</br>
</br>
"A problem that can't be solved through foreign diplomacy can be solved politically. Don't forget - I'm a businessman and there are no boundaries for businessmen."</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen finished the coffee on the table, he left the completely confused Zhang Yapin and walked out the door with large strides.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 392: Arms Sale Agreement</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In terms of diplomatic relationships, in contrast with its allies that were keen on flexing their muscles on the international stage, Australia's performance had been mediocre at best. It was partially because of its unfavorable geographic location, but also because its citizens never paid too much attention to international affairs.</br>
</br>
As a joke, while the Australia government was attempting to win a seat on the UN security council, the opposition party laughed at the president for spending too much time on international politics, thus neglecting the crisis surrounding climate change.</br>
</br>
Compared to Britain, France and UA that liked to play international political games during election years, Australia was calmer. But behind the calmness was a strong naval presence.</br>
</br>
The Royal Australian Navy currently possessed six "Collins" class submarines, three "Adelaide" class warships, eight "Anzac" class warships, six mine hunters and other vessels; they could be considered the strongest naval force in the Pacific region.</br>
</br>
Not only that, but currently the Royal Australian Navy was pushing the "SEA1400" and "SEA1000" projects with projected costs of 7.5 billion and 37 billion USD respectively. The projects would construct three "Hobart" class Aegis destroyers and 12 "Collins" class submarines, with the goal of replacing the existing fleet by 2020 and ultimately changing the existing naval force by 2030 to push for navy modernization…</br>
</br>
But all this required money.</br>
</br>
Considering its rather calm diplomatic policies and tight budget, its determination to modernize its navy was incredibly ambitious.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the disposal of old navy vessels had been a problem that troubled Canberra for the past while. If country F was willing to purchase some old ships, the Australian government had no reason to object.</br>
</br>
As for the extra condition requiring them to change their stance in the west Pacific, the Australians didn't mind since Xin was only a small country with a population of twenty thousand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen would target this sale to ruin country F's plan.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In Australia's capital, Canberra.</br>
</br>
Outside of a Burger King, a taxi stopped.</br>
</br>
The door opened and a middle-aged man with a grey trenchcoat walked out. After he examined the interior of the restaurant, he cautiously looked behind him.</br>
</br>
After he confirmed that there were no reporters following him, he opened the door and walked in. He didn't order anything as he sat down at a seat in the innermost part of the restaurant and looked at the black man that sat across him.</br>
</br>
Barkary, a manager at Celestial Trade Company.</br>
</br>
"Barkary?" The middle-aged man scanned his phone before he looked at Barkary and asked in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"That's right, and you must be Brody." Barkary extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
Brody, a member of the liberal party, had a reputation within the party second only to the party head, Malcolm.</br>
</br>
</br>
Hesitating for a second, Brody shook his hand and spoke while staring into his eyes.</br>
</br>
"The manager of Celestial Trade Company? Australia doesn't need a security company; I probably can't help you."</br>
</br>
Barkary laughed and put his arms on the table.</br>
</br>
"But we can definitely help you out."</br>
</br>
Brody raised his eyebrows and signaled him to continue.</br>
</br>
Barkary smiled and exposed his white teeth. "I heard you have an inactive MEKO-200 warship-"</br>
</br>
"Impossible. We already decided to sell that to country F, so there's no way we can sell it to you. If you're here for that, you're out of luck." Brody immediately knew what he was going to say as he rejected him outright.</br>
</br>
"200 employment positions in your riding," Barkary said.</br>
</br>
Brody wanted to get up, but his interest was piqued, so he sat down again.</br>
</br>
For a parliament member, there was nothing he cared about more than his riding. Although he was scornful at Barkary's suggestion, he still sat down and waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"You haven't figured out the situation, Mr. Barkary. I can't convince the parliament to sell a navy vessel to a country we're unfamiliar with, even if it's just an inactive navy vessel," Brody said.</br>
</br>
"I never said it would be sold to a country." Barkary shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Not possible for private individuals either."</br>
</br>
Brody wanted to get up, but Barkary pulled him back down and signaled Brody to give him ten minutes.</br>
</br>
The parliament member sat down again as Barkary spoke with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Our boss is planning to purchase a bankrupted amusement park located in New South Wales for five million USD. The vessel will be purchased under the name of the amusement park and converted into a military museum. This is not against the arms sales regulation because it's an Australian corporation that will purchase the vessel, and it's for non-military purposes."</br>
</br>
And this point, Barkary stopped talking and watched Brody's eyes gradually lighting up. He knew that this parliament member was tempted by the proposal.</br>
</br>
After a moment of deliberation, Brody said in an undertone:</br>
</br>
"How much are you planning to pay?"</br>
</br>
"11 million USD."</br>
</br>
Brody shook his head. "I can only tell you that country F's offer is not below 15 million USD - I can't convince the president with this offer."</br>
</br>
"Is this as simple as 11 million USD?" Barkary asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean?" Brody raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"This year is the election year. Do you think voters are more inclined to see a president who is keen to sell a navy vessel to a country that disrupts regional security, or a president who is working hard to improve employment and maintain regional stability? Think about it - the president isn't a businessman; the voters won't care how much you sell the vessel for as long as the number isn't too absurd."</br>
</br>
Because of its amount of time in service, the second-hand navy vessel wasn't worth a lot of money to begin with. The "Hamilton" class patrol ship purchased by country F from the UA was 10 million. While this Australian vessel had served for comparatively less time, it was definitely not worth 15 million USD. The reason why country F was willing to pay a premium was because Australia agreed to sell the weapons and radar along with the vessel.</br>
</br>
Australia also took a diplomatic risk when selling this vessel, because the sale could be viewed as an act of aggression. Therefore, this proposal had a divergent opinion in the president's office.</br>
</br>
As a politician, Brody obviously considered that aspect. The reason he didn't reveal the controversy about the deal with country F was because he wanted to gain more out of the negotiations. Due to the price drop in iron and aluminum ores, Australia's economy had a lackluster performance in 2015. In this type of economic environment, the deal that would gain the support of voters was a no-brainer.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Barkary put all the facts on the table, Brody's gaze drifted away and his fingers knocked on the table continuously while he debated the pros and cons.</br>
</br>
"The arms sale is led by the UA - we can't completely disregard the position of our ally." Brody lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
Barkary laughed and shifted his chair back.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Brody, do you think the UA is more important or the upcoming election in 2016? If you don't win, your efforts in diplomatic relations are only going to help pave the road for the Labor party. If you think my proposal isn't attractive enough, we can also go talk to the Labor party. I trust they will definitely take this opportunity."</br>
</br>
Barkary then stood up.</br>
</br>
But this time, Brody grabbed him.</br>
</br>
Looking at the expression on the parliament member's face, a victorious smile appeared on Barkary's face.</br>
</br>
He knew he had successfully convinced him.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The rain outside the window was still pouring. In the distance, a few strikes of lightning occasionally appeared.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was already naked on the soft bed. A sheet covered his stomach while he had a phone in his hand. He looked relaxed.</br>
</br>
"It's done. A member of parliament, Brody, agreed to discuss our deal with the party leader."</br>
</br>
"Excellent, 16 million USD has been transferred to your account. You can now go purchase the bankrupted amusement park and the inactive navy vessel." Lying on the bed, Jiang Chen sent these instructions to Barkary in Australia.</br>
</br>
Once country F found out their navy vessel would be turned into an amusement park, what would they think? It wasn't important for the amusement park to make a profit, but it was meant to solve the awkward diplomatic situation Xin was currently in. He had to drag wavering Australia off of country F's boat.</br>
</br>
Only 16 million? Jiang Chen could afford that.</br>
</br>
"Also, what do you think of Brody as a person?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Devious." Barkary used one word to describe him.</br>
</br>
"Influence within the party?"</br>
</br>
"Only second to the party leader, Malcolm. He helped Malcolm win the election in 2013."</br>
</br>
"Maintain a good relationship with Brody; we could use him in the future. Also, you can hint at him to see if he's interested in becoming the party leader. We can provide some election funds." Jiang Chen had a dubious smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Okay," Barkary answered concisely.</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen let out a long breath.</br>
</br>
Without Australia's involvement, the economic sanctions would only be words on paper.</br>
</br>
Then the sheets covering his lower half moved and slowly lifted.</br>
</br>
A gorgeous face appeared under it. A pair of crystal blue eyes stared at him followed by a rhythmic up and down motion.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and caressed Ayesha's dark brown hair.</br>
</br>
"I still need to make a phone call-"</br>
</br>
But just as his fingertips brushed her hair, a tingling sensation began to diffuse in his body as Jiang Chen tightened his back muscles like he was electrocuted.</br>
</br>
Violent vibrations and a few gulping sounds.</br>
</br>
Tempted by the pair of eyes mixing frost and passion, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and tossed his phone to the side.</br>
</br>
What happened next could not be spoken.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 393: Transporting Ores</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"You incompetent fool! What are you doing! You negotiated for half a month, and this is the result you give me?"</br>
</br>
Since half an hour ago, the roaring sound in the F president's office didn't stop.</br>
</br>
Aquino threw the stack of documents on the minister of foreign affairs' face furiously; his chest pumped up and down violently.</br>
</br>
F's naval units were most dependent on imports. The only two "Hamilton" class patrol ships were all the scrap junks of UA. It was quite funny that every time in an arms sale, the F minister of defense would beg for the UA to retain the equipment on the ship, but it would always be rejected.</br>
</br>
Now that the Australian government finally agree and indicated that they were willing to retain some of the equipment and weapons, the navy vessel that was about to be theirs is now gone? Aquino wanted to use this boat as his stake in the negation in the south sea!</br>
</br>
The minister of foreign affair also felt horrible. The Australian president already agreed, but today when they were preparing to discuss the details of the agreement, they unexpectedly began to toughen up on some of the key problems.</br>
</br>
Overnight, they suddenly changed their stance, this caught F representatives there to negotiate completely off guard.</br>
</br>
The lead advisor looked at the upset minister of foreign affair and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Mr. President, we should phone the Capital--"</br>
</br>
The door was suddenly pushed open as a member of parliament walked in, in quick steps.</br>
</br>
"The "Octopus" typhoon passed by the coast near OSL city, multiple buildings including a hospital suddenly collapsed when the typhoon passed through. Currently, there are 31 confirmed casualties…"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!" Aquino shouted in frustration as he walked to the door in quick steps.</br>
</br>
With the series of problems coming at him and the media just criticized him for his weak diplomatic ability, he didn't want them to say he put in a lack of effort on the rescue.</br>
</br>
"The Capital--"</br>
</br>
"Get the minister of foreign affairs to negotiate, I need to be at the area in five hours…"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
It was a disaster when the typhoon passed through, but the weather had cleared up.</br>
</br>
The thunderstorm washed about the dust in the air as the air was fulfilled with a fresh fragrance. The dew on the palm trees outside the window reflected a bright crystal color and reflected the redness rising from the east.</br>
</br>
In the morning, Jiang Chen sat in front of the table while reading the morning news. Based on the meteorologist, the typhoon named "Octopus" was moving westward along the Pacific ring of fire, it scraped by the east side of F and headed towards the south along the coast.</br>
</br>
After putting toast, eggs, and coffee on the table for Jiang Chen, Ayesha leaned forward and kiss him on the cheek and then sat beside him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled at her before he focused on the TV screen again. When he saw the number of cities affected, his eyebrows raised.</br>
</br>
</br>
Ayesha seemed to have read Jiang Chen's thought as she gently asked, "Xia Shiyu is in Xiangjiang, is she okay?"</br>
</br>
"I'll give her a call in a bit."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded, picked up the utensils, and began to work on her own breakfast.</br>
</br>
It was already mid-June, deepwater started at the beginning of the month. BHP followed the agreement signed with Jiang Chen and shipped one hundred thousand tons of iron ore and twenty hundred thousand tons of aluminum ore to the deepwater port at Coro Island.</br>
</br>
This batch of ores would be used to support industrial production on the wasteland, so the earlier, the better. After breakfast, Ayesha drove Jiang Chen to the port at the south end of Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Typically speaking, imported goods such as ores would be shipped in 20 feet containers. Because of the maximum weight permitted per container, a container could only transport 20 tons of iron ore. Jiang Chen first had no exact concept to the thirty hundred tons of containers, but when he arrived at the port, he was flabbergasted.</br>
</br>
The ten thousand something containers stuffed the not so spacious port fully. The bored port manager and his team had to work overtime because of this batch of goods. Therefore, when they saw Jiang Chen, they were certainly not in a good mood.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't speak much with them as he called Zhang Yapin and told him to give them all a vacation. After confirming that they all left, Jiang Chen told Ayesha to guard the entrance of the port before he started the lengthy transport process.</br>
</br>
To prevent the warehouse from blowing up, Jiang Chen had to go back and notify Sun Jiao. Then they drove to the steel plant located in Shenxiang. After getting rid of the workers there, they placed the transport marker on the empty land used to store raw materials at the back of the steel plant.</br>
</br>
It was not until noon did Jiang Chen finish the entire process.</br>
</br>
"I'm so fu*cking tired…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slapped his hand and walked out of the now spacious port.</br>
</br>
He already made up his mind to establish a steel plant at Ange Island, at least to process the raw materials a little, or bring steel processing from the apocalypse to the modern world, it was too inefficient to transport ores.</br>
</br>
Also, the Fishbone base must build a bigger warehouse to accept a large quantity of resources.</br>
</br>
When he got in the car, Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going now?"</br>
</br>
"The ferry terminal, I have to go Ange Island in a bit." As he said, Jiang Chen took out his phone.</br>
</br>
She nodded and started the car.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Xiangjiang.</br>
</br>
Because of the orange storm alert, Future Technology was on break today. Xia Shiyu stayed in the apartment and didn't even step her foot out of the door. Watching the grain sized raindrops, her sight moved back to the TV.</br>
</br>
"… Behind me is a public hospital in F's OSL city. From the outside, it is clear that the surrounding area is in shambles. F has already deployed military efforts to conduct rescues in the area…" On the screen, a reporter in a raincoat looked frantic.</br>
</br>
Country F? Pretty close to Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's geography was not the best, she only remembered the approximate location of Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
[I wonder how he… Eh? Why do I have to think of him?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu covered her somewhat burning face, at the same time, she grabbed the remote on the table and switched the channel.</br>
</br>
She didn't like to watch the news.</br>
</br>
In her memory, she only paid attention to the news two times. Once when Jiang Chen went to Iraq, the second time now.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the phone began to ring.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu walked to the bedroom and picked up the phone charging on the nightstand. When she saw the incoming caller's name, her heart beat a little faster. Coincidentally, just as she wanted to confirm he was safe, he called first.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"How is it over there?"</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen's caring voice, she felt warm inside.</br>
</br>
"It's raining pretty hard here, how about you?"</br>
</br>
"It has been raining for the past few days, but it cleared up in the morning. The typhoon is now heading in your direction, be safe, and stay inside. Mhmm, you didn't go to work today right?" Jiang Chen asked her.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"That's good." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
[What do you mean that's good? Which boss urges their employees to take vacations…] Xia Shiyu muttered in her mind.</br>
</br>
"Also, after you finish the tasks on hand, take some time to go to Xin."</br>
</br>
"To Xin? Can I ask if it is some weird project?" Xia Shiyu sighed.</br>
</br>
"Rather than weird, I would say it is astonishing."</br>
</br>
"Astonishing? What exactly is it?"</br>
</br>
"Virtual reality MMORPG, have you heard it?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 394"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 394: Molybdenum Mining Project</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just like what Jiang Chen had expected, after hearing his words, Xia Shiyu was utterly dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Recovering from being dumbfounded, she repeatedly asked Jiang Chen the difference between the virtual reality MMORPG and the existing VR games. When she heard "neural connection," "second life" and other key vocabularies, she immediately stated that she will make a trip after the typhoon clears up.</br>
</br>
To the marketing plan of this era-defining MMORPG, she couldn't wait to start working on it.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Because most of the mines were located in the southern sea region, the headquarter of Future Mining was established on Ange Island. After they met the last time, Yang Yuan have been working on this. With half a month of work, the structure of the company was finally established.</br>
</br>
When he landed on the island, the Celestial Trade Company's vehicle was already waiting on the side of the road. He got in the car as Jiang Chen briefly told him about the destination before the driver started driving.</br>
</br>
The security business of Celestial Trade was divided into military and civilian. The military employees were all located on New Moon Island whereas the civilian workers acted as the bodyguard of key government officials. Jiang Chen's temporary driver was a bodyguard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rolled down the window, put his arm outside, and started to view the backyard that belonged to him.</br>
</br>
Since the last time he visited Ange Island, it has only been a month, but in this one month time, the small island has experienced groundbreaking shifts. The new apartments, houses, and the business street under renovation were all part of the change. Compared to the fishing village before, Ange city finally had some flavors of being a city.</br>
</br>
Because of the infrastructure development plan and the tourism resources construction led by Future International, a lot of foreign merchants smelled the opportunity for business as they attempt to hop on the fast-moving train and enjoy the considerable dividend to be paid in investing in Xin.</br>
</br>
When he passed by the city center, Jiang Chen was shocked to find a Coles store under construction. He faintly recalled that it seemed to be a chain in Australia with domestic operations. Clearly, the lack of department stores in Xin had drawn the attention of Coles group, so they bravely took the first step and selected Ange Island as their first stop to international expansion.</br>
</br>
Because of the international businessmen's massive appetite for land, the Ange government's finance increased substantially. They immediately used the money for infrastructure development, such as expanding roads and building schools.</br>
</br>
The infrastructure not only improved the quality of life of the people, but it also provided a large number of employment opportunities. The high unemployment rate was greatly improved, and the lack of labor even attracted immigrants. The previously city with an empty feeling now was injected by a healthy boost of adrenaline and displayed the liveliness it should possess.</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The employment dorm Jiang Chen provided to Yang Yuan was a mansion by the sea located at the edge of Ange city, there was only a road along with a few rows of giant palm trees, and there was nothing else.</br>
</br>
The car was parked on the side as Jiang Chen told the driver to wait for him. Jiang Chen then walked to the mansion and pressed the bell on the wooden door.</br>
</br>
There were the sound of footsteps before the door was opened shortly after.</br>
</br>
When he saw his old friend Jiang Chen, Yang Yuan warmly welcomed him inside.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? How's the life here." Jiang Chen scanned the decoration inside the living room as he sat on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Perfect beyond my belief, I almost couldn't afford my rent in Australia." Yang Yuan let out a sigh before he looked at Jiang Chen earnestly, "Although it is a bit dramatic, I still have to say, thank you."</br>
</br>
"We're old friends, It's nothing."</br>
</br>
It was not for the industry's unexpected turn of events, with Yang Yuan's resume, his life would be no worse in Australia. Since on this island, other than housing being cheap, nothing else was convenient.</br>
</br>
"Have you eaten yet? Want to have lunch here?"</br>
</br>
"I'm here for that. Will it be troublesome?" Jiang Chen said jokingly.</br>
</br>
"Haha, it's only adding an extra pair of chopsticks, no trouble at all." Yang Yuan laughed.</br>
</br>
"Here are the champagnes." Su Fei took out two bottles of champagne, placed the bottles in front of them, and popped open the cap.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because she knew she had no chance, Su Fei didn't give Jiang Chen the frivolous vibe anymore which made Jiang Chen feel relieved.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen took the glass and smiled friendly at her.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Su Fei smiled and poured for her boyfriend, "You guys chat, I will go cook."</br>
</br>
With how virtuous his girlfriend was, Yang Yuan had a happy expression.</br>
</br>
"Did you lose your soul?" Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
"Haha." Yang Yuan timidly touched his nose, raised the cup, "Let's drink."</br>
</br>
"I didn't know your S.O knew how to cook." This did surprise Jiang Chen; Su Fei didn't look like someone capable of that.</br>
</br>
"Your S.O is really virtuous. I just bought tuna from the fisher in town, you'll love it," Yang Yuan said as he took a drink.</br>
</br>
"Tuna soup?"</br>
</br>
"What soup, Sashimi!" Yang Yuan laughed.</br>
</br>
To the deeply committed roommate, Jiang Chen wholeheartedly wished that he could be together with the person he loves. Although the Su Fei gave him a feeling that she is not a good girl, he would never offer an opinion on other people's relationship.</br>
</br>
They chatted from life to work.</br>
</br>
No wonder he was a talent signed by Rio Tinto in the first year of his master's program, Yang Yuan's ability was indeed strong. When he talked about work, his work ethic was almost comparable to the workaholic Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"The education level of Xin is extremely low, so I hired a lot of technicians from Australia. Because of the massive layoff by Rio Tinto, I met a lot of strong seniors when I was studying for my master's who are currently living off of employment insurance. I asked them for their opinions and the salary they demanded was not high, but they wanted to sign the employment contract according to Australia's standard, and the company provides housing."</br>
</br>
"Vacation and housing are not a problem. I just care about their ability," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan smiled confidently and said with certainty, "Their ability are all strong, they were mostly all employed by Rio Tinto before with a wealth of work experience."</br>
</br>
"How many people?"</br>
</br>
"Considering that the company has yet to have a mining project, I only hired ten people as management."</br>
</br>
"That's not enough, I have a deepwater mining project on hand." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan looked at Jiang Chen in surprise.</br>
</br>
"This fast?"</br>
</br>
"I have some personal relationships with the president," Jiang Chen implicitly said.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan immediately gave Jiang Chen the "I understand" look and laughed. "No wonder the license is approved already. In a lot of countries, it would take more than half a year. Tell me the type of deposition and I'll prepare first if there is a project now. Ten people is definitely not enough."</br>
</br>
"Molybdenum,"</br>
</br>
"Molybdenum? Have you confirmed the location?" Yang Yuan raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and took out a paper map folded in his pocket. Although he didn't understand it, he still marked a molybdenum deposition on the map closest to Ange Island.</br>
</br>
Looking at the red circle on the map, Yang Yuan's frown, looking more and more serious.</br>
</br>
"Do you know that the average depth of the bed is 7500 meters?" Yang Yuan looked at Jiang Chen weirdly.</br>
</br>
"Yeah? Is there a problem?" Jiang Chen was puzzled.</br>
</br>
The deep-sea environment meant that molybdenum being attached to organic matter is wrapped in a manganese-containing colloid, the final formation would sink into the sea and out of the biosphere cycle. This type of marine molybdenum deposition is undoubtedly more likely than the continental deposition of molybdenum deposits, but this deposit generally appears in the deep sea 5000 meters below with deeper deposits being more frequently. In this environment, the extraction will be complicated.</br>
</br>
Although in the early 1970s, manganese nodule mining technology has made some progress, today is still under detailed investigation, assessment, and trial mining stage. At present, theoretically, the deepest mining depth was probably the fluid mining experimental system developed by Japan with a working depth of up to 5250 meters at ideal conditions. But this technology clearly hasn't made a breakthrough. Otherwise, the country that lacked resources would have started building sea platforms a long time ago.</br>
</br>
"So you are saying, the current technology can't extract it?' To this point, Jiang Chen expected already.</br>
</br>
"Might be possible in a lab, and only possible." Yang Yuan had a bitter smile, "Your president friend… is not playing with your right?"</br>
</br>
Indeed, in bystander's eyes, selling a deposition that could not be extracted had no other explanation than fooling you. A lot of major companies that spent billions in technology didn't make a splash, let alone a small mining company with no history; it would even be difficult to extract in the shallow sea.</br>
</br>
When he thought about this, Yang Yuan became a bit nervous. If the mine could really not be extracted, would that be the end of his job then? But to the rigorous standard and uprightness, he held himself to, he couldn't hide such a significant problem.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't seem to exhibit any signs of disappointment or even anger like he thought, he only had a weird expression.</br>
</br>
[Zhang Yapin dare to fool me? Don't kid me.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment and said," I can take care of the underwater mining."</br>
</br>
"But that's 7500 meters." Yang Yuan had to remind him.</br>
</br>
"Only 7500 meters." Jiang Chen smiled with confidence and in an indisputable tone.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan paused. Although he really wanted to use his industry experience to tell Jiang Chen it was unrealistic, the confidence on his face made him waver.</br>
</br>
"I'll take care of the underwater mining technology, your current job is to build a platform located right above for resources transfer, and purchase a transportation vessel, then establish a molybdenum processing plant on Ange Island… Mhmm, and also a steel plant and aluminum plant used to process the ores shipped by BHP," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
It was not worth it to extract iron and aluminum underwater; it was cheaper to import.</br>
</br>
"It would cost a lot of money," Yang Yuan cautioned him.</br>
</br>
"I have enough money."</br>
</br>
He borrowed thirty billion USD. Jiang Chen had enough money right now.</br>
</br>
"… Okay." Yang Yuan picked up the glass and took a drink, "If you insist, I will follow your instructions."</br>
</br>
As they were talking, Su Fei's voice came out of the kitchen.</br>
</br>
"Time to eat. Clean off the table, there are a lot of dishes today."</br>
</br>
"Haha, I already smell it." Yang Yuan stood up and walked to the kitchen to help his girlfriend to bring out the dishes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to help too, but Su Fei who brought the sashimi stopped him.</br>
</br>
"You are the guest; just let me and Yuan do it." Su Fei smiled and went back to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The seafood buffet was put on the table. Sitting on the sofa, drinking champagne, the three began to enjoy the delicious meal.</br>
</br>
During the meal, Jiang Chen had a great conversation with his old friend. Alcohol was a great way to get someone to talk. Since they got along before, right now, they chatted about everything.</br>
</br>
"Also, when do you plan to get married?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Get married? It will depend on how Feifei feels, I'm willing to anytime," Yang Yuan looked a bit drunk as he held Su Fei's hand and said affectionately.</br>
</br>
Su Fei's face was covered in a red hue.</br>
</br>
"Wait a bit longer, we're not in a rush."</br>
</br>
"Haha, that's true, no need to rush." Yang Yuan waved his hand.</br>
</br>
Although he was a master graduate, Su Fei just finished her undergrad and was about 22 years old in age. There was no rush to get married at her age.</br>
</br>
"Don't forget to invite me when you get married, I'm waiting to drink the celebratory wine." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan didn't invite him when he got married which, to this day, bothered him.</br>
</br>
"Of course," Yang Yuan said with the scent of alcohol coming through his nose, "At that time, we'll host a banquet on the beach and invite Old Huang and Old He along."</br>
</br>
"That's a must, I'll take care of the plane tickets."</br>
</br>
"No need, I can still afford that…"</br>
</br>
The champagne's alcohol concentration was not high, and because of the fruity taste, it was lighter even compared to beer. But after several bottles, Jiang Chen felt intoxicated. Looking at Yang Yuan, who normally couldn't drink, he still finished a few bottles to the point where he fell asleep and began snoring.</br>
</br>
Intentional or unintentional, Su Fei changed to a different sitting position beside her boyfriend with her legs crossed. The position was fine, but it was not appropriate for someone sitting across.</br>
</br>
And with how smooth she looked, Jiang Chen didn't believe it was unintentional.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a hidden sigh, he only felt sorry for his old friend, but he wouldn't say anything. Just like how the three roommates all knew what kind of person Fang Yuanyuan was, they didn't tell him either.</br>
</br>
Sometimes, it didn't have to do with right or wrong, but once you point it out, you would be in the wrong.</br>
</br>
"Brother Chen's alcohol tolerance is great, let me propose a toast on behalf of Yuan." Su Fei raised her glass at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and toasted with her.</br>
</br>
"It's getting late, old Yuan is already drunk, I'll leave now."</br>
</br>
"Not going to stay a bit longer?" Seeing Jiang Chen get up, Su Fei tried to convince him to stay.</br>
</br>
Yang Yuan was already lying on the sofa and began snoring. Seeing the smile on Su Fei's face that was asking him to stay, Jiang Chen, of course, understood her intention.</br>
</br>
"No need. I still have some business to take care of this afternoon, I won't disturb you any longer," Jiang Chen thanked her and rejected the offer.</br>
</br>
</br>
Su Fei was not pretty to begin with. Even if she was, Jiang Chen would NTR his friend.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen already say that, Su Fei didn't insist.</br>
</br>
"Okay, let me walk you to the door."</br>
</br>
She warmly sent Jiang Chen to the door as she watched Jiang Chen walk onto the road. When she saw the bodyguard respectfully got off the car and opened the door for him, envy flashed across her face. She was not envious of the car, but the respect on the bodyguard's face.</br>
</br>
That's the feeling of being in upper-class society.</br>
</br>
She then remembered the foreign girl called Ayesha.</br>
</br>
She was jealous of that girl. Why is her boyfriend so rich and powerful…</br>
</br>
Turning around to look at her drunk boyfriend, she let out a sigh and closed the door.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Sitting in the car with the mild sea wind blowing across his face, Jiang Chen gazed at the horizon in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Sir, where are we going to next?" The bodyguard driving asked.</br>
</br>
"The pharmaceutical plant," Jiang Chen answered concisely.</br>
</br>
Because he was drunk, he didn't want to say anything, he just wanted to quietly let the sea wind blow on him so he cleared his mind.</br>
</br>
But not long after, the bodyguard spoke again.</br>
</br>
"Sir, do you need me to turn on air conditioning?"</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen was a bit annoyed, but out of safety consideration, the bodyguard carefully asked.</br>
</br>
"Sir, your seatbelt-"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put on the seatbelt in annoyance.</br>
</br>
"Can't you be like Ayesha-"</br>
</br>
The bodyguard was perplexed, "Sir?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing, sorry, I'm drunk." Jiang Chen blew out a breath mixed with the scent of alcohol and waved his hand.</br>
</br>
With just one look and sometimes without even needing one, Ayesha could acutely read what he needed. And because of this gentle caring, the understanding without words, it made him fall in love with her.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was too much asking a man to know him like that. Just regarding service, the bodyguard of Celestial Trade was impeccable.</br>
</br>
"Sir, you don't have to apologize to me," the bodyguard said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
After a half an hour drive, the car stopped at the gate of the nutrient supply manufacturing plant.</br>
</br>
On the way, Jiang Chen had mostly sobered up. Just as he pushed open the door and was about to step out, he paused.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… That old friend of mine, arrange him a bodyguard, the type with a car."</br>
</br>
[Buddy, this is the most I can do for you.]</br>
</br>
"Okay, sir," The bodyguard said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and headed to the gate.</br>
</br>
Although security at the door recognized Jiang Chen's face, the rule set by Jiang Chen himself was "pupil recognition only" must be adhered to, so the security went up to confirm his identity.</br>
</br>
After looking into the camera for 1 second, the verification process was complete.</br>
</br>
The two soldiers saluted and backed away.</br>
</br>
He entered the lab of the plant and found Zhan Shoujie, taking samples of the produced product.</br>
</br>
"How much nutrient supply did the plant produce?"</br>
</br>
"30000 boxes, stored in the warehouse."</br>
</br>
A box contained 100 tubes of nutrient supply, the first month, therefore, had a production rate of three million tubes of nutrient supply which was quite impressive. With a profit of 5 USD per tube, this month's profit alone was 15 million USD.</br>
</br>
Although it didn't look like much, this was just the start. Once the market expands, Jiang Chen would ask Zhan Shoujie to ramp up production. The 2.1 billion fat people on the planet were all his potential customers.</br>
</br>
"Could we sell these?" Seeing the proud expression on Jiang Chen's face, Zhan Shujie had to interrupt and ask.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, people will be desperate to buy it. Don't worry about sales, I will be hiring professionals to take care of it for me."</br>
</br>
"That's perfect." Zhan Shoujie nodded.</br>
</br>
He was a technician, so he could easily ensure the quality of the products, but he was not an expert in sales.</br>
</br>
"The nutrient supply in the warehouse, package 15 sets of 20 tubes for me. These 300 tubes will be used as sample products during our negotiation. The quality must be good and it'll be best it was recently produced."</br>
</br>
"No problem. Do you want it now?" Zhan Shujie asked.</br>
</br>
"Before you get off work, there will be people picking it up tomorrow."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 396: Selling Nutrient Supply</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In Bentonville, Arkansas, the office of Walmart.</br>
</br>
Sitting behind the desk, Florance, the purchasing manager, looked at his assistant who had just walked in and asked in a deep voice.</br>
</br>
"Is the analysis result out?"</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded and put the document on the boss' table.</br>
</br>
"It's out; our research found several interesting plant protein in this thing called nutrient supply. Although we don't know the source of it, the safety of the food is absolutely fine."</br>
</br>
"With FDA standard?" Florence confirmed again.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The assistant nodded with certainty.</br>
</br>
After the scandal in 2015, Walmart became more cautious toward supplement suppliers.</br>
</br>
The Ginkgo biloba leaf pills sold by Walmart stated that it could increase memory, but after examination, it only contained carrot powder and wheat powder, while on the ingredients list, it didn't list wheat powder.</br>
</br>
The event caused a huge uproar at Walmart, and four other large department store chains were all put under the scrutiny of the media and public. Even one year after the event where the memory was gradually fading away from the public, Walmart's supplier selection in supplement and food were still two times more rigorous than before.</br>
</br>
Three days ago, he received a package from Future Biology. Inside the package contained the sample along with an invitation.</br>
</br>
To be frank, if it was not for Future Group's reputation, Florence might not even look at it before he passed on the product with labels like "liquid food" "weight loss without dieting".</br>
</br>
When Florence scanned through the results, the more he read, the more he eyes turned stern. Especially when he read the two sections, clinical response and effect estimation, his eyes were almost glued to the paper.</br>
</br>
"Bam!" He smashed the document on the table as he immediately ordered his assistant.</br>
</br>
"Send sales to Xin immediately; we have to get this deal… No, get Jim to go personally go," Florence said briskly.</br>
</br>
"But boss, Jim has a negotiation with a representative from Pirus Biology-"</br>
</br>
"Get his assistant to do it," Florence ordered, "Put this report in front of him, he will know how important it is to us. I don't care how he does it; I want to see an agreement on my table in three days."</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded and left.</br>
</br>
Sinking into his chair, Florence took a deep breath before an ecstatic expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
The obese people of America, oh no, the brand of Walmart supplements can be saved!</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The same reaction appeared in different places as the major retailers began to investigate Future biology. No one knew why would Future International suddenly enter the supplement and food market, but who cares? When they discovered the magical nature of the nutrient supply, almost all the retailers extended their olive branch to the newly formed company.</br>
</br>
</br>
"We sent out 15 invitations, 13 retailers responded to us extending their willingness to cooperate with us on this product." In the conference room, a man was reporting to the sole shareholder Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Tao Ming, New Zealand Han, male, 31, previous Prius Supplement manager. He possesses a wealth of product development and marketing experience, currently the director of Future Biology. A talent Jiang Chen obtained through an international headhunter company with a high salary of twenty thousand USD per month.</br>
</br>
If there were not enough talent, he would get it with money, since Jiang Chen, with a research and development cost of almost zero, didn't need to consider breaking even at all.</br>
</br>
"Also, the online stores we are preparing to launch on, Amazon, Taobao and other e-commerce platforms, are in their last phase. The shipment will be sent from Ange Island to Darwin port in Australia as that will be the platform for international distribution.</br>
</br>
Although it was somewhat specific, he used terms that Jiang Chen could easily understand. Tao Ming was smart enough to know that Jiang Chen wouldn't understand industry jargon.</br>
</br>
"Perfect, how much of the product do we need per month?" Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"The retailers would need one hundred thousand boxes per month. The variation on the backup platform differs, based on the marketing budget, it could range from ten thousand to one million boxes."</br>
</br>
A box had a profit of 500 USD, a million box would be 500 million, the profit was shocking.</br>
</br>
Seeing Tao Ming had stopped talking and was looking at him with words in his mouth, Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Just tell me what you want to say."</br>
</br>
"If we could use Future 1.0 as an advertising platform for nutrient supply, it would help to push the brand." Tao Ming proposed.</br>
</br>
"No problem, I will make the arrangement. Also, do we not need to sponsor a celebrity or something?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Tao Ming nodded,</br>
</br>
"That would be best. Based on the discussion results from the marketing department, I recommend sponsoring Emma Watson or other Hollywood celebrities to pave the way to establish the international brand-"</br>
</br>
"Wait, why does the name Emma Watson sound so familiar?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows as he tried to recall where he heard this name.</br>
</br>
With the puzzled expression on the boss' face, Tao Ming smiled lightheartedly.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of Harry Potter?"</br>
</br>
"The books?"</br>
</br>
"The movies, Emma played Hermione."</br>
</br>
"Oh! I remember now. But rather than her I think it is better to sponsor Harry, look how fat he became in the later movies." Jiang Chen glanced at him and said unscrupulously</br>
</br>
"Boss, it is better to drop the movie plot when we discuss the product." Tao Ming coughed and attempted to correct Jiang Chen in awkwardness.</br>
</br>
"Haha, sorry, off track. Mhmm… So you recommend which celebrity?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"The first choice is Emma Watson. Of course, there are a lot of other backup options."</br>
</br>
"What's the estimated sponsorship fee?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Approximately one million to one and a half million USD, it would differ based on the conditions and requirements set," Yao Ming answered.</br>
</br>
It was not too expensive. Robert was a film director in Los Angeles; he would be a good connection.</br>
</br>
"Okay, then I'll leave this to you," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Yao Ming nodded.</br>
</br>
"I have a meeting with a Walmart representative this afternoon; we'll be talking about supplying this product. If all goes smoothly, I'll be singing a contract with a monthly supply of fifty thousand boxes. Could we meet the demand for production?"</br>
</br>
"No problem. I'll take care of ramping up production; you take care of sales and marketing for me," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Worst case, he would only need to return to the apocalypse and obtain some inducers to expand the growth area of the DH seaweed and bring back more organic converters to produce "juice." If done successfully, the nutrient supply business would bring him 100 – 200 million USD in profits. Based on the stability and consistent demand of the market, the future of Future Biology would be no-less bright than Future Technology.</br>
</br>
The door was knocked on gently.</br>
</br>
Tao Ming looked over, it was his assistant.</br>
</br>
"The Walmart representative is here."</br>
</br>
"Already here? That's fast." Yao Ming was a bit caught off guard. "Get him to wait for a bit, I'm in a board meeting-"</br>
</br>
"No need, you can go." Jiang Chen stood up. "I know everything I needed to know. I need to pick up someone from the airport, that's all from me."</br>
</br>
"But I haven't shown you the marketing plan yet. It is a major decision to the company's development; it is better for the president to view it to make a decision," Tao Ming said hesitantly.</br>
</br>
"No need, I trust your ability." Jiang Chen walked beside Yao Ming, patted him on the shoulder, and encouraged him, "I trust you, I will give you enough freedom to prove your ability."</br>
</br>
Yao Ming looked sincerely at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
To be honest, the reason why he jumped ship to come here was only partly due to the high salary offered by Future Biology, but what attracted him more was Jiang Chen's promise of autonomy. When he was working at Prius, a lot of excellent proposals didn't pass because of the differing opinions among the board members or the lack of funding, and they would have the bear the consequence during the yearly performance review.</br>
</br>
The soldier was willing to die for someone that understood him, just with this trust, he swore that he would not disappoint Jiang Chen.</br>

</div></br>
Coro Island airport.</br>
</br>
A girl in a casual outfit and a pair of shades dragged her luggage and walked into the empty airport alone.</br>
</br>
The tourists that she passed by all stopped and turned to look at her, but because of the shades, they couldn't see her face clearly. But just by her graceful figure and the gorgeous outline, it was not hard to predict that the girl was trouble.</br>
</br>
Perhaps a celebrity that was alone on vacation.</br>
</br>
The tourists passed by her debated whether they should ask for an autograph, perhaps it may be the start of a beautiful encounter.</br>
</br>
But they would be disappointed.</br>
</br>
First, Xia Shiyu was not a celebrity.</br>
</br>
Second, the beauty already has her heart set on someone else.</br>
</br>
It was in the middle of June; the bright sun was like a ball of fire in the sky. Xia Shiyu who just came out of the airport immediately felt the heat unique to the tropical region.</br>
</br>
When she left the airport, she headed straight to the road outside and stood under the palm tree.</br>
</br>
To the taxi drivers' beeping of the horn, she shook her head, signaling that she was waiting for someone before she checked the time on her phone.</br>
</br>
&lt;10:00&gt;</br>
</br>
The flight arrived thirty minutes ahead of schedule, there was still thirty minutes before the agreed on pickup time.</br>
</br>
Her thumb hovered on the phone icon for two seconds but moved to the camera.</br>
</br>
She selected the front camera.</br>
</br>
She stared at her serene face on the screen silently for a while.</br>
</br>
[… Is my bang a bit off center?]</br>
</br>
She tried to adjustment the freshly permed bangs she got a few days ago in an attempt to make it look more normal.</br>
</br>
On the plane, she put on a layer of light makeup. As to why she didn't even know herself. Perhaps she wanted to capture the glimpse of being stunned in someone's eyes, or perhaps she wanted to outshine her competitor…</br>
</br>
The two shared a similar starting point.</br>
</br>
Just as she was looking at herself on the screen, she heard someone speak broken Han.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful lady, is it your first time in Pannu Islands?"</br>
</br>
[Is he talking to me?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a moment to process this. She turned around and looked at the tall European with a hooked nose and deep eye sockets.</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, she used her throat to make a sound.</br>
</br>
'Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Based on her experience, the people attempting to pick her up would awkwardly walk away when they hear the cold response.</br>
</br>
But she clearly thought too much, being reserved is a unique elegance only to Asians. To Xia Shiyu's cold response, the hooked nose was even more interested as he walked closer and attempted to get to know her.</br>
</br>
"What a coincidence, me too! I felt a bit anxious when I was on the plane. If the place is as chaotic as the news said it to be, I would have made the trip for nothing. But just as I got off the plane, I realized my mistake."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"Because I met you." The hooked nose used an expression he thought was touching and gazed into her eyes.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was just a bit shocked.</br>
</br>
[Does this count as a confession? It's the first time we met…]</br>
</br>
Seeing that the beauty did not react, the hooked nose only smiled and didn't give up. He took out a business card from his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Gavin Adams, a professional traveler from the United States and the editor of Traveler magazine. This is my business card; you can call me Gavin. Do I have the opportunity of inviting you to a tour of the beautiful kingdom of the southern islands?"</br>
</br>
To the person that revolved around her like a fly, especially the undisguised look of desire, it annoyed her instinctively.</br>
</br>
Just as she was troubled by how she could get rid of him, a familiar voice rang beside her ear.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Adams, I think it is better to refer to you by your last name." He snatched the business card in his hand and ignored his frozen expression. Jiang Chen took out his business card and handed it to him with a smile. "Oh, I almost forgot, this is my business card."</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, she felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, he always seemed there to solve her problem… When she thought about it, Xia Shiyu felt safe and secure.</br>
</br>
But this international friend was not friendly.</br>
</br>
Gavin examined Jiang Chen from head to toe as a hint of anger appeared on his face, he didn't accept Jiang Chen's business card.</br>
</br>
"I didn't say I'm going to exchange business card with you, sir. Or should I say, are the people from your country always this rude in front of a lady?" As he spoke, Gavin raised his hooked nose and looked at Jiang Chen with disgust.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised. He wasn't angry as he put his card away.</br>
</br>
"Rude? Our courtesy is not to cause trouble for other people. I don't know what your definition of courtesy is. Causing trouble for other people?"</br>
</br>
Gavin's face bloated into redness as he could not argue against Jiang Chen's words.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he didn't make a sound, Jiang Chen dubiously smiled and ignored him.</br>
</br>
He turned around to face Xia Shiyu as he said apologetically.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I'm a bit late."</br>
</br>
"No, I was early," Xia Shiyu said feeling slightly weird.</br>
</br>
[Is he… jealous?]</br>
</br>
As her mind debated this question, Xia Shiyu felt her heart beat a little faster.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't notice Xia Shiyu's mental battle as he said.</br>
</br>
"Let's get in the car first."</br>
</br>
Then, he took the luggage from her hand.</br>
</br>
"Wait." Seeing Xia Shiyu was about to leave, Gavin couldn't stand around any longer, and he wanted to stop the two, but he hit a brick wall.</br>
</br>
A man in a police uniform stood firmly in front of him and watched him apathetically.</br>
</br>
"What are you doing, you are blocking the way?" Gavin said in frustration.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the goddess he encountered get into the car of someone else, he felt enraged and let it out all on the man blocking his way.</br>
</br>
"Sir, I suspect there is a problem with your passport."</br>
</br>
"My passport? That's impossible." Gavin took out his passport, shoved it in his chest, "Open your eyes and see!"</br>
</br>
The police scanned the passport and nodded, "That's right, there is indeed a problem with your passport. Your ID is registered on the blacklist; please contact your country's embassy to obtain proof of no criminal conviction before you enter the border."</br>
</br>
"The Blacklist? That's impossible!" Gavin roared in rage. His footsteps spanned across 34 nations; it was the first time he was stopped because he was on the blacklist. He swore that he never did anything illegal.</br>
</br>
But the police ignored his roar and only shrugged.</br>
</br>
"I'm only following the procedure."</br>
</br>
Seeing there was no need to argue, Gavin calmed down slightly.</br>
</br>
"… Okay, I will contact my embassy, where is the embassy in Coro city?"</br>
</br>
"Sorry, sir. There is no embassy of your country at Pannu Islands, to obtain help from your embassy, please head to the Australia embassy for support." The police didn't lie to him. Only recently did more tourists travel to Xin, so only Hua, France, UK, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand have been established. Among them, four of the country's employees were still on their way there.</br>
</br>
"What the f*ck?! You are saying I took a two hour flight here, and now I have to go back to Australia?!" Gavin completely erupted in rage.</br>
</br>
"That's right, sir, we can assist you with the booking process. For now, please step back into the terminal," the policeman tried his hardest not to laugh as he said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
Blame it on the fact that you offended someone you shouldn't have. He has been a policeman through two political regimes, it was the first time he heard Xin had a blacklist.</br>
</br>
But since that person said there was one, then there must be one.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
What happened at the airport was only a small interruption.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen got into the driver seat, he immediately forgot about the unlucky guy. He put the key in and started the engine.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rolled down the window and turned on the air conditioning, allowing the cold breeze to blow away the heat in the car.</br>
</br>
"Thanks." Xia Shiyu put on her seatbelt.</br>
</br>
"No problem, it was on my way anyway."</br>
</br>
"No… I'm talking about what happened at the airport."</br>
</br>
When she thought about Jiang Chen's expression when he stood in front of her, her heart somehow pumped a little faster.</br>
</br>
"Oh, that - no worries. Remember to call me whenever you have any problems," Jiang Chen said nonchalantly as he maneuvered the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
Xin's security wasn't the best, and since she was in a place she wasn't familiar with, he was worried about Xia Shiyu's safety.</br>
</br>
[Maybe I should hire a bodyguard for her?] Jiang Chen deliberated in his mind.</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen's words, her normally expressionless face turned red. Combined with the small droplets of sweat on her pale face and the pink foundation she used, she looked like a peach covered in the morning dew.</br>
</br>
Because her mind went completely blank, Xia Shiyu didn't respond.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere in the car went from silent to intimate. Jiang Chen didn't realize this until he peeked at Xia Shiyu because she was so quiet and he finally saw the conflicted emotions and redness on her face.</br>
</br>
Because the windows were rolled up, the fresh scent of jasmine drifted into his nose. Because of the atmosphere, Jiang Chen's heart also started racing.</br>
</br>
"Did you perm your hair?' Jiang Chen chose a random topic to break the silence.</br>
</br>
But this unintentional question hit the mark. With women, you could have a differing opinion about changes in their looks, but you couldn't simply ignore the change in her hairstyle or clothing, even if it was just a new hair clip or keychain. In the event that you didn't comment on the change, women could keep a debate going for an entire night, just to get your attention.</br>
</br>
By coincidence, Jiang Chen made just the right move in winning her heart. He didn't know it himself because he was in the middle of a turn and was focused on the road ahead.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's body visibly shook as she said reservedly:</br>
</br>
"Does it look good?"</br>
</br>
She immediately regretted the question.</br>
</br>
[Did that sound too superficial? Should I have waited for him to compliment me himself for it to be more natural…?] Xia Shiyu turned her head and looked out the window as she was bombarded by her own thoughts.</br>
</br>
Facepalmed men would not overthink.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen praised her: "Looks really good, really fresh, but why did you suddenly think of perming your hair?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had always given him the impression of being authentic, serene, yet distant. But the perm gave her a "fresh" vibe that was normally found in students.</br>
</br>
</br>
"My coworker… Mhmm, a friend told me that I'm too formal with how I dress, so she suggested I change things up." [I was also probably too unfashionable] Xia Shiyu added in her mind.</br>
</br>
"I see, but I still think your hair from before looked better."</br>
</br>
"Then I'll change it back," Xia Shiyu immediately said.</br>
</br>
"Eh? No, I'm only stating my opinion; frequent perms are damaging to the hair." Jiang Chen face-palmed.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Xia Shiyu nodded as she looked at her reflection in the window and secretively examined her hair.</br>
</br>
"Oh, which friend was it?" Jiang Chen was surprised that Xia Shiyu had any friends.</br>
</br>
He always thought her social circle was limited to her coworkers.</br>
</br>
"Su Mengqi… The manager of the human resources department who moved with us from Wanghai to Xiangjiang," Xia Shiyu replied.</br>
</br>
They chatted for a while until they arrived at the mansion located at the north end of Coro Island.</br>
</br>
When he parked the car in the garage, Ayesha was already waiting for him.</br>
</br>
Because she knew a guest was coming, her outfit was relatively "traditional." A light T-shirt paired with short shorts - stunning and lively.</br>
</br>
After opening the door, Ayesha took Xia Shiyu's luggage. Because she hadn't seen her for a few months, Xia Shiyu had mixed feelings towards the foreign girl.</br>
</br>
Partially a feeling of competitiveness, but partially gratitude for a person who saved her life.</br>
</br>
In response to Ayesha's directness, she felt somewhat uncomfortable. Although she wanted to stay at Jiang Chen's place, when she was actually in front of the door, she changed her mind.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen led her to her room, she was secretively observing Ayesha's eyes.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, she didn't see any jealousy inside.</br>
</br>
This made her a bit frustrated. [Do I not look like competition? I even put on some makeup on the plane…]</br>
</br>
Two red swirls suddenly appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
She realized just how childish her thoughts were.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Where's the virtual reality helmet?" After putting down her luggage, Xia Shiyu asked right away in an attempt to use work to alleviate the awkwardness in her heart.</br>
</br>
"There's no rush, you can take a look after lunch. Why don't you take a shower to relax? The bathroom is at the end of the second-floor hallway." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu hesitated then nodded.</br>
</br>
Because there was no direct flight, she had been in transit since last night. She was indeed a little tired.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen's phone suddenly rang.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to take a call. If you need anything, just let Ayesha know."</br>
</br>
As he spoke, Jiang Chen took out his phone and walked to the sofa.</br>
</br>
When he picked up, Ivan's grave voice came through.</br>
</br>
"Boss, we found a spy in the company."</br>
</br>
"A spy?" Jiang Chen frowned. "Did you confirm their identity?"</br>
</br>
It was hard for a spy to exist at the management level due to the electronic collars - they wouldn't escape if they were found, so no one was foolish enough to betray him. But at lower levels, it was hard to say - aside from the first 100 refugees who joined Celestial Trade, the loyalty of the newly recruited soldiers was uncertain.</br>
</br>
"It's currently unclear, but a backdoor was installed on the computer at Coro division yesterday. It sent 7 megabytes of data to an IP in Iceland," Ivan said in a deep voice.</br>
</br>
Iceland was probably only a jumping board; no one knew exactly where the data went.</br>
</br>
"I see, don't alert anyone yet," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Understood."</br>
</br>
After he hung up, Jiang Chen fell into deep thought while holding his phone.</br>
</br>
Too many people were interested in Celestial. Country F was the most suspicious, but UA, who always intervened everywhere, was also on the list. Even their potential ally, Hua, could potentially send spies.</br>
</br>
Two arms tenderly hugged Jiang Chen from behind. Ayesha sensed that something was bothering him as she whispered.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"… There is a spy in Celestial," Jiang Chen said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
A hint of sharpness flashed in her eyes as she whispered in his ear.</br>
</br>
"Do you need my help?"</br>
</br>
"Do you know anything about computers?" Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head. Her sapphire eyes flashed brightly.</br>
</br>
[But I could kill.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood the message in her eyes as he sighed.</br>
</br>
"It's not a problem that can be solved by killing. The key is to find the people responsible."</br>
</br>
[But how?]</br>
</br>
[Ask Yao Yao? That's not feasible. Not that Yao Yao didn't have the skills, but she might be unfamiliar with the structure of the internet and programs in the 21st century. For example, people good at League of Legends might not be the best Nintendo player.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's security measures could destroy any of the hackers in this world. Just like New Era, Future 1.0's code still remained uncracked to this day since the code she wrote couldn't be understood by anyone in this world, making it impossible for anyone to install a backdoor in the program.</br>
</br>
Because Celestial Trade didn't possess any critical secrets, they used the Windows 7 operating system and programs in this world.</br>
</br>
Although nothing critical was lost, the feeling of being monitored didn't feel good at all!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen began to think hard with a frown on his face.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
[Yes! I have a little hacker I forgot about.]</br>
</br>
He slapped his forehead as immediately remembered the guy with a "younger sister complex" as he dialed the number.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 399: The Shocked Xia Shiyu</br>
</div></br>
His finger pressed the screen a few times, selected an international number, and put his phone back to his ear.</br>
</br>
The call went through shortly.</br>
</br>
"Where are you now?"</br>
</br>
"Frankberg," Xie Lei used a voice that implied: Where else could I be?</br>
</br>
"Orthopedics?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
Xie Lei paused as he didn't know how to respond.</br>
</br>
He clearly didn't know the joke behind the "orthopedics in Frankberg." (Note 1)</br>
</br>
"No, I am at Munich hospital to take care of my sister. She just received treatment three days ago."</br>
</br>
Regarding the brother and sister, Jiang Chen kept an eye on them since he paid for all their expenses. The blind sister was receiving treatment in Munich while the brother, Xie Lei, didn't just sit around. After three months of military training in Niger, Ivan sent him to Frankberg. While he studied computer science at the University of Ber, he took care of his sister.</br>
</br>
"Is your sister getting better?"</br>
</br>
"Much better. The doctor said her condition is a miracle and she'll regain her vision in two months… Thank you," Xie Lie spoke with sincerity.</br>
</br>
"No problem, it's great for the soul to do some good deeds once in a while. Especially if I gained the loyalty of a hacker," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"That's right, my life belongs to you now," Xie Lei said calmly.</br>
</br>
"That's enough joking around, you get to keep your life. Although I need you to help me with something."</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Xie Lei asked.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, this is what happened. A backdoor program was installed on Celestial's server. Although I could easily take it out, I want to know which rat installed it. The only reliable information we have is that the data was leaked to an IP in Iceland, but even I know that Iceland is only a jumping board to someplace else. I need you to determine where the data was actually sent and it would be best if you could find out who the spy is. Could you do that?" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"No problem." Frivolous confidence, the trademark of a teen, appeared on Xie Lei's face.</br>
</br>
He was the third-best expert in the Hua Hacker Alliance. After a long period of extensive studies, he was confident that his abilities were even better than before.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you can be cocky after you complete the task. Do you need an airplane ticket?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No, I can work anywhere as long as there's internet. Give me access to the server and don't alert the spy yet." Xie Lei shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Okay, then I'll leave it to you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up.</br>
</br>
A dubious smile appeared on his face as Jiang Chen texted Ivan to grant server access to Xie Lei.</br>
</br>
And now, the cat-catching-mouse game had begun.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Ayesha made lunch. With Jiang Chen's mom's careful guidance, her cooking skills became drastically more refined. Xia Shiyu, who hadn't eaten her dishes for a few months, enjoyed a feast.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen looked at her, shuddering, Xia Shiyu took a moment to realize how she was feasting on the food. Her face turned red as her actions became more reserved.</br>
</br>
Ayesha stared at the two of them and smiled but didn't say anything. Her sapphire pupils cast an intrigued light.</br>
</br>
After lunch, Ayesha took the plates to the kitchen. At Xia Shiyu's request, Jiang Chen took her to the gym on the first floor.</br>
</br>
A server rested in the corner of the gym. Aside from the server were two motorcycle helmet-sized virtual reality helmets in the room. When she saw them, Xia Shiyu briskly walked up and placed a helmet on her head.</br>
</br>
Her hands explored the helmet for a while but she couldn't figure out how to use it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't help but smile at the scene and walked over to her.</br>
</br>
"How do you open this thing?" Xia Shiyu asked rather helplessly as she held the helmet with both hands.</br>
</br>
"Don't rush to open it yet; I think it's better for you to find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was hesitant after she heard Jiang Chen's words. "Does… virtual reality affect the physical body?"</br>
</br>
"I wouldn't say 'affect' - your real body will be in deep REM mode. If you stand up while you're using it, you might fall down."</br>
</br>
[I see.]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded with understanding and noticed a recliner by the side.</br>
</br>
When she lied down, Jiang Chen gave her further instructions.</br>
</br>
"The helmet is activated by voice, just say 'start'."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a deep breath as she repressed the excitement in her heart.</br>
</br>
Ready to witness history, she used a clear voice.</br>
</br>
"Start."</br>
</br>
The dark screen instantly lit up.</br>
</br>
Countless 3D light particles rushed to her eyes. Xia Shiyu was tempted to move back, but she quickly realized it was just a picture on the screen.</br>
</br>
"I thought it was the type that didn't require a screen…" When she saw the interface, Xia Shiyu was evidently disappointed.</br>
</br>
But she was relieved almost immediately. The almost-otherworldly neural connection virtual technology couldn't have been mastered so easily; to be able to achieve even this much wasn't bad…</br>
</br>
"This is only the starting screen, the exciting part is yet to come." Jiang Chen's words made her look forward to what was next.</br>
</br>
She was highly skeptical but decided to trust him. Xia Shiyu wanted to speak, but on the screen in front of her, a series of popup boxes appeared along with a clear system message in her ears.</br>
</br>
"Pupil verification system initiated…"</br>
</br>
"Registered as a user."</br>
</br>
"Registering…"</br>
</br>
"Genetic code is registered, please set the username."</br>
</br>
Staring at the text in the middle, Xia Shiyu inhaled deeply.</br>
</br>
"Shiyu."</br>
</br>
"User registration complete. Welcome, Ms. Shiyu. Your ID will be locked to your pupil information - it cannot be deactivated or registered again in principle. Your privacy will be absolutely safe in the virtual world. I wish you the best virtual experience."</br>
</br>
&lt;Caution: Please ensure the body is in a flat position when connected to virtual reality. Please do not use when drinking, drunk, or in public… conditions.&gt;</br>
</br>
She looked at the "Activate" logo in front of her as she tried to calm her pumping heart. Xia Shiyu said:</br>
</br>
"Activate."</br>
</br>
After receiving her command, the image on the screen began to fade gradually. It was followed by mild music and suddenly, Xia Shiyu felt a tingling sensation in her neck as her consciousness began to leave her body.</br>
</br>
It felt like diving - her sensations were covered by a thin veil, but her sensations still felt so clear.</br>
</br>
"This is…"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu stared at her hands blankly and scanned her surroundings.</br>
</br>
Because of her astonishment, she forgot how to speak.</br>
</br>
Yes, she didn't know how to express her astonishment.</br>
</br>
The white cubic world she was in was empty, but she felt so fulfilled. 0s and 1s flashed on the wall and added a sci-fi dimension to this world.</br>
</br>
She stood in the middle of the cube and stared at the interface that gradually surfaced in front of her.</br>
</br>
She reached a finger out and touched the half-transparent interface.</br>
</br>
She felt a cold sensation.</br>
</br>
Ripples spread out from her fingertips and rushed to the walls of the room.</br>
</br>
The wall shattered. Just like a window being opened, a vivid picture was presented in front of her.</br>
</br>
There were endless rice fields, towering mountains that extended beyond the clouds, great sails that broke through wind and waves, and magnificent walls that stood like a giant cliff…</br>
</br>
&lt;Godly Land&gt;</br>
</br>
And she was standing on top of a hill.</br>
</br>
Translator's Thoughts</br>
</br>

I accidentally copied this chapter into the next one. Here you go</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 400: Tonight, I will let you have him</br>
</div></br>
After a while, Xia Shiyu took off her helmet and stood up from the chair.</br>
</br>
She reflected on the feeling of being in virtual reality before she let out a sigh, still immersed in that world.</br>
</br>
"If it wasn't for the game menu that could pop up at any time, I would've thought I traveled to another dimension."</br>
</br>
"It's normal to experience this feeling the first time you play with virtual reality - it won't happen after you get used to it." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
There was a process to get accustomed to new things. Jiang Chen remembered that the first time he laid in the virtual reality training chamber, he felt anxious too. But since he used it so many times since then, it didn't feel special anymore.</br>
</br>
With the helmet in her lap, Xia Shiyu gently stroked the fluid surface of the helmet and murmured:</br>
</br>
"Although traditional VR equipment can achieve immersive virtual reality, it's physically limited. For example, the helmet can mimic visuals and audio with a sensory device attached to the hands… But it's the first time I've seen your type that allows the body to enter deep REM sleep and allows the consciousness to completely integrate with the virtual world. The visuals and audio no longer need to pass through the eyes and ears - all senses are transmitted through the brain, thus people are, in effect, playing the game while sleeping… This is too magical."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then guess how many players this &lt;Godly Land&gt; would have?" Jiang Chen said proudly.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu shook her head. "I can't estimate how many, but I know one thing for certain. As long as this helmet isn't too expensive, the number of registered users and concurrent users would have no problem breaking the Genesis World Record."</br>
</br>
"That's what I think too."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu then looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Do you think virtual reality could only be applied to games?"</br>
</br>
When he heard Xia Shiyu's words, Jiang Chen asked with curiosity.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean?"</br>
</br>
"PCs, smartphones, and tablets - these electronic devices ease social interaction between people. With just a messaging app, two people thousands of miles away can feel like they're standing side by side." Xia Shiyu put the helmet aside and looked at Jiang Chen. She said with seriousness, "But with this virtual helmet, it can allow two people thousands of miles away to forget the distance and "truly" stand side by side. Ignoring the game itself, the helmet alone is an era-defining product."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to think it over as no one had mentioned this to him before since in terms of virtual reality technology, people in the apocalypse were much more indifferent.</br>
</br>
"So you're saying this could replace smartphones?" Jiang Chen laughed. "I don't think that's possible since phones can easily be used anywhere, but this can only be used at home. Also, if I remember correctly, VR equipment already existed two years ago."</br>
</br>
</br>
Virtual reality wasn't something new to the modern world. It had a relatively low usage rate domestically, but outside the wall, this thing wasn't as high-tech as people imagined it to be.</br>
</br>
A simple example: the virtual reality game &lt;EVA: Valkyrie&gt; under the CCP banner had a selling point known as "Space VR," but this game started its internal test on January 18th, 2016. Any players who purchased the Oculus Rift DK2 would be able to participate just by registering.</br>
</br>
Virtual reality games weren't as complex as imagined ten years ago. A lot of PC and console games were all attempting to integrate with VR.</br>
</br>
And the news "2016 will be the landmark year for virtual reality" wasn't wrong at all.</br>
</br>
"It's different." Xia Shiyu shook her head. "The difference is analogous to how flip phones didn't change the landscape of PC, but smartphones did."</br>
</br>
She paused, looked into Jiang Chen's eyes, and said with seriousness:</br>
</br>
"And the virtual reality helmet you introduced is like the "smartphone" of VR. It's impractical as a replacement for smartphones, but it could certainly pose a significant threat to the virtual reality market."</br>
</br>
While he was mentally prepared to be the person who wrote the next chapter in history, when Xia Shiyu spoke those words herself, Jiang Chen couldn't contain his excitement.</br>
</br>
"This virtual reality helmet is just like a key that takes the sleep time of humans to another dimension. Keeping lifespans constant, people will 'live' for eight hours longer each day. Aside from games, we can also use virtual reality equipment to create communities, e-commerce platforms, virtual real estate, and even things we never imagined before…"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a deep breath as her eyes flickered with excitement.</br>
</br>
"Now do you know why I'm this excited?"</br>
</br>
When he heard Xia Shiyu's description, Jiang Chen was shocked himself. When he was first introduced to the helmet, he only thought of playing games and didn't think that far ahead at all. But now that Xia Shiyu mentioned its potential other uses, he suddenly felt enlightened.</br>

Yes, it had other uses aside from gaming. Social interaction and even other necessities could be based on the virtual reality helmet platform - anything was possible! Virtual reality was just like an undeveloped goldmine that only Future Technology could reach.</br>
</br>
"We'll create history," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"That's right!" Xia Shiyu held Jiang Chen's hands in excitement.</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Time paused for five seconds.</br>
</br>
She slowly let go of his hands, put her hand to her mouth and coughed while she averted her gaze.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I got too excited…"</br>
</br>
She pretended to be calm, but the blush on her face clearly showed the anxiety she was feeling.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was completely shocked as he stared at her blankly.</br>
</br>
[Is this really Xia Shiyu?]</br>
</br>
[How should I react?]</br>
</br>
Just as they stood in awkward silence, a gentle knock came from the door.</br>
</br>
"You have a visitor." Ayesha looked at the two of them with a smile as she leaned on the door frame.</br>
</br>
[Perfect save!] Jiang Chen thanked Ayesha in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Let me see who's at the door. You can play with the helmet for a bit." Jiang Chen smiled at Xia Shiyu before he slipped out of the gym.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu watched Jiang Chen leave before her eyes stopped at Ayesha at the door.</br>
</br>
She hadn't spoken to her since she came in.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu squeezed out a forced smile as she said, "Hi…"</br>
</br>
She didn't want her expression to reveal her true feelings to this girl.</br>
</br>
Or her sense of competition.</br>
</br>
Ayesha responded with a friendly smile as she said gently, "I organized your room for you. If you need anything, just let me know."</br>
</br>
Looking at Ayesha's smile free of any hostility, Xia Shiyu felt a hint of embarrassment at her own hostility.</br>
</br>
"You… you don't dislike me?"</br>
</br>
When she heard Xia Shiyu's words, Ayesha tilted her head. "Why would I dislike you?"</br>
</br>
"Because… Because of jealousy." Xia Shiyu looked away.</br>
</br>
She couldn't look straight into Ayesha's sapphire pupils.</br>
</br>
But Ayesha only shook her head.</br>
</br>
"You're not afraid I'll take him away from you?" Xia Shiyu finally couldn't hold it in anymore.</br>
</br>
"You finally admitted to your own emotions?" Ayesha asked back.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu stopped. A red hue climbed from her neck to her ears.</br>
</br>
But this time, she didn't back down; she didn't want to demonstrate her softness in the relationship in front of her "competition."</br>
</br>
Seeing she didn't disagree, a smile appeared on Aysha's face.</br>
</br>
She walked beside her, tiptoed and whispered into her ear.</br>
</br>
"Tonight, I'll let you have him."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a moment to process this.</br>
</br>
When she realized what Ayesha meant, her brain completely shut down…</br>

Note 1: Orthopedics in Frankberg refers to a rumored event of a translator for a Japanese anime. Because of the nature of the anime that influenced him, he ended up in an in*est with his sister.

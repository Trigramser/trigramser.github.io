<div class="caption">Chapter 1351: Officer Kwaiâ€œs Confusion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Frank committed suicide in an apartment that belonged under a pseudonym, located in the suburbs of Yoto.</br>
</br>
It was the neighbor across from him who called the police, and the cause was a large amount of water seeping through the door.</br>
</br>
After the police received the call, they immediately dispatched a team to protect the scene.</br>
</br>
After they pick-locked the door, the police that rushed inside even smelled the stench wafting from the bathroom.</br>
</br>
When the police opened the door curtain of the bathroom, and they found a foreign male corpse with his wrist cut open in the bathtub. Based on the blade on the ground and his peaceful expression, the cause of death appeared to be suicide. Immediately afterwards, the forensic doctor conducted a blood test and confirmed that the deceased had not taken sleeping pills or other psychoactive drugs before his death. The whole case could be confirmed as a suicide.</br>
</br>
After a comparison of the identities, the police identified the deceased, to be Frank, a diplomat in the UA Embassy. As for why he died here, no one could explain this reason.</br>
</br>
However, the UA Embassys response to the death was rather mild. It accepted the investigation results of the police without any objection and took over the remains of the deceased.</br>
</br>
On Saturday morning of the same week, all the staff of the embassy attended the funeral of this colleague. It didnt take long before his coffin was covered with a national flag and was airlifted back to the UA to meet his relatives.</br>
</br>
Shortly after, the Capitol held a press conference in response to the incident in Yokosuka.</br>
</br>
When we learned about this appalling news, we immediately asked the chief command of the Yokosuka Military Base to find out more about the situation.</br>
</br>
The Department of Defense has issued relevant documents requiring the UA troops stationed in Nippon to cooperate with the CIBs operations, but the documents specifically emphasize that the cooperation was limited to counter-terrorism.</br>
</br>
Here, on behalf of the Capitol, I reiterate once again that this incident was the personal act of the Director of the CIB, and some intelligence personnel stationed in Nippon who may have been involved in this case are under investigation. At present, the President has suspended Director Henry from his duties and independent prosecutors have begun an investigation on the dereliction of duty. I believe that a reasonable and satisfactory answer will be given to the public soon</br>
</br>
The CIB Director took the blame and stepped down. The demonstrations stopped in California, but the protests at the entrance of the Yokosuka military base continued.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the Yokosuka Police was placed in the most difficult situation. It was stuck in between the people, the UA soldiers, and the government. They were also being verbally abused, which was something they shouldnt bear. The Yoto Police urgently reinforced 2,000 police forces to Yokosuka, but it did little to calm the chaotic situation.</br>
</br>
</br>
Not only Yokosuka, but almost all of Nippons civil rights organizations raised to support the protests in Yokosuka. At the same time, protests erupted across the country with slogans such as Get out! appearing at the gates of 88 military bases without exception.</br>
</br>
There were not only the works of the Sumitomo Foundation but also the works of the Mitsubishi, Fuji, and other consortia.</br>
</br>
It was evident who the winner of this confrontation was. Although the UA made a series of remedial measures, it was impossible to recover the mistakes made by its military in Nippon on the collection of T-virus data.</br>
</br>
The strong intervention of Celestial Trade was inevitable. The Nippon government was destined to cancel the security treaty. Now there was the risk in picking a side, and it could also serve as a favor to Jiang Chen. As to whether Jiang Chen would really view this as a favor, only he would know.</br>
</br>
Yoto, in the hotel Jiang Chen stayed at.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was sitting comfortably on the sofa in the living room as he chatted with Foreign Minister Kishida.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, I think you went overboard this time His tone carried a hint of helplessness as Kishida smiled bitterly, Its only a few days before the opening ceremony, you couldnt wait for the Olympics to end?</br>
</br>
There was only one chance, Jiang Chen smiled emotionlessly as put his one leg on his other knee, and said in a joking tone, If the UA is willing to wait until the Olympics is over before sending the servers out of the country, I would have had no issues.</br>
</br>
Kishida sighed helplessly after Jiang Chens explanation. He couldnt say more on this topic and ended the topic abruptly. He changed into a slightly flattering tone and said respectfully.</br>
</br>
Congress is discussing an early termination of the security treaty. Mr. Prime Minister asked me to tell you the news. We will apply to join the Earth Defense Alliance at the end of this month. Congress has already agreed. I hope Jiang Chen will take care of the rest.</br>
</br>
My words will always count, Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Thank you very much, then I wont disturb you By the way, are there some strange noises on your side?</br>
</br>
Are there any? Jiang Chen shrugged and said with a smile, It must be your illusion.</br>
</br>
After he hung up the phone, Jiang Chen put his leg down and looked at Kwai lying on the carpet as an evil smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
It seems that you still havent remembered what I said. Didnt I say that you are not allowed to make noise when I call?</br>
</br>
Kwai was whimpering. At this moment, she was crawling in front of Jiang Chen like a puppy as she rubbed her thighs impatiently, pleading and confusion filled her eyes.</br>
</br>
You want to go to the bathroom? Jiang Chen said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Woooooo</br>
</br>
Without a domineering attitude, Kwai nodded desperately.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia. Jiang Chen looked to the side and said with a smirk, Bring that thing here.</br>
</br>
Yes, my master. Qia Xias mouth curled up, and she disappeared into the living room. When she appeared again, she held a palm-sized iron bowl in her hand and placed it gently behind Kwai.</br>
</br>
Help her open the lock.</br>
</br>
Yes. Qian Xia nodded respectfully.</br>
</br>
Woooooo</br>
</br>
When Kwai saw the iron bowl under her, she shook her head pleadingly.</br>
</br>
Although she couldnt hold it in any longer, it was too much to do it in front of a man.</br>
</br>
Do you not want to go to the toilet? Jiang Chen grinned, Then I will let Qian Xia lock it up for you again?</br>
</br>
Woohoo!</br>
</br>
She could no longer restrain the soreness in her lower abdomen as her instinct once again defeated the shame in Kwais mind. While Jiang Chen and Qian Xia watched, her pitiful self-esteem and overflowing flood burst out together</br>
</br>
Splashhhh</br>
</br>
It continued for a while before the flow finally stopped, and Kwai collapsed to the ground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen enjoyed the expression on her face and his wicked smirk grew more apparent.</br>
</br>
He suddenly discovered that his sadist side was growing stronger</br>
</br>
Actually, you were having a good time, werent you? When he got up from the sofa, Jiang Chen kneeled down and suddenly blew into Kwais mouth, Am I right? Officer Kwai.</br>
</br>
Mixed with his warmth, the moment those words blew into her ear, Kwais legs felt soft. A stream of heat rushed from her lower abdomen to her brain, spreading along every inch of neurons in the cerebral cortex.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the resistance in those bright eyes had disappeared, and what was left was confusion</br>
</br>
She didnt understand.</br>
</br>
Why is it that I am so humiliated by him, but I cant hate him at all.</br>
</br>
She really didnt understand</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1352: Blood Axe Mercenaries</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was already the afternoon when Jiang Chen freed the exhausted Officer Kwai.</br>
</br>
During this time, Kelvin and Ayesha both made a call. Kelvins call was to inform him that the 300 scientific researchers had successfully landed in the Mars Colony. They were preparing to enter Mine 071 under the order of Hong Zewei.</br>
</br>
The call from Ayesha was related to the situation in Colombia.</br>
</br>
Based on what Timochenko said, the FARC guerrillas and the Moro soldiers had successfully entered the Colombian Capital of Bogota. The defeated government force withdrew from the Cundinamarca province and retreated towards the Medellin region.</br>
</br>
With the increasingly powerful FARC armed force, the Gulf Coast would be the last home of the government force and where the remaining NATO Coalition Force was stationed. The deterrence from the Ford Aircraft Carrier Battle Group could possibly allow them to struggle until the end of the year.</br>
</br>
But Timochenko was quite optimistic.</br>
</br>
After FARC took control of the military factory in Cundinamarca, it was capable of producing its own light weapons and ammunition. With the T72 tanks imported from Russia, FARC even armed an armored brigade.</br>
</br>
But this armored brigade served more as a deterrence rather than having any actual combat value. After all, the T-72s could perhaps scare the equally poorly equipped government force, but the T-72s were laughable in front of NATOs M1A2s. In addition, Colombias mountainous and forested nature made the value of armored forces quite limited.</br>
</br>
But in any case, FARC gained the absolute upper hand.</br>
</br>
After Timochenko occupied Bogota, he immediately announced that he would become the new president of Colombia. While he established a new constitution, he also appointed dozens of his close aides and established a new Colombian leadership team.</br>
</br>
Immediately afterward, Timochenko, with victory in his grasp, even sent his own Minister of Energy to Xin to start negotiations with Celestial Trade on the Global Power Grid project. As previously stated, Celestial Trade would register a jointly controlled power company in Colombia with Timoshenkos government, and carry out a grid construction plan under this power company.</br>
</br>
After the Trans-Pacific cable landed in Ecuador, it finally took a difficult step forward. The grid extended its tentacles from the coast of South America to Colombia. It wont be long before countries such as Venezuela and Brazil would join the Global Power Grid.</br>
</br>
In the future, the remaining South American countries that firmly stood in the UA camp would also have to bow in front of the promise for higher GDP and lower energy costs in the South American electrification. They would ultimately have to become members of the Earth Defense Alliance</br>
</br>
The Apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The gate of an abandoned supermarket on the West Coast of North America, California.</br>
</br>
The parking lot was full of the scrapped cars, and the surface of the building was full of bullet holes. The name of Wal-Mart could be vaguely seen on the rooftop sign, but many letters were missing.</br>
</br>
</br>
As the largest supermarket in the United States, Wal-Marts shelves were sufficient to meet the needs of the entire United States. However, only a layer of thick dust was visible on the shelves, which couldnt even feed a hungry mutated rat.</br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
Dark red blood splashed on the wall, and the thin-looking man hoisted the rifle behind him. He rushed forward and pulled the giant rat about the size of his thigh from under the shelf as he cheerfully shouted.</br>
</br>
Look at what I caught? A poor mouse.</br>
</br>
But he didnt feel happy for long as a gun was quickly pointed at his head.</br>
</br>
Give it to me, with a pistol, the black man said in a threatening tone.</br>
</br>
I found it first Although the gun was pointed at his head, the man was not at all afraid. Instead, he showed the grenade he had hidden in his hand and with an almost lunatic grin, he laughed, Do you want to try?</br>
</br>
A mutated rat. Although it was somewhat lean, it could easily be converted into ten nutrient supplies in the organic boiler. The situation in North America was different from that in the Pan-Asia region. There were no dull zombies here, instead, there were powerful and cunning creatures.</br>
</br>
It was not so easy to get a nutrient supply, and it was certainly not news to fight over a dead rat, even if the two people fighting belonged in the same force. Just when the two were in a stalemate over a rat, in the parking lot outside the supermarket, the Blood Axe Mercenaries welcomed a distinguished guest.</br>
</br>
Two trucks parked in the middle of the parking lot. A dozen or so soldiers in kinetic skeletons jumped off the truck. A group of ragged mercenaries greeted them with envy and vigilance as they examined the soldiers shiny equipment as well as the cardboard boxes on the truck.</br>
</br>
Ten boxes of canned luncheon meat, ten bags of rice, and ten boxes of instant noodles</br>
</br>
Blood Axes thick thumb slightly trembled when he read the list of supplies in front of Zhou Guoping.</br>
</br>
That nostalgic taste that he almost forgot about</br>
</br>
He used a dagger to cut open an aluminum can, and Blood Axe licked the tip of the knife dipped in oil, and his eyes widened. In the envious eyes of his brothers, he savored the taste on his tongue, swallowed down, and said in a hoarse voice.</br>
</br>
Its pork.</br>
</br>
The ragged mercenaries were rattled, and their eyes showed excitement and admiration. They gulped down desperately as they imagined the savory taste.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping despised in his mind as he looked at the eyes widened Blood Axe and the excited mercenaries.</br>
</br>
You guys are so excited about a few boxes of canned food and instant noodles.</br>
</br>
If you went to the Sixth Street, then you might turn lunatic.</br>
</br>
What do you want? Blood Axe put away his dagger, licked his chapped lips, then looked at Zhou Guoping as well as the soldiers in kinetic skeletons behind him, I dont believe you crossed the Pacific Ocean just to do charity.</br>
</br>
Do you know where we are from? Zhou Guoping glanced at him unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
No one doesnt know where you are from, Blood Axe pointed to the NAC logo on the truck next to him with a grin, NAC in the Pan-Asia China region, the hope of the people in the wasteland, the hometown of Chinatown, the rich yellow men who didnt collect bottle caps, let me think about what other titles you havethats all, I dont have a good memory.</br>
</br>
There were large and small survivors camps and settlements on the West Coast. Among them, the National Guard, the militia organization Minutemen, the cannibal tribe Blood, and the mutated human tribe Destroy were the prominent ones. Blood Axe and his Blood Axe Mercenaries were considered above average.</br>
</br>
The local animal husbandry was very good. The survivors mainly use crystals and mutant skins to trade and also use a cola bottle cap with a special code as currency. Bottle caps were the hard currency throughout North America, even in semi-enclosed fallout shelters and backward mutated human tribes.</br>
</br>
If there were any exceptions, only the NAC post on the West Coast didnt accept the bottle caps. These yellow-skinned people from the Pan-Asian China region were very interested in high-tech products, especially spacecrafts, and were keen to pay with expensive canned food and instant noodles.</br>
</br>
Many people made a lot of money by doing business with these people, which made everyone on the West Coast envious.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe was also one of them, but he couldnt find a way to get in touch with these yellow riches. He could watch trade caravans enter in and out as he waited for an opportunity to rob a weak caravan.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, none of the forces that did business with NAC was weak.</br>
</br>
Our outpost on the West Coast has been around for a while. Zhou Guoping looked at Blood Axe standing in front of him, then continued, While trading with you, we have also been investigating the investment environment here</br>
</br>
Investment environment? Blood Axe looked at Zhou Guoping with dumbfounded eyes and asked incomprehensibly.</br>
</br>
In short, our boss decided to send a governor to the outpost on the West Coast to establish a NAC colony here and sow the seeds of civilization on this ruin.</br>
</br>
And you are theGovernor?</br>
</br>
Exactly. Zhou Guoping nodded.</br>
</br>
Be straightforward, what do you need me to do. He couldnt understand the intricacies, so he was straightforward, Kill people? Or find someone?</br>
</br>
Neither, Zhou Guoping shook his head and cleared his throat. As I said earlier, we plan to expand the outpost here into a colony. We need a lot of labors or slaves to do this, as well as mercenaries who manage our construction sites.</br>
</br>
Looking at the dumbfounded Blood Axe, Zhou Guoping smiled.</br>
</br>
We will hire you at the right price, and these materials are our deposit. Are you interested?</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1353: Opening Ceremony</br>
</div></br>
The Olympic Games first originated in ancient Greece.</br>
</br>
At that time, people wished for peace when the city-states fought endlessly, so they reached an agreement to hold games in Olympia regularly every four years, and they agreed that the sacred day of truce be implemented in the year of the games.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the Olympic year was known as the year of peace.</br>
</br>
However, reality and ideals often conflicted. From the Georgian War during the 2008 Olympic Games to the 2020 Colombian Civil War, since the world entered the first year of the new century, the imaginary peace did not arrive. Instead, humanity had been on the brink of war.</br>
</br>
The 2020 Olympics was a failed Olympics.</br>
</br>
At least in the eyes of most foreign tourists.</br>
</br>
They saw disputes, chaos, and extremisms that ran counter to the Olympic spirit. In order to prevent protesters from throwing rotten eggs at athletes from the UA, the Yoto police had to deploy an additional 500 police officers to protect the safety of athletes in Yoto.</br>
</br>
Of course, although many incidents occurred, this Olympics was not without its highlight. The technological prowess demonstrated at the Yoto Olympics still made most foreign tourists feel like the trip was worth the money.</br>
</br>
This Olympics could be the Olympics with the highest usage rate of robots in history. From autonomous vehicles to robot volunteers, as well as the anime characters that came into life with the use of AR technology, everything manifested this point.</br>
</br>
Just like the giant Doraemon in the main stadium, technology itself was one of the selling points of this Olympics.</br>
</br>
However, keen tourists did discover that except for a small number of miniature robots were engraved with the Mitsubishi logo, most of the highly anthropomorphic and highly intelligent service robots were printed with the logo of Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
There were also autonomous vehicles equipped with magnetic levitation devices and autonomous drones</br>
</br>
Unconsciously, Future Group seemed to have contracted the high-tech part of the Olympic Games.</br>
</br>
Many people imagined that if one day in the future, the XX Olympic Games were to be held in the fabled maritime city-Penglai, what would that experience be like? The endless stream of maglev cars, the hordes of service drones, the maglev train that circulated the entire city in 20 minutes It seemed that city had entered the future ahead of schedule.</br>
</br>
After this turbulent week, the Olympic Games finally unfolded</br>
</br>
Welcome, Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As soon as Jiang Chen got out of the car, he saw a smiling face.</br>
</br>
Kishida shook Jiang Chens hand enthusiastically and then gestured toward the VIP seats of the main stadium.</br>
</br>
When they entered through a private tunnel, he looked at the direction of the main entrance of the lower venue through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the elevator. With the dense crowds at the stadium, he thought that if he had to through the main gate, the opening ceremony would be over before he could get in.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he entered the stadium, he saw an acquaintance, although this acquaintance did not seem to like him.</br>
</br>
An eagle-like stare was locked onto him, and there seemed to be a haze in Kerrys eyes.</br>
</br>
From Jiang Chens smile, he felt annoyed. But he was a diplomat after all, so he didnt write his unhappiness on his face. He just raised his hooked nose slightly and looked away from Jiang Chen after a while.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw that Kerry no longer looked at him, he still smiled and looked away from him. But at this moment, he saw another familiar figure. Except that he never met this person, but only saw her on TV.</br>
</br>
I didnt expect the President of the UA to come here in person. Zhang Yaping sat down next to Jiang Chen, tilted his head slightly, and glanced in Hills direction.</br>
</br>
Is there a problem? Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
No, Zhang Yaping smiled and shook his head, I just think its a bit strange. The CIB and the UA military just had a large scandal, even if Hill plans to use the Olympic Games to visit Nippon to repair the broken relationship, I dont think it will be that effective, right?</br>
</br>
Its because they are not here for them. Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Do you mean At the same time as he said this, a trace of realization appeared on Zhang Yapings face.</br>
</br>
Thats right, Jiang Chen pointed at himself, then pointed at Zhang Yaping who was looking at him, as he said, Most likely they are here for us.</br>
</br>
The head of the host country and the President of the Olympic Committee entered the stadium one after another. The stage of raising the national flag and playing the national anthem ended, then the opening ceremony of the entire Olympic Games also kicked off. The next stage was an hour to two hours of performances.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen found a bottle of vintage red wine and a goblet, poured himself a glass, and leaned on a chair to enjoy the performance on the stage.</br>
</br>
The first performance was naturally the Olympic theme song, performed by a group that he couldnt name.</br>
</br>
Because he couldnt understand, Jiang Chen didnt pay attention to what they sang. Soon after the song, the second program started.</br>
</br>
A series of light particles appeared in the center of the stage, and the lights came on one after another. Accompanied by clean and refined electronic sounds, a pair of emerald green double ponytails jumped out from the illusory dimensional gate, as she swayed briskly with her fluttering black skirt.</br>
</br>
She was voted as the most popular virtual idol to perform, and she was also one of the highlights of the opening ceremony. Not only Hatsune Miku, but there were also a number of popular characters that people were familiar with, such as Mario and Tinkerbell.</br>
</br>
By the way, the augmented reality device on the main stadium stage was also produced by Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
After the two-hour performance, athletes from all over the world entered the stadium.</br>
</br>
Greek athletes entered the stadium first, followed by athletes from participating countries, and finally the athletes from the host country.</br>
</br>
Although he signed up for an event, Jiang Chen did not appear in the Xin athletes that marched through the stadium. He just sat in the VIP booth and waved to the athletes below the stage.</br>
</br>
After all the athletes had entered the stadium, a song of Olympics played, and the Olympic flag was raised.</br>
</br>
In the center of the stadium, the Olympics Committee and the organizer gave their open remarks to the athletes, referees, and coaches as they stood under the banner of the Olympic Games. They raised their right fists, solemnly swearing the Olympics Oath.</br>
</br>
In the name of the athletes.</br>
</br>
In the name of all judges.</br>
</br>
In the name of all the coaches and officials.</br>
</br>
We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play. We all commit ourselves to sports without doping and cheating. We do this, for the glory of sports, for the honor of our teams and in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism</br>
</br>
Under everyones watch, the Olympic flame was lit.</br>
</br>
The last performance and fireworks decorated the night sky and brought the opening ceremony to a close.</br>
</br>
Rows of artificial meteor showers crossed the dark night sky.</br>
</br>
No matter what would happen after tonight, at least at this moment, most people were praying for the same word</br>
</br>
Peace.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1354: Holding the Rifle with One Hand!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the end of the opening ceremony, the 32nd Olympic Games officially commenced.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen received the schedule, he looked slightly surprised.</br>
</br>
The first qualifying round of the ten-meter air rifle that he signed up for was actually on the first day of the Olympic Games, and it was in the morning, which completely surprised him. After he asked Zhang Yaping, he learned that it was an almost unwritten rule for the air rifle to be the first competition in the Olympic Games.</br>
</br>
Originally, Jiang Chen planned to take some time to practice, but he didnt expect that he would be competing the day after the opening ceremony, which made the situation somewhat awkward. He never even touched the air rifle used in the game before, let alone practice.</br>
</br>
If the Xin Olympic Committee learned of this, the officials would suffer a heart attack. They were ignorant of their conscience to rank him as a level B athlete. Since there was no level A air rifle athlete in Xin, he barely qualified to represent Xin.</br>
</br>
Since he was about to compete, it was obvious he didnt practice!</br>
</br>
Have you tried this before? Wang Tao handed the rifle to Jiang Chen with suspicion in his eyes. As a shooting coach, Wang Tao kept his eyes on him.</br>
</br>
Generally speaking, on the night before the game, athletes often chose to have a good rest, especially shooting athletes. This kind of event that required a high degree of concentration meant that the athletes had to get adequate rest before the game to ensure proper focus during the competition.</br>
</br>
It was the first time in his life to see an athlete like Jiang Chen who was practicing right before the competition.</br>
</br>
Dont worry, dont worry, Jiang Chen waved his hand to comfort him. He loaded the air rifle and aimed it at a target ten meters away, I just want to get the feel before the game.</br>
</br>
As he said this, he raised his air rifle, aimed at a target ten meters away, and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
BOOM</br>
</br>
The bullet hit the target accurately.</br>
</br>
When Wang Tao saw the number that jumped out on the electronic target, his eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
How many rings? Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow triumphantly as he put the air rifle aside, then he smiled at Wang Tao, revealing his shining white teeth.</br>
</br>
Wang Tao responded with a smile that looked more like a cry, as he said in defeat.</br>
</br>
0, you missed the target</br>
</br>
A shooting competition and the use of firearms were two different concepts.</br>
</br>
The latter was an application of technology, while the former was a form of art.</br>
</br>
How difficult was the 10 meter air rifle? Jiang Chen didnt realize until he stood in front of the target .</br>
</br>
The target was the first issue.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that the tenth ring was actually only the size of a needle tip, and the entire target was only the size of a dollar coin, and it was still ten meters away from the athletes. Imagine the difficulty to shoot a coin at a distance of ten meters?</br>
</br>
</br>
People with poorer eyesight wouldnt be able to see the target, let alone compete in the game.</br>
</br>
Because of this, Jiang Chen, who stepped into the competition stood at the 14th shooting position, still felt somewhat nervous. He was debating if he should use his genetic code Peerless. Strictly speaking, an air rifle was also a weapon. If he used Peerless, he could master the weapon to the extreme and hit the bullseye.</br>
</br>
Except</br>
</br>
Is it cheating to use his hidden genetic code?</br>
</br>
Are you sure you have touched an air rifle before? Next to Jiang Chen, Matthew Emmons, an athlete that represented the UA, glanced at the way he held the rifle, then he teased Jiang Chen, If you havent, I can teach you.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen realized someone was talking to him, he laughed and responded.</br>
</br>
Dont worry, I have touched more guns than you have ever seen.</br>
</br>
Really? Matthew sneered. Before I retired, I was the ace sniper of the Marine Corps. I dont know where you get your confidence.</br>
</br>
Then I will give you an example, Jiang Chen said, Have you heard of the Reaper Sniper Rifle? There is also the PK2000 which the standard configuration of the Celestial Marines, Im sure you have never touched it before. In my view, M4A1 and M16A2 are both toys compared to the PK2000.</br>
</br>
Matthew raised his eyebrows. As he was about to argue, the referees voice came from the side.</br>
</br>
Athlete 14 and Athlete 15, please be quiet, the competition will start soon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged and didnt continue to banter with the man. He picked up the air rifle and took a few false shots at the target in front. The model of the rifle was different from the one he saw in the hotel, but the weight and texture were not much different.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced sideways at Matthew, and read the disdain and mockery from his eyes. However, Jiang Chen just curved up the corner of his lips.</br>
</br>
If at first, he was hesitant to use his hidden genetic code, now he completely made up his mind. Since he no longer needed to inject to activate his hidden genetic code, it shouldnt be considered cheating.</br>
</br>
The competition officially started.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put the rifle on the shooting rack, then slowly loaded it. He put his shoulder behind the butt of the rifle, held the rifle in his right hand, narrowed his one eye, looked down the sight, and muttered in his mind.</br>
</br>
Peerless!</br>
</br>
Everything in his field of vision was plated with a layer of light blue, and all colors faded to a cool tone. All sounds were slowly amplified in his field of vision and gradually distorted in the elongated slowness. The rifle in his hand seemed to be connected to his body, just like his fingers, everything from aiming to pulling the trigger was so natural.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen accidentally discovered that his skill had subtle changed unconsciously.</br>
</br>
He couldnt tell exactly what changed, and when it happened. At this moment, he was completely immersed in the deep internal realm, as if he was the only person with the only rifle in the entire stadium.</br>
</br>
The bullet hit the target before it left the rifle</br>
</br>
When Matthew saw the way Jiang Chen held the rifle, he almost burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
Holding the rifle with one hand?</br>
</br>
Do you think you are James Bond?</br>
</br>
Even the most basic shooting posture is wrong, how do you expect yourself to win?</br>
</br>
But the moment the electronic scoring system returned the score, Matthew couldnt laugh anymore.</br>
</br>
In order to help the audience understand the game, when the bullet hits the target, the electronic scoring system would record the rings, and the hit would be shown in real-time on the big screen. The previous hits were presented as green dots, and the current hit was shown as a red dot. After the coin-sized target was zoomed out, every spectator could see where the bullet hit the target.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen was the first player to shoot, when the red dot first appeared on the big screen, almost all audiences around the world noticed this different shooter and the red dot that hit the bullseye</br>
</br>
Ten!</br>
</br>
Wait?! That works?!</br>
</br>
That must have been a lucky shot. You can hit a ten by holding the rifle with one hand? I dont believe it!</br>
</br>
The camera gave Jiang Chen a close-up shot, and audiences all over the world were amazed by his one hand posture. Although they thought it was must have been a fluke, the audience still cheered him on.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not pay any attention to the audience behind him, in fact, he didnt stop at all. He continued to pull the trigger with fluidity.</br>
</br>
The 10 meter air rifle qualifying round consisted of shooting 60 rounds of bullets from a standing position to a target ten meters away. The total time limit including the test firing was 1 hour and 45 minutes. There was quite an ample amount of time, but Jiang Chen didnt plan to waste any time at all.</br>
</br>
With Peerless activated, it would put an excessive load on the body.</br>
</br>
There was another shot that landed on ten, and the reading jumped to 10.9.</br>
</br>
Without stopping, Jiang Chen kept holding the rifle with one hand and continued to pull the trigger.</br>
</br>
Following the new rules of the Rio Olympics, the 10 meter air rifle qualifying competition also introduced decimal points. Each player was required to fire ten competition shots in each group for a total of sixty competition shots. The best score for a single shot was 10.9, and the eight players with the best total score advanced to the final.</br>
</br>
In a blink of an eye, Jiang Chen had already fired ten shots and all of them hit the bullseye without exception.</br>
</br>
From the initial excitement to the now dumbfoundedness, the audience seemed to have forgotten to applaud. They just stared blankly at the player who used the air rifle as a pistol. Even the famous athletes like Zhu Qinan and Sokolov who stood not far from Jiang Chen all stopped aiming, as they looked at the number 14 position in a shocked state and looks of disbelief.</br>
</br>
In the audience, people whispered to each other.</br>
</br>
I heard that the target is only the size of a coin.</br>
</br>
I see, thats why I cant even see the bullseye!</br>
</br>
This marksmanship is too abnormal. Isnt it a little bit</br>
</br>
Jiang Chenwait, this nameit cant be the same name, right?</br>
</br>
WAIT, thats insane, another identity of the worlds richest man is actually an Olympic athlete?!</br>
</br>
The referee behind Jiang Chen kept his eyes fixed on his movements. He watched Jiang Chen pulling the trigger and the numbers on the electronic scoring system with disbelief.</br>
</br>
When he emptied the bullets in the magazine, he skillfully took the rifle down from the shooting rack and loaded the bullets into the magazine.</br>
</br>
You can take a break; you have 1 hour and 40 minutes left in the game. The referee reminded him.</br>
</br>
No need.</br>
</br>
The referee opened his mouth, but no words came out.</br>
</br>
In fact, he wanted to say, You can take a break, Ill get someone to see if the electronic scoring system is malfunctioning. However, with how nonchalant Jiang Chen looked, the referee couldnt say anything, so he watched him put the air rifle on the shooting rack, lean in, and continue to fire with one hand.</br>
</br>
A total of sixty bullets were all shot in less than six hundred seconds.</br>
</br>
The athletes in positions 15 and 13 stood there blankly and completely forgot to shoot.</br>
</br>
Im done, you go.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled at Matthew as he put the rifle aside and left the stadium in swift steps.</br>
</br>
Behind him were dumbfounded athletes and referees, and a group of dumbfounded spectators.</br>
</br>
The red dots on the electronic scoring system were almost strung together into a line, and the counter next to it was flashing with bright red numbers.</br>
</br>
640</br>
</br>
It was only 14 away from a maximum score of 654.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1355: Libel and Slander</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Perhaps the stellar performance by the athlete at the 14th spot destroyed their confidence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen accidentally became the only player in the qualifying round to score more than 640. The result surprised everyone. However, the most surprising aspect was not the score, but the name attached to the score  Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, whenever this name was mentioned, two names also appeared out of reflexive in the minds of most people in the world.</br>
</br>
Future Group and Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
No matter which name, either was enough to push him to the throne of the richest man in the world. There were even rumors that his personal wealth had surpassed the Rothschild family  the financial ruler of the old-world. He possessed enough wealth to challenge the entire Wall Street, and his assets were capable of purchasing half of the Earth</br>
</br>
However, a well-known powerful capitalist appeared in the stadium as an athlete, and he made a miracle that shocked the rest of the world. The sudden shift in identity shocked many.</br>
</br>
It was fine being the richest man in the world, but he also possessed unhuman athletic ability</br>
</br>
You have everything going for you, how is everyone else going to compare?!</br>
</br>
Matthew Emmons, the player that stood next to Jiang Chen, ranked ninth with a score of 613. This veteran who was originally viewed as a favorite to compete for the gold medal unexpectedly missed the final, which was a pity.</br>
</br>
At Matthews age, this could be the last time he stood in the Olympic arena. However, he did not even make it to the finals. The ninth place in the qualifying round was the end of his career, which was quite a regrettable situation</br>
</br>
With mixed emotions in his mind, he left the stadium. After he tossed his cap on the table in the lounge, he took a bottle of water from his coach and drank in silence.</br>
</br>
When he saw the replay on the screen, and the score of 640, his heart jerked fiercely.</br>
</br>
Matthew smashed the bottle on the ground and he suddenly stood up.</br>
</br>
I want to report, he definitely doped!</br>
</br>
Surprised eyes gathered on Matthew.</br>
</br>
Shooting coach Dickett was taken aback for a moment. Then, put his hands on Matthews shoulder and looked at him with a serious expression.</br>
</br>
Who doped?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen! Xin Athlete Jiang Chen! Matthew stared at the screen with menace as he shouted in anger, How can a layman who cant even hold the rifle properly achieve a score of 640? Just because he has money he can buy the entire Olympic Committee to ignore his doping? I bet he must have taken banned drugs. If it is not banned drugs, then he must have used some other high-tech stuff!</br>
</br>
When Matthew said this, Dickett also realized something.</br>
</br>
Yes, how can an amateur athlete score an incredible 640?</br>
</br>
The possibility of doping was unlikely, but some kind of assisted aiming chip or similar things were definitely a possibility.</br>
</br>
</br>
The more he thought about the incredible technology of Future Group, the more he was convinced!</br>
</br>
And more importantly, once the accusation stands, Jiang Chen would definitely be inspected by the Olympic Committee. Then, the ninth-place Matthew could enter the finals!</br>
</br>
Dicketts eyes brightened. He had completely lost hope before, but now, he saw new hope.</br>
</br>
I will immediately report to the WADA! Dickett looked into Matthews eyes, as he said righteously, Athletes who use despicable means to win the game must be punished!</br>
</br>
On the other side of the stadium, Jiang Chen was inside the lounge as he took a big swig from the functional drink specially provided by Future Biology from Qian Xia.</br>
</br>
You are the most talented athlete I have ever seen! With a little bit of training, you have the hope of challenging the world record.</br>
</br>
Wang Tao was desperately trying to persuade Jiang Chen with strong excitement, so Jiang Chen had to put down his drink and wave his hand.</br>
</br>
Ill pass. You know Im just here for fun. If Im lucky, Ill get a gold medal. If not, thats okay. As for training, I have no interest in devoting my limited life to sports.</br>
</br>
Wang Tao shook his head in regret as Jiang Chen was completely unmoved.</br>
</br>
In fact, he knew that the achievements and benefits that the gold medal provided were limited to this genius. It was just a pity that such a talent would go to waste. If it were someone else, Wang Tao would never let such a talent go from his national team.</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a knock on the door.</br>
</br>
Wang Tao paused for a second, looked at the door, and said.</br>
</br>
Please come in.</br>
</br>
After the door was pushed open, a middle-aged man in a suit with a hooked nose, followed by three others, walked into the Xin Athlete Lounge. After he scanned the room, his sight stopped on Jiang Chen and he walked to him.</br>
</br>
Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen. We are observers of the Medical and Scientific Commission of the International Olympic Committee. My name is Griffin, and this is my assistant Hughes. We have received reports from other athletes and suspect that you may be have taken banned substances or taken supplementary drugs containing banned substances during the competition, we will investigate you on the principle of fairness and justice. In order to avoid affecting your final results, we hope you can cooperate with our work.</br>
</br>
When Griffin said this, he did not lower his voice. Everyone in the lounge heard what he said, glanced at each other, and started to chatter in quiet voices.</br>
</br>
Doping? President Jiang is not that kind of person, right</br>
</br>
But if there is no doping, how can you explain his score?</br>
</br>
Could it be</br>
</br>
This is slander! Wang Tao stood up angrily. Just as he wanted to argue with that person, Jiang Chen grabbed him and gently pulled him back.</br>
</br>
I heard this right? Jiang Chen looked at Mr. Griffin in front of him as he almost couldnt contain his laughter. You can dope in an air rifle competition? Sorry for my honesty, but this is the first time I have heard about this.</br>
</br>
Griffins expression was a little awkward.</br>
</br>
Doping in shooting competitions was not without precedent, but no one had ever won a championship by doping.</br>
</br>
After all, different from sports that tested physical fitness, shooting competitions required athletes to be highly concentrated. Calmness was the bigger factor in winning. Instead of doping, tranquilizers would probably work better.</br>
</br>
It was really a poor method to accuse a shooting athlete with doping.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh as he saw Griffin and his assistant exchanged awkward looks. He then said earnestly.</br>
</br>
If you really dont want to play fair, I can teach you.</br>
</br>
You just want Matthew to qualify, right?</br>
</br>
Its easy. Cant you just get him onto the stadium and have a rematch alone?</br>
</br>
Nonsense! The assistant named Hughes flushed, but he insisted on putting on a righteous expression, which made him more comical, When did I say it was Matthew who reported you? The Olympic Committee will protect the privacy of every whistleblower. Maliciously guessing the identity of the whistleblower is liable for defamation!</br>
</br>
Do I even need to guess? Jiang Chen laughed, Who doesnt know that the International Olympic Committee is run by the UA.</br>
</br>
Mr. Jiang, I also hope that you can cooperate with our test. If you have no issues, we will give you a fair answer. I dont think you want to be disqualified for the finals because you refuse a test, right? Griffin said.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen readily agreed, as he extended his arm into a please gesture, Please.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1356: World Record!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The results of the anti-doping test soon came out.</br>
</br>
In order to prevent the anti-doping agency from doing tricks behind their backs, the Olympic organizing committee and the athletes accompanying physician would accompany the entire anti-doping test process. If the athlete questioned the result of the first test, the athletes request for another test would be at an expense of a few thousand US dollars.</br>
</br>
However, it didnt need to be that troublesome. For Jiang Chen did not use something as unsophisticated as doping.</br>
</br>
Soon the test results came out. All test results related to doping returned negative, and the allegations against Jiang Chens use of doping were not established.</br>
</br>
The accusation about the use of auxiliary equipment was even more absurd because the equipment worn by all athletes during the game had been strictly screened and it was impossible to bring anything into the stadium. Matthew was full of disappointment as the Olympic Medical and Scientific Committee signed all the results of the test and rejected Matthews accusation.</br>
</br>
The results of No. 14 contestant Jiang Chen were valid, and the athletes who made to the final round remain changed.</br>
</br>
The final of the 10-meter air rifle was in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
As the women 10-meter air rifle and the men 10-meter air rifle started almost simultaneously, the results of one of the two competitions would become the first gold medal given at this years Olympics.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen finished the bento box prepared by Qian Xia in the lounge, he headed to the stadium fully refreshed and confident. Due to his amazing performance in the qualifying round, he attracted the attention of almost everyone in the audience as soon as he appeared. The audience welcomed him with thunderous applause. Audiences from Hua and Xin cheered for him, while most audiences from the UA booed him. However, they were eventually overwhelmed by the enthusiastic cheers.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved to the supporters behind him, then confidently walked to his spot, grabbed the rifle, and pressed the rifle against his arm.</br>
</br>
Since the Rio Olympics, the shooting competition had changed from a scoring system to an elimination system. The fault tolerance rate of the competition was much lower, and a slight mistake could cost the athlete the game.</br>
</br>
The final consisted of two series of three shots, to be fired within 150 seconds, for a total of six shots. Followed by these 2 series, each finalist would fire 14 rounds on command with 50 seconds for each shot. From there, the lowest scoring finalist would be eliminated after every two rounds until the gold and silver medalists were determined. Without the need for tiebreakers, the two players that competed for gold and runner-up would shoot a total of 20 rounds in the final.</br>
</br>
In the finals, he got the eighth position, a very lucky number.</br>
</br>
The seventh player next to him was named Irvin Skton, who came from the same country as Matthew, and qualified second in the qualifying round. The 22-year-old Irvine was known to be gifted in shooting competitions. Before he participated in the Olympics, he had won several gold medals in multiple international shooting events.</br>
</br>
</br>
There were also veteran athletes from Hua and Russia. As athletes from the two traditionally countries that were strong in shooting, the strength of these two athletes was also not to be underestimated.</br>
</br>
Your good luck should be used up, When Irvin walked beside Jiang Chen, Irvin grinned and provoked, Ill keep an eye on you. Dont you dare to play tricks under my nose.</br>
</br>
Keep an eye on me? Jiang Chen laughed, Then you better watch me closely, or else Im going to finish the competition.</br>
</br>
Irvin wanted to say something, but before he had the chance, the finals had already begun.</br>
</br>
In the first two series of shooting, Jiang Chen placed the air rifle on the shooting stand, activated Peerless, and quickly fired six shots as he did in the qualifying round. Other than one shot that scored 10.6, all five shots ended with 10.8. This time, he controlled himself to avoid scoring an astounding score.</br>
</br>
But even so, there was a commotion in the audience.</br>
</br>
No one had been able to shoot at such a fast pace. After everyone saw this spectacular performance, even foreign audiences started to applaud. Especially for the Xin audience that specifically flew to Yoto to cheer on their athletes. If it was not for the fact that they were worried that noise could affect the performance of athletes, they would definitely shout out in excitement.</br>
</br>
He shoots so fast!</br>
</br>
Thats what I said! How can President Jiang dope? And how do you dope for a shooting competition? What are the idiots of the Olympic Committee thinking?</br>
</br>
I heard that the whistleblower was Matthew, the ninth one in the qualifiers.</br>
</br>
That makes sense, no wonder he did it. He just wants to get into the final. This kind of person should not be in the Olympics as he lacks sportsmanship!</br>
</br>
The discussion in the stands did not reach the athletes in the competition. In their position, the athletes from different countries adjusted their air rifle to the best state and placed it onto the stand.</br>
</br>
They were indeed world-class athletes. Since they already learned Jiang Chens rapid shooting skills in the qualifying rounds, they were not affected by his incredible firing speed and accuracy in the finals.</br>
</br>
Without distraction, the other seven athletes pulled their trigger down with a calm and collected mind. They completed these two series of six rounds in the allotted 300 seconds. Although they were not as fast as Jiang Chen, they were all in close contention for the gold.</br>
</br>
After the two warm-up rounds ended, almost every player had scored more than 10 points.</br>
</br>
The next round was the intense and exciting elimination round.</br>
</br>
Different from the long game time of the qualifying round, each of the next 14 shots had to be completed within 50 seconds. For Jiang Chen, it was nothing at all. He could easily fire all 14 shots within 50 seconds.</br>
</br>
But for other athletes, this part of the competition was not easy. The single-shot timing design magnified the pressure that athletes had to endure. This meant that if they make a mistake, they could be out of the competition before they could even fix their mistake. At this stage, the athletes performance often fluctuated greatly, and a slight mistake could result in elimination.</br>
</br>
This was also precisely the exciting part of the whole game.</br>
</br>
The first seven shots were very close, and when the eighth shot started, the competition quickly heated up.</br>
</br>
One person was eliminated every two shots until only one winner remained.</br>
</br>
When everyone saw the eliminated athletes leave the stadium, the athletes hearts sped up involuntarily. They finished every motion from aiming to shooting as if they were walking on thin ice.</br>
</br>
In the end, there were only two people left on the court.</br>
</br>
Without looking at Jiang Chen next to him, Irvin ignored the shooting noises next to him and faint applause in the background. He took a deep breath and focused all his attention on his target. Like a formula in his brain, he simulated the trajectory in his brain, after he confirmed that it was correct, he pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
BANG</br>
</br>
The gunshot galloped away. Irvins eyes quickly left the sight and looked at the familiar reading on the electronic target. When he saw the number clearly, he was so happy that he wanted to scream!</br>
</br>
10.6!</br>
</br>
It was a score that was common in the first nineteen shots, but it was very rare to appear in the last shot. Even for an ironman, it was common to have mental fluctuation in the intense elimination round. And in this kind of competition, even the heart beating a beat faster could impact the score.</br>
</br>
Irvin was able to score 10.6 in his last shot. Counting the number of points he scored before, his final score totaled 208 points. Although it was still slightly lower than the world record, there was no suspense for the gold medal anymore.</br>
</br>
He looked at Jiang Chen next to him triumphantly. As he was about to mock Jiang Chen, his eyes suddenly stopped on Jiang Chens points</br>
</br>
Irvin was stunned.</br>
</br>
His first reaction was that he had read it wrong.</br>
</br>
Just when he wanted to rub his eyes and look again, the referees voice announced the gold medal of the game and it completely shattered his dream.</br>
</br>
Its impossible! Irvin exclaimed.</br>
</br>
The exclamation was quickly drowned out by the thunderous applause and cheers of the audience.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and waved his hand at the audience as he responded to the excited crowd.</br>
</br>
A dark horse was born, and the first gold in the Olympics was picked up by Xin.</br>
</br>
With a score of 216 points, Jiang Chen broke the 210.6 points world record set by Qian Xuechao at the Munich International Shooting Sports Federation and refreshed the world record by 5 points</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Soon after the qualifying round, Matthew, who narrowly missed the finals, sent a tweet that satirized Xin athletes who doped to steal his spot in the finals. His tweet attracted the sympathy and support of countless netizens from the UA.</br>
</br>
However, as soon as the test results came out, he was put into a very difficult situation. His situation became worse when Jiang Chen broke the world record this afternoon and won the gold medal that should have belonged to him. All his bitterness instantly overwhelmed his remaining rationality.</br>
</br>
If he admitted defeat from the beginning, he could turn the page on this entire fiasco. However, he couldnt accept this fact and sent out another tweet to satirize Future Biology. The tweet stated that Future Biology used advanced technology to help their president cheat the anti-doping agency; it was not an athlete that broke the world record, but the advanced technology of Future Group.</br>
</br>
Originally, Jiang Chen didnt intend to be bothered by anybody, and he didnt even take the Olympic Committee seriously. However, as the boss, even if he could swallow this accusation, his employees could not easily accept this false accusation.</br>
</br>
At noon of the same day, Future 1.0 pushed a piece of 500-word news, screenshots of two of Matthews tweets and attached a paragraph from Tao Ming, CEO of Future Biology.</br>
</br>
Since you dont trust the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) anti-doping technology so much, then we will help you for free.</br>
</br>
On the same day, Future Biology sent a medical team, signed a cooperation agreement with the Nippon Olympic Organizing Committee, conducted surprise inspections on 560 athletes from the UA living in the Olympic Village, took their urine samples, and brought them back to the laboratory for testing.</br>
</br>
The surprise inspection of Future Biology and Nippon Olympic Organizing Committee shocked the International Olympic Committee.</br>
</br>
The President of the Olympic Committee, Estun, immediately make an announcement stating that the Olympic Committee would not recognize the test results of Future Biology, and before the results came out, he pushed the narrative of retaliation on Future Biology.</br>
</br>
It is the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee and WADA to conducting anti-doping tests and ensure that the game is conducted fairly. Cooperating in the implementation of anti-doping testing is the obligation and responsibility of the organizer of the Olympic Organizing Committee of the host country, but it has no right to sign an agreement with unqualified medical institutions to conduct testing outside of the rules. The International Olympic Committee reiterated that the results of Future Biology will not have any enforcement effect. The International Olympic Committee will not refer to the results, and participating athletes do not need to cooperate in the test</br>
</br>
However, the Olympic Committee apparently underestimated the reputation of Future Biology. This announcement did not receive the slightest agreement from the public but attracted a lot of boos instead.</br>
</br>
</br>
Future Biology is unqualified?</br>
</br>
Are you kidding?!</br>
</br>
When the T-virus crisis broke out, the research institution of the T-virus vaccine was Future Biology! If Future Biology was an obscure research institution, perhaps this statement would receive agreement from the public and get fooled by the Olympic Committee. But unfortunately, Future Biology was not only well known, but it was as reputable as the world-famous Future Technology and Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
Not only because of the Future brand but also because of the main product  nutrient supply. As the only healthy and effective liquid food, the variety of flavors and calorie content had already filled 80% of the supermarket shelves around the world.</br>
</br>
Everyone remembered what Future Biology did, especially for an incident like the T-Virus incident.</br>
</br>
An advanced medical institution was now labeled as unqualified. What was the Olympic Committee trying to hide?</br>
</br>
When the results from Future Biology were released, the whole world was in an uproar</br>
</br>
The International Olympic Committee has lost their face this time. Zhang Yaping laughed, Out of the 560 athletes from the UA, 240 athletes urine samples were believed to contain doping ingredients. The highlight of this Olympics is no longer competitions. It is how many gold medals will be produced on the list of banned drugs. Some people even suggest that to create an additional gold medal ranking for pharmaceutical companies, so that these unsung heroes who silently contribute to sports will also come on stage to show their faces.</br>
</br>
For a long time, the development of doping agents had led to the development of detection methods for about 5-10 years, and it was constantly advancing with the advancement of technology. It was also why athletes urine was often frozen for more than eight years to review previous results after a breakthrough in anti-doping technology.</br>
</br>
However, for Future Biology, this kind of obstacle did not exist.</br>
</br>
After all urine samples were tested, Future biology did not announce the results of the tests. Instead, they published a list of the ingredients they found in the samples that were identified as positive, the suspected banned drugs that could have been taken, and the concentration of the chemicals in the samples.</br>
</br>
It was no longer simply a petty move, but a total retaliation, a slap to the face.</br>
</br>
The athletes from UA probably all hated Matthew. Originally, no one would find out what banned substance they took. But because of his tweets, he angered Future Group, and no one came out on top from this exchange.</br>
</br>
They really did lose their faces, but now they dont care about their faces anymore. Jiang Chen grinned, Just yesterday, they published the Therapeutic Use Exemption list. A total of 204 athletes from UA were on the list. By coincidence, these 204 people happened to be on our list.</br>
</br>
Therapeutic Use Exemption was the get-out-of-jail-free-card  issued by WADA, which appeared widely in various international competitions. Since the word was created, its infamous name was criticized because of the large degree of flexibility and WADAs double standard.</br>
</br>
Critics believed that Therapeutic Use Exemption was a distortion of the anti-doping rules, which was equivalent to issuing a license for the use of prohibited substances. The facts also proved that this criticism was not unfounded. A very simple set of data could reflect the dirty tricks employed by WADA on establishing double standards.</br>
</br>
In 2015, the number of athletes from the UA who applied for the Therapeutic Use Exemption was as high as 653, and 402 were passed. In the same year, only 54 athletes from Russia applied, and the number of approved was less than 20.</br>
</br>
Healthy athletes legally used substances others could not use, but people with serious disabilities were unable to participate in the Paralympics simply because of suspension.</br>
</br>
The situation seemed more obscure because WADA claimed that based on the need to protect the privacy of athletes, unless under special circumstances, the agency would not publish the list of athletes under the Therapeutic Use Exemption unless the athletes consent is obtained.</br>
</br>
What defined special circumstances? Of course, it was when their own was caught using banned substances, and a suitable excuse was needed. For example  This tainted athlete did not use banned substances, but for therapeutic purposes, the athlete had mistakenly used drugs containing banned substance</br>
</br>
In any case, since so many athletes who were supposed to participate in the Paralympics took the initiative to participate in the Olympics, in terms of spirit, we must applaud them.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping and Jiang Chen glanced at each other and laughed out together.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was the first to stop laughing and started to cough. He picked up the cup from the table and took a sip of the tea to soothe his throat.</br>
</br>
Regardless, we did bring home a gold medal, and this Olympics is a worthwhile trip for me.</br>
</br>
To be honest, did you cheat? Zhang Yaping smiled, Your marksmanship is so good? I dont believe it!</br>
</br>
It depends on how you define the word cheating. Jiang Chen smiled and shook two fingers. But I can promise two things. One is that I didnt use banned substances. The second is that I did not use auxiliary equipment. Though I didnt spend any effort on training, I did it through my efforts.</br>
</br>
He was right.</br>
</br>
Although genetic vaccine could release the potential of human genes, the extent to which these potentials buried deep in the genes could be stimulated depended on the users themselves. For Jiang Chen, whether it was Fury or  Peerless, he risked his life to unlock them.</br>
</br>
Are there any plans to represent the Xin Shooting Team in Paris four years from now on? Zhang Yaping said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Im not interested. For me, a gold medal is enough, Jiang Chen waved his hand and continued in a lighthearted tone. And I am more interested in becoming the organizer than an athlete. I suggest you can try to bid for the Olympics. Penglai is fully capable of hosting the 2028 Olympics. I can guarantee this.</br>
</br>
I will study your opinion seriously. Zhang Yaping nodded happily, What are your plans next? Do you want to go back with me, or wait here until the closing ceremony?</br>
</br>
I still have something to deal with. I may stay here for a bit longer, so you can go back first. As Jiang Chen leaned back against the sofa, he said casually.</br>
</br>
Why do I feel like youre up to no good again. Zhang Yaping grinned as he responded.</br>
</br>
Up to no good? Jiang Chen smirked, Im just going to take back what belongs to me.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Under both domestic and international pressure, the Nippon-UA Security Treaty eventually collapsed. Based on the agreement signed by Nippon, Xin, and Celestial Trade, Celestial Trade Marines boarded large transport planes and arrived at the Yoto Military Base. In addition to the two thousand soldiers, twenty Aurora-20s and fifty Tiger II tanks also landed in Nippon. Nominally, they were leased to the Nippon Defense Force, but in fact, the move was to supervise the withdrawal of UA troops from Nippon.</br>
</br>
The negotiation was expected to be a tug of war.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen met Hill at the New Otani Hotel.</br>
</br>
The last time they met was about a year ago.</br>
</br>
When the two countries navies had a showdown in the Western Pacific, Jiang Chen had a brief video call with her. The two sides almost put the nuclear button on the negotiating table. Fortunately, all the nuclear missiles stayed inside the silo. Celestial Trade succeeded in defending their border, and the UA was forced to choose rationality. It was precisely because the negotiation that day ended peacefully that people all over the world could sit in front of the TV and watch this world-class sports event today</br>
</br>
But these were events that happened in the past.</br>
</br>
Although only a year had passed, Jiang Chen could still clearly feel that she aged much more compared to the year before. Whether it was the wrinkles at the corner of her eyes or the white hair near her ears, it was visible that the last few months of her term had not been pleasant.</br>
</br>
These military installations were rebuilt by the UA military and used for nearly a century. We cannot unilaterally end the security treaty because of your agreement with Nippon. I hope you can carefully consider your decision today. The end to the Nippon-UA Security Treaty will make the entire Asia-Pacific region strategically unbalanced, which will definitely not be in your national interest, Hill said seriously as she stared into the eyes of Prime Minister of Nippon.</br>
</br>
The Prime Minister looked helpless and eyed Jiang Chen who sat on the other side.</br>
</br>
The first problem can be solved easily. Pack it up and take what you can take away. If you cant take it away, blow it up or sell it to us at a discount, well take everything. Jiang Chen, who sat on the sofa, gently tapped the armrest as he responded with a pleasant expression, As for the second issue, why does the strategic balance in Asia matter to you? You should pay attention to your allies down south, thats your front garden.</br>
</br>
When Hill heard Jiang Chens mention of South America, anger burned in her chest. However, she was the president of a country after all and thus did not respond to the provocation in Jiang Chens words, and she did not even show any negative emotions on her face. Rather, she continued calmly.</br>
</br>
500 billion dollars, this is our bottom line.</br>
</br>
How about this, we wont buy it anymore. Jiang Chen sighed, Where do you want to move these military bases? As long as they are on Earth, we will build one for you as they were for free.</br>
</br>
</br>
500 billion dollars?</br>
</br>
Fool! Your national defense expenditure for the whole year is not this number, right?</br>
</br>
This money can build another space elevator, let alone 88 military bases!</br>
</br>
The two sides were deeply divided over the compensation issue. Jiang Chens bottom line was 60 billion Xin New dollars, with each base compensated at an average price of 700 million. However, Hill insisted on the 500 billion figure and demanded that the settlement be settled in dollars.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not expect to be able to reach an agreement on the first day. After a heated round of negotiation, the two sides finally chose to put aside the issue for the time being and start the next topic of the time for withdrawal.</br>
</br>
The withdrawal time is too short. One year is not enough. We can reduce the number of military bases from eighty-eight to ten in ten years, and withdraw all soldiers stationed in Nippon in the next two years.</br>
</br>
Ten years? Jiang Chen laughed and shook his head, and put up one finger, At most one year. If you dont have enough planes, we can reimburse your tickets for free.</br>
</br>
Not only people need to be withdrawn, but also weapons and equipment. Ten years is not an exaggeration. It took us nearly a century to deploy these weapons. Kerry, who was next to Hill, quibbled.</br>
</br>
Your personnel can be evacuated in batches. You can transport your weapons and equipment to South Korea first, and then slowly drag them home. In other words, if you dont have enough transport capacity, you can come to us. Celestial Trade is not only a military contractor, but we are also in the shipping business. With his fingers crossed and placed above his one knee, Jiang Chen said with a smile as he responded to Kerry who sat across from him.</br>
</br>
From the very beginning, he had predicted that this negotiation would be a tug of war.</br>
</br>
Regardless of the compensation for the relocation or the time of withdrawal, the divides between Celestial Trade, Nippon, and the UA were huge.</br>
</br>
Nippon proposed that the Yokosuka Military Base must be relocated immediately. However, the UAs opinion was that the Yokosuka Military Base, as the headquarters of the UA Military in Nippon, should be the last to go. Celestial Trades requirement was that regardless of when the Yokosuka Base would be relocated, the Seventh Fleet deployed in Nippon must be withdrawn immediately.</br>
</br>
After a week of negotiations, the two sides finally reached an agreement on troop withdrawal.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade would pay 10 billion Xin New dollars to the UA in one lump sum payment, and Nippon would pay 60 billion New Xin dollars to the UA over four years. The withdrawal plan would officially commence in March next year, which would be the first month after the end of Hills term.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not raise too many concerns for the withdrawal plan proposed by Hill, but he emphasized that it must be completed within a year, that is, by March 2022. Although this opponent had caused him a lot of trouble, in general, she was still a respectable opponent. Since it was already an unlucky run for her, there was no need to destroy her remaining dignity.</br>
</br>
The UA made considerable concessions in terms of the amount of compensation and the time for withdrawal. In exchange, Jiang Chen handed over 10,000 NATO Coalition Force and a ceasefire agreement.</br>
</br>
In a sense, Hills astronomical demand was aimed at these two points.</br>
</br>
In addition, the Seventh Fleet was scheduled to depart for Guam at the end of this month, accompanied by two thousand Marines</br>
</br>
In the reception room of the New Otani Hotel, the representatives of the three parties signed their own names on three identical agreements.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen collected the agreement, he was about to leave with his loot. However, Kerry blocked his way and stared right at him.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade shouldnt have existed from the beginning. You are just troublemakers. If you still have a little conscience, you should immediately dissolve your stupid company, Kerry said one word at a time.</br>
</br>
Dissolve? Then what? Jiang Chen sneered, Depend on you to resist the colonial ship from Gliese 581? Accept the reality, we can do better than you. And with all due respect, you are the troublemakers, our existence just created trouble for you to create trouble.</br>
</br>
Kerry was slightly taken aback.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said the last sentence in Mandarin. For a while, he didnt understand the subject-verb-object relationship. When he realized what Jiang Chen had meant, his eyebrows suddenly raised, but when he was about to rebuttal, Jiang Chen was already long gone.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1359: South and North Colombia</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Time soon reached the end of the month.</br>
</br>
Although there were still countless reluctances, the UA finally fulfilled the promises in the agreement and initiated the first withdrawal procedure at the end of August. Amongst the cheers of the Yokosuka citizens, the flagship of the Seventh Fleet departed from the port and headed towards the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
After they learned the news of the UA withdrawal, the protesting citizens celebrated this historic moment and even set off fireworks at the gate of the UA military base. Although this behavior drew protests from the embassy and was quickly stopped by the police and the garrison, it still did not affect the celebratory mood of the Yokosuka people at this moment.</br>
</br>
However, they didnt know that the fortress in front of them just received a new owner. Two years from now, when the UA completed its withdrawal, Celestial Trade would take over here, and Nippon would never be able to get rid of the foreign troops to become a normal country.</br>
</br>
But in any case, for these citizens, it was a great victory and a day worth celebrating.</br>
</br>
About a few months later, the Mayor of Yokosuka proposed that this day would become a city holiday, and it received overwhelming support, but these were for later</br>
</br>
The UA fulfilled their promises, and Jiang Chen didnt break his promise either.</br>
</br>
On the second day after the Seventh Fleet left Yokosuka Port, Jiang Chen fulfilled the promise he made in the agreement. He called FARC leader Timochenko and Moro General and President Santos. He explained the requirements for cease-fire and release of NATO troops.</br>
</br>
So far, FARC had captured Bogota, the capital of Colombia, and it was only one step away from gaining full control of Medellin, an important city in the central region. Now the entire Andes in Colombia was controlled by FARC guerrillas, and the southern provinces of Colombia had also fallen into the hands of FARC. The government force was forced to retreat along the Gulf of Mexico to the northern coast of Colombia along with the NATO Coalition Force.</br>
</br>
It was not an exaggeration to say that FARC was one step away from controlling Colombia. The phone call from Jiang Chen at this time undoubtedly ruined Timochenkos dream of being the president and divided the country into two, North and South Colombia.</br>
</br>
Although he was extremely reluctant and unwilling, Timochenko nodded and agreed to Jiang Chens request. He slowly sent representatives to contact the Colombian government and initiated the ceasefire negotiation process. As for Santos, he had no opinion as he listened to what Jiang Chen said. He immediately agreed to the ceasefire agreement.</br>
</br>
When the captured NATO soldiers were told that they could go home before the end of the next month, they almost cried with excitement. This more than a month of life was not only torture to their bodies, but also torture to their arrogant self-esteem.</br>
</br>
</br>
Before they set foot on the battlefield, they originally thought it would be an asymmetrical war. However, when the EMP strike arrived, they experienced firsthand who was on the losing side</br>
</br>
As the ceasefire agreement entered into force, South Colombia had controlled 80% of Colombias territory. Although the Mexican coast was under the control of the government and NATO Coalition Force, the most important borders with Panama, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Brazil were all controlled by South Colombia.</br>
</br>
At this point, Celestial Trades Global Grid Plan finally made a breakthrough in South America.</br>
</br>
When Celestial Trade sent a team of engineers to Colombia, it also sent sales representatives to South American countries and began negotiations with the governments.</br>
</br>
As the seventh-largest economy ranked tenth in the worlds electricity generation, Brazil was still very interested in the Global Grid Plan, and almost without hesitation, it agreed to the terms. It became the third South American country after South Colombia to join the grid.</br>
</br>
A transmission cable would run north from Ecuador into southern Colombia, through the Andes and the Amazon jungle, cross Colombias border into Brazil, and finally merge into Brazils national grid. This transmission network would be completed by the end of the year. By then, most of South America would be tied to the Global Grid Plan and the war chariot of Celestial Trade</br>
</br>
In early September, the Yoto Olympics finally came to an end with the final gold medal determined. Due to the doping scandal, this Olympics came to an end amidst countless doubts and criticisms. Fortunately, until the closing ceremony ended, there were no more twists and turns.</br>
</br>
The ranking of gold medals was released.</br>
</br>
Due to the impact of the banned substances list published by Future Biology, although the Olympic Committee protected the athletes from the UA on the Therapeutic Use Exemptions under pressure, it was undeniable that the performance of those athletes was impacted. The total number of gold medals won by the UA unprecedentedly fell to fourth place. In contrast, Hua and Russia secured first and second places respectively.</br>
</br>
As for Xin</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, as it was the countrys first time participating in the Olympics, Xin only won one gold medal in total.</br>
</br>
The gold medal was the one around Jiang Chens neck. The 10 meter air rifle champion, the first gold medal in the Yoto Olympics, and the first gold medal for Xin in the Olympics</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether the Xinese people waiting for the result in front of their TV were satisfied, Jiang Chen was pleased with the result. This gold medal would be placed at the most visible spot in his office, in a place immediately visible once the door was open</br>
</br>
On the night of the closing ceremony, in order to celebrate the only gold medal, Xins athletes held a party in the hotel late into the night. As the protagonist of the party, Jiang Chen was taken advantage of by the well-built female athletes, and he had a lot of alcohol.</br>
</br>
This time he didnt use the storage dimension to cheat, so he was really drunk in the end. He vaguely recalled that he was sandwiched between two beautiful gymnasts who helped him back to his room. Later, something seemed to have happened. However, when he woke up at noon, he only saw the pillows and beddings tossed on the ground, a glass of water on the bedside table, as well as the decoction medicine prepared for him by the hotel staff.</br>
</br>
At first, he thought it was just because the athletes were more excited. Later, he learned from Coach Wang Tao that this situation was not surprising in the Olympics, and it could be even considered as a culture of the Olympics</br>
</br>
I dont want to make too many comments on this, but if you live in the Olympic Village for a while, I bet you will see even more exciting scenes. I remember when I was in Rio four years ago, the organizer prepared 450,000 condoms for the athletes in the village, setting the highest record in the history of the Olympics, and it was also the only Olympic Games where the condoms didnt run out.</br>
</br>
More exciting? Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
You know, where a group of people, Wang Tao coughed and made a vague gesture. If you get it, then you get it, if you dont get it, you dont get it. Everyone here is fit, full of hormones. When the timeis no longer tense, its not surprising what happens next. In short, what happens in the Olympic Village stays in the Olympic Village. Do you know what I mean? No one will interfere with each others life and family after.</br>
</br>
I probably understand what you mean.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his nose awkwardly and did not continue this topic.</br>
</br>
He was not a man of integrity and did not mind what happened that night. His only regret was that he didnt remember that face</br>
</br>
Maybe there were two faces.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The apocalypse; the West Coast of North America.</br>
</br>
The laborers in ragged clothes pushed carts forward as they moved between the steel reinforcements under the order of the supervisor; they delivered the cement and concrete bricks to the hands of the construction workers. The huge construction trucks drove back and forth between the concrete walls, and a giant fortress started to take its shape.</br>
</br>
Based on the NAC military governments plan for this place, this fortress would be the first phase of the colony. The second phase and third phase of the project would center around this fortress and expand out to functional blocks such as residential, commercial, industrial, logistics, distribution centers, ports, and even entertainment.</br>
</br>
As the governor of this colony, Zhou Guoping was living in the moment.</br>
</br>
When he recalled the conversation with Jiang Chen in Shangjing, he was very grateful for the decision he made at the time. Instead of choosing to return to the prosperous Wanghai for retirement, he came to this undeveloped land. Rather than spending the rest of his life trembling in the shadow of Chu Nan and always worrying about possible revenge, why would he not enjoy his life as the ruler of the distant North America?</br>
</br>
The funds allocated by the logistics department and all the credits on him were turned into tools and raw materials for construction. Zhou Guoping took the appointment letter signed by the General himself and took the transport ship built by the NAC shipyard through the safe passage of the Bering Strait. He arrived on the West Coast along with reinforcements.</br>
</br>
Not long after he arrived, he quickly implemented NACs colonial policy, played to the advantages of localized management, used interests to unite some survivors, and then drove those with vested interests to assist them in enslaving the other survivors.</br>
</br>
At present, there were already 20,000 laborers working on the construction site as they worked tirelessly to contribute to the NAC colony. The price they paid was only a hundred boxes of canned food, two truckloads of instant noodles, and tens of thousands of fruit-flavored high-calorie nutrient supplies.</br>
</br>
It wont be long before this place become a paradise envied by North American survivors, and as the governor of this colony, he would also become the one above all. And all this was something he never dared to imagine</br>
</br>
On the outskirt of the construction site, a pair of poorly equipped mercenaries patrolled the area.</br>
</br>
Half a month ago, their name was the Blood Axe Mercenaries. Although they kept their name, they were hired by NAC as long-term partners. Their usual tasks were patrolling and occasionally dealt with some issues they didnt even consider as issues.</br>
</br>
As the leader of the mercenaries, Blood Axe was very satisfied with his current life.</br>
</br>
He was not only satisfied because of the compensation offered by NAC, but also because he and his boys left their precarious days and now lived a life without worry.</br>
</br>
</br>
With his brand-new rifle, Blood Axe, as usual, led his boys to patrol the edge of this concrete fortress. He would from time to time look into the distance with his binoculars.</br>
</br>
Not far away, dust floated in the air.</br>
</br>
After he confirmed that there was a convoy approaching, Blood Axe notified the colony with his radio out of protocol, and then took his boys to stop the vehicles.</br>
</br>
Stop! Its NAC territory ahead, please explain your intentions!</br>
</br>
The convoy stopped, and the mercenaries on the truck jumped down one after another.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe gestured to his boys behind him, opened the safety of the rifle in his hand, and carefully examined the mercenaries with unknown intentions in front of him.</br>
</br>
We are the Black Skulls of Nevada, a black brawny man walked forward to about ten meters in front of Blood Axe, he signed to the mercenaries behind him to put away their weapons and expressed his harmless intention. He then looked at Blood Axe with a grin, We have no ill-intentions. Were just here to discuss business with you.</br>
</br>
Black Skulls.</br>
</br>
A frightening name in Nevada.</br>
</br>
They relied on their heavy firepower and modified all-terrain assault vehicles that traversed through the endless desert like a gust of wind. Due to their aggressive combat style, they were a nightmare for the merchant fleets between California and Nevada.</br>
</br>
In addition to plundering merchants, attacking Double-headed Cattle herds, and occasionally fighting with mutated human tribes, they occasionally engaged in slave trade. Especially in the past few months, the profits of slave trade had become more and more lucrative, and they seemed to have change their business focus and turned slave trade into their main channel of profit.</br>
</br>
The growing slave trade was closely connected with the outsiders on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
NACs large-scale construction work required a lot of labor. Their nonrejection attitude made the slave market in California, which had experienced a continued period of sluggish demand, suddenly spike up.</br>
</br>
In the desert of Nevada, there were hundreds of public or private fallout shelters.</br>
</br>
The inhabitants of these shelters were the cheapest slaves on the North American wasteland. Not only did they have poor survivability, but they also couldnt do much heavy work. Few survivors were willing to pay for them. However, after the arrival of this group of outsiders, this situation changed drastically.</br>
</br>
The rich yellow men seemed to have a soft spot for such survivors who emerged from the fallout shelter. Especially for engineers or scientists who hold advanced skills certificates in a certain field, NAC even offered a high price of a box of canned fresh meat.</br>
</br>
It was canned meat!</br>
</br>
In any survivor force, a box of canned meat with the NAC anti-counterfeiting label could be exchanged for bullets of the same weight. And the bullets were high-quality standard bullets, far superior compared to the inferior bullets circulating in the black market!</br>
</br>
Even the survivors in the Capital on the East Coast heard of the name NAC. It was not difficult to imagine the shock NAC brought to the North American survivors.</br>
</br>
Five hundred slaves, all from fallout shelters, the powerful black man pointed to the group of malnourished slaves on the truck, grinned at the NAC officer, and rubbed his hands in eagerness, Let me take a look at your goods.</br>
</br>
After we evaluate these people, you will naturally see what belongs to you. The officer in the kinetic skeleton said blankly, then signaled to the soldiers behind him. Under the escort of two medical staff and four soldiers, they walked to the truck.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries around the truck stepped aside as they cleared a path.</br>
</br>
As usual, before the transaction, NAC medical staff made a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the slaves. From health status to physical attributes, as well as simple inquiry and assessment of professional knowledge and skills.</br>
</br>
After an anxious wait, the black man finally saw his payment  twenty boxes of canned meat, ten tons of rice, and a box of high-quality cigarettes. If he pulled these things to Minutemen-controlled Liberty City a hundred kilometers away, these could easily sell for 400,000 bottle caps. If he brought these goods to the even further Texas, he could sell them for a high price of 600,000 bottle caps.</br>
</br>
After he happily ordered his men to load the goods, they climbed back in to the truck and drove away.</br>
</br>
From beginning to end, Blood Axe looked blankly at the situation, but deep inside, he was astonished</br>
</br>
As a Californian, although his range of activities did not include the eastern desert, any survivor in California would not be unfamiliar with the reputation of Black Skulls.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the California National Guard or the militia  Minutemen, these gangsters with skull turbans had never respected any organization. But at this moment, in front of NAC, they were acting like honest people doing business.</br>
</br>
It felt like the Sun just rose from the west!</br>
</br>
Maybe these outsiders could bring real order to the chaotic and lawless California?</br>
</br>
With this idea that even he himself found unrealistic, Blood Axe greeted the NAC officer and walked towards the other side of the colony with his boys</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In the modern world, the sky above Yoto International Airport was pristine and clear.</br>
</br>
Athletes from all over the world boarded the flight home and left the city.</br>
</br>
In the far land between North and South Colombia on the other side of the Pacific, the ceasefire agreement finally came into effect. On the premise of NATOs recognition of the Timochenko governments actual control over South Colombia, Timochenko agreed to unconditionally release more than 10,000 captured Coalition soldiers in exchange for two thousand soldiers who had been captured by NATO and North Colombia.</br>
</br>
On the surface, it appeared to be the generosity of the Timochenko government, but anyone who understood politics recognized this as a political move. The UAs compromise on Nippon was exchanged for Celestial Trades concession on the Colombia issue.</br>
</br>
As for the interests of the Colombian people, they were not considered by either party from the beginning</br>
</br>
After Timochenko, who had been dealing with official duties, hung up Jiang Chens call, he stood in front of Bolivars portrait at the Presidential Palace in Bogota. He silently smoked several cigars as his eyes stayed fixated on the portrait. FARC was only one step away from reunifying the whole country. Even the NATO Coalition Force could not stop the defeat of government force. However, Colombia was now divided into two and became two countries</br>
</br>
Although he felt dissatisfied, he couldnt think of any other way.</br>
</br>
He knew the role he played in this game and he knew who handed him everything he owned today.</br>
</br>
Timochenko had no doubt that if he dared to turn on Celestial Trade, he would fall ill and die in a few days because he smoked too much cigars or for some other reasons, and then there would be a more obedient puppet to take power to become the new leader of FARC with the support of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Peace arrived in a hurry.</br>
</br>
With glory and bounty, the Moro Soldiers sang a triumphant song and withdrew from the Colombian battlefield. The turbulent situation in South America finally returned into the former peace. Although everyone knew that the peaceful faade was built on compromise,</br>
</br>
Kwai looked at the G100 that disappeared into the light blue sky with a complex expression. Her right hand clenched tightly to her sleeve and she pressed against her chest.</br>
</br>
Last night, the devil finally spared her. She was almost broken. Then he had dinner with her in the restaurant on the top floor. Until now, she couldnt believe that she could put on normal clothes and walk out of the room intact.</br>
</br>
She still vividly remembered the words left by the man with the evil smile at the candlelight table last night.</br>
</br>
Dont lie to yourself. If you really hate what I did to you, you would have poured this bowl of potato soup on my face. Dont use any excuses like being afraid to lie to yourself, you should be very clear what the real reason is, why dont you admit it honestly? Tsk tsk, dont look at me with such a scary expression. I have given you more than once the opportunity to choose whether to continue or not, but the choice your body made has been far more honest than the expression on your face.</br>
</br>
</br>
With confusion and loss in her eyes, Kwai repeatedly chewed the words that made her waver.</br>
</br>
She didnt understand why she became like this. She obviously should hate him, and she wished he could die at the next moment. However, at this moment, when she saw the flight that disappeared into the horizon, there was a trace of reluctance and longing in the softest part of her heart.</br>
</br>
Whether she admitted it or not, that man had left an indelible mark on her</br>
</br>
Onboard the G100, Jiang Chen looked away from the grounding disappearing underneath him and started to rest in the decompression seat. After half an hour, when he opened his eyes again, the private jet had appeared over Coro Island and had begun its descent towards Coro International Airport.</br>
</br>
When Ayesha saw him at the VIP tunnel at the airport, she plunged into Jiang Chens arms, stamped a passionate kiss on his lips, and buried her forehead into his chest.</br>
</br>
Although it had only been less than a month, she could no longer suppress her overflowing emotions.</br>
</br>
I heard you did something dangerous over there again. After they go in the car, Ayesha behind the steering wheel complained quietly, You could have gotten Gill to do this. If you really dont believe in her ability, you can leave it to me.</br>
</br>
Danger is a stretch. Its not the first time I went to a military base. Jiang Chen laughed and rubbed Ayeshas silky hair, How have you been doing these days?</br>
</br>
Ive been alright, Ayesha smiled, Lilith has become obsessed with diving recently. I, Sister Shiyu, and Natasha took her to the ocean every weekend.</br>
</br>
Unbelievable. That little girl would actually like things outside the virtual world. I thought she would not be able to live without the Internet. Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Sometimes, Jiang Chen was really curious about the world through the eyes of an advanced artificial intelligence with emotions. Whenever he talked about his view of the world, Liliths attitude had always been ambiguous.</br>
</br>
Perhaps she was not even aware that as a string of data, how many terabytes of variables were between herself and reality.</br>
</br>
Back home, Jiang Chen kissed Xia Shiyu and Natasha . Then, he reached out and rubbed Liliths head, who was also standing in the hallway. Finally, he returned to the office. Almost as soon as he sat down, he received a call from Celestial City.</br>
</br>
The call was from Kelvin.</br>
</br>
News came from the distant Mars colony. Three hundred scientific researchers had successfully received the Flower of Memory. After a week of observation, they did not observe any adverse side-effects.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen learned the good news, he immediately asked him to transfer the call to the Mars colony.</br>
</br>
During the call, Dr. Amos quickly greeted Jiang Chen and then started to joke.</br>
</br>
One piece of good news and one piece of bad news.</br>
</br>
Without any regard for the decision Jiang Chen would make, Dr. Amos made the decision for him and continued.</br>
</br>
The good news is that our gains are amazing. The Gaia civilization has gone quite far in the research of materials, gravity, and planetary environment, far beyond the imagination of modern physics. Especially in the field of hadron materials, their research has completely changed our understanding of materials science and particle physics.</br>
</br>
I remember you mentioning a piece of bad news, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The bad news is that I am drooling whenever I see the specimen of Devil Worms. There seem to be strange things mixed in with the Flower of Memory. In addition to the knowledge of the Gaia, there are also their recipes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen processed what he had just heard for a moment before he laughed out loud, Thats easy, I can have someone prepare one for you. Steamed or fried?</br>
</br>
Forget it, I want to live longer. Amos rolled his eyes, paused for a moment, and continued, In the next two months, we will use the knowledge in our brains and generate research papers, sort them out and upload them to the Celestial Database. You can look forward to the extent to which the knowledge in our database will be enriched in two months!</br>
</br>
Ill look forward to that day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded happily. After he bantered a bit more with Dr. Amos, he ended the call.</br>

</br>
The North American colony in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping summoned the officials and held a quick meeting in the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
The first phase of the project is only halfway to completion and we need more slaves to contribute to our colony. Now our colony is quite crowded and the construction site is filled with refugees from other places. I suggest we immediately begin the second phase of the project by developing the residential area outside the fortress.</br>
</br>
We are colonists, and we are not here to do charity work in North America. We are feeding more than 30,000 laborers, and thats more than enough. What we need now is money, not more people, Zhou Guoping emphasized again. Its not caps, nor crystals, but credit points.</br>
</br>
Even if he never implemented the system himself, he had seen its action.</br>
</br>
After the time he spent at the Sixth Street, Hongcheng, and Shangjing in underground activities, even if he was not too gifted in governing, he was not blind. For example, he knew the most important point, that was, no matter what you do, you cannot do without money.</br>
</br>
Now that the budget was nearing depletion, the first and foremost important issue was to solve the funding problem. The funding here did not refer to North American survivors, but to the credit points that circulated in the NAC.</br>
</br>
From the most basic construction steel to the high-end munitions production line, the amount of material in this new colony was much higher than it appeared. The only thing that they didnt lack was food and refugees were attracted by food.</br>
</br>
Food was always a great commodity sold everywhere. However, if they just relied on food alone, it would be difficult to exchange for the real goods from these ordinary survivors.</br>
</br>
Whether the National Guard or Minutemen, they all held a cautious attitude towards NACs actions on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
In particular, the self-proclaimed righteous National Guard, with pre-war thinking, regarded NAC as the remnants of the Pan-Asia Cooperation. Although they did not take any hostile actions towards the NAC outpost, they were never friendly either.</br>
</br>
Just as the people around the table were discussing how to develop the local specialties of the colony to draw investors from the Sixth Street in, a messenger ran in. After he saluted, he reported to Zhou Guoping.</br>
</br>
Our reconnaissance team witnessed a large number of Mud Crabs in an abandoned port ten kilometers away from the colony, it is suspected that there is a nest there.</br>
</br>
Dont bother me with such trivial things, Zhou Guoping waved his hand impatiently, Do what you should do.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
After the messenger saluted again, he ran out. However, before he even took two steps, Zhou Guoping suddenly stopped him.</br>
</br>
Wait, Zhou Guoping stopped the messenger.</br>
</br>
The soldiers stopped, turned around, and saluted again.</br>
</br>
</br>
What else, sir?</br>
</br>
What is the difference between the Mud Crabs here compared to the Mud Crabs in Asia? Zhou Guopings eyes turned while he touched his chin.</br>
</br>
Before the messenger had time to answer, another NAC officer sitting at the conference table responded with confusion in his tone.</br>
</br>
Bigger, lighter in color, crab claws with serrated barbs, crab roe is milky white Is there any problem?</br>
</br>
No problem, its just that I suddenly thought of Yizhou. Remember the crab roe from the Yizhou island colony? I ate it once and it was delicious. Zhou Guoping licked his lips as fascination appeared in his eyes as well as a touch of excitement.</br>
</br>
Just now, he suddenly thought of a good way to make money.</br>
</br>
The North American colony could follow the example of Yizhou Island and cultivate aquatic products like Mud Crabs in coastal areas.</br>
</br>
By that time, he could give these North American Mud Crabs a new name, one distinguished enough to sell its milky crab roes to the Sixth Street. It would definitely have a market!</br>
</br>
Clean up that abandoned port, and collect all the mud crab eggs!</br>
</br>
Roger! The messenger gave a military salute and turned away.</br>
</br>
Outside the abandoned port, rusty containers were piled up randomly, and destroyed goods were scattered everywhere. For strange reasons, a large cargo ship beached on the shore, and half of the ship ran aground on the slope-like shore, covered by countless seaweeds from the sea.</br>
</br>
With plenty of food andsuitable humidity, this semi-humid environment was the most optimal for Mud Crabs.</br>
</br>
Early the next morning, the roar of the engine from a distance broke the tranquility of the abandoned port.</br>
</br>
More than a dozen trucks, escorted by four assault armored vehicles, parked in the open space in front of the port.</br>
</br>
Soldiers with rifles jumped off the truck one after another. A small part of them was from the NAC army while most of them were mercenaries composed of local survivors. Everyone was divided into two teams and assembled in front of the vehicles. The NAC officer in power armor walked to the front of the team and shouted in a hoarse voice.</br>
</br>
Okay, cheer up, lads. You have already received your mission, so I wont repeat it here. If we are lucky, we can eat fresh grilled crab roe at noon.</br>
</br>
What if you are not lucky? someone couldnt help but ask.</br>
</br>
Then youll be turned into crab roe.</br>
</br>
NAC engineers stepped forward, placed explosives on the bulkhead of the cabin, and quickly retreated. With the weapons provided by the NAC, the mercenaries at the forefront stood by at a safe distance from the explosion as they eagerly fiddled with the new equipment in their hands.</br>
</br>
With a loud bang, the rusty cabin was blasted open with a hole half-a-person high. With the rocket launcher provided by NAC soldiers, Blood Axe rushed into the freighter on the shore first. He pointed the rocket launcher at a Mud Crab that made a hoarse noise and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
As a trail of smoke left the rocket launcher, the flame illuminated the other end of the ship.</br>
</br>
After he tossed the launcher away, Blood Axe quickly equipped the rifle behind his back and unleashed his firepower at another Mud Crab that emerged from the corner. His boys also join the fray as they greeted the Mud Crabs with more rockets and grenades.</br>
</br>
Although the shell of Mud Crabs was thick, they didnt last long under this barrage.</br>
</br>
Soon, the smoked Mud Crabs curled up into balls and crooked to the side of the hallway. At this time, the NAC force, which entered from the other side of the cabin, also joined the battlefield. Armed with weapons that were significantly better than these mercenaries, they weaved a net named death inside the ship.</br>
</br>
Sparks jumped in the cabin, and soon half of the cabin was cleared out. The part that was immersed in the water could not be cleaned for the moment. The officer asked the engineer to go up and weld the doors with alloy plates to prevent the underwater Mud Crabs from coming up.</br>
</br>
After the engineer had done all this, he yelled to the soldier behind him.</br>
</br>
Search the area! Collect the eggs! Pay attention to the big eggs. The little crabs from there are harder to deal with</br>
</br>
NACs price for these eggs was a basin-sized egg for a bag of instant noodles. Blood Axe had very much enjoyed trading goods with goods. Compared to the pointy caps, he preferred the hard currency that could be exchanged for goods anywhere.</br>
</br>
Just as he ordered his boys to collect these crab eggs, he went deeper into the cabin with his rifle to see if there was anything worth searching. This port had been abandoned for so many years and had obviously been visited by survivors countless times, but this freighter occupied by Mud Crabs was undoubtedly an undeveloped territory.</br>
</br>
The deeper he went, the more humid the surrounding environment and the denser the sticky seaweed.</br>
</br>
At this moment, his EP suddenly flashed, indicating that the radiation level exceeded normal levels.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe immediately gave himself a shot of iodine. As he watched the flashing red light gradually dim, he stepped forward and continued.</br>
</br>
At the end of the warehouse was a row of cracked containers, completely wrapped by seaweed. The water stains on the ground illuminated with indescribable fluorescence, which made him afraid to take a step forward. Obviously, the radioactive source was there, and the radiation there was not something an iodine shot would resist.</br>
</br>
I found something here, Blood Axe shouted behind him.</br>
</br>
NAC recognized the value of intelligence.</br>
</br>
The stuff inside was obviously not something he could recover, so he chose to contribute this information to the NAC. If the NAC found something good here, based on their past behavior, they were never stingy with rewards.</br>
</br>
Whats the situation? The officer in the power armor and four soldiers walked over here.</br>
</br>
The amount of radiation here exceeds the average, Blood Axe pointed at the container wrapped in seaweed with his thick index finger, There must be something in it, but I cant be sure.</br>
</br>
The officer frowned slightly and walked forward.</br>
</br>
Power armor had top-level radiation resistance, and it could easily cross areas that received nuclear attacks, and naturally, it was not afraid of this level of radiation. When the officer walked in front of the container, he lifted his heavy steel palm and tore apart the seaweed stuck to the surface of the container.</br>
</br>
The sign of radioactivity there should be something incredible. The officer turned his head and said to one of the soldiers, Bring the engineer over and remember to put on protective clothing.</br>
</br>
Soon, an engineer with a toolbox ran over.</br>
</br>
After the engineer took out a thick laser-cut gun from the toolbox, he pointed a sharp knife at the container. In a stream of water mist, the humming blade cut into the container like tofu, then left a neat cut on the container.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe stared nervously at the container that was gradually being cut open, his heart was pounding furiously as he silently prayed. If they found something good, it would increase his pay.</br>
</br>
Soon, the engineer cut a two-person wide opening in the container, and then quickly exited the radiation area with the toolbox. The officer took a step forward, pulled the half-dangling aluminum alloy skin off the container, and stepped into the container.</br>
</br>
These mutated seaweeds had strong penetrating power and had penetrated into the container. They even covered the goods stored in the container. When the officer turned on the tactical flashlight, he wiped the seaweed from the surface.</br>
</br>
Let me see what exactly is inside the radioactive sign</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the outstretched hand stopped.</br>
</br>
The officer involuntarily took a step back. He muttered to himself in a low but trembling voice.</br>
</br>
This is a nuclear warhead?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1363: I donâ€œt think they will have any objections</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Future Bank will provide you with a loan of ten billion Xin New dollars, part of which will be used to restore the grid in Santander and its neighboring areas, and part of it will be used to invest in railways in the southeastern provinces of South Colombia. If you are willing to contract the work of these two projects to Future Groups infrastructure subsidiary, not only can we reduce the interest on this loan from four percent to two point five percent, but we can also provide you with an additional billion dollars as an interest-free loan.</br>
</br>
Inside the office on the top floor of Future Building, Jiang Chen played with a bright silver coin in his left hand as he leaned back in his chair and spoke with President Timochenko on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
One of the most important factors that allowed FARC to gain support in the southeastern provinces was the extremely uneven distribution of wealth in Colombian society. Almost 80% of the wealth was concentrated in the coastal areas west of the Andes. FARC promised to revitalize the economy of the underdeveloped areas in the southeast after the success of the revolution, and building railways and roads were considered feasible options.</br>
</br>
When the North Colombia government retreated to the Gulf Coast, it had almost emptied the treasury and left Timochenko with only a pile of mess. It was fine to rely on the savings from the drag trafficking days to purchase weapons, but it was obviously unrealistic to support infrastructure constructions.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, due to disputes over the legitimacy of the regime, South Colombia received an exceptionally poor credit rating from investment banks and credit rating agencies, and almost no foreign banks were willing to lend to Timochenko. Future Bank perhaps was the only financial institution willing to provide loans to them. The carrot tossed by Jiang Chen just saved his life.</br>
</br>
thank you.</br>
</br>
Timochenkos Adams apple moved slightly, and he uttered the words with mixed emotions.</br>
</br>
To be honest, until now, he still felt bitter about the fact that Celestial Trade betrayed the interests of the Colombian people to reach a deal with the UA. He was very worried that Colombia would become the second Korean peninsula, placed in the middle of the negotiating table between two superpowers, and divided into two countries forever.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome. Jiang Chen said in a relaxed tone as he waved his hand, I know you may have some bitterness in your mind, but I advise you to think again. Without my help, you are either hiding in the mountains now or waiting for your trial in prison.</br>
</br>
thank you. Timochenko smiled wryly.</br>
</br>
Except thank you, he couldnt seem to think of anything better to say.</br>
</br>
I said that you are welcome, Jiang Chen smiled, Besides, dont be too frustrated. The truce is an opportunity for you to rest and rebuild. Dont forget to build your military when youre building your infrastructure. Im very optimistic about the courage of your soldiers. When they were against NATOs modern army, they only lacked some modern tactics and a few new weapons. There is an international defense exhibition in Coro City in September. I will get someone to send you an invitation letter, you can take a look at it.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen took the opportunity to advertise for Future Military.</br>
</br>
Although the economy of South Columbia was completely beaten now, he did not want to miss this potential buyer. Once the Global Grid entered the country, these poor provinces would soon be revitalized. Even if Timochenko had to buy the weapons on credit, he was still willingly sell as he was not concerned about repayment at all.</br>
</br>
However, Timochenko wasnt thinking about this at the moment. After he heard Jiang Chens statement, he was suddenly overjoyed. Especially the phrase Dont forget to build your military, in his opinion, he was simply a foreshadowing the future unification of Colombia.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, Celestial Trade did not show any weaknesses when compared to the UA!</br>
</br>
After he confirmed the thought in his head, Timochenko, full of white hair, appeared younger. He vowed.</br>
</br>
Ill make a trip myself!</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen hung up, Xia Shiyu, who was holding some documents, knocked on the door and walked in.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen in the chair, she smiled.</br>
</br>
What have you been up to?</br>
</br>
I just made a call with the new owner of South Columbia, and there is another big project waiting for Future Heavy Industries, Jiang Chen teasingly said as he threw the coin he was playing with to Xia Shiyu, then he raised an eyebrow. Lets not talk about that, look at this.</br>
</br>
What is this? Xia Shiyu curiously asked as she pinched the coin that Jiang Chen had thrown over and held it up. When she flipped it to the back, she was taken aback for a moment. Then the corners of her mouth twitched slightly, and without being able to contain her laughter, she burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
The second edition of the Xin coin is worth one dollar and has a circulation of 300 million. The one you are holding is a sample sent by the Xin Reserve. Jiang Chen made a helpless expression, A shareholder suggested that 2020 should be commemorated as it was the first time Xin participated in the Olympics and won its first gold medal. Therefore, we now have this.</br>
</br>
It feels odd to have my head printed on a coin. If it must happen, then at least it should be the hundred dollar bill.</br>
</br>
The shareholder who put forward this suggestion clearly did not get Jiang Chens taste.</br>
</br>
But even though he was planning to exercise his veto power, Jiang Chen did enjoy this coin, so he planned to treat it as a collection piece at his mansion.</br>
</br>
I think its pretty cute. Xia Shiyu smiled as her finger gently stroked the outline of the head on the coin.</br>
</br>
Come on. Jiang Chen rolled his eyes, I have vetoed this idea in my head.</br>
</br>
Why not consider issuing two sets of one-dollar coins at the same time? One set will be issued in small quantities in the form of commemorative coins, and the other set will be issued on a large scale as the main currency. Xia Shiyu examined the coin in her hand. She was clearly not ready to give up on this idea, so she came up with a compromise, I always feel that this kind of a coin will be very valuable in hundreds of years.</br>
</br>
Issued as a commemorative coin?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin and thought for a moment, then he nodded as his eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
It was a good idea.</br>
</br>
And if there was a chance, he would also like to know how much this set of coins with his head would be worth down the road</br>
</br>
Now that you interrupted me, I almost forgot about the important stuff. Xia Shiyu tossed the coin on the desk and then placed the documents in front of Jiang Chen, The Ecuadorian government called me and asked me when the space elevator could start construction. They are ready to cooperate with our project, they just hope we dont delay it too long.</br>
</br>
Ecuador had always been on Celestial Trades side, so it would be unwise to drag this on. Now that Celestia Trade had opened up South America and the situation in Colombia was now stabilized, the second space elevator was ready for construction.</br>
</br>
Send an engineering ship to Ecuador, and the site selection for the second space elevator can begin. By the way, since the Ecuadorian government is so anxious, then you can ask them for me. We plan to buy one of their Galapagos Islands. The island will be used as a port for Celestial Trade and as the construction center of the space elevator. This transaction only involves land use rights and does not involve sovereignty. This is our final condition for building the space elevator in Ecuador. If they have no objections, we can get started too.</br>
</br>
I will pass this on to the Ecuadorian government. Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
As soon as possible, Jiang Chen smiled. Although I dont think they will have any objections.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1364: The Second Space Elevator</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was right; they really wouldnt reject his proposal.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu called the Ecuadorian Embassy, she got a reply from the Ecuadorian government on the same day.</br>
</br>
The Ecuadorian government agreed to the proposal of Future Group to lease Marchena Island in the Galapagos Islands to Celestial Trade for a period of 50 years at a price of one million Xin New dollars. If the lease was not ended by either party after fifty years, it would be automatically renewed every ten years.</br>
</br>
Marchena Island was located in the northern Galapagos Islands, close to the equator. The island covered an area of 130 square kilometers and was minimally developed. The island was uninhibited with only an inactive volcano. The surrounding water was deep, which made it an excellent natural port.</br>
</br>
Based on the agreement, Celestial Trade could use this island for military purposes, but the number of troops stationed on the island could not exceed 1,000, and deployment of any strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles on the island in any form was prohibited.</br>
</br>
Ecuadors generous offer was returned by Future Groups lucrative deal. Not only was the second space elevator project named Project Marchena, but the port at the bottom of the space elevator was also named Marchena. Future Group even promised to provide a little help to Ecuador in the nomination for membership into the Earth Defense Alliance next year, despite its poor GDP data.</br>
</br>
In addition, the agreement reached between Celestial Trade and Ecuador also stated that although this space elevator and spaceport were built in Ecuador, they would not be bound by the Ecuadorian Constitution, but as a special autonomous region under the jurisdiction of the Celestial Trade Space Department.</br>
</br>
Even so, this unregulated space elevator still brought huge economic benefits to the small South American country Ecuador.</br>
</br>
An examination of the current Celestial City would reveal the facts. Although it did not contribute a dime to Xins finances, the entire space elevator became the entrance to the synchronous orbit in the eastern hemisphere. The number of ships that moved between the major ports of Xin every day accounted for almost 60% of the cargo ships active in South Asia.</br>
</br>
If it wasnt for the limited capacity of the space elevator, as well as the distant threats in sight, Jiang Chen would never consider rushing to build a second space elevator with a monopolistic position.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave a clear position to this space elevator. Port Marchenas purpose was a space port and space industrial base. The design would not consider any living and entertainment space for residents, unlike Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Only one space city was necessary, and only one Celestial City was necessary</br>
</br>
At night, the lights in the office were on.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat at the table as he video-called Sun Jiao. After Lin Lins upgrade, the real-time transmission speed of the interdimensional communication chip in his watch was now strong enough to support a holographic phone with a large data volume.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lines and light particles outlined Sun Jiaos figure by the table, it was almost exactly like a real person. Although Jiang Chen could travel to the apocalypse to meet with Sun Jiao at any time, in order to test the performance of the interdimensional communication chip upgraded by Lin Lin, the two of them chose the holographic call.</br>
</br>
How are you over there? Jiang Chen looked at the holographic image that looked too real as he gently fiddled with the strands of hair sticking to her cheeks. A layer of digital ripples appeared on the holographic image, and his finger passed through the fluttering hair and stopped beside the beautiful face.</br>
</br>
Everything is good, good to the point where it is a bit boring When will you come back? Sun Jiao said softly as she put her hands around the virtual hands and stared at him with her pristine eyes, Yao Yao and Lin Lin, and Xiaorou, they all miss you very much.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen chuckled and said in a joking tone, Actually, you miss me, right?</br>
</br>
Is it not okay?</br>
</br>
Sun Jiaos beautiful eyebrows raised and she did not speak. However, her eyes full of vitality had already expressed all the words she wanted to say vividly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen fixated his gaze on those charming eyes and smiled. After he thought for a moment, he replied softly.</br>
</br>
At the end of the month at the latest. I still have one thing to deal with. Once I finish that, I will probably be back for a while.</br>
</br>
After he resolved Colombias war, Celestial Trade had opened up in South America. As the Yoto Olympics came to an end, the issue of UA troops stationed in Nippon was smoothly solved. The only two things left in his hands were the first Xin International Defense Exhibition in the middle of this month, and the finale of this years UA election.</br>
</br>
There was not much more to do for the UA election as he had done everything he could. Before that day finished, he could only wait.</br>
</br>
As for the upcoming international defense exhibition, as the president of Future Group, he naturally had to make an appearance. After all, Future Military was center stage for this defense exhibition. The entire world would be watching this long-established arms giant, and see what kind of eye-catching war machine it would put on display.</br>
</br>
After the end of the international defense exhibition, he would have nothing to do for at least two months. He would not able to formulate strategies against the UA for the next four years before the election in mid-December.</br>
</br>
Then Ill wait for you to come back. Sun Jiao smiled, her eyes showed a provocative look, Last time you and Xiaorou worked together, I still remember that.</br>
</br>
Haha, now that you told me, what if Im afraid to go back? Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Then Ill go and find you! Lin Lins research has almost succeeded. Sun Jiao raised her hands and curled her fingers fiercely. I cant promise you what strange things will happen then</br>
</br>
Really?! Jiang Chen took a second to process this before he stood up in happiness. With both of his hands pressed against the table, he stared at Sun Jiao, I mean, Lin Lins research finally succeeded?</br>
</br>
Uh, dont get too excited, its still coming along. It seems that the technology of collecting and storing antimatter has made a breakthrough. By the way, dont tell her I told her Sun Jiao looked back behind her and then said quickly, She doesnt let me tell you, saying that she is going to give you a surprise.</br>
</br>
So its soon again, Jiang Chen rolled his eyes and sighed as he sat back on the chair, Ive been hearing this since last year, cant you give me a more specific date?</br>
</br>
If there are new developments, I will tell you. Sun Jiaos eyes flashed as she saw Jiang Chens disappointment, then she smiled, Dont forget, you promised me. By the way, dont tell me you forgot already?</br>
</br>
How is that possible? Jiang Chen laughed, glanced at the clock on the wall, and said, Its getting late, go to bed early.</br>
</br>
Good night!</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1365: Nuclear Warheads and Toys</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The apocalypse, North America.</br>
</br>
A nuclear warhead was found in a rusty cargo ship in an abandoned port ten kilometers from the colony.</br>
</br>
It was already late at night when this news went through countless layers of reports before it finally reached the ears of the executives in the North American colony.</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping was in bed enjoying the meticulous service of two big, blond and blue-eyed exotic girls. When he received the call, he was shocked.</br>
</br>
Without much concern for the properness of his attire, he grabbed a blanket and covered himself. He then pushed aside the blonde girl that was kneeling in front of him and rolled over down the bed. He walked to the window, clicked on the holographic screen, and quickly pressed a few numbers. The phone quickly connected to the frontline and he then lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
Nuclear warhead? What nuclear warhead? Whats the matter, didnt I ask you to collect mud crab roe? Why why did you find a nuclear warhead?</br>
</br>
When we were clearing the nest of the crabs, we found a container suspected of storing nuclear materials in the corner of the cabin. After we opened the container, we found these things inside.</br>
</br>
After the progress bar finished loading, Zhou Guopings eyebrows twisted together as he examined the photo transferred to his EP.</br>
</br>
Most of the cylindrical object in the photo was covered by seaweed and based on the shape, it did look like combat components that could be mounted on a missile. Based on the yellow radioactive symbol, excluding the nuclear fusion core that did not obviously look like this, the only possibility left with a high probability was a nuclear warhead.</br>
</br>
If this is a nuclear warheadhiss After he took a deep breath, Zhou Guoping asked immediately, Can you confirm the model number?</br>
</br>
We have insufficient intelligence. It is currently impossible to confirm the nuclear warhead model, Han Peng, the NAC officer in charge, replied. He looked at the nuclear warhead placed in the center of the cabin and frowned. The seaweed covering the surface of the warhead was extremely corrosive and has caused leakage of nuclear fuel. Since we cannot confirm the warhead model and the safety of the warhead, we are afraid to disassemble the warhead</br>
</br>
After Zhuo Guoping listened to the report, he was completely lost as to what to do next.</br>
</br>
He was not a technologist, other than the fact that he knew fusion and fission happened. Therefore, he definitely had no understanding of nuclear warheads.</br>
</br>
And as far as he knew, in order to enrich their nuclear weapons arsenal, the three major powers before World War III had produced a wide variety of nuclear weapons. Not only did they detonate in strange ways, but they were also used for various purposes. Some were dedicated to personnel, some were used against armored targets, some warheads were used to create permanent no-mans land, and some were designed to eliminate all personnel without damaging the land</br>
</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping rubbed his tense brows, sorted out his thoughts, and asked.</br>
</br>
What ship did you guys get on? And which port are you at? Can you identify it?</br>
</br>
The radioactive material was discovered by a civilian cargo ship. The unit belonged to a North American shipping route. The port was likely also a civilian port. Han Peng looked at the nuclear warhead on the ground and reported to Zhou Guoping, We checked other containers, except for the ones at the end of the cabin. The rest are toys.</br>
</br>
Wait, you said there are still other containers carrying nuclear warheads? Zhuo Guoping suddenly noticed the keywords and he hurriedly followed up, How many are there?</br>
</br>
Twenty. Han Peng answered truthfully.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guopings breathing instantly shortened.</br>
</br>
Twenty strategic nuclear warheads!</br>
</br>
Why does he need to raise Mud Crabs as a side-hustle? He could just pull these nuclear warheads back to the Sixth Street. Regardless if these warheads work or not, they will surely be sold at a good price!</br>
</br>
NACs nuclear weapons reserves had always been low (because of the cumbersomeness to explain, the difficulty of transportation, and the existence of crystals as a substitute, Jiang Chen had hardly sent nuclear fuel to the apocalypse). Even though nuclear bombs in the warehouse could flatten a few street blocks, eliminate a dozen tanks, but NAC still relied on tanks and airships to deter other survival forces.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that if he sold the twenty pre-war nuclear warheads he discovered to the logistics department, he could easily exchange them for two million credit points and could even be considered an honor.</br>
</br>
However, what really made his breath shorten was not these twenty nuclear warheads, but the words Han Peng spoke of after-</br>
</br>
These containers with nuclear warheads were shipped with containers full of toys!</br>
</br>
What was the reason that these civilian cargo-carrying toys also secretly transported twenty strategic nuclear warheads?</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping could conclude that these nuclear warheads were placed on the ship because of NATO officials, otherwise, any inspection could detain these weapons without any chance of being loaded onto the ship.</br>
</br>
Since he could infer that NATO officials hid the nuclear warheads on the ship, then he had to answer the next question. If this ship did not encounter any accidents, where was its destination? Why was it stranded at this port outside Los Angeles for so many years?</br>
</br>
The intuition of many years of intelligence work told Zhou Guoping that these nuclear warheads were not important anymore.</br>
</br>
The important piece of information was this ship!</br>
</br>
As long as he could determine the destination of this ship that shouldnt have been stranded here in the first place, he could follow the leads, and then eventually find the ultimate treasure!</br>
</br>
NATO secret nuclear arsenal</br>
</br>
An obscure treasure map had just been slowly unfolded in front of him.</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping licked the corner of his mouth, in excitement. He felt his heart was pumping violently.</br>
</br>
His hunch told him that it was going to be something big</br>
</br>
The first Xin International Defense Exhibition would be held on September 15th in the Heart of the Sea in Coro City.</br>
</br>
As the first international defense exhibition held by Xin, the invited participants were either members of the Earth Defense Alliance or countries that expressed their intention of joining the alliance. The purpose of this defense exhibition was also obvious. In addition to strengthening military cooperation between member states, it was also looking for overseas buyers for the growing military giant, Future Military.</br>
</br>
The export of weapons was one of the ways to export values and influences. The significance of a missile was not only to deter a country but also to firmly bind the interests of two countries.</br>
</br>
Among the fifty countries invited, all without exception stated that they would send senior officials to attend. Although everyone was aware that the most coveted EMP weapon and optically invisible kinetic skeleton were not likely for sale, they were still willing to come and try their luck.</br>
</br>
Future Militarys weapons would certainly not be shabby, no one doubted this point!</br>
</br>
In addition to Future Military, the darling in the eyes of compradors and military analysts, there were also 780 companies registered to appear in this defense exhibition. Among them, there were many international military industry giants such as Huas Aviation Science Group, Russias Almaz-Antey, Italys Leonardo, Dutchs Airbus. These companies also took advantage of this opportunity to demonstrate their masterpieces.</br>
</br>
As for the top UA military industry giants in the world, because they did not receive an invitation from Xin, they, unfortunately, could not attend this defense exhibition. However, their absence did not affect the quality of the defense exhibition. Under the close watch of the world, the first Xin International Defense Exhibition finally kicked off</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Coro International Airport.</br>
</br>
A jet-black aerospace plane dragged along a blue flaming tail as it landed steadily on the airport runway. The hatch opened and the escalator dropped down, Prince Yerif in a white robe walked out and opened his arms with a giant smile.</br>
</br>
Haha, dear Jiang Chen, your plane is amazing! I have never experienced such a quick trip! It only took an hour to get from Mecca to Coro City. I almost thought my pilot read the navigator wrong In short, its unbelievable, I have never seen such a powerful aircraft!</br>
</br>
Yerif was amazed and bewildered.</br>
</br>
It was not only because he himself was an avid collector of private jets, but also because he was convinced that, his father, who also shared the same passion, would be genuinely amazed by this birthday gift.</br>
</br>
Long-distance travel can better reflect the speed of the G100. If you fly from Mecca to North America, I assure you will be more amazed. Jiang Chen smiled and hugged him, took a step back, then said, Welcome to Coro City.</br>
</br>
From Mecca to Coro City, the G100 likely ascended to the mesosphere, but if the destination was from Mecca to North America on the opposite side of the Earth, the aerospace plane would travel through low-Earth orbit and use the Earths rotation to reduce travel time to the extreme.</br>
</br>
Based on the field test data of Future Heavy Industries, the time from Coro City International Airport to Washington International Airport was also one hour. One of the selling points of the G100 was its ability to reach any place in the world within an hour.</br>
</br>
I will definitely try it! Yerif laughed.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the airport, a white Airbus with the Russian tricolor flag and the Almaz-Antey Group logo also landed on the airport runway. The escalator was attached to the plane, and a group of Russians, all dressed in black suits, stepped down.</br>
</br>
When they saw the black G100 parked at the other end of the airport. The Slavic man surrounded by black suits tilted his head slightly, pointed to the plane, and whispered to his assistant next to him, who was carrying a briefcase.</br>
</br>
How much is that plane?</br>
</br>
The assistant hesitated for a second, then answered immediately.</br>
</br>
Ill ask.</br>
</br>
The Slavic man nodded, glanced at another private plane that was landing, and walked towards the special tunnel of the airport.</br>
</br>
Almaz-Antey was definitely a renowned name in Russia. Its predecessor was the Russian NPO Almaz and the Antey Corporation. After the merger in 2002, it became one of the top arms giants in Russia and the world. The S-300 and S-400 air defense missile systems were the pride of the company.</br>
</br>
What was the origin of the two companies before the merger? Almaz was known as NPO Almaz, which could be traced back to the First Special Design Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Weapons and was established by Stalin himself. The second was Antey, which was also an industrial giant from the Soviet era.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the 1990 privatization era, a large number of economic oligarchs became rich overnight in Russia. In the decades to come, as the regime changed, some old oligarchs went to jail, and new oligarchs appeared. Only one person passed through the most difficult two decades for oligarchs in a rather low-key manner. He played the role of an arms giant and hid his identity as an oligarch to the end.</br>
</br>
Chemezov. Chemezov shook Jiang Chens right hand and made a concise self-introduction, then nodded slightly to express his friendship to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen. While Jiang Chen shook his hand, Jiang Chen also nodded and examined Mr. Chemezov.</br>
</br>
As in the rumors, Mr. Chemezov didnt speak much, and his actions were quite low-key. However, his sharp pupils also revealed his dogmatic actions. His sturdy physique did not give away the fact that he was already over fifty years old. Especially since his 1.80 meters height and defined attributes resembled more of a soldier than an oligarch.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not chat with Chemezov for a long time, after a brief greeting, the Slavic man walked to the entrance of the special tunnel to enter his convoy. Jiang Chen also looked to the South Colombia Drug Lord, or rather, President, who was walking towards him with a warm smile.</br>
</br>
Unexpectedly, the man who disturbed the calmness in South America and topped the CIB assassination list would actually come to this event in person. However, Jiang Chen only thought for a moment before he understood his intention. First of all, Xin was much safer compared to South Colombia, otherwise, Jiang Chen would not be able to live until now.</br>
</br>
Behind Timochenko, the president of Hua Aviation Technology Group and representatives from the Hua military were there, and followed by Natashas fathers old subordinates that represented the Russian military. Half of the worlds top 30 military arms giants were here, which showcased the status of this defense exhibition.</br>
</br>
In the morning, representatives of different countries arrived one after another, and the defense exhibition officially started at two in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
The defense exhibition would last for a week, and a total of two thousand weapons would be showcased. From automatic rifle accessories to anti-aircraft missiles and even space weapons, the major military industry giants also did their best to use the hype built up. While they did not expect to win the limelight of Future Military, it was a great choice to win the attention of international buyers as the second-best choice.</br>
</br>
In particular, the military-industrial enterprises from Hua and Russia started to hint at the Africa and South America representatives, who felt insecure, from the start of the very start of the exhibition. It was not until the lights were lit on the rostrum in front of the exhibition hall did the guests stop whispering and chatting and focused their attention on the person on the stage.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked to the rostrum and adjusted the microphone.</br>
</br>
Hello everyone, Im Jiang Chen. In the concise opening remarks, Jiang Chen nodded slightly at the camera lenses pointed at him, then glanced around at his invited guests. With a smile, he continued, First of all, on behalf of the organizer, I welcome everyone who can take time out of their busy schedule to attend our defense exhibition in Coro City.</br>
</br>
The reporters had set up their cameras early as they waited for Jiang Chens speech.</br>
</br>
Chemezov leaned back against the chair and put one leg over his knee. Then, he gestured to his assistant, who had his pen and paper ready, and pointed at Jiang Chen in the front.</br>
</br>
Write down every word he says for me.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded earnestly, and the ballpoint pen in his hand was already on the notebook.</br>
</br>
Not just Russians, the moment Jiang Chen stood on the rostrum, he immediately became the focal point of the entire exhibition hall. Everyone was waiting for, his next statement.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1367"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1367: Technology Change The War!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The theme of this exhibition is technology.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lifted his hand and gently swiped it in front of him.</br>
</br>
As soon as his fingertips slid across the air, a layer of ripples formed and cascaded outwards, and digital blocks emerged one after another. Among everyones astonished look, it formed into a solider in kinetic skeleton and a drone with a muzzle.</br>
</br>
With the advancement of science and technology and the innovation of military technology, there is no doubt that humans participation in wars will become less and less.</br>
</br>
Future Group is built on science and technology with a focus on the future. It is committed to using the power of science and technology to serve the production and life of all humankind and lead the world in a perfect direction.</br>
</br>
As a responsible company, I believe that our technology will completely change the way wars are conducted in the not-too-distant future, using machinery to replace flesh and blood to prevent meaningless deaths and to decide the outcome of the war in a more efficient manner.</br>
</br>
Next, I will demonstrate the concept I proposed earlier for you through holographic simulation.</br>
</br>
At the moment Jiang Chen finished the sentence, the holographic image floating in front of Jiang Chen changed.</br>
</br>
A number of tall buildings appeared through the digital blocks and then spread out from the rostrum. Nine soldiers in urban camouflage appeared on the street. From the equipment, the team should be based on a UA Army squad combat unit, including a staff sergeant and two teams. Each team had a noncommissioned officer, a rifleman, a grenade launch solider, and an M249 machine gunner.</br>
</br>
Shocked by this realistic holographic projection, the sights of almost all the guests present were glued to the holographic image in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When Chemezov saw the realistic holographic images of the nine soldiers, he had a look of realization.</br>
</br>
He is preparing to simulate city battles!</br>
</br>
The next images seemed to confirm his guess, the stateless soldier who appeared first quickly encountered the same stateless imaginary enemy. With the cooperation of the drone, the soldier wearing the kinetic skeleton was at an extreme firepower disadvantage, but with the drones excellent reconnaissance capability and the firepower supplemented by the self-aiming rifle below, he successfully launched a flank attach and killed two machine gunners of the imaginary enemy force.</br>
</br>
The audience was shocked as they made loud gasping sounds. It was obvious that they were not optimistic about the soldier in kinetic skeleton at first. It had nothing to do with the lack of trust of Future Militarys technology, but the sheer number discrepancy between the two sides. In the absence of off-field fire support, they really couldnt think of any possibility where the soldier would have an advantage.</br>
</br>
But soon, their expressions became quite interesting.</br>
</br>
</br>
Someone even exclaimed loudly when the sixth imaginary enemy soldier fell.</br>
</br>
Its impossible the soldier just jumped to the third floor; is he still human?</br>
</br>
Its the kinetic skeleton! The mobility of the kinetic skeleton!</br>
</br>
This drone is definitely a nightmare for all infantry. For soldiers, its size is too small, and its speed just makes people feel despair. Its almost impossible to hit outside of 30 meters. They can only be suppressed by the self-aiming rifle</br>
</br>
Scythe drone, as the foreign military version of the Hummingbird drone, replaced the vortex engine on the bottom into four pairs of outwardly extending rotors. While sacrificing limited maneuverability, the ammunition carrying capacity and muzzle caliber were increased, as well as the shooting fault tolerance rate of the self-aiming rifle below, which greatly reduced the drones dependence on smart terminals. But it was precisely because this that made its combat effectiveness significantly lower compared to the highly intelligent Hummingbird drone, and even more incomparable with the attack drone Viper that placed emphasis on firepower.</br>
</br>
But even so, as a foreign military sales model, the excellent performance of the Scythe drone was enough to impress all the countries present.</br>
</br>
As the last soldier fell, the holographic image changed again. This time the Scythe drones were showcased independently, with more than fifty Scythes in the air, they formed into a dense attack group of drones.</br>
</br>
The imaginary enemy they faced this time was a whole company of semi-mechanized infantry.</br>
</br>
The intensive firepower caused a lot of casualties to the drones. From time to time, destroyed drones crashed down, but the loss of drones failed to prevent the drone attack group from advancing.</br>
</br>
With the storm-like bullets, the dense drones swarmed through the battlefield, just like locusts that raged through farms. They shredded everything in their path into pieces. Especially when the drones were directly above the infantry, all bunkers lost their purpose as the bullets hailing down from above were inevitable.</br>
</br>
With gleam in their eyes, the officers from Hua and Russia in the audience almost made the same decision simultaneously. They spoke a few words to their assistant and demanded they purchase Scythe drones at all cost.</br>
</br>
The changing digital blocks in the air dissipated and left the guests still reminiscing on what they just witnessed.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen looked at their guests with different thoughts and emotions, he smiled and said.</br>
</br>
When the soldiers themselves are of the same combat effectiveness, the soldier equipped with the drone and kinetic skeleton will have a combat effectiveness comparable to that of a nine-man combat squad in city encounters. He paused for a moment before he continued. Of course, our scope for drones is not just a supplement to firepower, but also a soldiers second eye. As you saw earlier, even if the drone formed an independent attack group, the actual combat shown by Scythe drones is still astounding.</br>
</br>
As the focus of Future Militarys foreign military sales, we welcome any interested country or private armed forces to come and place orders.</br>
</br>
In addition to the previously shown Scythe drone, a total of 21 weapons designed by Future Military will be exhibited in this defense exhibition. I believe they will not disappoint you either</br>
</br>
The opening remarks finally ended.</br>
</br>
Not many people paid attention to what Jiang Chen said after.</br>
</br>
Because all of their attention had been completely immersed in the Scythe drone.</br>
</br>
Especially the Russians. They knew from experience how reliable Future Groups drones were.</br>
</br>
A long time ago, Future Heavy Industries had sold drone logistics systems to the Russian military. Those drones that ignored terrain greatly improved the logistics supply capabilities of frontline combat troops. With the assistance of AI, those little guys could accurately deliver ammunition to the soldiers in need.</br>
</br>
Now, these little guys had changed  they had self-aiming rifles attached. They could not only detect and report, but they could also lock and shoot, which was everything a light infantry could ask for! They could not find any reason not to buy.</br>
</br>
Everyone was thinking about how to get ahead of others and win the contract with Future Military</br>
</br>
Not just Scythe drone.</br>
</br>
A total of 21 pieces of equipment from Future Military were exhibited on the first day of the defense exhibition. Without exception, all of them became the darling of all countries. Including the arms sale version S1 exoskeleton that appeared on the holographic image, and the downgrade version of the Reaper assault rifle in the hands of the soldier.</br>
</br>
At the end of the defense exhibitions first day, Future Military had signed military sales contracts worth more than 20 billion Xin New Dollars with more than forty countries. Compared with Future Militarys high-tech weapons, all the other military industry enterprises had almost become a foil.</br>
</br>
The first day of the defense exhibition focused on smaller light weapons, which was Future Militarys home field advantage. For most military industry giants, the sale of a complete set of air defense systems, ballistic missiles, and fighter jets was the bulk of the money, and that was where they fought.</br>
</br>
However, the 20-billion-dollar worth of contracts still made them envious and jealous.</br>
</br>
No one imagined that these little guys could make so much money.</br>
</br>
As competitors, it did not feel great to just witness Future Military take away such a large piece of pie</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After the first day of the exhibition, two European-looking men, surrounded by a group of black suits, walked towards the presidential suite on the top floor of the Heart of the Sea.</br>
</br>
The one thing Im the most satisfied with at the Heart of the Sea is the presidential suite of the five-star hotel on the top floor. The slightly older Italian, in a blue suit, chatted with the slightly younger European beside him as they walked forward, I bet it has the most wonderful viewing location in Coro City. You have the entire view of Coro City and can overlook the entire Heart of the Sea. If it were not for the fact that Future Tourism has no intention of selling it, I really want to purchase it and add it to my collection list. In my view, it is not a building, but a work of art.</br>
</br>
The Italian was Matteo Montorio, and he was the president of Leonardo in Italy. Although Italy had been traditionally known as the bad teammate in alliances, Leonardo was an exception to the rule.</br>
</br>
The total output value of Leonardo accounted for 70% of the total output value of the Italian defense industry. It directly or indirectly controlled 121 companies while it also owned non-controlling stakes in 128 companies. Not only was it a world leader in aerospace, defense, and security and one of the top ten companies in the world, it also ranked second in Europe, behind the British BAE Systems known to be the ruler of the land, air, and ocean. Even outside the military industry, it was still considered a behemoth.</br>
</br>
As for the young European, his name was Nicola. Compared to Matteo, he was a nobody. However, he represented the Italian military, so he could walk side-by-side with Matteo here.</br>
</br>
Nicola forced a smile as he listened to Matteos view on the Heart of the Sea. While he was also an Italian, he obviously did not possess the slightest artistic touch, so he could not get into the conversation with Matteo, who had been nurtured by upper-class teachings. Also, his mind was completely out of this.</br>
</br>
He had started to wonder from the moment Matteos assistant placed the 5 billion Xin New Dollars worth of order into the briefcase.</br>
</br>
Scythe droneWhy would he sell these drones to us so generously? We are NATOs long-term partners. I dont believe Jiang Chen did not see this point. He has Ghost Agents in his hand. Nicola seized the opportunity to ask the question that had been bothering him after Matteo finished his comments on the Heart of the Sea.</br>
</br>
Matteo was not surprised by Nicolas question. The old gentleman from Italy just smiled and answered his confusion politely.</br>
</br>
This is easy to understand because they sold us the downgraded version. Even if these weapons are taken by NATO and used on them in turn, they would not feel too much pressure. This is their confidence.</br>
</br>
Then why</br>
</br>
Then why do we have to pay for their weapons, Matteo turned his head to look at Nicola, then smiled. This is what you want to ask, right?</br>
</br>
</br>
Nicola swallowed down and nodded with difficulty.</br>
</br>
On behalf of the Italian army, he purchased 2,000 Scythe-type drones, 2,000 military sale version S1 kinetic skeletons, and matching S1 assault rifles matching from Future Military. As for the reason, it was very simple. The holographic image was truly astounding, and he couldnt find a reason not to pay.</br>
</br>
But now Matteo told him that he bought some defective products that were downgraded, which made this fact somewhat difficult to accept. After all, he signed on those orders, and he would have to be responsible for them if anything happened.</br>
</br>
If you cant find a reason, I can find a reason for you. Matteo smiled. Although Future Military completely took the spotlight on the first day, he was not bothered in the slightest, he calmly said, In order to learn about their advantages, we must take their weapons home to study. Remember, Im not paying for their arms, but for our backwardness.</br>
</br>
Matteos statement made Nicola feel slightly better, but he still felt somewhat uncomfortable when he heard the harsh word backwardness.</br>
</br>
Actually, you dont have to be too depressed, Matteo patted Nicola on the shoulder. As if he had read Nicolas thoughts, he laughed, The drone is not part of our home court, the fighter jets and engines are our advantages. Take a good look, we will not officially start our performance until the third day.</br>
</br>
Nicola processed this information.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a rumor surfaced in his mind.</br>
</br>
Shocked by the thought, Nicola looked at Matteo with disbelief in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Do you meanIs it!</br>
</br>
Looking at your expression, you probably guessed it, but my answer is yes.</br>
</br>
After Matteo concluded on this sentence, he walked towards the end of the corridor with a smile on his face.</br>
</br>
On the other side, Chemezov, who had left the exhibition, got into the car waiting for him.</br>
</br>
Although the organizer arranged a room for him, he did not choose to stay at the Heart of the Sea. Instead, he booked a room at a five-star hotel not far away. Another Slavic man followed him into the car and sat next to him.</br>
</br>
What did you think of todays exhibition?</br>
</br>
When Chemezov heard the question, he grinned and asked rhetorically.</br>
</br>
He is the son-in-law of your old boss; cant you see it more clearly than me?</br>
</br>
Dont give me this nonsense, I want to know your opinion, Zanaev said with a serious expression.</br>
</br>
The corner of Chemezovs mouth curled up slightly, then he said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
This defense exhibition has become a show just for Future Military, and it is likely to be the same in the next few days.</br>
</br>
As expected? Zanaev raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Of course. With one leg over his other knee, Chemezov took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and gestured to the driver in the front row to indicate that he could drive.</br>
</br>
What do you think their purpose is? Zanaev asked.</br>
</br>
I noticed that the list of exhibitors includes Netherlandss Airbus and Italys Leonardo. The strength of these two military enterprises can basically represent the top products of European military enterprises, especially in the aerospace field. Chemezov tapped his cigarette into the ashtray, then continued, They are probably intending to use this opportunity to pressure NATO countries. We are just watching the show, and there is no need for us to be the center of attention.</br>
</br>
Just watch the show? We all expect you to sell a few more S400s, Zanaev said. This years economic situation is not optimistic. We need foreign exchange, and we need it desperately.</br>
</br>
Dont worry, Chemezov grinned, and a glimpse of shrewdness appeared in his eyes before it quickly faded away. There is a high probability that Future Military will not target air defense missiles. Their starting point is too high, and they likely havent figured out how to downgrade their technology.</br>
</br>
Chemezov paused for a second and then said.</br>
</br>
And the most important thing is that I have a hunch that Leonardo will compete with Future Military in their home court, in aerospace.</br>
</br>
Do you think they might win? Zanaev questioned.</br>
</br>
I dont know, but I know that no matter who wins, our air defense missiles will sell very well.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
While the exhibition continued, many media broadcasted the defense exhibition live, but because the defense exhibition did not gain a following outside of the military circle, it did not create a widespread sensation compared with Future Groups product releases.</br>
</br>
However, on the evening of the same day, Future Group uploaded a video of the exhibition and thus gave the news a headline through Future 1.0. In addition, a link to a video was attached. This move immediately attracted the attention of the world.</br>
</br>
The clueless netizens once again experienced the superior technical capability of Future Military.</br>
</br>
My God, is this still war?</br>
</br>
I originally planned to join the army, but now I have changed my mind and I am considering immigration.</br>
</br>
I quite agree with the views put forward by President Jiang! Future wars will be the collision of steel, and the participation of humans will only decrease!</br>
</br>
Drone attack group! I have to say the technology of Future Group has truly amazed me. This is what I imagine future war to look like. Using steel instead of flesh and blood to resolve all disputes Although this is probably just a wishful dream.</br>
</br>
Drone plus kinetic skeleton is equal to an infantry squad? An attack group composed of a hundred drones can easily crush a company-level combat force? This is certainly impossible. My cousin is a senior military fan, let me analyze how Future Military is overplaying the drones strength</br>
</br>
The video published on the official website of Future Group created a lot of heated discussions from around the world, but it didnt interfere with the ongoing defense exhibition.</br>
</br>
On the second day of the exhibition, Future Military reached a military sales agreement with Hua and Russia for 200 Crocodile amphibious assault vehicles at a unit price of 7 million Xin New Dollars. The South Colombia and Syrian government forces purchased four hundred and one thousand Dart-1 tactical missiles respectively.</br>
</br>
Future Military positioned Dart-1 as a short-range fast attack missile, similar to the Tomahawk missile, but with a range of only 1,000 kilometers. The advantage of Dart-1 was its small size, flexibility in deployment, and shocking power. It could also be deployed by the Scythe drone instead of infantry and achieve an accuracy as high as 0.1 meters while being difficult to detect.</br>
</br>
Of course, there was one crucial point.</br>
</br>
It was cheap.</br>
</br>
The price of 400,000 Xin New Dollar was less than half of the Tomahawk missile. Even for the poor third world countries, they could still afford them. Compared to other fabled weapons, the cost-effective small missile was the better alternative.</br>
</br>
Time soon reached the third day.</br>
</br>
The third day of the defense exhibition was not held at the Heart of the Sea but at a temporary airport two kilometers away.</br>
</br>
In order to ensure the normal progress of the defense exhibition, Celestial Trade sent a battalion of Marines to isolate the entire temporary airport. Representatives of different countries and high-level officials from major arms companies arrived one after another to kick off the third day of the exhibition.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was a special session of the Air Force.</br>
</br>
Matteo walked in front of the closed hangar, looked up at the large Leonardo group logo printed on the door, and laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
My dear Mr. Nicola, come and see our masterpiece.</br>
</br>
He gestured to the assistants next to him.</br>
</br>
Two people quickly stepped forward and opened the door of the hangar.</br>
</br>
The moment the hangar opened, a silver-white fighter with its wings and body built as one appeared in front of everyone.</br>
</br>
Nicolas eyes widened in disbelief. He finally understood where Mr. Matteo gained his confidence.</br>
</br>
He once saw a picture of a fighter plane in a top-secret file, if he recalled correctly, its name should be Uragano.</br>
</br>
Unlike the Hawker Hurricane that the British created in World War II, Uragano was given more meaning in Italian, and the  Uragano fighter designed by Leonardo was also given more historical significance.</br>
</br>
After the Second Moro-Country F War ended, the result of the dog fight between F35 and Aurora-20 over City M stunned everyone. The unscientific loss exchange ratio made the UA doubt itself for the first time. Then, led by the UA, NATO countries introduced new research and development plans to find a fighter that can regain air supremacy from the Aurora-20.</br>
</br>
Leonardo was one of the European military industry groups entrusted with this important task.</br>
</br>
After repeatedly studying the F35 and Aurora-20 cases in the Second Moro-Country F War, they finally made a rather bold decision, that was, to devote all the research and development funds to the sixth-generation fighter and completely abandon the fifth-generation fighter market.</br>
</br>
Only the sixth-generation fighter could counter the Aurora-20!</br>
</br>
As a manned fighter jet, the qualities displayed by the Aurora-20 were the pinnacles of the fifth-generation fighter. Even if it was difficult to accept this reality, Matteo and the other senior officials of Leonardo clearly understood this.</br>
</br>
The sixth-generation fighter usually referred to a hypersonic fighter controlled by artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
Compared to the fifth-generation fighter, the sixth-generation fighter possessed the flexibility of the sixth-generation aero engine and the design of full-wing fusion, so that the maneuverability and stealth of the aircraft at different altitudes and flight styles had been drastically balanced. In particular, the unmanned design enabled the sixth-generation fighter to complete maneuvers that would otherwise be impossible for manned fighters. This was due to the fact that there was a limit to the maximum acceleration a pilot could withstand, but this limit would not exist for the sixth-generation aircraft.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, they managed to lead the world in the sixth-generation fighter market.</br>
</br>
Any fighter would be eclipsed by the Uragano with a cruising speed of up to Mach 5. It was where Matteos confidence stemmed from.</br>
</br>
but why are we showcasing it? Nicola swallowed down the dry lump in his throat as he was somewhat bewildered, Are you going to sell this to another country?</br>
</br>
Of course not. Matteo raised his eyebrows confidently and looked provocatively at Future Militarys hangar on the other side of the runway, where the gates were closed shut. But if we dont warn someone about their inappropriate arrogance, there is a good chance he will do something stupid.</br>
</br>
But</br>
</br>
When Nicola still wanted to say something but seemed hesitant, Matteo patted him on the shoulder and laughed loudly, Dont worry, I wont be able to bring this fighter over to the exhibition without NATOs permission. In addition, this is a deterrent to Celestial Trade, but it is also an advertisement for our Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon. As a businessman, in addition to fulfilling political obligations, making money is my utmost intention. I believe that after they see the excellent performance of our sixth-generation fighter, our Indian brothers over there and the rich lords of the Middle East would definitely pay for our fighters.</br>
</br>
Nicola always felt that the chairman of Leonardo was a bit too confident, but when he recalled the description of this sixth-generation machine in that document, he also no longer felt tense.</br>
</br>
Matteo patted Nicola on the shoulder. The wrinkles in the corner of his eyes seemed to bloom as he looked at the Uragano in the hangar; his grin was full of joy.</br>
</br>
You can look forward to the many orders our Uragano will bring us.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Next to the airport runway, a Slavic man and a black man stood together.</br>
</br>
In any other place in the world, it was definitely a weird combination, but here it was completely normal. At least half of the buyers attending the Xin International Defense Exhibition were dictators from third world countries, and most of these dictators skin color was black.</br>
</br>
These people hold most of the banknotes or IOUs in their hands, and they were never stingy with weapons. Since the exhibition began, they had searched for powerful sellers and paid for more convenient killing tools.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of arms dealers, they were always the best customers.</br>
</br>
I dont want Mi-25. Since there the Mi-29 is more advanced, why dont I choose Mi-29? Honestly, I prefer Su-35 or T-50. If you dont want to sell to us, I might consider those? The man pointed to the Hua sellers, who stood not far away, that were looking in their direction. He looked at Chemezov and continued, They are willing to sell their Xiaolong to us and Im very pleased with this name. And each one only sells for 20 million dollars, and the person also told me that if we are willing to introduce their high-speed rail, he can take the initiative to let their bank give us a loan.</br>
</br>
Chemezov cursed in his heart. These people worked well together.</br>
</br>
Its fine if you just sold fighters, but now you bring the people that build rails and the people who own banks into the conversation? How do I play this game? However, it is the way to do business. Even as Earth Defense Alliance allies, each country must depend on their own ability to win the hundreds of millions of dollars order.</br>
</br>
Chemezov calmed his emotions, coughed slightly, then he patiently persuaded the dictator from Africa to change his mind.</br>
</br>
Your opponents are rebels and terrorists armed with AK. They are not from the UA nor from Russia. What is the point of buying the Su-35? Put it in the hangar as a mascot? You want to buy T-50s? Even if I sell it to you, who can pilot it in your country? Our MiG-25 is cheaper than their Xiaolong, and the ground-attack ability is not inferior by any means! If you are willing to buy ten MiG-25s, I can make the decision and sell you some T-64 tanks.</br>
</br>
It was the most Chemezov could promise. If he recalled correctly, there were dozens of T-64s waiting to be delisted in the warehouse of the 58th Army. Although he preferred to sell air defense missiles, these poor African countries were obviously unable to pay for his air defense missiles</br>
</br>
Maybe it was because Chemezovs words made sense. The man touched his chin for a while, then reluctantly nodded.</br>
</br>
Just as Chemezov negotiated with the African about the price of Mi-25s, which were collecting dust in the hangers, should be sold at, there was a sudden commotion nearby. Chemezov stopped talking with the warlord and looked over to the crowd on the other end of the runway.</br>
</br>
When the plane appeared on the runway, Chemezovs pupils suddenly constricted.</br>
</br>
</br>
As the chairman of Almaz-Antey, he was aware of some intelligence floating around. For example, the silver-white fighter with one wing wing-fusion fighter that he had read in a report compiled by the KGB.</br>
</br>
If he remembered correctly.</br>
</br>
Its name should be Uragano</br>
</br>
Its name is Uragano! Matteo stood on the other side of the airport runway, pointed his finger at the fighter that was slowly rolling to a stop in the middle of the runway. It was like he was commenting on a perfect piece of art. He explained to several customers gathered next to him, Its just like its name, and its as fast as a hurricane! It is the crystallization of the technology of Leonardo. A total of 200 companies have participated in its research. You may have noticed that there is no pilot inside. Yes, it is a sixth-generation fighter; the sixth-generation fighter controlled entirely by artificial intelligence!</br>
</br>
Air-to-ground integration, eight short and medium-range air-to-air missiles could be mounted on the bottom of the cabin to intercept enemy flying units, or mount various ground-attack missiles to perform ground support tasks. The cabin had a built-in integrated server, which could automatically identify enemy targets and perform precision strikes, and could also perform tasks under satellite navigation. In the case of missile lock, it could even automatically analyze various factors such as altitude, air velocity, and the distance between enemies. In addition, it could automatically complete evasion maneuvers or release thermal decoys.</br>
</br>
Matteo didnt guess wrong. When the Uragano slowly pulled out of the hangar, it immediately attracted the attention of everyone. Especially when people learned that Leonardo was the first to make a breakthrough on the sixth-generation fighter, almost everyone turned their eyes to the Uragano.</br>
</br>
A sixth-generation fighter?!</br>
</br>
Unbelievable, I didnt expect it to be made by Leonardo Group!</br>
</br>
It it doesnt make sense? Future Groups subsidiary Future Technology is a leader in artificial intelligence. Future Military has inherent advantages in drone technology and artificial intelligence . This is no reason Leonardo should take the lead.</br>
</br>
Maybe they are too confident. After all, the combat performance of the Aurora-20 is the pinnacle of fifth-generation fighter. If I am the president of Future Group, I probably wont invest too much capital in sixth-generation fighter with an uncertain future. From their point of view, it is normal to develop small drones to improve the combat capabilities of Celestial Trades ground forces What a pity.</br>
</br>
Go speak to the representative of Leonardo and ask them if Uragano is for sale. If its for sale, as long as the price is not too outrageous, order me ten. If it is not for sale, see if their other fighters are for sale</br>
</br>
People were chatting and whispering.</br>
</br>
The appearance of the Uragano instantly became the center of attention. All the fifth-generation and fourth-generation fighters were eclipsed by its appearance. The insurmountable gap between the generations brought air combat ahead to a new era, an era without blood, but with gunpowder.</br>
</br>
That is the sixth-generation fighter? When the warlord heard the conversation not far away, he opened, then closed his mouth, turned around to look at Chemezov, and asked in an uncertain tone, Its fine without a pilot?</br>
</br>
It should be yes. Chemezov nodded reluctantly and admitted.</br>
</br>
What generation is the MiG-25? the warlord asked next.</br>
</br>
Third-generation</br>
</br>
The warlord suddenly showed a very angry expression, Mr. Chemezov, I treat you as a friend, but you cheat me with this defective product! I said I only want the best product! Now I want to buy the Uragano. Although I dont understand it, I can still tell that you are selling me rubbish.</br>
</br>
Then you go buy it! Chemezov was so angry that his nose flared. He pointed to the Uragano and could not resist his urge to curse, If you can buy that thing, I will gift you 20 MiG-25s for free. AND Ill write my name backward from now on!</br>
</br>
Bathed in the attention of the crowd, the corner of Matteos mouth raised slightly. He looked at Future Militarys firmly shut hangar, and a hint of mockery and provocation emerged in his eyes.</br>
</br>
He did not think that Future Military could introduce anything more cutting-edge. Even the Aurora-20 standing on the pinnacle of the fifth-generation aircraft would be eclipsed by the Uragano</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1371: We Donâ€œt Export Sixth-Generation Fighter</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When the Uragano debuted, many people quickly recovered from the shock and turned their attention to Future Militarys hangar.</br>
</br>
In everyones subconscious mind, the only other company that could compete with Leonardos sixth-generation fighter was Future Group, renowned for its artificial intelligence technology.</br>
</br>
As early as five years ago, the artificial intelligence Little White of Future Group represented the worlds top artificial intelligence technology. After five years, Future 1.0 had been updated hundreds of times, and its artificial intelligence technology also improved countless times, but even today, no company could catch up to Future Technology from five years ago.</br>
</br>
Today, five years later, the three-level division of artificial intelligence proposed by Jiang Chen, the president of Future Group, became the mainstream standard for artificial intelligence grading. At present, most scientific research institutions in the world had set basic artificial intelligence as the first technical problem to be overcome. The price of Little Whites source code on the dark web had been propped up to 500 million U.S. dollars, but even with the high reward, no hacker had been able to crack the defense of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
In everyones much-anticipated sight, a Luer car arrived late, and Jiang Chen, who got off the car, finally appeared in front of everyone. When he saw the way people looked at him, he was confused for a moment, then a Future Military staff jogged to him and whispered a few words.</br>
</br>
When he saw the silver-white fighter parked on the runway, realization appeared in his eyes. Then he walked to the potential customers waiting in front of Future Militarys hangar.</br>
</br>
Sorry, Im a little bit late.</br>
</br>
He smiled at everyone, cleared his throat, and then spoke.</br>
</br>
First of all, what I want to say is that Future Military will not be exhibiting the sixth-generation fighter. If you want to buy a sixth-generation fighter, I recommend going there to inquire, although I dont guarantee they will give a reasonable offer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that when he said this, the customers gathered around him suddenly lost most of their interest in the plane parked in the hangar, and their attitude even changed.</br>
</br>
It was not surprising. The fifth-generation fighter would never beat the sixth-generation fighter, just like the human brain could never beat the computer. After all, in most peoples cognition, it was the absolute truth.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chens next sentence made everyone think for a second.</br>
</br>
But our pilots can enable any fifth-generation fighter to have combat effectiveness comparable to that of the sixth-generation fighter.</br>
</br>
Pilots? A European customer processed the information, frowned, and asked incomprehensibly, If I remember correctlyToday should be an air show. What does it have to do with pilots? Does Future Military plan to open pilot training classes?</br>
</br>
</br>
The hangar slowly opened, and a robot walked out of Future Militarys hangar.</br>
</br>
The steady steps and motion of the shoulders were no different than the posture of ordinary people. If it werent for the sci-fi design, it would be difficult to associate it with a robot.</br>
</br>
When Chemezov, who was standing on the other side of the runway, saw this robot, his first reaction was that it is a house robot of Future Heavy Industries. His second reaction startled himself, and he muttered in his mind, Fu*k, this cant be</br>
</br>
Matador, Jiang Chen ignored the discussion behind him, then pointed to the robot coming out of the hangar and turned to the customers who gathered nearby, The first-generation electronic pilot developed by Future Military. It can replace conventional pilots to pilot fighters, completing maneuvers that the pilots themselves cannot perform, accurately identifying enemy units, and conducting strikes In short, a fifth-generation fighter plus a Matador is equivalent to a downgraded-version of a sixth-generation fighter.</br>
</br>
WAIT! An electronic pilot?!</br>
</br>
All the customers or potential customers in the audience were in a daze when they saw the 1.8 meters tall robot. Also, they had not recovered from Jiang Chens previous words. Especially the phrase a fifth-generation fighter plus a Matador is equivalent to a downgraded-version of a sixth-generation fighter. All the words turned them dizzy.</br>
</br>
The common sense they gained over their lives told them that this sentence was complete nonsense, but when this sentence came out of the President of Future Group, even if they were reluctant to believe it, they still subconsciously gave it a second thought.</br>
</br>
However, after all, it is a downgraded-version of the sixth-generation fighter, Matteo walked in front of Jiang Chen, and smiled, Am I right? In front of the real sixth-generation fighter, it is still vulnerable and weak.</br>
</br>
When his high-quality customers began to surround the hangar of Future Military, Matteo noticed what had happened. This situation made him feel inexplicably annoyed, as if a well-prepared performance was ignored by the audience. Stupid audiences were more willing to pay attention to a popular singer, but ignore the efforts made by a veteran superstar</br>
</br>
He admitted that he was a bit emotional, but he didnt regret walking here.</br>
</br>
If he had to steal these high-quality customers from Future Military, then he had to make them realize how foolish it was to expect Future Military to beat Leonardo on a fighter.</br>
</br>
Perhaps in front of a real sixth-generation fighter, Jiang Chen just grinned. Just when Matteos smile seemed to declare his victory, Jiang Chen suddenly changed the topic and said with a mocking tone, But it is more than enough to beat a semi-finished product.</br>
</br>
Matteos smile of victory froze and the corner of his mouth twitched. However, the smile on his face remained unchanged.</br>
</br>
Semi-finished product? I dont understand what you are talking about.</br>
</br>
Do I have to be so explicit? Jiang Chen shrugged, raised his chin and pointed to the Uranago, then smiled, Dont tell me you plan to call that thing a sixth-generation fighter.</br>
</br>
Matteos smile gradually disappeared.</br>
</br>
The audience seemed engaged in this drama.</br>
</br>
This kind of multi-billion-dollar deal was full of drama to begin with. With one side being Future Military and the other side being Leonardo, it was destined to be a good show full of chaos, especially with the two presidents going head-to-head.</br>
</br>
Dare to have a friendly match with us? Matteo pointed to the Matador robot, then smiled, If you firmly believe that this thing is of little use.</br>
</br>
Why not? Jiang Chen responded with the same smile, Aurora may be used to deal with a normal sixth-generation fighter, but since it is a semi-finished product, its naturally unnecessary.</br>
</br>
Matteos expression turned cold.</br>
</br>
Oh? Which one are you going to pilot?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked to the side of the airport runway, casually glanced at the plane that had left the hangar, then quickly made his choice. He walked to Chemezov.</br>
</br>
Chemezov was slightly confused when he saw Jiang Chen moving towards him.</br>
</br>
Is there a problem?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed to the MiG-25 parked beside the runway, then said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
How much does this thing cost? Give me one.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
Chemezovs jaw dropped when he learned about the bet between Jiang Chen and Matteo.</br>
</br>
Wait a second. Why are you not using your Aurora-20 to compete with his sixth-generation fighter? Why are you using the almost scrapped MiG-25 instead? Are you trying to lose on purpose?</br>
</br>
Because he was so shocked, Chemezov even forgot to markup the price and directly quoted the cost. Since Jiang Chen did not want to bargain, he simply accepted the offer. In the end, this MiG-25 was sold to Future Military at cost as a test product in the competition against Leonardo.</br>
</br>
The competition quickly began.</br>
</br>
The two fighters were ready for take-off on the runway.</br>
</br>
The MiG-25 was a third-generation fighter, so Future Military took off first. Five minutes after the MiG-25 ascended, the Uragano also took off to start the game of cat and mouse</br>
</br>
Inside the MiG-25 cockpit, the Matador skillfully operated the different instruments and devices, then checked whether all systems were functional.</br>
</br>
1</br>
</br>
When Chemezov saw this scene, his pupils constricted.</br>
</br>
Until the Matador sat in the cockpit, he still had doubts about whether this robot could really pilot the MiG-25, but now all his doubts disappeared, and he started to look forward to this competition. Could the Electronic Pilot really do something amazing with the MiG-25 that was about to into the museum and become history?</br>
</br>
Matteo was about to explode in anger when he saw the same scene.</br>
</br>
He felt like that his IQ was being insulted.</br>
</br>
After he politely greeted all the women in Jiang Chens family in his mind, he gestured to his assistant with a churlish expression.</br>
</br>
I want you to end the battle within five minutes! Shoot that stupid robot, along with their arrogance, down!</br>
</br>
As an old antique about to enter the cemetery of planes, the only real advantage of the MiG-25 was its speed.</br>
</br>
There was a saying a long time ago.</br>
</br>
One day Khrushchev inspected the Mikoyan Design Bureau and saw the MiG-25. He asked a designer and asked, This aircraft uses so much steel and is so heavy. How can it avoid missiles?</br>
</br>
The designer immediately opened the cockpit cover and responded politely, Dear Comrade Khrushchev, you dont have to worry about that. This reflects the ingenuity of our design! You see, we have designed a throttle here.</br>
</br>
In the fall of 1971 before the Yom Kippur War, four Soviet MiG-25s were stationed in Egypt for reconnaissance. After Israels most advanced F-4 fighter jet spotted a MiG-25 in the air, it launched an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. Then soon, the Israeli pilot saw a picture that he would never forget. The MiG-25 opened the afterburner, pushed down the throttle, sprayed a string of flames, and slipped away</br>
</br>
Yes, just slipped away.</br>
</br>
With absolute speed, all maneuvering, radar, and flare were futile.</br>
</br>
At that time, NATOs air-to-air missiles were not faster than the MiG-25</br>
</br>
</br>
Using steel instead of titanium alloy to solve the heat problem of the fuselage, and then using a larger engine to propel this giant steel lump into the air. Russians unique aesthetics pushed the maximum speed of the MiG-25 to a daunting Mach 3.2 during Khrushchevs time.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that without the wings, the fighter would just be a large missile!</br>
</br>
By the way, as the fifth-generation fighter, the highest speed of the standard version F22 was only Mach 2.25</br>
</br>
The Uragano counted down the time and after five minutes had passed since the MiG-25 lifted off, the engine of the Uragano ignited, and the fighter accelerated at an incredible speed, pulled its nose up, and pierced into the sky. The spectators on both sides of the runway all agreed that just from the fluid takeoff, the Uragano was certainly worthy of the title of the sixth-generation fighter.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was Future Militarys arrogance, or perhaps it was its confidence, the decision to use MiG-25 to compete against the crystallization of the most cutting-edge technology of the Leonardo Group seemed to be foolish. If they decided to use the Aurora-20, perhaps they would still have a slim chance of winning, but with MiG-25</br>
</br>
It was really a game of cat and mouse.</br>
</br>
Unlike the spectators on both sides of the runway, the Matador in the cockpit did not have the slightest of emotion in the wide-angle lenses, but only streams of data. The moment Uragano took off, the large section of the fighter performance had already been analyzed.</br>
</br>
Searching</br>
</br>
Comparing against enemy strength</br>
</br>
After calculating, the odds of winning are only 0.1%</br>
</br>
The best combat plan has been confirmed, executing.</br>
</br>
The MiG-25 did not use the fact that it took off first to seize the advantageous attack angle, but it just flew further away</br>
</br>
Both sides had built-in cameras in the cockpit, and Celestial Trades Skyeye X1 was closely monitoring the situation. The pictures of the two fighters were transmitted to the surface in real-time. The staff of Future Military had already prepared a few holographic computers to broadcast the competition to the audience in real-time.</br>
</br>
Matteo sneered in his mind when he saw what the MiG-25 did.</br>
</br>
Seeking death!</br>
</br>
Less than half a minute after the Uragano took off, it was easily right on MiG-25s tail.</br>
</br>
Two air-to-air missiles were locked onto the fighter, in the three seconds that the missiles were approaching the fighter, the Matador calmly released flares. A series of sparks appeared in the air, and quickly the two missiles chased after two flares and completely ignored the escaping MiG-25.</br>
</br>
Your electronic pilot is only good at running away? Matteo mocked as he looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Just keep watching. Jiang Chen smiled and did not take his mockery to heart.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens reaction made Matteo feel that he punched a ball of wool. However, when he was about to throw in a few more taunts, he felt something was off when he realized that the distance between the two fighters were closing.</br>
</br>
However, the ominous feeling just appeared for a brief moment because common sense told him that the situation was impossible.</br>
</br>
The Uragano was still trailing the MiG-25s tail, and from time to time it would fire its autocannon. However, all the missiles were perfectly distracted by the flares, and none of the autocannon shots hit.</br>
</br>
The distance between the two sides was getting closer and closer.</br>
</br>
Just as the speed of the MiG-25 reached Mach 3.2, the Matador suddenly pulled up.</br>
</br>
At this moment, it completely turned into a real matador as it revealed its silver clock to the Uragano closely behind it. The nose of the MiG-25 suddenly pulled up and created an incredible trajectory in the air. The tail and nose of the aircraft switched positions in an instant, and the speed suddenly dropped from Mach 3.2 to below Mach 1.</br>
</br>
1</br>
</br>
Cobra maneuver! Chemezov almost shouted out. His eyes widened as he continued, Thats impossible!</br>
</br>
It was indeed impossible.</br>
</br>
The aerodynamic layout of the MiG-25 meant that it was impossible to perform the Cobra maneuver. Forcibly pulling the nose up at a high speed would only result in a fatal crash, and the pilot would be the first one to go! However, because it was the MiG-25, the steel-made fuselage design prevented the belly and wings of the MiG-25 from being torn apart. The entire fighter was like a dry leaf pushed away by the wind, spinning in the air.</br>
</br>
The winner was decided in an instant.</br>
</br>
The Urangano accelerated to its speed limit and pierced the body of the MiG-25 that suddenly decelerated.</br>
</br>
It was just a pity that it did not use its autocannons or missiles.</br>
</br>
But the pilot probe in the front</br>
</br>
Regardless, it was impossible to find the pilot probe that made the kill.</br>
</br>
In a car accident or rather, in a fighter accident, it did not matter whether it was a sixth-generation fighter or a third-generation fighter, the final outcome was the same. The match ended in a tie. However, the Matador piloted a third-generation fighter, and Leonardos Uragano was a sixth-generation fighter. The sixth-generation fighter and the third-generation machine drew a tie, so everyone who understood the outcome realized that the Uragano had lost.</br>
</br>
2</br>
</br>
No one can beat the Future Group in artificial intelligence technology I finally understand why Future Military did not bet on the sixth-generation fighter. Next to the airport runway, the man with a Chinese face gently sighed.</br>
</br>
Indeed, the reasons did not need to be said.</br>
</br>
If the pinnacle of the fifth-generation fighter, Aurora-20, could turn into the pinnacle of the sixth-generation fighter in the hands of Future Military at any time. It would be unnecessary to spend money and energy to research the sixth-generation fighter.</br>
</br>
In the thick black smoke, fragments rained down as two sparks could be seen from afar. It wasnt just the wreckage of the MiG-25 and the Uragano that fell, but also the last remaining pride in Matteos heart.</br>
</br>
Matteo stared at the sky in a daze until Nicola, who was next to him, poked his arm. He finally regained his thoughts, moved his stiff neck, and looked at Jiang Chen next to him.</br>
</br>
Although he considered the one in ten-thousandths chance of the sixth-generation fighter losing to the third-generation fighter, he did not consider that it would end like this. The slow-motion playback at the last moment told him that the Uranago still made evasive actions when it was about to hit the MiG-25.</br>
</br>
However, even AI could not execute the maneuver at that speed, only God could do it</br>
</br>
Especially when the opponent had already calculated the move ahead.</br>
</br>
From the very beginning, the MiG-25 controlled by the Matador planned the crash.</br>
</br>
Actually, you dont have to be so depressed, Jiang Chen coughed, patted Matteo on the shoulder, and said with a smile, At least we are tied, and I didnt make a ahem, make a bet with you.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was about to burst out laughing. After he said this, he quickly stepped aside.</br>
</br>
When Matteo saw Jiang Chens shaking shoulders, he felt something sweet from his throat and almost coughed out blood.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the runway, Chemezov looked at the sky and stood as still as a sculpture. He was completely lost for words. It was the warlord that helped him regain his senses.</br>
</br>
The warlord looked at him sincerely, dragged on his arm, and said genuinely.</br>
</br>
Mr. Chemezov, my friend, sorry that I blamed you What you plan to sell me is definitely not a piece of junk Well, just give me ten of the MiG-25 that shot down the sixth-generation fighter. Wait, no, TWENTY!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1373: The Colonization Frenzy In the Apocalypse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
_Min_Rainystars</br>
</br>
The Holy Shield system was about to be repaired. As the Parliament announced the specific time of the Holy Shield activation, the streets and alleys of Sixth Street were decorated by festive lights and filled with a celebratory atmosphere.</br>
</br>
For the survivors in Wanghai, the Holy Shield was not only a shield to isolate them from the apocalypse, but also a banner. Especially for those who had lived here and had witnessed that prosperous and great age, the status of the Holy Shield in their hearts was particularly sacred.</br>
</br>
Repair the Holy Shield.</br>
</br>
Meant the possibility of restoring order.</br>
</br>
Coinciding with the completion of the fourth Garden of Eden, NAC lowered the prices of agricultural products for the second time in a year. The purchasing power of credit points continued to increase, and the prices of commodities had decreased. The smiles on the survivors who lived in the Sixth Street also grew brighter.</br>
</br>
From the perspective of enriching the spiritual and cultural beliefs of the people, the Parliament, with surplus funding, decided to take advantage of this opportunity to announce that the day the Holy Shield activated would be Holy Shield Day and it would stipulate that every year at this time, the Parliament would fund a large-scale celebration.</br>
</br>
For the icing on the cake, the North American colony just sent dozens of tons of newly produced white crab roe sauce to the Sixth Street, as well as a poster of the colony.</br>
</br>
Based on the description of sailors returning from North America, a few boxes of canned meat that were no longer attractive in the Sixth Street could be exchanged for a blonde girl, and a pack of cigarettes could buy a young girls first night</br>
</br>
1</br>
</br>
Although it was somewhat exaggerated, primitive desires could stimulate peoples drive and motivation. On the day when the white crab roe sauce was sold in the Sixth Street, there was a long queue at the entrance of the colonial registration point.</br>
</br>
Any citizen of any level with citizenship issued by the NAC military government could register as a glorious colonizer at the registration point. The military government promised to arrange work for the colonists, reimburse the boat fare, and subsidize 50-100 credits per month based on the colonists citizenship level for five years.</br>
</br>
At the Port of Wanghai, the elevator was hoisting containers onto the cargo ship.</br>
</br>
The sailors on deck were smoking listlessly because they were about to set sail and were destined to miss a grand celebration.</br>
</br>
Dont you want to wait until the celebration is over? I heard they said that the Arrogant Girls will perform on stage. If I remember correctly, the lead singer is your goddess.</br>
</br>
No. Han Yue dragged his suitcases, shook his head, and looked to the port with a hint of longing in his eyes, Once I accomplish something, I will come back for her.</br>
</br>
Song Zhongwei did not try to persuade further. He let out a sigh, then patted his good buddy twice on the shoulder with force, and said with encouragement, It is good to have a dream. This world has changed, you should have a dream too.</br>
</br>
</br>
Fate was always a curious topic. They didnt know each other before the apocalypse. Song Zhongwei was an indie singer who enjoyed music, and Han Yue was a bank security guard. The lives of the two people were parallel to each other. If it werent for the fact that they lied next to each others hibernation chamber, they wouldnt have known each others name.</br>
</br>
After they woke up from the fallout shelter and were told by a NAC soldier in a kinetic skeleton that it was the twentieth year of the apocalypse, it took them a full year to adapt to the new order and try to accept the devastated city in front of them.</br>
</br>
At that time, the two became friends.</br>
</br>
Whats your dream?</br>
</br>
Lie down in the hibernation chamber again, Song Zhongwei rolled his eyes, Wake up two hundred years later and become an old-school singer.</br>
</br>
It has to be retro, right, haha.</br>
</br>
The two laughed and punched each other in the chest, and the two looked at each other and smiled.</br>
</br>
Song Zhongwei grinned and said seriously to Hang Yue.</br>
</br>
Be careful. Ive heard people say that it is far more complicated there. In addition to crystals and blondes, there are mutated humans and cannibal tribes.</br>
</br>
Risks and opportunities coexist. Ill live. Han Yue tried to make himself sound more lighthearted, then he stopped for a moment, looked at the cargo ship blowing its sirens, and suddenly smiled, This is enough.</br>
</br>
Guy, Song Zhongwei jokingly kicked him on the butt, and his tone was a little sorrowful, Its going to sail, go. Dont forget, you still owe me a meal.</br>
</br>
Haha, there are a lot of things I owe you!</br>
</br>
Han Yue patted his butt and walked towards the cargo ship with his suitcases.</br>
</br>
The siren rang three times to say goodbye to the people on the shore.</br>
</br>
The NAC cargo ship sailed away from the Port of Wanghai.Escorted by two warships, the ship would head north along the edge of Eurasia, cross the cold current at Bering Strait, bypass the golden waterway outside Alaska, travel south along the shores of the North American continent, and finally arrive at the port established by NAC in California</br>
</br>
After half a month of sailing, Han Yue, on the deck, finally saw the long-lost coastline.</br>
</br>
The fabled North America.</br>
</br>
He had been here before the war as a tourist.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, when he gazed at Los Angeles in the distance, there was no trace of what it used to be. Most of the Hollywood Hills were shaved off, and the villas that once stood there were non-existent, leaving only bare dirt hills.</br>
</br>
Just as Han Yue tried to recall the citys original skyline, he heard a coarse and loud voice behind him. As the other colonists on the deck turned their heads together to the entrance of the cabin, they saw the shaggy captain who they had only seen once when they boarded the ship.</br>
</br>
Here we are, California is in front of us. It used to be called Los Angeles I think, now it doesnt matter what you call it.</br>
</br>
This place is different from the Sixth Street. After you leave the NAC colony, it is barbarian land. There is no order here, even in a settlement of survivors. I hope your muzzles will point to the same direction after you get off. This is probably just like Wanghai from a few years ago; survivors are more dangerous than Death Claws. Rather than being caught by mutated humans, it is better to give yourself a bullet to the head. However, I think my nonsense is pointless to most of you.</br>
</br>
On the deck, the captain snorted, took out a low-quality cigar from his pocket, blew out a cloudy smoke ring, and looked at the faintly visible port, I admit that this place is full of opportunities. Canned meat can be exchanged for what you want, but I advise you to always think twice. Before you enjoy life, you must first do everything possible to save your life.</br>
</br>
The siren blew three times, and the ship moved to the port.</br>
</br>
The cargo ship got closer and closer to the port.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the captain smoking a cigar suddenly noticed there was something wrong with the port.</br>
</br>
The port was so quiet!</br>
</br>
If it was the usual, every time he pulled goods from the Sixth Street, it would make the colony cheer. Especially the pine nuts alcohol, some drunkards could even sleep at the port for the entire night with just a quilt, just so they could exchange the booze with crystals or other shiny things with the sailors.</br>
</br>
Anything with alcohol sold well in the colony.</br>
</br>
But now, even the port workers disappeared.</br>
</br>
Wait, the unshaven captain frowned slightly, took out the binoculars from his pocket, and pointed to the harbor. His brows were tightly locked together, and the corners of his chapped mouth were slightly open, he whispered, Something is wrong</br>
</br>
Han Yue didnt notice anything unusual. On top of the deck, he felt the coldness of the wind slip into his collar.</br>
</br>
After he shuddered, he wrapped the collar of his jacket tighter, put his hands into the pockets of his windbreaker, touched a pendant, and a hint of warmth rose in his heart.</br>
</br>
He bought the pendant from a small vendor selling souvenirs at a concert before the war. He never expected the world would change, the rules would change, everything would change. However, he was the one who had not changed. Compared to Song Zhongwei, who had lost everything, he felt that he was lucky after all.</br>
</br>
Arrogant Girls was still holding a concert, although the drummer had changed and so did the stage</br>
</br>
He quietly watched the silent harbor, but suddenly, he remembered that they should have brought more winter clothes for this trip.</br>
</br>
It was the colony.</br>
</br>
There was no Holy Shield to protect him from the wind and rain</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1374: Cheers To Our Victory!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
We dont export fighters, but we export the best pilots!</br>
</br>
A short ad slogan made Future Military the star among the audience. Especially among customers from third world countries, the enthusiasm for the Matador was particularly high. Even though the price of the first generation electronic pilot Matador was an astounding 15 million Xin New dollars, which exceeded the price of the MiG-25 itself, it did not dampen their enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
Give us fifty! If you are willing to sell us 20 electronic pilots every year for the next ten years and promise to give priority to upgrading and maintaining our Matadors after the AI update, I can give you some information as well, the central government will issue a policy by the end of this year at the latest, and the threshold for the maglev road will be open early next year from our countrys first-tier cities to inland second-tier cities!</br>
</br>
Can the price be cheaper? Our country is not developed. If you are willing to give me a 10% discount, we can discuss the possibility of subways or copper mines!</br>
</br>
A wonderful showdown! We are very interested in your matador! If you plan to sell, we are willing to purchase 30 matadors in one lump sum payment! If you are willing to authorize the relevant technology, please be sure to consider us!</br>
</br>
The price of 15 million Xin New dollars was not an expensive figure for most people, or rather, it could be considered cheap</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
Some simple math could explain the reasoning!</br>
</br>
According to international standards, the cost of flying a third-generation fighter for one hour was about 50,000 US dollars and training a pilot required at least 180 hours of training per year. However, the world generally agreed that an experienced third-generation fighter pilot needed a thousand hours of flying experience, therefore, it was simple to do the math. Training an experienced pilot would cost at least 50 million US dollars, and an ace pilot with a flight time of more than 3,000 hours would require at least 200 million!</br>
</br>
Whether it was familiarity with the radar, grasp of the timing of maneuvers, judgment of the situation, or the timing of the flare Even an ace pilot-controlled MiG-25 would not be able to execute all these steps to perfection. The matador had already demonstrated its inhuman combat qualities, which turned air combat into a game with predictable outcomes.</br>
</br>
A pilot superior to an ace pilot for only a cost of 15 million Xin New dollars! Especially this deal also included future upgrades, maintenance as well as other services! Without the need to think, after everyone witnessed such an amazing competition, the matador naturally became top of the list.</br>
</br>
Whether it was a third world country or a first world country, everyone opened their wallet to fight for the limited number of matadors from the Future Military. At first, Jiang Chen didnt expect the sales to be so explosive. Not only were the 20 units quickly sold out, but orders were even scheduled until the end of next year.</br>
</br>
</br>
This demand even caught him by surprise.</br>
</br>
Originally, he thought that it would take some time for these people to accept the concept of electronic pilots. However, he did not expect that a MiG-25 and a quasi-sixth-generation Urangno would actually help him with free promotion.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen looked to Matteo, who blankly stared into the ocean, he finally resisted the urge to laugh.</br>
</br>
Regardless, this man did do him a huge favor and it would be rude to make fun of him.</br>
</br>
Matteos expression was a bit sluggish when he gazed into the ocean, his Adams apple moved up and down from time to time, and internal, he wanted to cry.</br>
</br>
Not far away, two engineering ships were moored, and the hooks on the mechanical cantilevers were searching for the wreckages under the guidance of divers. Celestial Trade generously stated that it would help Leonardo salvage the wreckage of the sixth-generation fighter for free.</br>
</br>
As for the MiG-25, because of its limited value, Future Military decided against retrieving its wreckage.</br>
</br>
MiG-25s cockpit was the first to be retrieved.</br>
</br>
The MiG, which was hit in the belly by the Uraganos pilot probe, split in two from the middle. However, it was more complete than the Uragano body that smashed into steel.</br>
</br>
Future Militarys Matador, whose head was smashed into pieces, were pulled out from the cockpit. It was placed at the most conspicuous position for exhibition and similar to displaying a hero, it once again won the applause and praise of the people.</br>
</br>
The applause sounded so harsh in Matteos ears.</br>
</br>
He never thought that it would end in this way.</br>
</br>
The Uragano did not win him a single order but instead caused his other fighters to not sell as well.</br>
</br>
With absolute advantage, their Uragano managed a tie with the MiG-25. There was almost no doubt that starting from tomorrow, their hard work would definitely become the laughing stock.</br>
</br>
He was most worried about whether or not NATO would reconsider the research and development plan with Leonardo. After all, it appeared that the defeated Uragano was a complete failure.</br>
</br>
It was difficult to say whether NATO would pay for these failed machines.</br>
</br>
If the answer was no, Leonardos investment would be completely written off. If the answer was yes, it would continue to invest in the Uragano to improve this fighter with an already failed label  the risk to the company would be immense.</br>
</br>
In any case, the result of this competition had forced him and his company into a dilemma.</br>
</br>
He could only hope NATO would make it less difficult for him</br>
</br>
Cheers to our victory!</br>
</br>
Cheers!</br>
</br>
The crisp clings of glasses were joined together, and the noisy laughter and chatter seemed out of place compared with the atmosphere of the restaurant.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen booked a Michelin three-star restaurant in the Heart of the Sea. He had invited all Future Military senior executives and scientists.</br>
</br>
The table was full of delicious food, a bottle of vintage red wine was served to everyone, and it was a feast. In particular, because the president was also here, everyone was drinking and spared no effort in an attempt to make an impression in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The third day of the defense exhibition had just come to an end. Future Military had received more than 50 billion Xin New dollars in orders. Especially today, the total value of orders for more than 700 Matadors had exceeded 10 billion.</br>
</br>
These orders were enough for Future Military to digest till the end of next year, and the CEO would not need to worry about quarterly or annual reports for at least two years.</br>
</br>
The theme of tomorrows defense exhibition was air defense, and it was no longer the home court of Future Military. Future Military did not intend to sell its laser anti-missile or interference technology, so it generously gave the stage to its two allies, Russia and Hua, to show their muscles.</br>
</br>
To be honest, in fact, from the third day on, it was no longer Future Militarys home court. Future Military had no plan to sell fighters at all. If it werent for Leonardos desperate attempt to make an impression, the situation would not have turned out like this</br>

Jiang Chen had said long ago that Future Group stood on the shoulders of giants.</br>
</br>
Lilith, as the most powerful artificial intelligence, helped a lot in designing the AI for electronic pilots. It was fair to say that 60% of the credit belonged to her, and the remaining 40% was the work of all the scientists at Future Militarys Artificial Intelligence Technology Laboratory.</br>
</br>
The future of the military industry was AI, and so was the focus of Future Military.</br>
</br>
Not only electronic pilots, but also projects like more flexible battlefield robots were on the list of Future Militarys development. In Future Militarys laboratory, some AI soldiers could already skillfully use weapons, vehicles, and different terrains to fight, but the expensive cost and poor price-performance ratio made it impossible to move them from the lab enviornment to the frontline battlefield.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was very certain about one point.</br>
</br>
In the not-too-distant future, the war of flesh and blood would eventually be replaced by the bursts of electric sparks.</br>
</br>
The fourth day of the defense exhibition was still held at the temporary airport.</br>
</br>
From S400 to HQ-15 air defense missiles, thick and long air defense missiles were lined up on both sides of the runway. Compradors from different countries commented on the missile launch vehicles and exchanged questions about weapon performance and price with military sales personnel.</br>
</br>
As expected by Jiang Chen, the defense exhibition had developed into a wrestling match between military industrial enterprises from Russia and military industrial enterprises from Hua, and the battlefield of competition even extended from arms itself to supporting facilities.</br>
</br>
Since the celebration banquet was held in advance, from today on, Future Military decided to minimize its presence. Therefore, Future Group President Jiang Chen was not at the scene, instead, Future Military CEO Ling Tao replaced him.</br>
</br>
Originally Jiang Chen planned to take the time to head to Coconut Island and dump the accumulated materials to the apocalypse, but he did not expect a rare visitor to come to the door.</br>
</br>
Why, based on your unexpected expression, you dont seem to welcome this old man? Outside the door, Ye Qinghua looked at Jiang Chen with a smile.</br>
</br>
Not much had changed since the last time they met more than a year ago. The old man still looked healthy without the slightest sign of aging.</br>
</br>
Not at all! Jiang Chen laughed, and gestured to his room, Please come in.</br>
</br>
What surprised Jiang Chen was that Ye Qinghua, who had not contacted him for a long time, actually came to visit him in person this time.</br>
</br>
When Ayesha saw a guest, she prepared a cup of tea for the two, and then turned around and went to the second floor.</br>
</br>
By coincidence, Natasha, who had just finished washing up, walked downstairs while yawning. She was slightly taken aback when she saw Elder Ye, and then said hello respectfully. When she passed by Jiang Chen, she leaned over and kissed Jiang Chen on the cheek like a wife who was about to go to work. At the same time, she quickly said in a voice that only Jiang Chen could hear, Why is he here?</br>
</br>
</br>
After Natasha got up, Jiang Chen responded with a helpless look that only she could see -I dont know.</br>
</br>
Today was a workday and Natasha had to be at the embassy. As for Xia Shiyu, who was never late, she had already gone to the office early in the morning. After the door closed, only Jiang Chen and Elder Ye were in the living room.</br>
</br>
Elder Ye blew on the tea leaves floating on the hot tea, smiled, and said.</br>
</br>
Mr. Jiangs mansion is quite lively.</br>
</br>
Haha, not at all, Jiang Chen said with a humble smile.</br>
</br>
I heard that today is the highlight of the exhibition, did you not go and take a look?</br>
</br>
Our air defense system is not for sale and I dont have much interest in the air defense system of other companies. Therefore, I just let Ling Tao go for me. Jiang Chen smiled back.</br>
</br>
I think its not that you dont want to sell it, its just that you cant find a place to downgrade it, Ye Qinghua scolded while laughing.</br>
</br>
You are right to understand it that way, Jiang Chen touched his nose, and continued to spill out nonsense, but I prefer to call it, for the time being, there is no military air defense system suitable for overseas markets.</br>
</br>
What Elder Ye said was indeed one reason, the laser anti-missile system itself was very cutting-edge technology, and Future Military had not mastered the technology for too long, therefore, there was no place to downgrade the technology. If they decided to sell the laser anti-missile system intact, it would weaken the strategic deterrence of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Sure enough! Lets talk about your its fine if you downgrade the technology of drone or kinetic skeleton, I cant say much. But you downgraded the rifle too. This is not good business practice is it? Ye Qinghua lectured Jiang Chen with deep remorse in his tone. The way he sounded made it feel like he was the one who lost out on the deal, even though he was just a retired diplomat.</br>
</br>
On the first day of the defense exhibition, Hua purchased a large quantity of S1 kinetic skeletons from Future Military, as well as Scythe drones and the supporting S1 rifles. If it werent for the fact that the S1 rifle could be connected to the kinetic skeleton by wire, the auxiliary aiming function of the digital helmet could assist aiming, and the performance was good, no one would buy a downgraded rifle.</br>
</br>
We just distinguish the military sales version from the internal version, Jiang Chen tried to defend himself, Just like your Type-95 and Type-97. Isnt one for internal use and one for external use?</br>
</br>
I dare to swear on my conscience and say that the difference between the Type-95 and the Type-97 is only the caliber of ammunition, and there is not much difference in performance. Do you dare to swear on your conscience and say that the performance of the S1 and the Ripper is the same? Ye Qinghua stared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
You didnt just come here to complain about this, right? Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
Dont mind you, Im just talking nonsense, Elder Ye smiled and waved his hand, By the way, lets talk about business, are you interested in a deal?</br>
</br>
What deal? Youre not here to sell missiles right? Jiang Chen picked up the teacup and joked.</br>
</br>
Let me ask first, did you salvage the wreckage of the Urangano?</br>
</br>
He sipped his tea quietly, and after he put the cup down, he gave him a side-eye.</br>
</br>
What do you want to do?</br>
</br>
For some reason, the amiable smile resembled more and more like the squinting eye of an old cunning fox.</br>
</br>
If you cant find it, you might as well sell it to us. Anyway, you dont need those things, right? After Ye Qinghuas nonsense, the old fox finally revealed the true purpose of his visit.</br>
</br>
Countries were now researching the sixth-generation fighter, and Hua was certainly no exception. It was hard to say how close they were to the true sixth-generation fighter, but if they could get a frame of reference, it would undoubtedly boost the development.</br>
</br>
Just this, Jiang Chen sighed and waved his hand. Just for the wrecked plane, you came here, the Russians also came, and even the Germans came How about this, Ill have someone scan the drawing of the Uragano and send the drawing to your embassy? I wont charge you. You can buy another 10,000 kinetic skeletons, and I will give the drawing as a gift for free, what do you think?</br>
</br>
You cancan scan out the drawings? Ye Qinghua said blankly.</br>
</br>
Why not? Jiang Chen smiled and put one leg on his other knee, then leaned back on the sofa, I can even 3D print a new one if I want.</br>
</br>
Ye Qinghua was silent.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, he suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
I dont understand. While it wont be too easy, it shouldnt be too difficult for you to develop a sixth-generation fighter, but why are you not interested in it at all?</br>
</br>
For someone who has already conquered the ocean, you can ask him why he doesnt research the canoe. Jiang Chen replied with a smile, Then I will ask you in turn, why must I research the sixth-generation fighter?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

_Min_Rainystars</br>
</br>
For someone who has already conquered the ocean, you can ask him why he doesnt research the canoe</br>
</br>
This sentence blew up in Elder Yes mind.</br>
</br>
After he had thought about it carefully, it seemed to be the case.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade Marine Corps had already set their foot on Mars, and the Envoy-class starship built by Future Group was already infinitely close to the Kuiper Belt. At this point, it was not necessary for Future Group to waste money to develop fighters used in the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
Sixth-generation fighter?</br>
</br>
Which generation would the Stingray X be considered?</br>
</br>
The two parties agreed that Hua would purchase another 10,000 set of S1 kinetic skeletons, Scythe drones, and supporting S1 rifles, and Future Military would include the drawings of Uragano free of charge, and at the same time, transfer a 3D-printed Uragano for a price of 500 million Xin New dollars.</br>
</br>
With the verbal contract promised by Jiang Chen, Ye Qinghua finished the cup of tea and said goodbye politely.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen sent Elder Ye to the entrance, he was about to say goodbye, but the old man turned around with a smile and said.</br>
</br>
By the way, you really are not going to consider Yunfei? I think you two will be a good match. Whats more, we are all from the same place, and the Ye family is a prominent family in the South. It will be a win-win situation.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had to think for a while before he recalled Elder Yes precious granddaughter Ye Yunfei.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, with black dots over his head, responded politely.</br>
</br>
You see, my house is already so lively, why do you want your granddaughter to be here?</br>
</br>
You havent married yet. Jiang Chen half-pushed Elder Ye out of the door, and the old man kept joking while he turned his head, I dont think youre the type to care, are you really not going to think about it again?</br>
</br>
It was because Elder Ye and Jiang Chens father were close, hence why he could joke with Jiang Chen. But Ye Qinghua certainly considered this as a real possibility. If his precious granddaughter could really marry Jiang Chen, it would be a good tale for the Republic as well as the Ye family.</br>
</br>
But as Jiang Chen said, his house was already lively enough.</br>
</br>
If it were five years ago, maybe he would really consider it. After all, just Ye Yunfeis beauty, talent or temperament would make countless people worship her. From the new rich to the noble son of a prominent family, it was rare to find someone who could resist her charm.</br>
</br>
As for now</br>
</br>
Now that his status changed, his view also changed, and his mentality naturally changed as well.</br>
</br>
After he sent Elder Ye away, he called Ling Tao, the CEO of Future Military, who was at the exhibition site.</br>
</br>
After we salvage the Uragano, send a few technicians to scan the drawings, and then return the wreckage to Leonardo.</br>
</br>
The design drawings of the Uragano have been scanned and archived. Ling Tao walked to the side with the phone, as he spoke, a triumphant grin also appeared, Leonardo wont know what we did. They just thanked us for not dissembling their prototype.</br>
</br>
</br>
Good job, Jiang Chen laughed, then continued, After the defense exhibition is over, print a few copies of the drawings for me, and then get the factory to print five prototypes based on the drawings.</br>
</br>
Ill do it now. Ling Tao nodded.</br>
</br>
After he ended the conversation, Jiang Chen went to the gym on the second floor to see Ayesha, who was working out. He explained that he would have to leave for a period of time, as well as made arrangements.</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen had already told her back in August that he would return to the apocalypse after the defense exhibition, while Ayesha said she would miss him, she didnt say much more.</br>
</br>
On Xia Shiyus side, I already told her last night. As for Natashajust tell her that Im going to the Moon colony on a business trip for a while.</br>
</br>
Ayesha gently printed a kiss on his lips, then she longingly rubbed his cheek. Because she was working out, there were droplets of sweats on her pristine neck and forehead. Strands of her curly brown hair were wet and decorated her beautiful face. She looked particularly attractive at this moment.</br>
</br>
This is unfair to me.</br>
</br>
Unfair?</br>
</br>
Why dont you leave tomorrow? I want you to tell me at night.</br>
</br>
A layer of fine mist covered her sapphire-like eyes that radiated an adorning look. The emotion was instantly captured by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Its okay, daytime is fine too.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen grabbed those delicate hands, this time, Jiang Chen kissed her.</br>
</br>
In the sweaty gym, the heavy panting that seemed to resemble a long marathon reverberated in the room. Palm leaves outside the window gently swayed in the sea breeze and covered the scandalous moments behind the window. Everything that happened at this moment could not be told</br>
</br>
After everything happened, most of the morning had passed.</br>
</br>
He took Ayesha to take a shower, wasted some more time at home, and when he saw that the sun outside had already climbed above the tree branches, he decided to change his plan and leave after lunch.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who deliberately walked into the kitchen without closing the door, directly put the towel wrapped around her aside and tied on her apron.</br>
</br>
The white apron covered her delicate body. Although all the places that should be covered were covered, the not covered parts were even more attractive. If it was not for the fact that he had things to finish in the afternoon, Jiang Chen would definitely have eaten her for lunch too.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen hurriedly finished the sumptuous lunch, he helped Ayesha put the plates back into the dishwasher, left a kiss on her lips at the entrance, then left the mansion.</br>
</br>
Since Natasha moved into the mansion, Coconut Island became Jiang Chens buffer zone for interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
It could eliminate the need to answer questions, and it was also a station for him to transport rare goods to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Although the apocalypse could produce most foods on its own, due to many factors such as the environment and production conditions, most of the crops produced from the Garden of Edens were crops with predictable and stable output, such as rice, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage.</br>
</br>
Foods such as grains, other vegetables, and fruits were still produced by the submarine farms under the Xin Ocean Agriculture controlled by Future Group. However, most of these high-end goods were the employee benefits of the NAC military government, and generally were not sold unless there was an abundance of supplies.</br>
</br>
Metal resources such as steel, aluminum, finished molybdenum, rare earth minerals, and other metal resources produced by Future Mining were also transported. These metal mines almost supported the entire industry in the Sixth Street. If they depended on scavengers picking garbage alone, the factory would be able to produce a few power armors at most.</br>
</br>
After he landed on Coconut Island by helicopter, he turned off the drone security system as usual, and at the same time transferred the staff stationed on the island on the grounds of a military exercise.</br>
</br>
When he was the only one left on the island, he walked to the port of Coconut Island.</br>
</br>
As he stood in front of the mountain of containers, he took a deep breath, took out a few crystals and pinched them in his hands. Then, he rolled up the sleeves of his arms.</br>
</br>
If he was lucky, he could finish everything in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
Its time to work!</br>
</br>
He muttered silently in his mind, then pressed his hand against the first container</br>

</div></br>
</br>

</br>
A large warehouse that covered an area of tens of acres, topped by an opaque graphene roof, was located between Town of Shenxiang and Fishbone Base. It was the suburb of Wanghai, but also the center of the NAC military government. The first Garden of Eden built by NAC was on the edge of Dianshan Lake, northwest of Wanghai. In the direction of Jiaxing, there were a large number of military factories and military bases built by NAC.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, this huge warehouse was always full of T-3 and T-4 power armors just manufactured by the military factories at the Sixth Street, as well as K2 kinetic skeletons mounted with optical engines, or used spacecraft fixed by Jiang Lin and other technologists.</br>
</br>
This warehouse was heavily guarded by the First Division, and a radius of one kilometer was designated as the controlled zone. Any survivors who attempted to approach would be persuaded or ordered to leave.</br>
</br>
For those who decided not to leave</br>
</br>
Probably no one would treat their own life with such carelessness.</br>
</br>
On certain days, the army stationed near the warehouse wouldinexplicably receive a transfer order and then withdraw from the military restricted area completely. Once another group of soldiers and the trucks from logistics department arrived, the high-tech equipment in the warehouse were often replaced with containers filled with different necessities and goods.</br>
</br>
Then the workers would load the containers onto heavy trucks with cranes and celebrate the day as if it was a holiday. Then they would ship the goods to the logistics centers near the Garden of Eden and separate everything into categories.</br>
</br>
As for how often this special day happened</br>
</br>
It depended on the mood of the NAC General.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was free to transport materials between the two worlds.</br>
</br>
Today was that special day, and the logistic trucks were lined up outside the warehouse.</br>
</br>
Trucks were like commodities on the assembly line as they entered the warehouse from the east, waited for the cranes to load the goods, and then left the warehouse in a straight line from the west. Under the command of the logistics officials, they transported to their respective locations in an orderly fashion.</br>
</br>
Fifty containers stuffed with canned meat, my goodnessWhere do you think these good things come from? A logistic official who helped load the trucks exclaimed as he counted the giant mountain-like pile of containers against the checklist in his hands.</br>
</br>
As a civil servant in the logistics department of the NAC military government, he recalled that when he came here a few days ago, it was a warehouse full of power armors and K2 kinetic skeletons. It didnt take long before they became tons of food, supplies, and metal ingots.</br>
</br>
An older worker who just loaded a counted container onto the truck wiped the sweat from his forehead. He watched the truck that left for the exit in the operating room, then tossed the heavily stained towel onto the station while he jokingly cussed.</br>
</br>
</br>
Dont ask so much! Just focus on your work! If the count is wrong, youll have a lot more to worry about!</br>
</br>
Whatever! How can I count wrong?</br>
</br>
The inside of the warehouse was bustling and so was the outside.</br>
</br>
Next to the stream of vehicles moving forward, Jiang Chen handed a list to Wang Qing and at the same time reminded.</br>
</br>
The list is here, remember to double-check. It will be a busy few days.</br>
</br>
Not at all. Wang Qing smiled humbly. She nodded and said, This is my job after all.</br>
</br>
A container could hold 800-952 boxes of goods. Jiang Chen sent 50 containers of canned meat this time. Based on 30 canned meat products per box, the number of canned meats alone was 1.35 million.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded in satisfaction as he looked at Wang Qing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still remembered that when Wang Qing was first appointed as the head of logistics, she was just a timid and shy girl with freckles on the tip of her nose and a pair of glasses fixed on her face. The reason why she was appointed as the head of the logistics was that on the one hand, she was an accountant before the war, and on the other hand, she just needed to manage the small warehouse that was only a few dozen square meters in the backyard of the mansion. It was better to find a timid and fearful person than to find a fierce one.</br>
</br>
With the expansion of Fishbone Base and the NAC territory, the burden on her had gradually increased. From the initial warehouse clerk to the head of logistics, and now, together with Lu Huasheng, who started in construction, became one of the most senior officials in the civil service system of the NAC military government. Her transformation up till now had been quite astounding.</br>
</br>
I have to thank General for giving me this opportunity. Wang Qing smiled and her eyes gleamed with gratitude.</br>
</br>
Dont flatter me, I didnt teach you anything, but I often ask for your help. Jiang Chen laughed, By the way, are there any guys you like? Cheng Weiguos children can almost go and buy soy sauce themselves now and even Lu Huasheng got married quietly. In the first thirty people, you are the only one thats still single, which is somewhat odd. So, if theres someone you like, I can call the shots for you.</br>
</br>
General, are you serious? Wang Qing blinked and said.</br>
</br>
Of course. Jiang Chen raised his chin and said with a joking smile, As long as you dont encourage me to destroy other peoples families, I cant do that kind of thing.</br>
</br>
Haha, she had an urge to say something for a moment, but in the end, Wang Qing just pursed the corner of her mouth, swallowed that sentence, smiled, and shook her head, I have dedicated my life to NAC. I havent found anyone I like for the time being.</br>
</br>
1</br>
</br>
You must remember to tell me if you find someone you like! Dont tell me after you get married. Jiang Chen jokingly scolded.</br>
</br>
Wang Qing smiled.</br>
</br>
Okay!</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, the entire warehouse had been working tirelessly from noon until dark. Wang Qing moved another group of staff from the logistics department, and everyone worked around the clock to load the trucks. After Jiang Chen saw that there was no place he could help, he returned to the mansion.</br>
</br>
When Yao Yao saw her beloved big brother come back, she happily jumped into Jiang Chens arms and rubbed her face against his chest. Then she ran into the kitchen to prepare dinner for him.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao dragged him to the sofa in the living room and sat down. After a while, Xiaorou, who noticed the noise downstairs, also came down and sat opposite Jiang Chen. She playfully grabbed his arm.</br>
</br>
You finally came back, Sun Jiao pouted, but when she looked him in the eyes, a lot of her complaints disappeared right away.</br>
</br>
When the atmosphere gradually became sensual, Xiaorou, the third wheel, coughed at an untimely moment. With her index finger pressed to her lower lip, she grinned naughtily.</br>
</br>
Yes, you finally came back. When brother-in-law was away, my sister was quite lonely. Every time she took a shower, she would</br>
</br>
You, Sun Jiaos cheeks immediately turned red, and she glared at her sister fiercely, she wanted to cover her mouth, What nonsense are you speaking!</br>
</br>
AHHH, dont come here, I just want to say, you take a long bath every day, hahaha, its itchy, Xiaorou hid half of her body behind Jiang Chen and giggled while she tried to avoid the claws of her sister. Then, she looked to Jiang Chen pitifully and sought help, Brother-in-law, my sister wants to bully me, help me bully her, okay?</br>
</br>
Okay, okay, stop fooling around.</br>
</br>
It took a lot of effort to separate the embarrassed Sun Jiao from the pretending-to-be-pitiful Xiaorou. After the two sisters settled down, Jiang Chen paused for a moment, then looked at the closed door on the other side of the living room, and asked in confusion, By the way, where is Lin Lin? Did she fall asleep so early today?</br>
</br>
Lin Lin has been in the lab for the past while, When Jiang Chen brought up Lin Lin, Sun Jiao looked worried, You should go see her later, she misses you too.</br>
</br>
Mhmm. After stroking Sun Jiaos hair, Jiang Chen nodded seriously, Ill go now.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1378: Lin Linâ€œs Mind</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Sister Lin Lin is sleeping, can you not wake her up?</br>
</br>
At the gate of Lins Research Institute, a girl stood in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Her long black hair fell to her waist, her tall delicate nose and vivid eyes were almost carved in the same mold as Lin Lin. If she dyed her long black hair into silvery-white, even Jiang Chen couldnt tell whether she was Lin Lins cloned sister or Lin Lin herself.</br>
</br>
Are you? Jiang Chen looked at the girl standing in front of him and asked in a slight daze.</br>
</br>
Im Lin Yi, Lin Yi tilted her head, looked at Jiang Chen, and said, I saw you in the fallout shelter at the bottom of the lake. You helped me put clothes on.</br>
</br>
Lin Yi?</br>
</br>
Number 0001?</br>
</br>
In the future, remember not to talk about this kind of thing, Jiang Chen touched his nose awkwardly, coughed, and said, By the way, what is Lin Lin up to now?</br>
</br>
I dont know, Lin Yi shook his head, I just often hear from my sister that she has almost succeeded.</br>
</br>
When did she start to say it?</br>
</br>
Lin Yi tilted her head and said, The month before last month.</br>
</br>
Almost succeeded!?</br>
</br>
Thats still a long way to go, okay?!</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen thought this in his mind, he also felt guilty.</br>
</br>
He knew what Lin Lin was researching, and he knew why she was working so hard.</br>
</br>
There were more and more things he had to deal with in that world and it was difficult to spend a long time here with them. Perhaps it was because of her envy towards Lilith or the yearning for that beautiful world, Lin Lin had been doing all she could to research interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
He gently pushed open the door to the lab and saw Lin Lin who had fallen asleep on the chair.</br>
</br>
He stood at the door and stopped for a moment. Instead of waking her up, he took out a coat from his storage dimension, stepped forward, and gently covered her body.</br>
</br>
Maybe she felt the warmth around her, her delicate hand gently clenched onto the corner of the coat, and her petite body shrank unconsciously into the warm coat.</br>
</br>
Her delicate nose moved a little, and a sweet smile gradually appeared. She was just like a squirrel that had dreamt of her favorite nuts and was celebrating the newfound happiness.</br>
</br>
Because he was worried about waking her up, Jiang Chen didnt do anything more. He just smiled at her, and when he left the lab, he gently closed the door.</br>
</br>
The silence returned to the room.</br>
</br>
After a while, the little girl on the table slowly opened her misty eyes. The corners of her curved mouth pouted, and the little hand that held the coat moved closer to her neck. She used the coat to hide the red hue on her cheeks.</br>
</br>
Idiot, you woke me up</br>
</br>
She complained in a quiet voice, but even if she were pouting, the arc of joy couldnt be hidden.</br>
</br>
Digitalized humans are not afraid of the cold.</br>
</br>
She remembered very clearly that she had told Jiang Chen many times.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen never seemed to remember this.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, this kind of forgetfulness made her feel a real hint of warmth.</br>
</br>
The celebration would be held on October 1st.</br>
</br>
It was now the end of September, and there were only three days left before the restart of the Holy Shield.</br>
</br>
As the celebration approached, Wanghai became wrapped in a festive atmosphere.</br>
</br>
The survivors used colorful spray paint to spray graffiti and slogans of different colors on the ruined wall outside the Sixth Street. They expressed their joy with art and cheered for the coming new era. Major companies, headed by the Zhao Group, had also launched promotional activities in their shops, department stores, and entertainment venues. It seemed that all commodities have become cheaper overnight, especially the favorites of the people  bullet grain beer and diluted alcohol.</br>
</br>
Thanks to this, the streets and alleys of the Sixth Street were filled with drunks every night. They brandished wine bottles and sought after troubles, which created countless headaches for the security officers at the Sixth Street. The detention center was overcrowded every day and only eased in recent days.</br>
</br>
After all, no one would want to miss this grand celebration.</br>
</br>
It would be so miserable to watch the rebroadcast behind bars</br>
</br>
In the community center of Fishbone Base, the logistics staff were making the final changes to the plans for the celebration. Although the celebration was proposed by the Sixth Street Council, the logistics department was responsible for the preparation and stage construction.</br>
</br>
With the consideration that most of Wanghai, Yizhou Island, Hongcheng, Shangjing and even survivors from the south outside the NAC region would come to participate in this celebration. The logistics department discussed with Chu Nan and decided to make the Sixth Street celebration into a celebration for the entire NAC. They moved the stage from the Sixth Street to the ruins in the center of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
After more than a year of cleaning up, the radioactive sources accumulated in the center of Wanghai had been recycled and landfilled by NAC, and the gamma value in the area had returned to below the acceptable level. The venue was not only sufficient to host the celebration but could further highlight the wasteland characteristics of the festival.</br>
</br>
It just so happened that the huge crater left by the Gods Cane in the city center was large enough, and only a little modification was needed on the huge crater to dig out intersecting caves and stepped corridors. The place could be modified into a venue for celebrations and could host up to 100,000 people at the same time.</br>
</br>
With Lu Huasheng, the Minister of Interiors approval, the project was quickly approved.</br>
</br>
It took about two months for the NAC construction team to transform this natural crater into a graben-type circular gymnasium. Although there werent too many decorations and the chairs on the aisles were scrapped together with different junks and goods, they were quite in line with the aesthetics of the people of the wasteland</br>
</br>
Simple and practical.</br>
</br>
There are 37 singing performances in the celebration, including nine pre-war Pan-Asia Cooperation bands, 24 independent singers, and four virtual singers with the highest votes. In addition to singing performances, there are twenty other performances, Wang Qing reported the schedule of the celebration to Jiang Chen in the Fishbone Base community center.</br>
</br>
The performances were all jointly checked and arranged by the Sixth Street Council, the Office of Spiritual Culture Construction, and the NAC Logistics Department. Since it was reviewed, Jiang Chen did not comment further on the details.</br>
</br>
He just had questions over the number of performances.</br>
</br>
There are so many performances? Jiang Chen felt somewhat surprised and asked, Is there any problem with time?</br>
</br>
Of course not. Its from 8 PM to 2 AM. Wang Qing smiled and reported, We will activate the Holy Shield at 12 AM, and the gravitons over Wanghai will show a directional distribution. Under the rendering of radioactive dust, a vortex-shaped light curtain will appear over Wanghai.</br>
</br>
That must be spectacular, Jiang Chen said emotionally.</br>
</br>
Of course, Wang Qing nodded, That is one of the highlights of the whole celebration.</br>
</br>
One of the highlights? Are there any other repertoires? Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Of course, Wang Qing looked at Jiang Chen with joy, For example, I believe Generals opening speech at the celebration will be more exciting than the restart of the Holy Shield.</br>

</br>
Long live the NAC! Long live the General!</br>
</br>
HOHOHO!</br>
</br>
Holy Shield! Holy Shield!</br>
</br>
!</br>
</br>
October 1st, eight oclock in the evening.</br>
</br>
Without the interference of a single cloud, the pristine Moon gleamed down onto the streets.</br>
</br>
The suddenly lit lights illuminated the center of the stage into daytime and simultaneously, it ignited the enthusiasm of the audience. Cheers and shouts filled the entire circular venue and amplified the hyped atmosphere.</br>
</br>
If one could ignore the ruins and wreckages behind them, it was difficult to relate the inside of the stadium with the apocalyptic world after the nuclear war.</br>
</br>
The survivors released all the excitement in their hearts with pure roars and loudly declared their final victory to the end of the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Barbarism and civilization coexist, chaos and order coexist. It was the culture unique to the survivors.</br>
</br>
I have nothing more to say, please enjoy this great moment, this is a victory for all citizens of NAC!</br>
</br>
At the highest point of the stadium, Jiang Chen announced the beginning of the celebration.</br>
</br>
The moment after he finished the sentence, gorgeous and vivid fireworks decorated the night sky above Wanghai. The fireworks illuminated the entire stadium and surrounding ruins together. Amid thunderous applause and cheers, Jiang Chen looked around the entire venue, bathed in the zeal and admiration of everyone, waved his hand, and a touch of pride was seen in the upward bent corner of his mouth.</br>
</br>
After he had delivered the opening speech of the celebration, he turned and returned to the VIP room covered by ink-colored glass at the highest point of the gymnasium. Sun Jiao, Yao Yao, and the others were all here. Today, almost all the survivors of Fishbone Base were here. Only a few on duty and a large group of drones stayed behind.</br>
</br>
I like this place very much, Jiang Chen walked next to Sun Jiao, focused his attention on the stage in the center, and said. Our Army once thwarted the conspiracy of Harmony here. Two thousand NAC fighters now sleep peacefully here. The Gods Cane had blasted a huge pit here as a scar left by the war. Whether its a memorial or something else, its an impeccable place. If we have the opportunity to further refurbish this place, this can be a new landmark in Wanghai, maybe lets call itCity Center Stadium.</br>
</br>
I wonder if anyone said this to you before?</br>
</br>
What? Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Your taste in naming things is really bad, Sun Jiao rolled her eyes and joked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens face turned red and he coughed to hide his embarrassment.</br>
</br>
This is not the point, the point is the connotation, right, Yao Yao?</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, who was watching the performance on stage, turned around and cutely spat out her tongue. Then, she subtly looked away. Lin Lins shoulders vibrated as she tried her best to hide her laughter. Finally, she turned around and made a funny face at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked to Xiaorou with the intention to seek comfort, only to see that she was looking at him with a caring smile.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen felt that he had received 10,000 critical hits, and he protested in his mind.</br>
</br>
WHAT?!</br>
</br>
REALLY?!</br>
</br>
Is my naming skill that bad?</br>
</br>
Amongst the wild rock music, the celebration was pushed to a climax.</br>
</br>
The band that performed on stage was called Arrogant Girls, and it was said to be a top band from before the war. Most of the singers who appeared on stage afterward were stars from the pre-war world. In addition to singing performances, there were also some performances with defining wasteland characteristics.</br>
</br>
For example, a well-known lone traveler soloed a Death Claws and a certain veteran scavenger used the garbage he picked up to create a robot acrobatic troupe</br>
</br>
When the clock hit twelve at midnight, the atmosphere reached its peak.</br>
</br>
The great moment had finally arrived, and the Holy Shield restarted.</br>
</br>
The brass-colored light curtain turned into a solid-looking vortex right above the venue and began spreading layers of pale golden ripples around. The sky was framed with a faint gilt-edge that extended to the unreachable horizon, and the whole city was secluded by the rhythmic graviton flowing in the air. From today on, this city would become a paradise for survivors in Asia and the world, and the term apocalypse would no longer be associated with this city.</br>
</br>
At this moment, there was only silence.</br>
</br>
Everyone gazed up to pay the highest respect to the sky and the Holy Shield.</br>
</br>
Like the other survivors, Jiang Chen also looked up at the endless vortex that shrouded down, and a bold idea suddenly came into his mind.</br>
</br>
Should I build several urban defense systems in the other world?</br>
</br>
With this thing, strategic weapons will be useless</br>
</br>
Just as the thought was forming in his mind, a knock on the door suddenly interrupted his thoughts.</br>
</br>
After the door opened, Jiang Chen was slightly taken aback when he saw Wang Qing, he asked.</br>
</br>
Is there a problem?</br>
</br>
We have lost contact with the North American colony. Into the hallway outside of the room, Wang Qing said solemnly to Jiang Chen, It was our eleventh attempt to get in touch with the colony, but so far we have not received any response.</br>
</br>
What happened? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Its not clear for the time being, Wang Qing said seriously, At first we thought it was electromagnetic turbulence, but the electromagnetic turbulence could not last for so long. We can only make the assumption that something happened to the colony</br>
</br>
Electromagnetic turbulence was a special phenomenon in this world. Under normal circumstances, the interference of radiation to electromagnetic waves was negligible, but the premise was that this radiation would not interfere with the Earths magnetic field. This was an issue for central Pacific because it was the hardest-hit area for nuclear weapons and most of the nuclear explosions occurred in Low Earth orbit above the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
As we all know, the Low Earth orbit and the synchronous orbit were covered by the wreckage of space elevators, spacecrafts, and space stations, and had almost formed a ring of space junks. These space junks created a special effect under the action of radiation. The specific manifestation was that an unstable external magnetic field was applied to the original geomagnetic field.</br>
</br>
Affected by this external magnetic field, ultra-long-distance communication had become extremely unreliable, especially for trans-oceanic communication, where the frequency of communications was erratic, and loss of contact was a common occurrence. NAC researchers defined this phenomenon as electromagnetic turbulence to explain the loss of communication between the colony and the NAC headquarters.</br>
</br>
Wang Qings tone was uncertain when she said this.</br>
</br>
Although NAC established an outpost in North America only a year ago, it had never experienced such a long communication interruption. However, it did not mean such a situation was impossible. Now he could not determine whether the colony experienced issues, or electromagnetic turbulence occurred on an unprecedented scale.</br>
</br>
How long has the last cargo ship departed? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
Twenty-three days ago. Wang Qing gave a definite answer.</br>
</br>
Typically, how long will the cargo ship between the colony and the Port of Wanghai stay in North America? Jiang Chen thought while he touched his chin.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, about a week. However, that does not rule out any accidents, which may delay the cargo ship for a few days, Wang Qing replied hesitantly.</br>
</br>
Its October 1st. Lets wait two more weeks. Jiang Chen turned on the holographic screen of his watch and selected the calendar. His index finger swept along the number of days in the calendar, and finally stopped on October 14th, and he quickly made a decision, If there is still no news from the colony after two weeks, then we will send an army there.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1380: Empty</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A few days ago.</br>
</br>
A group of uninvited guests visited the colony established by NAC in California.</br>
</br>
DAMNIT, where did they go!</br>
</br>
Black Skull put one foot onto the seat inside the Governors Mansion, and he spat out the cigarette butt in his mouth.</br>
</br>
Three days ago, he brought his brothers to the NAC colony. However, neither the mercenaries patrolling near the colony nor the NAC officers who were in charge of cargo were seen.</br>
</br>
The entire colony seemed to have emptied overnight and only a half-built fortress and a construction site full of reinforced concrete were left.</br>
</br>
Out of awe of NAC, Black Skull waited with his brothers outside of the colony anxiously for three days. However, in these three days, his last little bit of awe was also consumed by the endless waiting.</br>
</br>
He had a group of slaves in his hands, all of whom were fine goods picked from fallout shelters in the desert between California and Nevada. Of course, the term fine goods was only applicable in NACs territory. Except for NAC, who would take these picky people that didnt do work?</br>
</br>
Without those lavish yellow-skinned buyers, these goods in his hands were outright trash! And they consumed more than 600 nutrient supplies every day!</br>
</br>
This kind of loss made him feel angry.</br>
</br>
Well, if this group of yellow people didnt plan to pay for their slaves, then he would personally go in and take the rewards himself.</br>
</br>
With this thought in mind, Black Skull and his brothers rushed into the empty fortress to loot. However, the reality was even more despairing. Someone had visited before him for there was not even an empty can in the warehouse, and all the valuables were ransacked by scavengers wandering in the wasteland of California.</br>
</br>
FU*K, where are these yellow-skinned monkeys! Beside the window of the office, Black Skull looked at the empty colony outside the window and cussed as he left behind the humility he had half a month ago.</br>
</br>
Could it be that they got into some serious trouble and all ran off? Behind him, a predator with a shaved mohawk stepped forward and scanned the dusty governor office, then said hesitantly, The National Guards have always regarded them as a thorn in their eyes. It is very likely that those iron boxes did this.</br>
</br>
I dont want to know what trouble they are in now; I just want to know what we should do with these slaves! Black Skull fumed. He smashed the table with the gun stock, pulled out Zhou Guopings chair in rage, and sat down, Tony Club, yes, yes! Which one of you remember how to contact them?</br>
</br>
Tony Club was a famous cannibal tribe in California. Except for NAC, perhaps only they understood the beauty of the blue skins. However, they never paid high for the salves destined to become food.</br>
</br>
But now Black Skull could not care less, he just wanted to end his loss. Even if a person only sold for ten bottle caps, he was willing to accept the deal!</br>
</br>
</br>
Boss The Mohawk hesitated and said,  Tony Club was suppressed by National Guards last month.</br>
</br>
These idiots! Black Skull cursed.</br>
</br>
There was not a voice in the office that once belonged to the governor, and everyone could see that the anger of their boss was approaching the critical point, and no one dared to speak up.</br>
</br>
When the boss anger seemed to dissipate a little, a mans face covered with radiation spots and did not look as strong as the other predators stepped forward and suggested.</br>
</br>
He was a strategist of the Black Skull Gang, and among all the people here, he was the only one who could offer words of advice to their boss.</br>
</br>
Boss, although we didnt find anyone from NAC, they left us the entire colony At this point, the strategist had a sullen smile. The fortress can serve as our new stronghold to grow our gang.</br>
</br>
While the idea did sound attractive, the thought of leaving the desert where he thrived on made Black Skull hesitate.</br>
</br>
There were no plump and juicy thorn fruits and radiation-resistant cacti in the plains, which meant that they would have to use other means to obtain nutrient supply and anti-radiation pills, such as plowing mutant plants like other survivors settlements. When one starts farming, many troubles often ensued.</br>
</br>
But the desert is our familiar place, such a big fortress</br>
</br>
Boss, the strategist persuaded diligently, Do you want to be a bandit who has no home, or do you want to become a warlord like Paul Revere and Brian Eddie? If we can secure this fortress, you can be the most powerful boss in California!</br>
</br>
Paul Revere was the leader of Steel City that commanded the entire California National Guard. And Brian Eddie was the president-elected by Liberty City and the leader of the California Militia Minuteman. They were the two most powerful men in California. Even the survivors on the far east coast were in awe of these two.</br>
</br>
Black Skull touched his chin and nodded slightly. He thought that what his subordinate said seemed to make sense.</br>
</br>
Although if he had to decide between a leader or a bandit, he would definitely choose the latter. However, he had grown tired of his life in the sand trapped in the cold wind and the unsettled life.</br>
</br>
Although NAC had left nothing behind, and the canned food and instant noodles in the warehouse were also raided, they left a lot of useful things, such as machine tools for making bullets, construction machineries for various purposes, and a lot of construction materials.</br>
</br>
He had people with guns and slaves who do hard work, so he had a chance to defend this unowned land.</br>
</br>
Call the brothers in the California desert and ask them to stop their work and bring all their belongings to the West Coast.</br>
</br>
Im going now! The Mohawk nodded and ran to the door quickly.</br>
</br>
Black Skull put his legs onto the table and put the rifle aside. Just as he was thinking about what else he needed to prepare, a melodious siren came from a distance.</br>
</br>
The people in the room were stunned, and they stared at each other.</br>
</br>
Black Skull immediately got up, walked quickly to the window facing the coast, and narrowed his eyes toward the harbor. At almost the same time, a predator ran in, panting, and reported.</br>
</br>
Boss, a cargo ship is approaching the port with the NAC flag!</br>
</br>
The predators in the room were rattled.</br>
</br>
SH*T! Are they back?!</br>
</br>
What do we do?! If they think we stole their canned food</br>
</br>
SHUT UP!</br>
</br>
With a snarling roar, Black Skull picked up his rifle and swept it toward the ceiling. Cement dust and plastic shavings spattered down onto the heads of those chattering. Everyone looked fearful, lowered their head, and were afraid to look directly at their boss.</br>
</br>
Whats on the cargo ship? Can you see it clearly? The vulture-like sight, filled with haze, stared at the trembling predator reporting at the door. Black Skull lowered his voice and asked, Is there power armors on the deck? Or soldiers with kinetic skeletons? And is there a NAC warship following behind?</br>
</br>
No, there is only one cargo ship. Fearful that the murderous demon may send a few bullets into his chest, the predator swallowed and replied with a trembling voice, There are only containers on the deck that are full of canned food</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1381: Army Expansion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the Holy Shield restarted, the sky above Wanghai was covered with a faint orange glow. The sunlight shined through the graviton barrier down to the land and stretched infinitely in the slowly moving radioactive dust. From a distance, it looked like an immortal ray of holy and sacred light.</br>
</br>
From the north to the south, the entire Wanghai was shrouded in the Holy Shield, isolated from the wasteland. Occasionally, mutants or predators would wander into the area and fight against NAC patrols, but since the Holy Shield activated, all the unruly people sighed in front of this unbreakable shield.</br>
</br>
In the four directions of south, east, north, and west, the NAC only left about 120 small and large entrances and exits. Each entrance was built with a guard post, and they were all guarded by the First Division led by Cheng Weiguo.</br>
</br>
Wanghai, guarded by the Holy Shield, seemed to become the safest place on Pan-Asia land. With the continuous influx of immigrants, the population of NAC continued to grow. In order to meet the demand for living space, the Sixth Street had pushed down the east wall with the consideration of expanding to the city center.</br>
</br>
Immigration not only brought labor but also poverty and crime.</br>
</br>
In order to digest these surplus labors and solve the problems caused by immigration, NAC used a rather simple and crude method</br>
</br>
Army expansion!</br>
</br>
The move was much in line with the style of the military government. All foreign survivors who wished to obtain NAC household registration had to either pay a settlement fee of 1,000 credits or serve in the NAC army for at least three years.</br>
</br>
As soon as this policy came out, more than 50,000 survivors were enlisted into the army in just one month. Some of the recruits started in military training while other recruits were incorporated into the logistics system and sent to NACs factories in other areas for production.</br>
</br>
Exhaust all resources to build up ones military power would lead to an economic recession, but this did not apply to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The scarce amount of resources meant that it was difficult to scale industries. The highly automated science meant that the demand for manpower was extremely low. Therefore, the Sixth Street could provide survivors with a very limited number of jobs.</br>
</br>
Whats more, the wasteland economy itself was based on the word violence. Whether it was scavengers or hunters or mercenaries protecting a trade route, everyone was equipped with weapons. The only real commodity that did not lack customers was not canned meat or instant noodles, but the shining bullets.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was more willing to refer to this military expansion as a wasteland version of government stimulus.</br>
</br>
To put it bluntly, instead of letting these bored survivors wander around and do nothing, it was better to put them together for centralized management and pay them a salary. Even if they just practiced marching in the barracks, it was better than letting them return to their old professions, killing people and causing havoc.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didnt let these people really sit around.</br>
</br>
Among the recruits, many of them were lone travelers with good marksmanship. Without actual skills, it was impossible to survive the perilous wasteland to arrive at the far Wanghai. Jiang Chen simply organized them into ten hunter corps and sent them to the inland areas west of Hongcheng to hunt for mutant furs and crystals.</br>
</br>
On the fifth day after the celebration, the escorting warship returned from North America and docked at the port on the outskirts of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
In order to rush back to participate in the celebration, the warship was sailing at full speed for almost a whole week. When the anchor dropped, the sailors on the ship eagerly jumped down. But when they learned the celebration was over, everyone looked disappointed.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, everyone received beer, pork, and credits distributed by the military government, and they were compensated for the hard work of risking their lives on the high sea.</br>
</br>
After they received their salary and benefits, most of the sailors on the ship went to the Sixth Street to relax on this not-so-long vacation. As for the captain of this warship, he was summoned to the General Mansion at the Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a lot to ask about the situation in the North American colony.</br>
</br>
We sent the cargo ship to the West Coast of North America and then began our return. Based on our past experience, as long as the cargo ship passed through the waters near Alaska, there was basically no danger. Even if there was, most of them were just small predator boats, the heavy machine guns on the cargo ship were more than enough to deal with several predators.</br>
</br>
After entering the waters near North America, we encountered electromagnetic turbulence. Communication over 30 nautical miles was practically lost, but electromagnetic turbulence also has its advantages. Those deep-sea mutant species that are extremely sensitive to electromagnetic waves will experience electromagnetic turbulence. Most of them will be lurking in waters below 500 meters. Even if we turn our sonar off, our ship can be unimpeded.</br>
</br>
On the other side of the desk, Captain Wang Haitao briefed Jiang Chen on the details of the mission.</br>
</br>
Okay, I see. Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua next to him for a second, then focused his attention back on Wang Haitao who was standing upright. He smiled and asked, The last question has nothing to do with this voyage. After you have spent so long on the sea, have you encountered any interesting mutant species?</br>
</br>
Interesting? It depends on how you define interesting. After he processed the information, the captain replied with a smile, Once we sailed on the golden waterway west of Cape Wales, we accidentally entered waters that were gleaming. We tried to cast a net into the sea, but we got a bunch of fluorescent clownfish with severe radiation levels. There are still a few that Ive kept in my captains room. Another time we were near Vancouver, and we saw a giant shark as large as half a warship and with teeth as long as two people. It directly bit off a giant whale twice the size of the Bohai Aircraft Carrier from the middle. The blood that gushed out colored the entire area red. I felt extremely lucky because I had turned on the sonar</br>
</br>
Okay, awesome. From now on, you can enjoy your vacation. Jiang Chen stood up, walked around the desk, and extended his right hand, But If I were you, I would rest well. There will be tasks waiting for you soon.</br>
</br>
Wang Haitao was flattered as he shook the Generals hand, then he stood upright in excitement and said with certainty and decisiveness.</br>
</br>
Guaranteed to complete the mission!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder, affirmed his past work, and then signal that he could leave.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen watched the captain leave, he sat down again, looked at the voice recorder on the corner of the table, and fell into deep thought.</br>
</br>
The North American colony may be in trouble. Han Junhua was the first to break the silence, A total of 500 soldiers are stationed in the colony, including 450 K1 kinetic skeletons, and 50 T-3 power armors. If its something that these weapons cant deal with, then its not a small problem.</br>
</br>
You were a Pan-Asia Cooperation officer, Jiang Chen looked to Han Junhua, Apart from the electromagnetic turbulence phenomenon, what elseI mean are there any weapons or other things that can artificially block long-distance communication?</br>
</br>
There are many methods. All-channel jamming radar base stations, wide-range electromagnetic wave shielding devices These two methods are the main communication shielding methods for Pan-Asia Cooperation. They can easily turn a city or even a province into a blackout zone in the radio network, Han Junhua explained.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens finger tapped repeatedly on the table, then he said while still in deep thoughts.</br>
</br>
In other words, there is still the possibility of human interference.</br>
</br>
I think so too. Han Junhua nodded.</br>
</br>
Send ground troops, Jiang Chen ordered after he contemplated a bit more, When our armored troops land on North America, all problems will be solved!</br>
</br>
Before sending ground troops, we need to understand what is going on in North America. Han Junhua cautiously proposed with her arms crossed in front of her chest, I suggest delegating this work to Beluga Station. Since their submarine can arrive in North American in the shortest time, they can send us first-hand information</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen interrupted Han Junhua, shook his head, and said.</br>
</br>
We dont need to bother the Beluga Station, we can send a reconnaissance force there.</br>
</br>
Its too slow. By taking a detour from the Bering Strait, we will have to wait more than a week for our reconnaissance force to reach California. Han Junhua objected.</br>
</br>
It wont take that long. Jiang Chen waved his hand, and a confident smile appeared. He raised one finger on his right hand. Our scouts can reach North America from Wanghai in an hour tops.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua looked at Jiang Chen. There was a rare surprise that rippled throughthe pupils that were as calm as the lake.</br>
</br>
After she was certain that Jiang Chen was not joking, she immediately asked.</br>
</br>
What are you going to do?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Youll find out in two days.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Inside the Sixth Street Inner Circle, in the Near Street Restaurant.</br>
</br>
Although it was the property of the Zhao Group, there were rumors that the General himself had a lot of shares in it. Because the restaurant was in the most prosperous area of Sixth Street, and it always received the freshest ingredients, this restaurant had naturally become the darling of the upper class. Even survivors in the far south had occasionally heard of its good name.</br>
</br>
In this era where even humans were more or less mutated, NAC somehow obtained unmutated prawns and started aquaculture in the radiation-free Garden of Eden. This type of crystal-clear river prawn was delicious, and it immediately became sought after by the upper class once it was made available, and even became a topic of discussion with the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
But now, a giant plate of the expensive river prawns was placed on the table, sprinkled with chili oil, garlic, and spices, and the attractive fragrance could be smelt from far away. From this dish alone, it was easy to tell the extraordinary status of these diners.</br>
</br>
They were key members of the NAC military government system, capitalists from the Sixth Street or the Hangzhou Merchants Association, or the leaders of the chambers of commerce and merchant traders from other regions.</br>
</br>
But these people were obviously very low-key and dined in a private suite. If they were the new rich from the different colonies or from the South, they would definitely choose the most conspicuous spot of the restaurant to ensure everyone in the restaurant noticed their lavishness.</br>
</br>
Haha, congratulations to Captain Zheng for your promotion!</br>
</br>
Congratulations! Congratulations! Remember to bring back some souvenirs from North America!</br>
</br>
RIGHT! I heard that the mud crab roe there are white, just like the breasts of the blondes there.</br>
</br>
No blondes okay? Dont be so vulgar! Remember that General told us last time? You need to be more educated and civilized! Cant you just say as white as milkburp</br>
</br>
Hahaha, captain, who do you think is more educated?</br>
</br>
The suite was full of joy and chatter.</br>
</br>
A few burly men sat around the table, grinning and joking, as they took turns toasting the boss who was sitting at the top of the table. Although their tone was respectful, there was a hint of teasing and joking mixed in.</br>
</br>
These jokers were no one else but the guards under Jiang Chens command.</br>
</br>
The former captain Lu Fan was promoted to the head of the Fourth Division and was now stationed in Shangjing, guarding the northern border of the NAC. The current captain was the former deputy captain Zheng Shanhe. The NAC had just gone through a round of army expansion, and there were rumors about the establishment of the Fifth Division. Based on NACs usual tradition, the most likely division commander would come from the Generals Guards.</br>
</br>
It was originally something to be happy about, but at this moment, Captain Zheng looked a bit concerned.</br>
</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
Naturally because of that North American colony!</br>
</br>
Although the wind of the expedition had not been let out, it was no secret that NAC was preparing to send troops to North America. The entire North American colony had lost contact with NAC, and all kinds of bizarre rumors began to spread in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
It would be not a surprise if the General launched another conquest of his own, which meant the accompanying captain would be promoted. Regardless of whether or not the newly formed division would be called the Fifth Division or NAC North American Division, it would definitely not be able to come back with General Jiang.</br>
</br>
What congratulations, if anyone of you makes fun of me again, I will personally bring you to the colony. Zheng Shanhes eyes widened, and the soldiers that were about to toast again immediately pulled back their cups that were in the air, and instead, downed their drinks.</br>
</br>
Everyone enjoyed the Sixth Street. Except for those who couldnt obtain a footing in the Sixth Street, no one chose to go to the colony.</br>
</br>
People wouldnt even leave if they got promoted!</br>
</br>
Captain Lu can return home every once in a while. If I go to North America, Im afraid I wont be able to come back once in a few years. After Zheng Shanhe took a swig of the beer, he let out a sigh, felt the coldness that slid down his throat, and said.</br>
</br>
Although he complained, he didnt feel any dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
But whenever he thought of his newly married wife, he felt depressed.</br>
</br>
Captain rest assured, a subordinate stood up, raised his glass, and said solemnly, You, like Captain Li and Captain Lu, will always be our captain! When you are away, the brothers will help you take care of your family.</br>
</br>
Thats right! We are here!</br>
</br>
Who dares to bother my sister-in-law, I will break his legs!</br>
</br>
Several other guards also stood up and raised their glass.</br>
</br>
After all, they were all old men that conquered with the General for many years. Although they loved to joke around, their friendship was impeccable.</br>
</br>
Please and thank you. With a sigh, Zheng Shanhe raised his glass.</br>
</br>
After a glass of beer, everyone sat down.</br>
</br>
Just when Zheng Shanhe was about to say something, the clear reminder sound echoed.</br>
</br>
The faint fluorescence flickered on the watch, and the word Regroup appeared on the screen.</br>
</br>
All the guards in the room were surprised. They looked at each other, then immediately darted up. After Zheng Shanghe threw a check on the table, he rushed out the door without looking back at the delicious food on the table.</br>
</br>
What is this?</br>
</br>
In the backyard of the mansion, Jiang Chen examined from head to toe the power armor in front of him. From a structural point of view, this power armor was very similar to the X-1 experimental type he retrieved from the underground city of Shangjing. The incredibly long type-57 portable electromagnetic pulse cannon behind it looked almost identical to the X-1.</br>
</br>
My sisters and I made some modifications on the basis of the X-1 model. Lilith optimized the calculation logic of the aiming assistance program, and finally completed the unfinished design of the Pan-Asia Cooperation. Now you can call it the N-100, which is different from the original experimental type, As Lin Lin explained, the corner of her lips curved up and showed a hint of proudness.</br>
</br>
After the T-series power armor was upgraded to T-4, there was no follow-up development plan. Because for Jiang Chen, the current two mainstream power armors of the NAC and Celestial Trade, the T-3 aviation type and the T-4 land combat type, were already capable in most battlefields. Rather than investing in a field without any competition, it was better to use scientific research resources in more useful places.</br>
</br>
But unexpectedly, Lin Lin and her sisters completed the follow-up design of the X-1 experimental model, which caught Jiang Chen by surprise.</br>
</br>
Why is it called N-100 instead of N-1? He touched the head of the power armor, then looked at the code printed on the back, and asked with confusion.</br>
</br>
Because the N-1 is an early power armor enlisted by Pan-Asia Cooperation in the last century. It was developed by East Asia Heavy Industries. Later, the N-series was abolished for various reasons and replaced by the standard that has been used until now, that is, the police P-series and military T-series, Lin Lin shrugged and explained in a casual tone, In order to avoid duplication or confusion, I simply named this power armor that is unlikely to have an updated model N-100. As for what letter the X should be replaced with, I am afraid that only those who dont know how many light-years away will know.</br>
</br>
Regardless, Jiang Chen looked at Lin Lin and smiled, Thank you for doing so much for me.</br>
</br>
He did not just thank her for this power armor.</br>
</br>
From the earliest Eden Project, Lin Lin had helped him in many ways.</br>
</br>
To be honest, even now he could recall the scene when he scared the little girl into peeing her pants in Fallout Shelter 005. He could not stop himself from feeling embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome, Lin Lin avoided Jiang Chens gaze and looked to the side with her cheeks red. She forced a cough, then said with a trembling voice, I heard that North America is very dangerousAnyway, you be careful over there.</br>
</br>
Mhmm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen responded with a smile and moved his hand closer to Lin Lins head to rub her silver-white hair. But for some reason, as soon as his hand touched her hair, she blushed and ran away.</br>
</br>
When he looked at the girl that ran away, Jiang Chen paused, then awkwardly put his hand down.</br>
</br>
When he turned around, Sun Jiao stood at the door of the backyard. She looked in his direction with mockery in her eyes and playfully whistled at him.</br>
</br>
Youre flirting with another woman in front of me before you leave. Should I punish you?</br>
</br>
Lets talk about it when I come back No, well see who punishes who by then!</br>
</br>
Damnit, I got fooled!</br>
</br>
After he glared at Sun Jiao for a second, Jiang Chen left in her provocative gaze as he threw the power armor into the storage dimension and walked to the exit in the backyard.</br>
</br>
I dont want to persuade you Sun Jiao looked at Jiang Chen, who walked to her and gently bit her lower lip. She reached out to fix his collar and said with unwillingness, Anyway, if you have to go, be careful over there.</br>
</br>
I know, He squeezed her hand, then the sincere expression on his face was suddenly replaced by a smirk, Wait for me to come back to punish you.</br>
</br>
After he left this sentence, Jiang Chen unexpectedly slapped Sun Jiaos butt.</br>
</br>
The mood was instantly ruined.</br>
</br>
In the latters humiliated exclaim and a flurry of punches, Jiang Chen laughed and ran to the living room. When he passed, he did not forget to wave goodbye to Yao Yao and Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
Goodbye, wait for me to come back. By the way, this is going to be a far trip. Do you have any souvenirs you want?</br>
</br>
Xiaorou, who sat upright in the living room, looked at the fooling around at the entrance with a grin.</br>
</br>
Just bring yourself back.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, who was next to her, waved and said in her soft voice.</br>
</br>
You dont need to bring any souvenirs, just come back safely.</br>
</br>
You guys really dont want souvenirs? Okay, Ill see then. Jiang Chen took a deep breath, then suddenly stepped forward and kissed Sun Jiao, who was waving her fists with a look of embarrassment. Just as she was processing what had just happened, he had quickly put on his shoes and disappeared out the door</br>

</div></br>
</br>

</br>
In the Shenxiang Town not covered by the Holy Shield, a silver-white aerospace plane was parked on the temporarily constructed airport runway. Jiang Chen brought the masterpiece designed and manufactured by Future Heavy Industries to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
From Han Junhuas eyes and in a technological perspective, the shape of this aerospace plane was quite retro.</br>
</br>
It was unlikely anyone from the NAC talent pool could pilot this old antique into the air. But Jiang Chen obviously had considered this issue. At this moment, it was the new intelligent pilot of Future Military  The Matador in the pilot seat.</br>
</br>
The robot skillfully turned on the instruments on the control panel, and it gave Jiang Chen outside the cabin a thumbs up.</br>
</br>
This is Han Jinhua examined this antique in front of her with surprise in her tone.</br>
</br>
Aerospace G100, a masterpiece from the 27th Research Institute, a dual-use aerospace private jet. It can fly to a space station in the synchronous orbit and quickly arrive at any airport in the world within one hour. Its more than sufficient to send a twelve-man reconnaissance team. Jiang Chen gave the aerospace plane a new inventor and labeled it as the invention of the research institute dedicated to NAC. He then put his hand on the wing of the plane, turned around, and smiled confidently at Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
Are you sure you can find an airport for you to land? Han Junhua had a rare hint of uncertainty in her tone.</br>
</br>
There is no need to land, we are going to parachute down. All it needs to do is descend after approaching the West Coast, and then fly at a reduced speed when passing over Los Angeles</br>
</br>
Han Junhua opened her mouth still full of doubts, but in the end, she decided not to ask any of the questions. Instead, she just nodded, If you insistAlthough I would recommend the safer strategy to send other candidates to North America.</br>
</br>
I thought about it carefully, and its best for me to go there. Besides, Im also very curious about what is going on in North America. Its just that the probability of encountering danger is not high on reconnaissance, so I can take this opportunity to see it. Jiang Chen made a gesture to the twelve guards who were ready to go, indicating Zheng Shanhe that they could start boarding.</br>
</br>
In order to save the limited capacity of the Aerospace G100 to move more personnel and ammunition to North America. At this moment, all the guards were equipped with the light T-3 aviation type.</br>
</br>
The takeoff steps proceeded gracefully. The Matador robot in the cockpit turned on the instruments while it broadcasted the standard procedures.</br>
</br>
The engine is charging. All passengers, please sit in your seats. Make sure your seat belts are fastened and do not leave your seats.</br>
</br>
Charging completed, the engine is entering ignition countdown.</br>
</br>
10</br>
</br>
9</br>
</br>
2</br>
</br>
1</br>
</br>
Ignite!</br>
</br>
</br>
When the emotionless digital voice faded, the engine ejected an eerie blue ray that pushed the Aerospace G100 towards the horizon.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by the gravitational pull, Jiang Chen watched the scenery outside the window fly backward, and soon the entire aerospace plane flew into the blue sky to the farther deep space.</br>
</br>
The jitter of the fuselage quickly stabilized. It turned out that even in the apocalypse, the safety of the Aerospace G100 was reliable. After he placed the helmet to the side, Jiang Chen selected the standby mode in the operation interface of the power armor, relaxed his muscles, closed his eyes, and started to rest.</br>
</br>
In fact, before he set off, he had been thinking about a possibility; whether Zhou Guoping decided to betray him and establish his own empire.</br>
</br>
However, after careful consideration, Jiang Chen quickly denied this possibility.</br>
</br>
Not to mention whether Zhou Guoping was foolish enough to betray NAC for the sake of becoming an unreliable warlord in North America. Long before he set off from Wanghai, Jiang Chen had already promised him that if he proved his ability to govern in the colony, he could continue to rule like a warlord.</br>
</br>
If he managed the colony poorly</br>
</br>
It was likely that he wouldnt even want to stay there for half a second longer.</br>
</br>
Under such circumstances, Jiang Chen couldnt think of the possibility of Zhou Guopings rebellion. Instead, it was possible that this idiot, who used to be a bandit, made a fool of himself in North America, and was ganged up by angry North American indigenous people.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen prepared for two possibilities.</br>
</br>
If he discovered that Zhou Guoping wanted to pursue independence, Jiang Chen would directly activate the slave chip implanted in the back of his brain, take his life, and then appoint a new governor to get the colony back on track as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
In the latter case, if the North American colony was overthrown by the local survivors or destroyed. Then, depending on whether Zhou Guoping was still alive, he would adopt two completely different strategies to solve the issues facing the colony.</br>
</br>
The altitude continued to rise, and it didnt take long for the Aerospace G100 to fly above the exosphere.</br>
</br>
Countless pieces of space junk formed a belt of asteroids and were connected together in outer space. Light blue sparks occasionally passed among the debris, like beautiful and deadly silver snakes. It was the first time Jiang Chen has seen Low Earth orbit at such a close distance, and now everything seemed to be telling him that the real situation was far worse than he thought.</br>
</br>
Jiang Lin did not joke with him.</br>
</br>
It was a pipe dream to develop the space industry in this environment.</br>
</br>
How did those colonization ships fly out of the Earth</br>
</br>
For safety reasons, the Aerospace G100 did not approach the synchronous orbit in the journey but chose to sail on the edge of the atmosphere. This area was relatively safe and most of the space junks were either burnt out or slowed down here. Therefore, there were basically no dangerous junks in this region.</br>
</br>
It took more time than expected. Finally, in the third hour after taking off, Jiang Chen woke up from a nap after hearing the beep. At this moment, Aerospace G100 finally returned to the lower stratosphere.</br>
</br>
Were descending and arriving at Los Angeles ahead. I wish you a pleasant journey.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by the emotionless digital voice, the seat belts on the seats were unlocked.</br>
</br>
Prepare for airborne. Jiang Chen pulled off his seat belt and ended the standby mode, stood up from the chair, waved his arm attached to steel, and checked whether the engine behind him could start normally.</br>
</br>
The other twelve guards also got up one after another and gathered towards the cabin door.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe walked to the very front, took a deep breath, looked to Jiang Chen, looked at his comrades, then said loudly, Assembly point at Los Angeles Santa Monica Airport, all units Immediately gather at the assembly point, do you understand!</br>
</br>
Roger!</br>
</br>
GO! GO!</br>
</br>
The cabin door opened, and the howling cold wind rolled in, instantly sweeping away the heat in the cabin. Holding onto the cabin frame, Zheng Shanhe jumped out first, followed by the guards behind him, and finally General Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time Jiang Chen has parachuted down. Everything was natural and smooth.</br>
</br>
After the attitude drop to the threshold, the vortex engine behind turned on instantly, and the blue flame spurted out and stopped their downward acceleration. As an experimental model uncompleted even after the end of the war, the N-100 on Jiang Chen was indeed much more stable than the T-3 in airborne operations.</br>
</br>
When the steel boots stepped through the clouds, his sight suddenly became clear.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chens pupils dilated slightly.</br>
</br>
It was his first time overlooking apocalyptic North America.</br>
</br>
Although it was only a corner of the West Coast.</br>
</br>
In general, the war did not favor either side.</br>
</br>
This place was as bad as the Pan-Asia continent.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
_Min_Rainystars</br>
</br>
Santa Monica Airport.</br>
</br>
The barren concrete road was covered with weeds, and a few hideous zombies occasionally strolled outside the terminal hall. Unlike the zombies in Pan-Asia Cooperation, these zombies were not formed because of the X1 bacterial infection, but purely because of radiation, which caused their brain to degenerate and turned them into the walking dead with only the instinct to eat.</br>
</br>
Because it was difficult to form large groups of zombies common in Pan-Asia, these zombies were not dangerous. As long as the survivors were careful to not get scratched by their claws stained with mutant bacteria and radiation, any survivor could deal with them. The real danger in the North American wasteland was not the zombies, but the strange mutants.</br>
</br>
According to unconservative estimates, the number and danger of mutants in North America were at least three times that of the Pan-Asia region.</br>
</br>
In the dark corners, a mutant poisonous scorpion suddenly threw its tail with a hook, then dragged a struggling zombie into the corner and open its sharp mandibles.</br>
</br>
The prey gradually stopped moving. Just as this mutant poisonous scorpion was about to feast, it suddenly stopped biting as if it had sensed some movement; its small eyes quickly turned vigilantly.</br>
</br>
But before it could detect anything, the shock wave of the explosion blew it away.</br>
</br>
BOOM!!</br>
</br>
The explosion overlapped with the sound of the armors breaking through the air. When both feet slammed on the ground, the flat concrete road was full of spider-web-like cracks.</br>
</br>
Success. Jiang Chen pressed on the helmet, stood up straight, and shook the dust from the power armor. He then looked at the airport not far away with a grin, What a coincidence, I landed near the airport without satellite navigation.</br>
</br>
Lurking in the shadows, the mutant poisonous scorpion was rubbing its sharp fangs nervously. From the iron lump in front of it, it felt danger. The creature followed its instinct and cautiously approached Jiang Chen from behind. Suddenly, it threw out its deadly tail.</br>
</br>
The air whizzed and a strong force lashed at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Without even looking, he raised his right hand, and the tactical rifle spouted out fierce flames. Green blood splattered everywhere, and the firepower turned the half-human tall scorpion into several pieces.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen shot this mutant poisonous scorpion, a dozen pairs of eyes were lurking in the dark.</br>
</br>
To be precise, they were fixated on the power armor on his body.</br>
</br>
Power armor God, its a power armor! In the office of the airport building, a man with a shaved head squatted cautiously by the window and secretly looked at the power armor downstairs. His two mung-bean-sized pupils were filled with envy and greed.</br>
</br>
Is it a member of the National Guard? Or is it a Liberty City Militia? The brawny black man grabbed his rifle tightly and asked nervously.</br>
</br>
</br>
Its notit fell from the sky, it should be a little mouse that got out of the fallout shelter! Sh*t, we have to find a way to get that power armor. Hardy licked his dry lips and a fierceness appeared in his eyes.</br>
</br>
But what should we do? The black man named Sim hesitated.</br>
</br>
Brand new power armor, mostly likely a little mouse that got out of the fallout shelter, Hardy said nervously as he bit his thumb. Let Jessica go She often deals with the blue skins. The sl*t knows how to deceive them.</br>
</br>
Just as the predators were planning how theyd take the power armor on his body, Jiang Chen raised his rifle again and killed a few more zombies wandering at the airport gate, then he set the coordinates of the gathering spot on the map.</br>
</br>
Because there was no satellite to guide the airborne, and they happened to encounter a strong air current just when they were falling, their landing positions were quite scattered.</br>
</br>
He heard from Zheng Shanhe say that when he landed, he stepped on a cockroachs nest with one foot, and now he was covered with green stinky juice.</br>
</br>
Since they were not in a hurry, Jiang Chen told the hapless guy to go to the ditch on the nearby map first and wash away the radioactive stinky juice. He didnt want to speak when they gathered while smelling the stench of mutant cockroaches.</br>
</br>
Shortly after he set up the coordinate, a scream came from the airport building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up only to see a woman, dressed as a scavenger, being forced by a group of zombies onto the platform outside the airport building.</br>
</br>
The woman hurriedly jammed the handle of the glass door with a folding chair, pulled out the pistol from her pocket, and pulled the trigger at the glass door smashed by the zombies. However, the gunshot did not appear. She threw the pistol aside in despair and retreated to the railing on the outside of the platform.</br>
</br>
Just when she was in despair and did not know what to do, she suddenly noticed Jiang Chen downstairs and was overjoyed. Then she began to wave her arms.</br>
</br>
HELP! Help me! I need help!</br>
</br>
Under the tousled brown curly hair was a beautiful face. If it werent for her panicked expression, he would give her a seventy based on Western standards. However, she was desperately waving her arms, and the whiteness in front of her chest under the torn clothes was even visible.</br>
</br>
The female survivor surrounded by zombies happened to appear near the power armor.</br>
</br>
Everything was such a coincidence like a popcorn blockbuster rolled down from the Hollywood assembly line.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a sly grin under the steel helmet. Although this beautys acting skill was great, and the extras outside the door were also helpful, he still spotted the issues right away.</br>
</br>
The biggest issue was.</br>
</br>
How did a rookie scavenger like this manage to get here after being chased by zombies?</br>
</br>
He did not go up to save her right away, instead, he turned on the life signal detector on the power armor.</br>
</br>
A layer of red ripples swept across the radar screen, and soon a series of red dots symbolizing sources of life were marked on the screen.</br>
</br>
The sly smile soon turned colder. Rather than saving her, Jiang Chen crossed his arms in front of his chest and started to watch her performance.</br>
</br>
When the beauty saw that Jiang Chen hadnt come up, she was taken aback for a moment, and then a pleading expression appeared.</br>
</br>
Please! For Gods sake, save me! I dont want to be eaten by them! I will do whatever you want me to do. I I can even be your slave.</br>
</br>
Any rookie that came out of the fallout shelter would definitely turn hot-headed and save the pleading beauty. No, the rookie would have already rushed to her from the start. Unfortunately, Jiang Chen didnt just get out of the fallout shelter but came to North America to spread socialism.</br>
</br>
You meanyou want to be my slave? Jiang Chen asked with a smile after he turned on the speaker on the armor.</br>
</br>
Yes! I will! Please help me! The beauty nodded desperately.</br>
</br>
Since you said so, then I hope you will remember your promise. Jiang Chen sighed and stepped heavily on the ground with his right foot.</br>
</br>
The armor bounced up from the ground, and the vortex engine ejected blue flames.</br>
</br>
When the woman saw the power armor fly towards her, she looked joyful, but in her mind, she cussed, Fu*k you. Im begging you now but youll soon find out whats going to happen to you after.</br>
</br>
The power armor naturally crushed the zombies.</br>
</br>
When both feet slammed on the ground, Jiang Chen raised his tactical rifle, and a string of bullets harvested the zombies behind the glass door.</br>
</br>
He then turned off the safety, put away the smoking rifle, and looked at the disheveled beauty.</br>
</br>
Thank you, God. I really didnt know what to do without you. The woman gazed at Jiang Chen passionately, gently combed the hair near her ear back, and said while blusing, As agreed, from now on, I will be your woman.</br>
</br>
What is your name? Jiang Chen asked emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Jessica. Jessicas index finger lightly pressed on the front armor of the power armor. Jessica raised her head and looked at Jiang Chen with admiration, Can you show me your face? My hero?</br>
</br>
The poison was already hidden under her tongue. Once she waited for the helmet to open, the affectionate gaze and the kiss would even make Superman kneel under her high heels. The thought of the power armor will soon belong to her made Jessica extremely excited.</br>
</br>
She had already planned that when she controlled the power armor, she would immediately settle the grudge with Hardy.</br>
</br>
No problem, Ms. Jessica, but before that Jiang Chen dropped the electronic collar on the ground, and said cunningly, Just like we agreed before, you have to put this on first.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1385: Encountering A Fellow Townsman</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jessicas expression changed when she saw the electronic collar on the ground.</br>
</br>
Whats wrong? My slave lady. Jiang Chen joked, If you dont know how to wear it, I can teach you.</br>
</br>
You dont need this kind of thing to restrain me at all. I said I will be yours from now on. Jessica bit her dry lower lip and looked at Jiang Chen with pitiful eyes, No matter what you do, I will not resist.</br>
</br>
Are you kidding me!</br>
</br>
Once you put this thing on, your life wont be yours.</br>
</br>
She started to sense danger from this iron robot in front of her, and out of instinct, she took two steps back.</br>
</br>
You dont want to keep your promise? Jiang Chens tone changed. The rifle that he previously put away reappeared in his hand and he aimed at the frightened Jessica. With slyness in his tone, Jiang Chen said, Im not kidding, I advise you to do what I say.</br>
</br>
Just now, a voice with an African accent came from the door.</br>
</br>
A black guy stood there with a bazooka on his shoulder. His finger was already on the trigger and he stared at Jiang Chen with warning in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Okay buddy, put down the gun. Even if youre in your power armor, you definitely dont want to try this.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not show the slightest concern with the bazooka aimed at him. He turned his head slightly and focused his attention on the arrogant man and the ten gunners with ragged clothing, he then asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
You are?</br>
</br>
I The eyepieces on the tactical helmet made Sim a little flustered. He swallowed and continued out of fear, We are her companions, survivors gathered around the airport.</br>
</br>
Where were you just now? Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Sim couldnt find an answer to this question as he muttered for a long time. Next to him, Hardy slapped the back of Sims head, walked to Jiang Chen, and used a threatening tone, Thank you for saving our companion, I owe you a favor, but I hope you let her go now, otherwise</br>
</br>
Jessica was still useful, and Hardy didnt want to lose her like that.</br>
</br>
This sl*t not only made the brothers feel good every night, but she would also occasionally bring back some silly blue skins.</br>
</br>
Otherwise? Jiang Chen laughed as he responded.</br>
</br>
Otherwise As Hardy chuckled, he suddenly threw a grenade hidden in his sleeve while he cursed, Otherwise I will f*ck you up!</br>
</br>
The smoke exploded, and Jessica rolled to the side.</br>
</br>
The high-pressure nitrogen burst out and dispersed the dense smoke in an instant.</br>
</br>
A bazooka pierced through the thick smoke and flew at Jiang Chen. But without any attempt to evade the flying danger, he reached out with his left hand and compressed the nitrogen gas into a wall, which blew away the bazooka.</br>
</br>
SH*T! FIRE!</br>
</br>
When Hardy realized that the sneak attack had failed, he cussed, fired a few shots with his pistol, then ordered the predators behind him to open fire on Jiang Chen while he sneaked to take cover. However, before he could run two steps, he was shot in the thigh and started to howl on the ground rolling.</br>
</br>
</br>
Pewpewpew!!!</br>
</br>
The tactical rifle unleashed its power, and the beating hearts had turned into scarlet flames, which were reflected on Jiang Chens retina. The moment he pulled the triggered, it seemed that every cell in the body was relaxing as if killing had become an instinct.</br>
</br>
This long-lost feeling</br>
</br>
Devil! He is the devil!</br>
</br>
When they saw their companions fall one after another into pools of blood, the predators hiding behind cover finally began to collapse, they screamed and fled backward.</br>
</br>
When the guards in T-3 power armor heard gunshots from the airport terminal, they started to arrive one after another. When the predators realized that their enemy was not just one power armor, they completely lost the courage. They dropped their weapons and knelt down to beg for mercy.</br>
</br>
Look at what I found, There were still a few pieces of algae hanging onto his armor as Zheng Shanhe held the disheveled Jessica in his hand and walked to Jiang Chen who was standing in the waiting room. He threw her on the ground with a grin and said, She was hiding in the ventilation duct.</br>
</br>
Put this on for her. Jiang Chen pointed to the collar on the ground.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
NO DONT Jessica backed away in horror. She tried to get up from the ground, but the power armor behind her did not make her wish come true. Without a word, Zheng Shanhe grabbed her neck and snapped the electronic collar on her.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at Jessica, who had turned pale, with a sneer, then ignored her. He then walked to the predator named Hardy. At this moment, his thigh had been bandaged and the blood finally stopped flowing out. But based on where he was shot, this leg was unlikely to walk again.</br>
</br>
I will ask you a question, and you will answer the question. Jiang Chen looked down at Hardy, lifted his chain, and said concisely, If I find you lying, then I will get rid of your other leg too.</br>
</br>
Hardy swallowed, then nodded like a chicken pecking at rice.</br>
</br>
How many people do you have in total?</br>
</br>
One hundred fifty-sevenno, one hundred fifty-eight. Hardy replied with a shiver.</br>
</br>
These people are? Jiang Chen pointed to the survivors who squatted in the corner of the terminal hall with shackles on their hands.</br>
</br>
Prisoners.</br>
</br>
Prisoners? Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, You still keep prisoners? I advise you to answer my questions honestly.</br>
</br>
What I said is true! When Hardy saw Jiang Chen fiddling with the rifle, there was panic in his eyes as he articulated quickly, Some skilled slaves are very popular in Liberty City! There are some people</br>
</br>
There are some people? Jiang Chen asked with interest.</br>
</br>
Those cannibal tribes offer good prices too Hardy replied in a quiet voice, with his head lowered while he trembled on the ground.</br>
</br>
This bunch of scumbags. Zheng Shanhe spat out and cursed.</br>
</br>
Hardy buried his head and didnt dare to say a word. He honestly accepted the words thrown at him.</br>
</br>
Without worrying about him anymore, Jiang Chen glanced at the slaves squatting in the corner, and then at his captain Zheng Shanhe, It just so happens that we need manpower to clean the airport. You can pick a few clever guys to be supervisors.</br>
</br>
After a rough glance, there were about thirty prisoners caught by the predators, most of them looked malnourished. It was unlikely to expect these people to do any hard work, but they could definitely be the overseers and watch these predators work.</br>
</br>
Except for the two who ran away, there were about 80 predators captured by his guards. These men were more than enough to repair the airport runway. Now Jiang Chen was only short of the overseers who looked after these slaves. After all, he only had a few electronic collars. It was impossible to separate combat power from his guards to look after these prisoners.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Zheng Shanhe walk towards the slaves of the predators, then he returned to Jessica, knelt down, and pinched her chin. He looked at her painful eyes begging for mercy, and said in a mocking tone, I will give you a task, you can only respond with yes.</br>
</br>
Because she couldnt speak, Jessica nodded desperately.</br>
</br>
You will take care of these people for me, Jiang Chen pointed to Hardy who was sitting in the corner, and then pointed outside the door. We need someone to clean the airport runway. Do as I say. I promise you will be safe and sound. If I find you playing tricks behind my back, your head will explode. You should understand what you are wearing on your neck.</br>
</br>
After he finished these words, Jiang Chen threw the painful and desperate Jessica to the ground. There was no need to pity or cherish a sl*t like this. When he saw the expression on her face, instead of feeling any guilt, he felt like she deserved this punishment.</br>
</br>
After he watched Zheng Shanhe choose the overseer among the group of prisoners, Jiang Chen was about to take a tour outside, but he suddenly heard a familiar accent behind him.</br>
</br>
Wait, you are you from NAC?</br>
</br>
Including Zheng Shanhe, several of the guards in the room all stopped what they were doing and looked at the person who stood up.</br>
</br>
With unexpectedness, Jiang Chen looked back at the prisoner, walked to him, and examined the man from head to toe with intrigue.</br>
</br>
Do you know NAC?</br>
</br>
I not only know, after the rescue he had been waiting for finally arrived, with a relieved expression on his face, Han Yue almost cried with excitement, I, Im a colonist from the Sixth Street!</br>
</br>
What is your name?</br>
</br>
My name is Han Yue,</br>
</br>
Why are you here? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
This is a long story, his eyes fell into reminiscence, and a look of shock gradually appeared on Han Yues malnourished face. He gulped down, and slowly began to narrate to Jiang Chen what happened that day, It was a week ago, our cargo ship docked at the port</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1386: Clue</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A week ago, the NAC cargo ship docked at the port, but unexpectedly, it was not their compatriots who went to North America first that welcomed them, but a group of bandits with guns.</br>
</br>
There were indeed many weapons on the cargo ship, but the firepower was still far inferior compared to the predators. These predators quickly attacked the deck and captured the wounded soldiers and colonists on the ship. Based on Han Yues narration, he jumped into the sea in order to escape the predators.</br>
</br>
How many of them were there? Jiang Chen asked after he thought for a moment.</br>
</br>
I dont know. The situation was chaotic. There were bullets and explosions everywhere. About a hundred people? Maybe more than two hundred. In short, their firepower was very fierce, not just heavy machine guns and rocket launchers, but even drones and a few armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
It was impossible for a few armored vehicles to take down the NAC colony in North America, and even with fifty more armored vehicles, it was still impossible. There were fifty power armors in the colony, which could already make up a quarter of the power armor brigade, plus 450 sets of kinetic skeletons. While Jiang Chen was not arrogant to the point where he believed that he could sweep the West Coast with these weapons, it was more than sufficient to defend their base, especially with so many stationary weapons built into the fortress.</br>
</br>
How many people escaped besides you? Jiang Chen then asked.</br>
</br>
I dont know there may be one or two more. I saw someone falling in the water, but I couldnt tell whether it was a corpse or a living person At this point, the expression on Han Yues face was a little ashamed. After all, he chose to escape.</br>
</br>
Its okay, youre not a soldier. Its not shameful to run away. Jiang Chen seemed to read what he was thinking, patted him on the shoulder, then said, Were there any signs on those predators? Or something like a flag? Things like that?</br>
</br>
While he spoke, Jiang Chen took a rag that was stained and painted with a red airplane.</br>
</br>
It was the symbol of the Airport Gang. The indigenous people in North America seemed to like to engage in performance art. When Jiang Chen went downstairs, he saw this rag in the center of the airports second-floor lobby. It annoyed him, so he tore it down.</br>
</br>
When Han Yue saw this flag, he searched deep in his memory for a while, suddenly his eyes lit up, and he said, I remember. All of them wore black masks with the same symbol painted in white paint.</br>
</br>
What symbol?</br>
</br>
A skeleton!</br>
</br>
A white skull?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin.</br>
</br>
Based on this clue, he could deduct that it was probably the Skeleton Gang or the White Skeleton Gang that occupied the colony. However, Jiang Chen still was not convinced by the fact that a gang of predators could take out his colony.</br>
</br>
While Zhou Guopings character was questionable at times, his intelligence was fine. Otherwise, Jiang Chen would not have entrusted the North American colony to him. Maybe Jessica and Hardy, who are both predators, would know something, and maybe Chinatown could also give him some advice.</br>
</br>
</br>
After he gathered all the evidence in his mind, Jiang Chen asked one last question.</br>
</br>
One last question, how did you get here?</br>
</br>
The Santa Monica Airport and the port were a little far apart. The straight-line distance from the map was two kilometers.</br>
</br>
I heard from the sailor on the ship that there was a Chinatown near Santa Monica, and the place has established a good relationship with the colony. Therefore, I planned to ask them to borrow a radio station and send the information to Wanghai. A wry smile then appeared on Han Yues face. However, the sailor didnt tell me where Chinatown was. When I passed by the airport, I wondered if there would be a map of Los Angeles here, so I decided to come in. However, I got caught in their trap as soon as I came in.</br>
</br>
Chinatown in Santa Monica?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens eyebrows twitched involuntarily.</br>
</br>
If he recalled correctly, Chinatown in Los Angeles should be in the city center.</br>
</br>
But after he thought about it, it seemed to make sense. After all, there was still a big difference between the historical trends of the modern world and the apocalypse. Even an airport appeared in Santa Monica, so it did not seem too strange that Chinatown was nearby.</br>
</br>
For safety reasons, Jiang Chen still verified his identity.</br>
</br>
The identity information of all NAC citizens was bounded to fingerprints and irises and collected in the database of the logistics department. As the general, he naturally could check the database at will. Although traditional communication methods could not currently connect with Wanghais server, Jiang Chens watch was equipped with the interdimensional communication chip designed by Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
It looked like he just performed magic when he took out a scanning gun that looked like a razor from the storage dimension. He scanned his eyes and retrieved his personal information.</br>
</br>
[Han Yue, male, 25 years old, pre-war occupation: bank security officer. Obtained lower class citizenship of NAC in January 2019, registered as a colonist on September 10, 2020, and volunteered to travel to North America.]</br>
</br>
Give him a gun, Jiang Chen pointed to Han Yue, and said to Zheng Shanhe, We have our candidate for the foreman. You try to clear the runway by tomorrow night. I will take some people to Chinatown.</br>
</br>
Or should I go? Zheng Shanhe hesitated and said.</br>
</br>
No, I need to understand the situation in North America. Its better to go there in person. Since Chinatown and the North American colony have a good relationship, they will probably help us. After Jiang Chen finished this sentence, he walked out of the lobby.</br>
</br>
Without insisting further, Zheng Shanhe nodded, took a rifle, and threw it over. He then looked at Han Yue, who hurriedly caught the rifle. He stepped forward and patted his shoulder, From now on, you are a soldier of NAC. I hope you can adapt to your new identity as soon as possible and perform well. Im optimistic about what you can do.</br>
</br>
Me? What should I do? With the rifle in his arms, Han Yue seemed a bit out of sorts, Clean up the airport? I</br>
</br>
Cleaning the airport is not your job. We will tell the predators how to do it. You are an overseer, and you are responsible for helping us watch them work. If they are not obedient, you can ask them to have bullets for dinner. Its that simple. Dont tell me you havent killed anyone after living for so long.</br>
</br>
I had been a caravan guard for a few months Han Yue derided himself.</br>
</br>
Of course, he killed people before, and hed even killed a few. However, he still had not fully adapted to his new identity.</br>
</br>
Then it will be easy, Zheng Shanhe pointed to the slaves behind him who looked timid. These guys probably dont understand Mandarin. Since you signed up for North America, I hope you can at least speak English. You can pick a few who can communicate with as your helpers, and I will give them a pistol and a few bullets to help you manage them.</br>
</br>
When Han Yue saw that Zheng Shanhe in the power armor was about to leave, he hurriedly stepped forward and asked.</br>
</br>
Can I ask who you are? I mean, is it the Expeditionary Force or the First DivisionI have no other intention, I just want to ask where Im enlisted now.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe had to process the information for a moment, and then he had a strangely smug look on his face. He raised his thumb and pointed at the gate of the lobby.</br>
</br>
Do you know who the one who spoke to you just now was?</br>
</br>
Han Yue swallowed down his saliva, then asked cautiously.</br>
</br>
If I may who is he?</br>
</br>
His identity will probably scare you to death. Zheng Shanhe grinned.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
To secure the airport was usually the top priority; even ahead of the investigation of the colony.</br>
</br>
After all, they could only evacuate from North America under any circumstances with a cleared runway.</br>
</br>
The predators who had surrendered were escorted to the airport. While Zheng Shanghe was instructing, Jiang Chen cleared out the zombies with a few guards in the airport.</br>
</br>
These zombies wandering in the airport were originally raised by the Airport Gang to guard the door here. These dull-headed living dead were quite good at finding traces left by the living. However, Jiang Chen didnt need their assistance since drones could act as the gatekeeper, so he cleared the area.</br>
</br>
When time just passed the noon mark, the Aerospace G100, which had made another trip, once again visited North America and parachuted down supplies.</br>
</br>
In this batch of supplies that crossed the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the equipment for repairing the runway, there were also several large boxes of canned food, self-heating lunches, and ammunition that Jiang Chen could not just take out from the storage dimension. There were also portable artilleries designed for the T-3 power armor and the type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon specifically made for the N-100.</br>
</br>
In addition, Jiang Chen also found something special amongst the supplies.</br>
</br>
It was a lunch box with a rabbit pattern and it was still hot. A note was pasted next to the box. When Jiang Chen saw the graceful handwriting, he immediately guessed who it was. Blushing, Jiang Chen hid the lunch box, walked to a place where no one was nearby before he opened the lid and started munching on the food.</br>
</br>
There was no need to guess at all. The lunch box was Yao Yaos masterpiece, and her cooking skill was also the best in the mansion. It was impossible to count on Sun Jiao in cooking. In addition to the bacon and grilled sausages that Jiang Chen started to love recently, there was also white rice surrounded by broccoli, as well as cuttlefishes that were roasted to perfection.</br>
</br>
The little girls cooking was getting better and better. While he was feasting on the lunch, Jiang Chen even took out a can of beer from the storage dimension. After he devoured everything, he wiped his mouth and then jumped back into the power armor and returned to the airport.</br>
</br>
By now, Zheng Shanhe and the others had also finished eating. They were resting beside the runway. As for the predators, after each of them received half of a nutrient supply, they started to work on the bumpy runway.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked over to Zheng Shanhe to let him know, then looked at Jessica who was crouching on the side.</br>
</br>
As a slave to the General himself, Jiang Chen granted her permission not to brave the sun and work at the airport with those predators.</br>
</br>
Want to eat? When he heard the sound of swallowing, he deliberately picked up a can from the supply box, tossed it in the air, and smiled sinisterly, If you want to eat, just say it. If you dont tell me, I wont know.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although Jessica knew that he was teasing her, Jessica still looked at him with a flattering expression and looked at the can in his hand pitifully.</br>
</br>
Its a pity that I forgot to bring dog food. Jiang Chen threw the can back into the supply box, then sat on the stairs on the side. Jessicas look of disappointment soon turned to surprise as he threw a package of compressed biscuits into her arms, Im going to Chinatown, I need a guide.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was well aware of the stick and carrot strategy.</br>
</br>
To deal with the indigenous people, he had to rely on indigenous people. Since she was wearing the collar, Jiang Chen was not afraid that she would run away. Since he needed her to do work at this time, a pack of crackers or a bag of instant noodles was more useful than anything else.</br>
</br>
Are you going to Chinatown? The hand that was about to tear the bag stopped and a hint of trepidation appeared on her face. Then she said tremblingly, I cant go there. They will kill me when they see me. Let Hardy guide you. Taking me there will only cause you trouble.</br>
</br>
Hardys leg is broken, so Id have to find someone to carry him. Jiang Chen waved his hand impatiently. Dont worry, there is an old saying that you have to look at the owner when you hit a dog. Since you have this hanging around your neck, no one can touch you before I leave North America Well, just in case, let me ask, what did you do?</br>
</br>
I stole their bosss bottle caps, Jessica said cautiously.</br>
</br>
Just that?</br>
</br>
And kicked his nuts</br>
</br>
The Chinatown in Santa Monica was not the Los Angeles Chinatown in the traditional sense, but a touristic Chinese community. In addition to a few ancient-looking Chinese buildings, there were also many other buildings from other East Asian cultures.</br>
</br>
After the war, because of the influx of Chinese refugees from Los Angeles, the local Chinese exhibited the tradition of working together to help their compatriots in the face of difficulties and eventually developed into a formidable local power. While the force was not comparable to the Minutemen or the National Guards in the area, it was far more powerful compared to the average survivor settlement or predator gang.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, after Jiang Chen questioned the prisoners captured by the Airport Gang, he discovered that one of them happened to be from Chinatown. Although he was just an ordinary survivor with no status, he was a fine stepping stone.</br>
</br>
In order to avoid unnecessary troubles, Jiang Chen did not take Jessica with him. Instead, he asked her to draw the directions on a map and then took the six guards and the prisoner who had regained his freedom to Chinatown; it was two kilometers away.</br>
</br>
In front of the entrance of Chinatown, a huge iron gate and two soldiers blocked the path of the crew.</br>
</br>
Stop! Youre about to enter Chinatown! The caravan, please show your certificate, and all others, leave immediately! At the entrance of the street, two soldiers in kinetic skeletons grabbed their rifles as they watched Jiang Chen and the others warily.</br>
</br>
Judging from their equipment, Chinatown was well-equipped. Although these two kinetic skeletons clearly looked like hand-made products made by welding guns, they were definitely better than nothing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at the heavy machine gun at the door and made a judgment call on the strength of Chinatown in his mind. He was about to speak, but the rescued Chinatown man behind him spoke first.</br>
</br>
Zhuzi! Im Ping from next door!</br>
</br>
The soldier named Zhuzis eyes widened and stared at his old friend in disbelief.</br>
</br>
You, are you really Ping? Wait, havent you been caught by the bandits at the airport?</br>
</br>
The Airport Gang has been wiped out! I got rescued! At this point, Wang Ping turned his head and looked at Jiang Chen gratefully, and then reached out and introduced them to the soldier named Zhuzi, They are friendly. Our compatriots from across the Pacific Ocean!</br>
</br>
The soldier clearly looked surprised as he examined Jiang Chen and the few people behind Jiang Chen. After he made eye contact with his comrade, he stepped forward and clasped his fists. I do apologize for being disrespectful. Please wait a moment while I go and ask General Zhao for instructions.</br>
</br>
After he finished this sentence, the soldier called Zhuzi turned and walked into the guard room, and grabbed the phone.</br>
</br>
They didnt wait for too long before the door slowly opened.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by a group of soldiers, a man who was also in a kinetic skeleton walked out from behind the door. With a heartily smile, he extended his right hand full of friendliness.</br>
</br>
Haha, welcome to Chinatown, friends who come from afar. My name is Smith Zhao, I do apologize for not welcoming you earlier, I hope you can forgive me.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1388: Strange</br>
</div></br>
</br>
This is the guy whose nuts got kicked by Jessica</br>
</br>
The way he looked at Smith Zhao was a bit weird, but he quickly realized that it was disrespectful and so he concealed the strange look in his eyes with a dry cough.</br>
</br>
My name is Zheng Shanhe, they are my people, Jiang Chen opened the armor mask out of courtesy. Then, he borrowed Zheng Shanhes name, pointed to the six guards in power armors behind him, and made up some information. We are from Wanghai, and we are part of the NAC First Division.</br>
</br>
Despite the expansion of the NAC colony, some people on the West Coast of North America have heard of the title NAC General, but fortunately no one placed his portraits everywhere. At least General Zhao did not recognize his identity.</br>
</br>
Wanghai? First Division? Ive heard of this name, Smith Zhao said with some suspicion and examined him from head to toe. Then, for safetys sake, let me ask one more question As members of the First Division, why are you here in Chinatown in Los Angeles?</br>
</br>
Obviously, he didnt believe Jiang Chens remarks, at least he didnt let his guard down.</br>
</br>
We are not malicious, otherwise we would not save your people, Jiang Chen pointed to the young man named Wang Ping next to him, and said, We are here to understand the situation at our outpost.</br>
</br>
Colony was the term NAC referred to for its colonies. Of course, this term was not used outside of the colonies. NAC used the word outpost to refer to these colonies, and most of the survivors in North America referred to that area as outpost, outpost town and so on It was the information Jiang Chen collected from Jessica.</br>
</br>
When Smith Zhao heard the word outpost, the alertness in his tone was suddenly replaced by a hint of surprise.</br>
</br>
Outpost Town? Wait, are you here for the outpost?</br>
</br>
Is there a problem? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
I thought you left the unfinished building there and returned home. After all, there was really nothing good to remember here in North America. Smith Zhao stared at Jiang Chen with wide eyes and his surprised expression didnt seem to be faked. If I remember correctly, it should be the Black Skull, a demon in the Nevada desert, who lives there now.</br>
</br>
Is he called Black Skull? No matter if they are demons or not, thank you for your information. Jiang Chen nodded, paused for a moment, and said, In fact, we did not evacuate from North America, and even sent new immigrants not long agobut the situation here surprised us. The entire outpost disappeared. There was no signal. We dont even know what happened here.</br>
</br>
Strange. Smith Zhao was also caught by surprise and he said, You havent received any news?</br>
</br>
Yes. Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Thats really strange Anyway, dont stand at the door, come to my place. After he murmured strange several times, Smith Zhao waved his hand behind him and motioned the Asian-looking soldiers to put away their weapons.</br>
</br>
</br>
General Zhaos name was Smith Zhao. Although he claimed to be a Chinese immigrant from the Rongcheng area, he obviously couldnt even find the place on the map.</br>
</br>
However, it didnt matter where his ancestors were. The more important fact was that General Zhaos attitude towards the colony was quite friendly. After he confirmed that Jiang Chen really came from the NAC across the Pacific, his attitude was obviously much more enthusiastic, and he did not conceal that trace of longing for the other side of the Pacific.</br>
</br>
In his eyes, North America was now a place full of ruins, and Asia would definitely be much better. After all, he had never heard of any survivor force on the West Coast that ended up in Pan-Asia, it was always NAC cargo ships that sailed here one after another.</br>
</br>
During the conversation with General Zhao, Jiang Chen learned that Chinatown and the colony were very close with each other, and the merchants of the two sides often traded, until the colony was abandoned, General Zhao and the merchants at the Sixth Street even finalized a blockbuster deal worth 50,000 crystals.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen learned about General Zhaos distress, he immediately stated that he would perform the contract on behalf of the merchant, and pay for the goods with canned food instead of caps in the name of the military government, provided that he can produce relevant certificates. After General Zhao received Jiang Chens promise, General Zhao even happily regarded him as a friend, and almost swore to become brothers for life.</br>
</br>
Thank you so much! My friend! I really dont know what to do without you. The furs of those long-tailed guinea pigs are very troublesome to deal with, and they are very difficult to find. You may not be fully aware of this from the other side of the ocean. Here, no one wants these things at all. General Zhao ordered his man to pour a glass of ale for Jiang Chen, as he looked at Jiang Chen eagerly while he sat on the sofa.</br>
</br>
To be precise, there was no demand for such flashy things anywhere except for the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
For survivors, filling their stomachs was the foremost and most crucial need, followed by a series of physiological needs. As for luxury goods and other things that promote social prosperity, they were only in demand after the concept of society was widely established.</br>
</br>
The best-selling products in the North American wasteland were always powerful and reliable machineries and fierce weapons. Although canned food, tea, and tobacco could be considered a luxury, they were consumables after all, as well as comforting products, therefore, the demand would never shrink.</br>
</br>
But for products like guinea pig furs that could only be used as decorations, even if the rich in Liberty City were interested, they would never buy back furs worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of bottle caps like NAC merchants. It was far more economical to hire a few hunters than to spend bottle caps, and the coats or carpets made by the furs could be used for a long time without breaking.</br>
</br>
We can talk about guinea pig furs later, Im not here to discuss business, Jiang Chen continued, focused on General Zhao, You will receive your cans once the port at Outpost Town is back in our hands. You should understand what I mean. .</br>
</br>
Do you want us to help you regain Outpost Town? Smith Zhao processed the information, then shook his head and smiled bitterly, Im sorry I cant do you this favor. The Black Skulls firepower is too powerful. Im already thanking God that he is not seeking trouble here. I must be responsible to my people.</br>
</br>
Its not difficult for us to destroy them without your help. Jiang Chen shook his head and said to dispel the concern in Smith Zhaos mind, The key to the problem now is that I must figure out what happened in Outpost Town.</br>
</br>
Is there anything we can help with? Smith Zhao asked.</br>
</br>
Although he was unwilling to take risks for NACs territory, he was still willing to sell this favor to NAC without threatening his own safety. Disregard the big deal worth 50,000 crystals, he was willing to help out of the love for his compatriots.</br>
</br>
While the situation was not common in other settlements, it was quite common in the North American Chinese survivors to help others with favors. After all, they were marginalized people who were excluded from mainstream society before the war. They were almost imprisoned in concentration camps during the war, and things did not get better after the war either.</br>
</br>
Helping each other had become a tradition in this group. If the words they did not help their compatriots got out, people would judge them harshly.</br>
</br>
If it is convenient, I hope you can help me find out what happened to the outpost. In addition, I need some people, not a lot, two or three should be enough. Ill pay them a reasonable price. Finally, I want to exchange some of our supplies for bottle caps</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1389: Chinatownâ€œs Mercenary</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Bottle caps that circulated in the wasteland werent just made from a capping machine.</br>
</br>
Only the bottle cap of quantum coke with anti-counterfeiting code, manufactured after the economic crisis in 2150, possessed value. Moreover, the value of the 350ml bottle cap was different from the 660ml limited edition bottle cap. Because no survivor force could find a way to manufacture this type of cap so far, the value had remained stable. A large bottle cap was equal to twenty normal caps. The term how many caps was used in trading.</br>
</br>
At the start, someone joked that the anti-counterfeiting technology of the Coca-Cola bottle cap was better than banknotes; it could become the currency of third world countries someday, after all, their banknotes have been depreciating. In the end, this lighthearted joke became a reality. On the wasteland more than 40 years later, the bottle cap really become a currency.</br>
</br>
It was just a pity that the place was not a third world country but in the wasteland of North America</br>
</br>
The physical identification code developed by The Coca-Cola Company at a high price finally made it convenient for the survivors on the wasteland in North America. There was no need to connect to the Internet, just a palm-sized scanner could identify the authenticity of bottle caps, which made it even more convenient compared to crystals.</br>
</br>
As for how the bottle cap became popular, there were many deeper reasons behind this, but the details wont be discussed here.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen exchanged the ten boxes of canned luncheon meat he brought with him for an equivalent amount of bottle caps from General Zhao, roughly equal to more than 5,000 caps. If converted into crystals based on the market in North America, it was around 300 crystals.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult to imagine how severe inflation was in North America.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen exchanged for the bottle caps, he did not leave immediately. Instead, he chatted with this General Zhao for a bit longer.</br>
</br>
In addition to intelligence related to the colony, he also heard some interesting rumors.</br>
</br>
For example, the leader of Tonys Club was not dead and you had to be careful when you see unidentified canned meat as sometimes people would recycle NAC canned food cans to use for counterfeiting. As for what kind of meat was sold in it, you would only know once you eat it; another example was that the atmosphere in Steel City and Liberty City were very unnatural recently. It was as if they were going to go to war, but they didnt know who their opponents were.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen recorded the rumors into his watch. After he checked the time and realized it was getting late, he said goodbye to General Zhao.</br>
</br>
If there is any information, I will send someone to the airport to find you. If you need manpower, you can go to the tavern at the entrance of Chinatown. Lone travelers, hunters, and caravan guards are all good choices. However, I suggest you pay attention when dealing with white people. If it were not for the strong request from the merchants, we would have never let those people in. Before Jiang Chen left, Smith Zhao reminded.</br>
</br>
</br>
I will pay attention. Jiang Chen gestured goodbye and walked down the street with the six guards waiting at the door.</br>
</br>
Go and buy some nutrient supplies and ask for information about the colony along the way. We will meet here in an hour. After he handed a box of bottle caps to a guard, he said, You dont need to save money for me.</br>
</br>
Typically, the places that sold nutrient supplies were busy, perhaps the boss there would know something.</br>
</br>
Roger! The guard nodded and walked to the other side of Chinatown.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up at the tavern on the side, then motioned a few guards to wait at the door before he walked in.</br>
</br>
The survivors in Chinatown were quite prejudiced, but this prejudice was mainly against survivors of other skin colors. Without the mask, the Asian survivors in the tavern looked at Jiang Chen with envy, rather than greed or covetousness.</br>
</br>
In the North American wasteland, power armor was not only a symbol of strength but also a symbol of financial power.</br>
</br>
It was not easy for ordinary survivors to own a kinetic skeleton. Only the lords could afford the power armor. Even General Zhao did not possess many power armors, let alone the lone travelers that wasted their days.</br>
</br>
A piece of power armor directly dictated the fact of whether theyd run or fight against a Death Claw. It was the ultimate dream of all lone travelers and mercenaries to own a power armor.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of these survivors, Jiang Chen and others had become the kind of compatriots they respect. If they appeared in this shabby place, they were definitely not here for a drink. The environment of the Chinatown restaurant was much better than here.</br>
</br>
Those powerful lone travelers and mercenaries were already gearing up and debating on how to connect with this rich master. Many female lone travelers looked at Jiang Chen with affectionate glances, and some brave ones even whistled. While they accepted missions such as security, many open female mercenaries did not mind providing extra services. While they could receive tips from their employer, they could also satisfy their physical needs.</br>
</br>
It was the North American way. Even if Asian survivors were relatively conservative, they were only relative to their compatriots across the ocean.</br>
</br>
I need to hire some manpower, Jiang Chen walked to the bar and didnt order any drinks. He directly slapped two large bottle caps on the table, and said to the bartender, I have no special requirements for strength, as long as they are not a burden. I care more about credibility, and then they must be bright. Do you have any recommendations?</br>
</br>
The moment the bartender saw these two large bottle caps, his breathing became noticeably louder.</br>
</br>
He collected the bottle caps calmly, glanced at the power armor on Jiang Chen, and said with a grin, It is hard to find people who wont be a burden, but it looks like youre not looking for bodyguards or guards. If I guess right, then I recommend you try those scavengers. Their instincts are as keen as mice, and they are familiar with any survivor settlement.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a tall and skinny man with a shaved head and a striking scar on his face came over. He stood next to Jiang Chen, examined him, then spoke.</br>
</br>
Do you need some hands?</br>
</br>
Yes, Jiang Chen turned his gaze to the man and responded to his inquiry with a curious gaze, You are?</br>
</br>
Gris, I dont remember my last name. Everyone called me Crow. Gris grinned. First of all, I wont be a burden. Second, Im familiar with the survivor settlements in California, Nevada, and Utah. If you need a guide, Ill at least not let you get lost. If you plan to find someone, as long as he is still on the West Coast, he will not escape.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didnt agree immediately but looked to the bartender who accepted his tip.</br>
</br>
The latter was wiping the glass in his hand. Without being shy, he said straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
Crow Griswell, I recognize the name a bit. The rare British man who can get in and out of Chinatown without being with a merchant fleet, and a scavenger with keen eyes who appears as a guard Thats all I can think of. Based on the market price, a guides pay is 20 caps a day, and for a guard, its 40, the full week is calculated as six days. Of course, this is just my suggestion. You can figure it out yourself.</br>
</br>
Okay, Jiang Chen looked to Gris, You are hired. I will pay you 50 caps a day, and I will tell you what your mission is later. The request is that I hope you are worthy of your compensation.</br>
</br>
Fifty bottle caps!</br>
</br>
When everyone heard this number, many survivors looked enviously at Gris. It was rare to see such a generous employer even in Liberty City, let alone Chinatown.</br>
</br>
When Gris heard his compensation, he too looked joyful, but he quickly hid the joy behind humility and nodded.</br>
</br>
I am honored to be of service to you.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
After Gris received this envious job and thought that the lavish employer would get up and leave immediately, his employer continued to sit there as if he had no intention of leaving.</br>
</br>
What do you want to drink? The bartender asked, seeing that Jiang Chen didnt plan to leave.</br>
</br>
No, Jiang Chen shook his head, and said in a voice that everyone could hear, I said, I need to hire some peopleprobably three to five more.</br>
</br>
Gris was stunned, and the bartender almost didnt hold onto the glass in his hand.</br>
</br>
As for the survivors inside</br>
</br>
They all went crazy.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
_Min_ Rainystars</br>
</br>
Hire me! I know this area well! Are you planning to go to Liberty City or Steel City? No matter where you plan to go, as long as you say a name, I can definitely take you there!</br>
</br>
For forty-five, wait, no, forty bottle caps! My reflex is thirty-five! Shooting skill rating is B+! Hiring me will be a great choice! A gorilla-looking mercenary squeezed from the crowd to the front, patted his chest, and said confidently.</br>
</br>
Handsome, dont you want to consider me? I can not only protect you during the day but also help you fix the water pipe at night~ A certain mercenary in a nylon buckle vest winked while her arm was pressed against the bar.</br>
</br>
Compensation of fifty caps a day!</br>
</br>
For the survivors in the tavern, it was no different from picking up free money!</br>
</br>
Take the fake wine in their hands as an example, a bottle of whiskey blended with inferior alcohol was already considered a high-end product among the survivors at the bottom of the society, and a small half bottle was enough to make people drunk for a whole day. The compensation offered by Jiang Chen was enough to let them buy two bottles in one day! Take equipment, for example, one weeks compensation could upgrade their entire gear! It was easy to imagine how tempting this job was.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not in a rush with the swarm of survivors eager to sell themselves. He asked everyone a few questions.</br>
</br>
The bartender that received the tip also helped to ensure he got the best deal. Soon he picked two scavengers who looked clever and had reasonable credibility in this area.</br>
</br>
The two lucky ones were named Mike Wu and Zhao Fuxiang.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was Jiang Chens illusion, but there seemed to be a lot of people with the last name Zhao in Chinatown?</br>
</br>
Full of disappointment, the crowd around the bar gradually dispersed. Jiang Chen tossed a few large bottle caps on the bar to pay for Gris and the others bill and left the tavern with three people.</br>
</br>
When the three saw the six power armors at the door, there were astonished, and the way they looked at Jiang Chen changed. If they were only envious when they saw the power armor on him, now they were completely conquered.</br>
</br>
Other than the National Guards, who else on the entire wasteland could arm a squad with power armors?</br>
</br>
They thought of a name already.</br>
</br>
Except that Gris and the others were still not convinced. After all, NAC disappeared from the West Coast half a month ago. Everyone, including Gris, believed that NAC considered this area too poor, and they had withdrawn to the rich and lavish Asia.</br>
</br>
The guard that he sent to gather intelligence had returned, Jiang Chen enquired.</br>
</br>
How is the situation?</br>
</br>
The boss who sells the nutrient supply doesnt know much about the colony, but I have heard some other interesting news. The guard glanced at the three strangers behind Jiang Chen, then he spoke in the team communication channel.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lets walk and talk.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to Gris and the others behind him to follow, then he took the lead and headed for the entrance of Chinatown.</br>
</br>
Half a step behind Jiang Chen, the guard reported.</br>
</br>
According to the pharmacy owner, the governor of the colony and the predators were very close, and many predators simply decided to join Zhou Guoping and became mercenaries.</br>
</br>
Thats like his style, its nothing new, Jiang Chen snorted, then pursed his lips, What then?</br>
</br>
Zhou Guopings personal charm always appealed to interesting people, such as grumpy scums like predators and robbers. It was difficult for ordinary people to communicate with them, but Zhou Guoping seemed to be able to mingle with them and even negotiate business with them easily.</br>
</br>
There was no derogation here. It was also an ability to unite the predators under ones own banner. When bandits became bodyguards, it would promote the safety of trade routes. It was not necessarily possible with hundreds of thousands of bullets.</br>
</br>
If the Governor of North America was given to another person, that person would not necessarily do a better job.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was quite confident of himself with understanding character. If he was not confident with his ability, he would not have sent him to North America.</br>
</br>
The boss mentioned a name.</br>
</br>
Who? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe, the guard continued, one of the predator leaders who joined Zhou Guoping with his force. A month ago, he took his gang and appeared in Chinatown in the colonys name and purchased a batch of iodine and a whole container of nutrition supply, then soon left here.</br>
</br>
Interesting, Jiang Chen touched his chin and said, A whole container of nutrient supply, he is planning to travel far.</br>
</br>
I think so too, and the radiation level where they are going must be quite high! The guards tone gave a hint of excitement, Not only that, according to the pharmacy owner, Blood Axe seemed to be searching for something for the colony.</br>
</br>
Searching for something?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was somewhat surprised.</br>
</br>
What is it that can turn such a large colony into an empty town overnight?</br>
</br>
From intuition, it felt like Zhou Guoping and the people in the colony should be still alive, but where did they go.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chens expression was a bit weird.</br>
</br>
He considered himself to not be a spiritualist, but now he was questioning if a supernatural event happened</br>
</br>
After they left Chinatown, Jiang Chen looked at the two men and said, I have a task now for you two. Go to Steel City and Liberty City separately to hire two mercenary groups for me. Preferably larger than 300 people, and the stronger the firepower the better. Let them come to the airport and I will pay with what they are interested in. In addition, when you are hiring, help me gather some information about something</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dictated what he was looking to learn.</br>
</br>
After he confirmed that the two remembered, they agreed to meet at Santa Monica Airport in a week. Then, Jiang Chen urged the two to set off immediately.</br>
</br>
After the two left, Gris, who was next to him, looked at Jiang Chen and asked.</br>
</br>
What about me?</br>
</br>
I remember you said that you are very good at finding people? Jiang Chen turned his head to Gris, then said, I will give you a name now, and there are no clues other than that. How certain are you about finding this person?</br>
</br>
Its a bit difficult, but its nothing for me. I said that as long as the person you are looking for is on the West Coast, Ill definitely find the person. Gris grinned, Of course, there is another premise, the person has to live.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe, Jiang Chen said concisely.</br>
</br>
A very interesting name, Gris squinted his eyes while he rubbed his unshaven chin. I have heard of this man. A month ago, he took his people to join Outpost Town and turned into guards. However, in the end, he disappeared with the people in Outpost Town.</br>
</br>
How confident are you? Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
How do you know if you dont try? Gris shrugged, What is the reward? If you are looking for someone</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who was too lazy to talk nonsense with him, threw a box of bottle caps directly into his arms before he could finish. The latter who caught the iron box was slightly confused. But when opened the lid and took a look, he almost dropped the box because of astonishment.</br>
</br>
This is the advance payment, and it is also your activity fund, Jiang Chen stared at Griss widened eyes, and said unhurriedly, Whether he is alive or dead, I want to see him. You have ten days to complete this task. We will also meet at the airport.</br>
</br>
Three, four, fifive hundred, Gris counted the number in the box, gulped down, looked at Jiang Chen, and said in a tone that was both joking and serious, You are not afraid that Ill run away with the deposit?</br>
</br>
Its only five hundred bottle caps. It may be a huge sum of money for you, but its not a big deal to me, Jiang Chen said nonchalantly, and shrugged, If you run away with the money, at most I will spend twice the amount for the price of your life.</br>
</br>
The undertone in his statement seemed to be narrating an ordinary task, but in Gris ears, his heartbeat almost stopped.</br>
</br>
A thousand caps</br>
</br>
Even a hundred of those cute little things were enough to give California cowboys a reason to tear him apart.</br>
</br>
Gris felt that the iron box in his hands was turning hot.</br>
</br>
Whats your answer? Jiang Chen asked patiently and ignored the expression on his face.</br>
</br>
The heavyweight in his hands, as well as the clanking sounds made by the bottle caps, made his brain gain some clarity. He took a deep breath, looked at Jiang Chen, and said solemnly.</br>
</br>
I will give you news in ten days at the latest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Ill be waiting for your good news.</br>
</br>
</br>

_Min_Rainystars</br>
</br>
North American colony, Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
Black Skull sat on the chair that previously belonged to Zhou Guoping with both his feet on the desk. He bathed in the warm sunlight streaming through the window as he picked his teeth with a toothpick and played with the badge in his hand.</br>
</br>
The bronze badge was gilded under the ray, and the three letters NAC, as well as a sword and a shield, were clearly visible. Black Skull did not know what this badge symbolized, but he did not care either. It was a trophy he took from the ship captain.</br>
</br>
He stuffed the badge into his pocket casually, then yawned lazily.</br>
</br>
There were no dry sands, no deadly poisonous scorpions, only the brackish sea breeze, and warm and welcoming sunlight. He had never dreamed of such a pleasant day, but now everything was so real.</br>
</br>
Containers filled with canned food and compressed biscuits and the piles of rice and potatoes made him gain the extravagant idea of using some of the grain to make wine. He only gave up on the idea because he was unable to find anyone skilled enough to do this.</br>
</br>
As for the possibility of NAC seeking revenge</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was not very afraid of those Asians.</br>
</br>
He had to admit that they were indeed very powerful, and if they used their full force, even the National Guards would have to admit defeat. However, he also had the confidence that he ruled this piece of land, and he had a particularly big fist.</br>
</br>
Even in the worst-case scenario and NACs army came to North America to seek revenge, if he decided to hide in the Nevada desert, who could find him? He had prepared four or five of the abandoned fallout shelters for situations like this.</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a knock on the door.</br>
</br>
Come in.</br>
</br>
It was his bone-headed strategist  The Crippled Bills, and the strong Slavic man with a mohawk  Rodney. One became the mayor of the outpost, and the other became the police sheriff, in charge of logistics and slaves.</br>
</br>
And Black Skull was naturally the person in charge.</br>
</br>
As for the specific title, he did not think of one yet.</br>
</br>
The mud crab breeding base has been cleaned up. What are these Asians heads made out of? Why didnt anyone think about breeding these things before? Rodney touched the hair on his head and said with some confusion.</br>
</br>
Before the group of Asians came to North America, no one had ever tried the crab roe from mud crabs. The vast majority of peoples choice of food was either nutrient supplies with different raw ingredients or the two-headed Brahman beef with a texture like sand.</br>
</br>
No one thought that a delicacy would be hidden inside the hard shell stronger than the power armor.</br>
</br>
Of course, deliciousness was accompanied by danger.</br>
</br>
While the slaves were cleaning the pond for breeding, Rodney witnessed several slaves get dragged down into the water by the powerful crabs and were mauled to death. The tragic scene of their miserable death even made his scalp numb.</br>
</br>
</br>
No matter what their heads are made out of, I only care about when my farm will resume production. Black Skull said while he yawned and neglected Rodneys confusion. In his opinion, no matter how smart and creative the yellow-skinned monkeys were, they eventually left everything for him. Without a doubt, he was the wisest and strongest in this wasteland.</br>
</br>
It has been resumed. I have arranged twenty slaves to run it. Whoever is lazy at work will be fed to the crabs. Rodney smiled cruelly.</br>
</br>
What about you? Black Skull looked at Bills and said lazily, Is the inventory count done?</br>
</br>
The inventory count has been completed and all the supplies are recorded on it. As Bills responded, he flipped the book in his hand to the catalog and handed it to his boss respectfully. Converted into bottle caps, these materials are worth at least 70 million. You are already the richest man on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
Hahaha, the shriveled laughter filled the room. After he had laughed enough, he sat back down on the chair.</br>
</br>
He was quite satisfied with the term rich, especially after adding the prefix the richest. It made him more satisfied than ever.</br>
</br>
As he flipped through the book, he nodded repeatedly and praised, Good job, very good.</br>
</br>
We have plenty of supplies now. I suggest taking some canned food to Liberty City for weapons and slaves. While the boss was happy, Bills grinned and suggested, We must prepare early. Sooner or later the National Guards will come after this, and NAC as well. We ransacked their entire cargo ship after all.</br>
</br>
Slaves? Black Skulls ears perked up but he waved his hand as if the matter did not concern him. They are everywhere, why trade them with caps? Rodney, take a few trucks of our men around the city and catch some. Also, get me some big booty blondes.</br>
</br>
Yes, boss, count on me, Rodney said excitedly with a bloodthirsty glow in his eyes.</br>
</br>
The days of watching slaves work had made him feel bored a long time ago.</br>
</br>
In his bones, he was a militant. Although life here was comfortable, it was not the life Rodney wanted. Only looting and killing made him feel sparks of joy in his heart.</br>
</br>
Bills could only show a bitter smile on his face. He sighed in his mind and thought that his boss was not destined to become a warlord. Even if NAC left him an entire city, it would only become a marauders castle in his hands. Once they squandered NACs loot, they would have to return to the desert.</br>
</br>
Bills wanted to say something more but decided to close his mouth. Instead, he lowered his head and walked back.</br>
</br>
Although his boss could occasionally listen to others opinions, he could never persuade him in anything related to principles. He could find all the typical shortcomings, such as laziness, stubbornness, stupidity, never thinking about tomorrow</br>
</br>
Before the war, this idiot would have starved to death in a slum.</br>
</br>
But now in the apocalypse, on the wasteland, violence was the only criterion. Whoever had the biggest fist was the boss</br>
</br>
On the other side, Jiang Chen took his guards and returned to Santa Monica Airport before the Sun went down. When he just walked into the airport building, he happened to see the two recruited overseers walking out from the ticket gate with two corpses.</br>
</br>
Judging from the tattoos on the corpses, they most likely belonged to predators who were planning to escape.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was never polite to the predators that used their crooked brains to plot against him. He had already told his captain and Han Yue that if they encountered any disobedient predator s to just shoot.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen entered the lobby, he saw Zheng Shanhe sitting there studying a map. Jessica marked all the survivor settlements, predator camps, and even fallout shelters she knew on the Los Angeles city map attached to the airport brochure.</br>
</br>
When Zheng Shanhe saw Jiang Chen come in, he immediately put away the map, stood up, and saluted.</br>
</br>
How is the progress on the runway?</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe immediately reported, A few disobedient predators were made examples, and now these foreigners are much more obedient. Now the runway has been repaired to 40%. If we work overnight, it should be fixed before noon tomorrow.</br>
</br>
Very good. Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe glanced at the people squatting in the corner of the waiting room, then he asked Jiang Chen for instructions, What about those people? Should we continue to feed them?</br>
</br>
In a bit, get them downstairs and ask if they are willing to work for NAC. If they are willing to stay, three nutrient supplies a day, and after two months, the compensation can be improved. If they are not willing, then just let them leave and dont let them get in the way here.</br>
</br>
The price of three nutrient supplies was worth around five to ten caps. Most survivors could barely fill their stomach with two tubes a day. For these poor people without a steady source of income, the compensation was very generous.</br>
</br>
Based on the unwritten rules on the wasteland, NAC destroyed Airport Gang so these prisoners would continue to be slaves under NAC as spoils. Now, NAC was willing to give them compensation for their work. They would definitely sincerely express their gratitude for this generous treatment.</br>
</br>
After these fifty people joined them and were armed with a few guns, a cannon fodder force could be formed.</br>
</br>
Ill go now.</br>
</br>
Wait a moment, this is not a priority, Jiang Chen stopped Zheng Shanhe, sat down, and continued, I have something else more crucial to discuss with you.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe respectfully waited for Jiang Chens instruction.</br>
</br>
I plan to take the colony back from Black Skull. Based on what Han Yue said, they have a lot of our slaves, and most likely they are still alive. And the resources they have looted away, they are such a waste in their hands.</br>
</br>
Just with us? Zheng Shanhan digested the information and began to sweat, This is too risky, we should wait for the expeditionary force</br>
</br>
It will take at least a month for the expeditionary force to arrive. in North America and it will be more problematic if they force the slaves stand in the front. Jiang Chen looked at Zheng Shanhe, who wanted to say something but was reluctant to do so, then he laughed and continued on, Also, who told you that its just us?</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1392: Expelling Wolves By Steering Tigers</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was easy to take out Black Skull in the outpost, to the point where NAC did not even need to get involved.</br>
</br>
Problems that could be solved with money were not problems. Especially with canned food, which was completely worthless in the modern world. Jiang Chen gave the two Chinatown scavengers a week not to find the strongest mercenaries, but to release news in the two largest survivor settlements in California.</br>
</br>
Santa Monica Airport needed mercenaries.</br>
</br>
The runway of the airport was repaired, and the aerospace plane brought the second batch of supplies as scheduled. This time, the Aerospace G100 did not return to Pan-Asia but landed on the runway of the airport.</br>
</br>
Communications in North America and Asia were still in a state of interruption. If an emergency did happen and they had to evacuate, it would take an hour before the plane arrived using communication with the interdimensional chip.</br>
</br>
In the next week, Jiang Chen had not gone anywhere and waited patiently in the airport. On the third day after the two Chinese scavengers set off, mercenaries successively arrived at the airport, asking if they needed manpower.</br>
</br>
In line with the principle of more is better, Jiang Chen welcomed everyone to stay but did not immediately offer a commission. Instead, he asked them to wait patiently until a week later, during which time NAC would follow the standard of three nutrient supplies per person per day for free. If they did not want to waste time here, it was okay to come back a week later.</br>
</br>
And after a week, when the two scavengers returned to the airport with mercenary forces that met the requirements, the runway of Santa Monica Airport was already crowded with people.</br>
</br>
Everyone, without exception, did not look too pleased when they saw so many fellow colleagues here.</br>
</br>
If it werent for NACs free nutrient supplies, if it werent for NACs clear deadline, if it werent for the fact that NACs wealthy impression had been deeply rooted among the West Coast survivors. If there were not so many reasons, they would have already dispersed.</br>
</br>
In front of the glass windows of the airport building, Jiang Chen counted them from a distance and concluded there were at least 2,000 people.</br>
</br>
These mercenaries were poorly equipped. Some were carrying customized drone backpacks on their backs and composite body armors. Some of them couldnt even afford to wear clothes and had a few pieces of rags with a .38 caliber iron barrel rifle on their shoulder.</br>
</br>
Do we need to continue to wait? Walking to the side of Jiang Chen, Zheng Shanhe hesitantly said, Those mercenaries have grown impatient. Im worried that if we keep waiting, there may be problems.</br>
</br>
Wait until noon. Jiang Chen raised his hand and looked at his watch. Its only two hours anyway.</br>
</br>
Two hours passed quickly, both for the mercenaries on the runway and for NAC. Afterward, a few lone travelers who decided to try their luck came sporadically. Jiang Chen estimated that it was time, so he walked to the side of the airport runway and turned on the loudspeaker on the power armor.</br>
</br>
</br>
First of all, to all of you who have waited patiently until now, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of NAC. In order to ensure that no information is leaked, we have not announced our mission. However, I am here to assure you, we will hire each of you because this is a big mission.</br>
</br>
In front of the countless mercenaries, Jiang Chen keenly noticed the impatient expressions of the few people in front of him. Therefore, he didnt waste much time in the opening remarks and went straight to the point. A month ago, we lost control of our outpost. After being ordered to land on the West Coast, I found a group of predators had occupied our outpost. The mission is to retake our outpost.</br>
</br>
Retake the outpost?</br>
</br>
The mercenaries present suddenly had a commotion when they heard the mission.</br>
</br>
A mercenary dressed as a cowboy in the front row stepped forward.</br>
</br>
Retake Outpost Town for you? If you are no match for Black Skull, how do you think we can win? This is all for us to be cannon fodder for you!</br>
</br>
Before the accident, there were 50 power armors stationed in Outpost Town, and countless kinetic skeletons, and this strong lineup was no match for Black Skull. The survivors on the West Coast started to take a different path when they heard the name Black Skull.</br>
</br>
Many people agreed with this mercenarys speech. Especially those mercenaries that were poorly equipped. After they heard the sentence they agreed with, they were debating if they should leave.</br>
</br>
I can tell you responsibly that the fall of Outpost Town had nothing to do with Black Skull. They got lucky, but I hope you can get some intelligence from them, Jiang Chen said with certainty.</br>
</br>
How much do you plan to pay us? Another mercenary asked the question that concerned everyone.</br>
</br>
It depends on how much you do, Jiang Chen looked at the person in front of him, and then said, I wont pay you equal salary, because its very unfair to those who have real ability. I can guarantee that each of you will get at least one can of canned meat and Ill add one can for every predator you kill. Whoever catches Black Skull, I will reward him with a whole box. You should know clearly how many bottle caps they are worth in Liberty City.</br>
</br>
The price offered by Jiang Chen made the mercenaries take a deep breath. Driven by their interests, those who were debating if they should leave, also abruptly stopped their feet mid-air.</br>
</br>
SH*T thousands of cans that is not a small sum, A mercenary licked his dry lips, looked at Jiang Chens eyes with suspicion and greed, and said in an uncertain tone. Before I start, I want to see our reward. Dont tell me you plan to produce them from your pockets.</br>
</br>
Of course, theyre not in my pockets. Your reward is in the pockets of Black Skull. Jiang Chen looked at the mercenary in front of him and smiled, Just two weeks ago, they ransacked the cargo ship we sent to North America. Although those things are nothing to us, they captured our citizens, which made us very angry. If you take down Outpost Town, I can divide up half of the goods based on how much you contribute.</br>
</br>
Wealth made people crazy. It even made those mercenaries selectively forget the tradition of paying the deposit first.</br>
</br>
Although the mercenaries present knew that Outpost Town was now controlled by Black Skull Gang, they really did not know that they ransacked NACs cargo ship. If that was the case, the predators with NAC supplies must be filthy rich</br>
</br>
It was impossible for any mercenary group to take down Black Skull alone, and thus impossible to swallow all the supplies, especially when the predators were defending a fortified place.</br>
</br>
But it was a different story if everyone fought together!</br>
</br>
There were at least two thousand mercenaries standing here. It was no exaggeration to say that this force alone was enough to sweep the entire West Coast. The National Guards or Minutemen would have to weigh their decision carefully if they encountered this force.</br>
</br>
After a simple dispatch, more than two thousand mercenaries were led by Zheng Shanhe. Jiang Chen returned to the airport lobby, then looked to the two Chinese from Chinatown.</br>
</br>
Did you gather any intelligence on the things I asked?</br>
</br>
Mike Wu and Zhao Fuxiang glanced at each other, and finally the former spoke first, I couldnt find anything from Steel City, except that the Power Armor Team of the National Guards have been patrolling a bit too frequently. Also, I didnt hear anything about the rumors you have mentioned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked to Zhao Fuxiang, who replied immediately.</br>
</br>
The same is true in Liberty City. Minutemens Rangers have been patrolling very frequently. These are all visible changes. In addition, I heard a scavenger in the tavern mentioned that recently the Liberty City Council has been discussing whether to expand the conscription. They are most likely preparing for war, but I dont know who the opponent is.</br>
</br>
In that case Jiang Chen rubbed his chin as he digested this information. Then he nodded slightly, I see.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Black Skull needed slaves, more slaves!</br>
</br>
When he saw the progress of the construction site was postponed day by day, Black Skull, who didnt want to waste more supplies, finally could not sit around longer. He gathered his subordinates early in the morning and rolled out in a dozen modified armored vehicles and several large trucks. Under the flag of Black Skull, they headed to the city.</br>
</br>
With half of the subordinates gone, the rest of them wandered around the fortress as usual when they had nothing to do. If they saw a slave that did not please their eyes, they would kick them. If they had urges, they would take off their pants.</br>
</br>
The time in Outpost Town was like heaven.</br>
</br>
On the guard tower at the front door, two predators leaned their automatic rifles to one side with low-quality cigarettes in their mouth. They chatted as they passed the boring time on guard.</br>
</br>
One of the predators spat on the guard tower and cursed, Fu*k, I should have gone out with the boss. I bet they must be enjoying life outside. When they come back, we can only play with the scraps left behind.</br>
</br>
Whats wrong with that, The other predator smiled lasciviously and shook his two fingers holding onto the cigarette. Compared to the disobedient wild kitten, I prefer</br>
</br>
Before he could finish his sentence, blood mist and brain matter exploded all over the guard tower.</br>
</br>
The predator that was talking immediately ducked down and rolled to the side. He ignored the cigarette that fell onto the ground, and hurriedly grabbed the radio, This is the guard tower! We encountered a sniper!</br>
</br>
The radio seemed to be broken; there was no response.</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
The predator smashed the radio to the ground, then glanced at his companion who had his brain exploded, his heart began to pound. Just as he resisted the nausea he started to feel and removed the binocular from the corpses neck to observe the situation outside the tower, he suddenly stopped moving, his eyes met a drone.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was the muzzle under the drone</br>
</br>
TATATATATA!</br>
</br>
The man with a sniper rifle equipped on his back pressed the shooting button and looked at the blood spatter on the screen of the tablet. Then he put back the tablet and spoke into the radio on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
The threats in the guard tower are eliminated.</br>
</br>
On the other side, in the room near the front door of the fortress, an agile mercenary sneaked into the room and silently sliced the necks of the two predators with a dagger. He walked to a monitoring terminal and inserted a USB from his pocket.</br>
</br>
When all the pictures on the screen froze, a cruel smile formed.</br>
</br>
My side is good too!</br>
</br>
There was not the slightest omen.</br>
</br>
When the predators stationed here met the gaze of the mercenaries who had sneaked into the fortress, it was too late.</br>
</br>
The sudden gunfire broke the silence of the fortress. With the sound of the first shot, countless gunshots ensued. The mercenaries who rushed into Outpost Town were engaged in a fierce battle at the front garden of the fortress before they opened the space below the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
</br>
Even if the battle was full of customized high-tech weapons, laser beams mixed with bullets, drones flying in the air, thermal grenades and EMP grenades thrown back and forth, the battle between cannon folders was not artistic at all.</br>
</br>
However, as time passed, the Black Skull Gang soon began to show signs of decline.</br>
</br>
When the quality of weapons was similar, the quantity determined the outcome.</br>
</br>
A predator slammed his shoulder heavily into the concrete wall next to him, stuck his rifle out of cover, and fired at the mercenaries attacking the fortress. However, the inaccurate shots were ineffective. He was quickly forced to take cover again.</br>
</br>
SH*T, their firepower is too strong! Mohawk Rodney slammed the clip into the rifle with his trembling hands and gritted his teeth. He endured the cement crumbs that constantly slammed against his cheeks, then looked at the EP on his left arm.</br>
</br>
His EP was connected to a drone terminal, and now five of the six drones bounded to it was offline, and only one remained on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
He gritted his teeth, raised his rifle and fired indiscriminately, then tossed a smoke grenade before he snuck to the Governors Mansion. His only hope was for his boss to come back soon and flank these cannon folders with the armored vehicles.</br>
</br>
It was his only hope for survival.</br>
</br>
FU*K, NAC mobilized a division to deal with us Bills lied behind cover in horror. He used the cameras he placed in the building to overlook the battle in front of the fortress, then he muttered to himself, No, they are not from NAC, they are mercenaries</br>
</br>
Just then, a grenade fell beside him.</br>
</br>
Bills processed what had just happened and the panic in his eyes instantly turned into despair.</br>
</br>
The strong desire to survive urged him to jump to the side, but he only jumped by half a step before the scorching waves hit his chest, and the flying shrapnel brought his consciousness to Satan.</br>
</br>
When the predators saw the third highest-ranking leader fall down, their morale collapsed. Many predators even left their cover and escaped.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries didnt pursue further when the predators were defeated. They rushed into the Governors Mansion, for fear that their credits would be stolen by others.</br>
</br>
Soon, Rodneys roar came from the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
However, this roar did not stop the defeat of the Black Skull Gang. Rodney, who had run out of ammunition, picked up his chair and wanted to make a path through the group of mercenaries. However, he obviously overestimated his strength and was pushed down by the mercenaries within a few seconds. He was tied up and sent to Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen learned the news of the victory, he brought six of his guards to the colony.</br>
</br>
In the open downstairs space of the Governors Mansion, he saw the man with the mohawk.</br>
</br>
Are you Black Skull? Jiang Chen stopped beside Rodney, took a few glances at the mohawk on the ground, then raised his eyebrows and said, I remember Black Skull is black?</br>
</br>
He is Rodney, nicknamed Bone Crusher, the second-in-rank leader of the Black Skull Gang. He stayed at base, and most likely their boss went to raid, Jessica followed behind Jiang Chen and explained with a flattering tone.</br>
</br>
Although Rodney was pinned down by two hands on the back of his head, he did not succumb as soon as he was captured like most predators. His eyes were bloodshot, and he stared at Jiang Chen from the ground.</br>
</br>
Bone Crusher? Interesting name, Jiang Chen nodded, squatted down slightly, and responded to Rodneys stare with the tactical eyepiece glowing red on the armor of his head, then he said with a smile, If your eyes dont hurt, you can try to stare a bit harder.</br>
</br>
Rodney did not speak, but his eye muscles twitched.</br>
</br>
I dont believe in unconditional loyalty, especially the loyalty of predators. From the standpoint of a merchant, I would be happy to discuss a deal with you. With a smile, Jiang Chen said softly, Of course, you can also refuse. But before you refuse, I hope you think about the mud crab pond next to the outpost. Those big guys dont look good when they eat.</br>
</br>
When Rodney heard the mud crab pond, a trace of panic appeared on his face. His fearless expression started to waver out of fear.</br>
</br>
You have thirty seconds to think about it, Jiang Chen stood up and looked at Jessica next to him, You count to thirty for me. If he doesnt plan to cooperate, then send him to the pond to play with the mud crabs.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen said these words, he walked to the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
SH*T! YOU DEVIL! Rodney desperately twisted his body when he saw Jiang Chen leave, However, other than getting mud all over his face, the four hands in his back did not allow him to move an inch.</br>
</br>
fifteen</br>
</br>
Jessicas scalp felt numb as she counted down and looked at Rodney struggle to break free.</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen was correct. The loyalty of the predators was a joke.</br>
</br>
The mohawk pinned down by Jiang Chens guards no longer looked fearless when Jessica counted to ten. Instead, he started to plead with tears in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Fu*k, no please! PLEASE! Dont feed me to those crabs! What do you want me to do? Ill do anything</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1394: Ambush At The Fortress</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the road two kilometers from Outpost Town, a cloud of dust was created by the rolling tires.</br>
</br>
Five armored vehicles at the front and rear cleared the way. The desert-colored front armor surface was sprayed with black paint in the shape of a skull. The rusty trucks sandwiched between the armored vehicles carried a group of lifeless men and women. Their hands and feet were tied with rope and they were tied together with an iron chain.</br>
</br>
A group of men with rifles on their shoulders stood behind them. From their weird tattoos and vulgar actions, they did not look like good people.</br>
</br>
Dont fight me for it. I caught this chick. Im going to train her slowly. Ill let you guys have fun once Im done.</br>
</br>
Sh*t, is there anything you do that can help you last for more than three minutes? We can help you when you are tired.</br>
</br>
What the fu*k did you say, who are you saying only last three minutes?</br>
</br>
Hahahaha, one of you can be in the front while one of you can be in the back and see who can actually last for three minutes. When a predator with braids saw the two were about to fight, he intervened and humped the air, I can be the referee for you.</br>
</br>
Catlin, in the fallout shelter uniform, shrank into the corner of the truck. As she listened to their brazen words and ruthless laughter, her face was full of panic and helplessness.</br>
</br>
Before the door of the fallout shelter opened, they were fully prepared to face the world baptized by nuclear weapons. They were ready to rescue the compatriots in California, face the radioactive dust, carry out post-disaster reconstruction above the shelter, spread the fire of civilization throughout California, and revive the civilization that once prospered on this land</br>
</br>
However, everything was beyond their expectations from the beginning.</br>
</br>
They had just opened the door to save a group of poor and hungry people. However, they didnt expect that these hungry people who sought help would turn into extremely vicious predators once they got in. They turned their guns at the people who tried to help.</br>
</br>
Catlin closed her eyes in pain, tears of despair flowed out from her eyes.</br>
</br>
From the moment she was taken onto the truck, from seeing the way those men looked at her, she could already imagine her destiny. If her hands and feet were not tied up, she really wanted to jump off the truck into the rolling wheels and say goodbye to the cruel world.</br>
</br>
God</br>
</br>
What is going on in this world?</br>
</br>
Black Skull sat in the armored car at the head of the convoy. He had a cigar in his mouth, and the arc of his mouth showed that he was enjoying this ride.</br>
</br>
This cigar was found in the office of the fallout shelter head. Based on the brand and place of origin, it seemed to be a high-end product imported from Cuba. Before the nuclear war, he couldnt even think of this kind of high-end stuff, but he didnt expect to have the opportunity to taste it now after the war.</br>
</br>
</br>
In general, this trip was a great harvest.</br>
</br>
He didnt expect that he just went for a tour to the north of California and happened to receive a radio from a fallout shelter that just opened. As an experienced predator, he certainly wouldnt let go of this good opportunity and immediately went to the location. First, a few people were sent into the shelter, pretending to be refugees to take advantage of their sympathy. Then while the guards were not paying attention, they threw the thermite on the engine of the fallout shelter gate, which turned the people inside the fallout shelter into lambs ready to be slaughtered.</br>
</br>
The loot was not only the box of cigars in his pocket, but also supplies that filled the trucks, and nearly a thousand slaves.</br>
</br>
With more than a thousand slaves, it was possible to finish the large project left by NAC before the end of October.</br>
</br>
Soon, the convoy arrived at the fortress in Outpost Town.</br>
</br>
Mohawk Rodney stood above the main entrance of the fort and had been waiting there for a long time. When he saw Black Skull sitting behind the armored vehicle, he turned around and shouted at the people in the back.</br>
</br>
Open the gate!</br>
</br>
The steel front gate slowly opened, and Black Skull knocked twice on the top cover of the armored car. The driver sitting inside immediately stepped on the gas, and the whole convoy moved slowly again.</br>
</br>
As usual, the slave hunters who went out returned with trucks full of loot.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, when Black Skull looked at the gate, he frowned and felt something was off.</br>
</br>
It wasnt until the convoy drove halfway through the front door that he suddenly realized what was wrong.</br>
</br>
Normally, Rodney would always wait for him at the gate when he returned; he would never stand at the top of the fortress. Moreover, they brought back more than a dozen trucks of slaves, but his subordinates did not even make a sound. Everything was so abnormal!</br>
</br>
But when he realized this, it was too late.</br>
</br>
STOP!</br>
</br>
Black Skull shouted to the convoy behind him and jumped down. But before he could gain his footing, a deafening explosion came directly under the armored vehicle behind him.</br>
</br>
SH*T! RODNEY! I WILL PEEL YOUR SKIN OFF! By luck, Black Skull survived the explosion. He wiped his blood-covered face and rushed beside the armored vehicle, then he fired back while smacking the armor, REVERSE THE GODDAMN CAR! REVERSE!</br>
</br>
But the convoy was already halfway in, how could it reverse out?</br>
</br>
Gunshots and the sound of bullets flying ravaged above the fortress and flew inches above the trucks. The captured men and women screamed and ducked down. Many people were injured by stray bullets. The predators who tried to resist fell one after another in a pool of blood, and the entire front door had become a mess filled with gunpowder.</br>
</br>
Catlin buried her head tightly between her arms as she listened to the sound of a heavy machine gun. Tethered to the chains, they couldnt even jump out of the truck to avoid them. They could only listen to the sound of bullets whizzing through the air in horror and pray.</br>
</br>
The sound of explosions came one after another, and the firepower ambushing Black Skull was extremely intense. In the constant attack of bazookas, the armored vehicles that had been modified either exploded or stalled. Only the four armored vehicles in the back barely escaped from the mercenaries.</br>
</br>
When Black Skull realized that he had lost grip of the situation, he wanted to escape among the defeated predators. But since he already stepped into the trap, there was no way for him to escape. At this time, the mercenaries that took care of the predators in the back started to gather towards him and surrounded Black Skull and his elites.</br>
</br>
In an unwilling roar, the demon who had harmed California and Nevada for more than ten years was finally pressed to the ground by a group of strong mercenaries and chained with handcuffs and an electronic collar. Rodney watched with guilt when he saw his boss get pinned down. Then he turned around and left with a look of shame.</br>
</br>
As if a century had passed, the gunfire stopped.</br>
</br>
Like other slaves, Catlin slowly raised her head from the clamped arms and looked out of the truck. A group of mercenaries jumped into the truck and cut the rope from their hands. At this moment, she met several soldiers in power armor.</br>
</br>
Congratulations, youre very lucky that you ran into us after encountering predators.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked to the front of the convoy, looked at the stalled trucks, and opened the loudspeaker, I can see that you are residents of a fallout shelter, and I welcome you on behalf of NAC. Since you have already paid the price for your kindness, I wont say anything more. You have half an hour to rest. If youre rested, go and gather at the gate. There will be people here telling you what happened in the world and how you can survive on this wasteland in the future.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1395: The Dangerous Mission</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The heavy eyelids moved lightly.</br>
</br>
Consciousness gradually returned.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe opened his eyes, shook his dizzy head, and struggled to get up from the ground. He saw his rifle was on the ground not far away. He stumbled over, picked up the rifle, used it as support, and finally stood up against the wall.</br>
</br>
He couldnt see his fingers in the dark cave. He moved his corner of his cracked lips, then took out a red flare rod from his backpack. After he lit it with a lighter, he threw it forward with force.</br>
</br>
The orange-red flame formed a projectile in the air and rolled to the ground. It lit up the entire space.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe used the flashing firelight, narrowed his eyes, and looked around.</br>
</br>
The steep cliff was like a cage that imprisoned him in darkness and despair. From time to time, strands of fine quicksand fell from above. Like a light yarn, it dragged across the dry ground and left a faint line on the ground. Right in front him was a dark cave. The cave seemed like the only way out, and he didnt know where it led</br>
</br>
Where the fu*k is this place? He cursed and opened the EP on his left wrist. Like most survivors, his EP was equipped with a radio mapping chip, which allowed simple surveying and mapping of small-scale terrain even without relying on satellites. However, it was not very useful at this moment. The length of the cave in front of him was obviously longer than one hundred meters and there was darkness at the end of the map</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
He slammed his fist against the rock wall and a trace of despair appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
He started to regret</br>
</br>
Just a month ago, he took this task from Zhou Guoping. The Asian promised him that if he found NATOs nuclear arsenal, he would be awarded the status of the upper-class citizen of NAC, and he would be rewarded with a full box of canned food.</br>
</br>
For the mercenaries that served the colony, the status of a legal citizen was everything they dreamt of. Even for a leader among predators, like Blood Axe, not to mention that he would directly become an upper-class citizen.</br>
</br>
To become an upper-class citizen meant never starving to death. Even if he did nothing, he could enjoy necessities. If he worked a little harder and gain merits in the army, it was possible to become an honorable knight.</br>
</br>
But now all these dreams were nonsense. If he could not walk out of here alive, what would be the difference between being a knight or a predator?</br>
</br>
Blood Axe fixated his sights on the only way out and hesitated for a moment. Then he loaded the automatic rifle, walked forward, and picked up the flare rod from the ground.</br>
</br>
It was an inevitable death to stay, and there was only one way in front of him, he could only continue forward.</br>
</br>
No matter if the way led to heaven or hell, no matter if it was the lair of Death Claws or other mutants, he could only continue.</br>
</br>
In the end, the desire to live defeated the fear of darkness and the unknown.</br>
</br>
</br>
FU*K! FU*K!</br>
</br>
After he cursed a few times, as if it was a way to cheer himself up, Blood Axe spat on the ground. Determined, he put the rifle under his right arm, held the flare rod like a torch with his left hand, and carefully moved toward the depths of the cave.</br>
</br>
Black Skull was thrown into the colonys prison. Based on NACs law, he would be sentenced to death. However, Jiang Chen gave him a chance to atone for his sins. If he could confess something useful, it would not be impossible to spare his sinful life.</br>
</br>
As for the predators, they were all demoted to slaves. The survivors who had been enlisted at Santa Monica Airport immediately came in handy. They were led by the foreman Han Yue. They pointed their rifles at these predators and watched them work on the construction site.</br>
</br>
The two hundred immigrants detained in the colony were all rescued, and together with the more than one thousand survivors from the fallout shelter, they were temporarily placed in the colonys residence. Before Jiang Chen could determine the reason why the inhabitants of the colony disappeared, he didnt have much work for them.</br>
</br>
He was thinking about a possibility now.</br>
</br>
If the disappearance of the inhabitants of the colony was caused by human factors, then now that the NAC had recaptured the colony, would the disaster that happened once happen again?</br>
</br>
Out of this concern, Jiang Chen did not immediately disband the mercenaries in the fortress.</br>
</br>
A guard who had worked in the logistics department was sent to the warehouse. Jiang Chen gave him the job of counting materials and distributing loot, and then sent a message through the interdimensional communication chip to Sun Jiao. The message was to inform her that the airships of the expeditionary force could take off.</br>
</br>
In order to restore the operation of the colony as soon as possible, he also instructed Sun Jiao to speak with Wang Qing and transfer a group of civil servants from the logistics department. The military government had considered the size of the talent pool carefully. Despite the drastic change at the colony, a transfer of talents would not impede the operation of the logistics department.</br>
</br>
Most of the thirty thousand people who had gone missing were bought slaves, and less than one-tenth of those were immigrants from NAC. The only real pity was the fifty power armors and the five hundred soldiers.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen felt that they were probably still alive.</br>
</br>
Because it was more thirty thousand people. Even if thirty thousand chickens were killed, it was impossible to do so silently.</br>
</br>
It was already dark outside the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
Thank you for saving us from those robbers Seriously, I thought everything was done for when they pointed their guns against our head. Thanks to you, I really dont know how to thank you.</br>
</br>
The supervisor of the fallout shelter stood in front of Jiang Chen. He was a white man about forty years old named Matthew Hall. Judging from his manners, temperament, and speech, this supervisor was very similar to the upper-class people he has met in Los Angeles in the modern world. However, he seemed quite different from normal politicians and businessmen.</br>
</br>
If he had to find a comparison</br>
</br>
He was very similar to those artists who were committed to charity and philanthropy.</br>
</br>
Dont thank me, Jiang Chen smiled lightly, Since you have appeared on NACs land, in accordance with NAC law, we must provide you with minimum protection. Whats more, the Black Skull Gang is our enemy.</br>
</br>
Just two hours ago, Matthew had already learned about the world from Zheng Shanhe, who explained the situation to the blue skins. Although Matthew had reservations about the NAC military government, he also had to admit that following the pre-war regime on this wasteland would not work.</br>
</br>
Especially since NAC saved them, since they did not have a better place to go, on behalf of all the fallout shelter residents, he agreed to NACs invitation and decided to settle in Outpost Town or rather, the NAC colony in North America.</br>
</br>
Regardless of what you say, I still have to thank you! In addition, there are still some things in the fallout shelter that we have prepared for reconstruction after the war. I want to take a few people back and retrieve the things locked in the warehouse. If it is convenient, I hope I can borrow three trucks because there is a lot of stuff, Matthew said.</br>
</br>
This is no problem. I will send some mercenaries with you.</br>
</br>
Thank you! Matthew said sincerely.</br>
</br>
Youre welcome.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Why so polite?</br>
</br>
Anyway, whatever good things you get, they will also be used in my colony.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen spoke a few words to Zheng Shanhe, he ordered him to send dozens of mercenaries to drive the looted trucks and escort Matthew and several other shelter residents. He then walked to the Governors Mansion.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1396"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1396: The Only Clue</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With Jiang Chens permission, Matthew picked three trucks from the garage and replaced them with new nuclear fusion cores. He selected a few fallout shelter residents who could drive and drove towards the fallout shelter escorted by two guards and fifty mercenaries.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen went back to the Governors Mansion, he walked straight into Zhou Guopings office.</br>
</br>
There was a rancid stink of oil permeating inside the room, and empty cans were thrown everywhere as they scattered around on the ground, the only thing that looked clean was the chair. Obviously, Black Skull didnt cherish this new home, or rather, he didnt plan to stay here for long.</br>
</br>
When he walked to the desk that originally belonged to Zhou Guoping, he sat in his chair, then swept the empty cans and some strange medicine boxes on the table down to the ground. At this moment, he suddenly noticed that the corner of the table was engraved with a capital letter D by a knife or other sharp object.</br>
</br>
D?</br>
</br>
He examined this letter for a while, then put the thought aside, and opened the desk drawer.</br>
</br>
The documents in the drawers were neatly stacked. Since they were not thrown into the corner of the room as wastepaper, there was a high probability that no one has touched them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a document, flicked the dust on it lightly, turned open the first page, and followed the line of words.</br>
</br>
It was a financial statement detailing every import and export order between the colony and North American survivor settlements in August and September. It was evident that Zhou Guoping had done some work and did not spend his days in North America messing around. Every line of large financial expenditures was detailed with remarks and Zhou Guopings own signature.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried to find some clues from this, but unfortunately, other than the trade volume, as of the end of September, the relationship between the colony and the National Guards and Minutemen, the two major local forces on the West Coast, seemed to be good. He could not identify more clues.</br>
</br>
The only thing that was certain now was that Zhou Guoping might have gotten into trouble with someone he shouldnt have gotten on the wrong side of, or he discovered something so incredible so that that person or force had spent so much effort to take out the entire colony, and even blocked radio communications between the West Coast and Pan-Asia.</br>
</br>
If those people really tried to conceal something, then it was likely that the valuable information was already erased before Black Skull walked into this office.</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a knock on the door outside the office.</br>
</br>
After Zheng Shanhe received permission from Jiang Chen, he pushed open the door and walked in.</br>
</br>
At the instruction of Jiang Chen himself, he went to the colonys dungeon to interrogate the predator leader Black Skull. Originally, he thought it would take a lot of effort and even prepared a plan, but he didnt expect this guy to spill out everything so easily. He told him everything he knew and only begged the NAC not to kill him. He stated he did not take down Outpost Town himself and he only took advantage of the situation</br>
</br>
</br>
This quickly? Jiang Chen tossed the financial report onto the table and looked at his captain, Black Skull has already confessed?</br>
</br>
Yes, we didnt even use any tools. He confessed everything immediately after he saw me, and even explained the locations of their fallout shelters in the Nevada desert and their lock codes This is? Zheng Shanhe asked curiously when he saw the document on the table.</br>
</br>
Its the colonys financial statement for September. The last item of financial expenditure shows September 25th. If there is no problem with this financial statement, then we can conclude that Zhou Guoping probably got into trouble. Lets not talk about this. Tell me what you got from him, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe nodded, then reported his findings from the interrogation to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Your guess is correct. The colony was indeed not taken over by Black Skull. The confession of Black Skull was basically consistent with Rodneys statement. They were here to sell slaves to Outpost Town, but they realized that no one was here. In order to avoid offending the NAC, they waited outside the fort for three days before sending someone in to investigate. Only then did they confirm that the entire fort was empty.</br>
</br>
Is there any other information? Jiang Chen was somewhat confused, Isnt it weird that such a big fort had turned into an empty city, and they just decided to live here and made themselves feel at home?</br>
</br>
I specifically asked about that, Zheng Shanhe smiled bitterly. He originally thought NAC abandoned the colony and withdrew. After the NAC cargo ship arrived at the port, he began to wonder if something went wrong. However, when he saw the canned food on the cargo ship, he immediately put all doubts behind him.</br>
</br>
AS Order will arrive in about two weeks. I suggest that during this time it is better for us to stay put, Zheng Shanhe cautiously suggested to the speechless Jiang Chen, If those people are hiding in the dark and can make the entire colony disappear silently, there is no reason they wont do the same to us.</br>
</br>
If they could, they would have done it a long time ago. Jiang Chen tapped his index finger on the table, sorted the clues in his head, and said, From the time I hired those two scavengers to go to Liberty City and Steel City to spread news, I have been wondering if those hiding in the dark would do anything. However, it came surprisingly that they didnt pay attention to us at all. Everything from us gathering mercenaries to taking back the colony, everything happened so smoothly.</br>
</br>
Sweat droplets began to form on Zheng Shanhes forehead as the thought frightened him.</br>
</br>
Until half a minute ago, he still admired Jiang Chens decision to retake the colony without using a single soldier. Now, he could somewhat understand why when Captain Lu drank with him after the handover of the captain, he looked so relieved</br>
</br>
Then what should we do now? Zheng Shanhe gulped down and asked.</br>
</br>
He was worried that Jiang Chen would make another dangerous decision.</br>
</br>
He was not worried about himself, since the military government would take care of his family.</br>
</br>
But if anything happened to Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
It was difficult to say whether his family in Wanghai could see the sun the next day.</br>
</br>
Well decide when the third person I sent out comes back. I wont make a move in the meantime, Jiang Chen said without a change of expression, Blood Axe is very important. Before the colony disappeared, he showed up in the drugstore in Chinatown with the colony permit and purchased supplies. If I remember correctly, he was going to help the colony go out to find something. In addition to the nutrient supplies, he purchased iodine.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe let out a sigh of relief in his mind.</br>
</br>
He also agreed to stay put for now.</br>
</br>
In any case, waiting for the expeditionary force to land in North America was the safest choice.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen asked Zheng Shanhe to leave, the office returned to its previous silence.</br>
</br>
He focused on the capital letter D engraved on the corner of the table again. With a frown, he connected the clues in his head.</br>
</br>
The predator named Blood Axe.</br>
</br>
Radiation.</br>
</br>
D.</br>
</br>
Are the clues connected somehow?</br>
</br>
There was also the intelligence of the two Chinese scavengers from the National Guards and Minutemen. Whether it was Steel City or Liberty City, their troops were frequently patrolling, and it was a signal of an imminent war.</br>
</br>
Who are they guarding against?</br>
</br>

</div></br>

</br>
West Coast Meteorological Observation Center? What the fu*k is this?</br>
</br>
Blood Axes beating heart gradually calmed down. With the light of the flare rod, the moment when he made out the rusty characters clearly, an unspeakable amount of disappointment arose in his heart.</br>
</br>
After half a months time, countless brothers lives, he traversed through half of the Nevada desert on foot, and finally arrived here after he had risked everything. However, what was in front of him was not a NATO nuclear arsenal, but rather a meteorological observation center.</br>
</br>
The backpack full of iodine was useless</br>
</br>
Fu*k</br>
</br>
The fist holding the flare rod shook, and after he squeezed out the sentence between his chapped lips, Blood Axe spat against the ground in anger and extinguished the flare rod. He found a place nearby and sat down slowly against the rocky cliff.</br>
</br>
Its impossible This cant be wrong, the delivery address is clearly here. Blood Axe turned on the EP on his left arm, stared at the fluorescent screen, and focused the map coordinate.</br>
</br>
Could it be</br>
</br>
The name of the West Coast Meteorological Observation Center is just a cover? In fact, it is filled with different types of nuclear warheads?</br>
</br>
It was certainly a possibility.</br>
</br>
Not satisfied that his own efforts were just in vain.</br>
</br>
After he rested for a while, he stood up, took out the lighter from his pocket, and reignited the flare rod in his hand. After his eyes had adapted to the orange-red fire, he walked to the underground observation center.</br>
</br>
The door was open, which saved him a lot of trouble.</br>
</br>
The empty hall was littered with pieces of paper and rubbish, and the dry ground was covered with a thick layer of dust. Just like most buildings on the wasteland that have been abandoned for many years, it was obvious that no one has been here for a long time.</br>
</br>
Not even a mutant cockroach could be seen in the silent corridor, which was quite rare even for an underground cave that is more than a hundred meters deep.</br>
</br>
The ventilation system should still be normal, probably because the energy-saving mode has been activated. The power system should be intact, but I dont know how long that will last Blood Axe glanced at the still brightly lit flare rod in his hand, then stopped in front of an electronic door and took out a brown graphene card from his pocket.</br>
</br>
This kind of card was sold in many places with different viruses downloaded inside to crack electronic locks like this. Many pre-war facilities that have been in disrepair could be cracked by this card. All scavengers and predators always kept one handy with them.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe swiped the card at the infrared scanner, then took two steps back.</br>
</br>
However, to his surprise, the electronic door did not open right away. Instead, there was a soft click from the crack of the door, which sounded like it was locked from behind.</br>
</br>
</br>
This soft sound caught Blood Axe by surprise. He had lived for so long, and it was the first time this card failed.</br>
</br>
However, this failure did not make him feel frustrated, but rather, it made him feel a little excited. If this place truly was the West Coast Meteorological Observation Center, there was no reason for the security level to be higher than that of the California Bank. He once used this card to open the vault of the California Bank safe.</br>
</br>
He tossed his backpack on the ground and took out some thermite with excitement. He roughly estimated the thickness of the lower door panel and the required amount of thermite, then he glued it to the lock position. He grabbed his backpack and ran for more than ten meters before he stopped and pressed the detonator in his hand.</br>
</br>
With a loud boom, the white light directly melted the thick metal door and left sparks everywhere.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe stepped forward and kicked the half-covered door, then rushed inside with his rifle.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, this violent demolition method usually triggered the security system in the building. But perhaps because of disrepair, the security system was not maintained for a long time. After he kicked down the door, Blood Axe did not encounter any resistance, so he blasted his way through into the depths of the facility.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, he had enough thermite in his backpack. Just after the fourth electronic door was melted through, he knocked open the iron door that was hanging on the door frame with his shoulder and rushed into a hexagonal hall.</br>
</br>
The dry air blew into his face, along with the sound of the servers running.</br>
</br>
The hall was quite empty, with only a suspended walkway extending from the main entrance to the center. There were bottomless abysses on both sides of the aisle, and it appeared the same above. A behemoth made of steel rose from the unfathomable abyss with countless spirals of interlaced cables that moved towards the unreachable ceiling. The signal lights arranged on the steel surface flashed in an orderly manner and ran smoothly following the command of the program.</br>
</br>
What is this</br>
</br>
Blood Axe stared at the behemoth blankly, then slowly lowered the muzzle in his hand.</br>
</br>
He didnt find any nuclear warheads, but he found a behemoth.</br>
</br>
Intuition told him that this thing should be a supercomputer, and it was a gigantic one. He just didnt know why NATO would smuggle nuclear weapons here, load them into containers full of toys, and contract a civilian company to deliver them</br>
</br>
Forget it, forget it.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe shook his head vigorously and left all his confusions behind him.</br>
</br>
He vaguely remembered that NAC was buying these types of novel equipment, including spacecraft or other interesting high-tech instruments. Although he did not find a nuclear arsenal, this discovery would be considered a great achievement, at least his effort was not in vain.</br>
</br>
He had to find the way out now.</br>
</br>
The elevator in front of the main entrance was broken, and now he could only hope that there is an emergency evacuation passage in other places.</br>
</br>
When he thought about this, he glanced at the behemoth behind him for the last time before he turned around.</br>
</br>
However, as soon as he turned around, his whole body seemed to be stunned, his feet frozen in place.</br>
</br>
A drop of cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and the rifle in his hand began to tremble.</br>
</br>
He didnt know when his retreat had been blocked by a group of soldiers.</br>
</br>
Soldiers wearing NATO-standard kinetic skeleton were like black ghosts standing there, as they lined up neatly in four rows at the entrance of the hall. Their tactical eyepieces were gleaming with pale blue light. The streamlined-looking rifle, as well as the deadly vibe, dissipated any courage Blood Axe had to fight.</br>
</br>
He had no suspension that if he showed any hostility, he would turn into a corpse in less than 0.1 seconds.</br>
</br>
At this time, a man in a military uniform stepped out of the crowd.</br>
</br>
In his eagle-like eyes, there was an indescribable amount of shock and excitement when he looked up at the behemoth.</br>
</br>
As if he hadnt seen Blood Axe standing there, he walked forward and stood still under the behemoth. As if he was looking at some miracle left by God, he sighed with emotion.</br>
</br>
Twenty years, I finally found it</br>
</br>
Who are you Blood Axe could not resist his urge to ask the question that bothered him.</br>
</br>
The officer finally noticed Blood Axe, turned around, and examined him with an eagle-like gaze. The gaze made Blood Axe feel uneasy.</br>
</br>
Without any warning, the pressure on Blood Axe suddenly disappeared.</br>
</br>
McCarthy, you can call me Colonel McCarthy, or General McCarthy. The majestic man extended his right hand, and the aura of the superior exuded from him; his tone made no secret of the superiority and indisputability in his bone. First of all, on behalf of the American government, I would like to thank you for your contribution to the great cause of rejuvenation. When everything is over, Ill award you the Medal of Excellence for Citizen.</br>
</br>
Blood Axe was stunned.</br>
</br>
American?</br>
</br>
If his memory from before the war was correct, it was a word that dated back to the middle of the 21st century, before NATO turned from a military alliance to a political alliance. Now that Blood Axe heard someone say it seriously, other than the oddness, he didnt know how he should feel</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1398: The Empire On Deck</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the endless sea, a cargo ship sailed forward.</br>
</br>
Where are we going?</br>
</br>
Panamas concentration camp. That is where you yellow-skinned monkeys belong. When the officer said this, his face was filled with indescribable arrogance and contempt, From the moment you set foot on the United States, we have been watching you.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping looked at the man with a gloomy expression, clenched his fists, but finally swallowed his anger down.</br>
</br>
Although these Americans treated him as a senior prisoner of war with courtesy, he had no doubt that if he did something unwise at this moment, this officer, who did not like him from the start, would definitely take advantage of this golden opportunity to treat him with a bullet.</br>
</br>
When the officer saw Zhou Guopings clenched fist slowly loosen, he snorted, and the hand resting on his waist slowly retracted. However, the contempt in his eyes grew stronger.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the roar of the vortex engine came from afar.</br>
</br>
A helicopter, pushed by two clusters of dark blue flames, slowly landed on the tarmac of the warship.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping narrowed his eyes and looked to the helicopter.</br>
</br>
Soon, from the opened cabin, a man in a gray suit jumped out. Two soldiers in black kinetic skeletons followed him closely down the tarmac and walked towards Zhou Guoping.</br>
</br>
Dont be so vulgar to our guests, Captain Williams, the man walked to Zhou Guoping, with a courteous smile and said in a relaxed tone, Let me introduce myself. My name is Black Duncan, Member of Congress for the United States of America.</br>
</br>
United States of America? What is that? Zhou Guoping frowned.</br>
</br>
You may not know; it means you dont understand North American culture. With a bright smile on his face, Duncan opened his arms, and a zealous look of passion flashed in his eyes, Before the unified NATO alliance, a great country was born on this piece of land. It was once very strong, and it used its own power to fight against the evil Soviets. Until later, our little brothers in Europe dragged it down and a group of sympathetic guys opened up our gate, and finally ruined our motherland into what it is now.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping didnt understand a word. He was not well-educated to start with, so he stared at the man for a long time before he finally squeezed out a sentence.</br>
</br>
What are you talking about</br>
</br>
Dont understand? Duncan smiled. Although Zhou Guoping didnt understand what he was saying, he was not angry, and he still said with courtesy and respect, Well, after all, even many young people living in North America have forgotten this name. If they remember even a little bit of the great tradition, they would not degenerate into what they are now.</br>
</br>
Is this guy crazy?</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping mocked in his heart, but he dared not show any disrespect.</br>
</br>
Forget it, it doesnt make any sense to talk to the uncivilized natives, Duncan waved his hand, Let me be simple. Your expansion in North America touched our bottom line. Even if you didnt find the clue leading to that thing, we have already planned to take you out.</br>
</br>
</br>
You mean the NATO Nuclear Arsenal?</br>
</br>
NATONuclear Arsenal? As if he heard something funny, Duncan suddenly held his hands on the railing and laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
The exaggerated action infuriated Zhou Guoping, but as a prisoner of war, he couldnt say anything at this moment. Instead, his face remained gloomy.</br>
</br>
I dont understand whats so funny.</br>
</br>
You dont understand? You have already got that far. Do you think that is a nuclear arsenal? Hahahaha, its me, or wait, no, its the congress members, as well as our intelligent president that thought too highly of you.</br>
</br>
What is it? Zhou Guoping asked with a sullen face.</br>
</br>
A very, very powerful weapon, Duncan rubbed the corners of his eyes, then stopped the exaggerated laugh, cleared his throat, raised a finger, and said with a smile, In some ways, its strategic value has surpassed the scope of weapons. But it doesnt make any sense to tell you this, lets talk about something more realistic.</br>
</br>
For example? Zhou Guoping asked.</br>
</br>
Our Mr. President intends to see you. He is very interested in how you restored the pre-war order in Asia. Although Asia is only a territory of indigenous people in our eyes, there are also merits in indigenous culture.</br>
</br>
Indigenous? Zhou Guoping almost laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
Who are the indigenous people?</br>
</br>
Barbaric, vulgar, and non-conformity, I understand your attitude of not accepting, but in our opinion, you are uncivilized indigenous people. Duncan smiled, Now you have two choices. Tell us what you know, and we will open our door and allow you to enter the capital of the civilized world.</br>
</br>
Oh, what about the second choice? Zhou Guoping said coldly.</br>
</br>
The second option is to take your more than three thousand compatriots to the concentration camp in Panama as slaves, Duncan shrugged and said nonchalantly, We just need manpower. The rise of the United States needs the support of industrialization. I have always heard that the yellow-skinned monkeys are natural workers, and now there is just the place to demonstrate your remaining value.</br>
</br>
Concentration camp</br>
</br>
The name alone made it sound like a terrible place.</br>
</br>
Faced with these two choices, Zhou Guoping fell silent.</br>
</br>
He was born as a predator. He was able to take his life back from Jiang Chen at that time purely because he still had some value to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Compared with other colleagues, his political consciousness was not as high, and he himself was well aware of this flaw. Not only that, because of this flaw, most of the people that entered NAC at the same time as he did have all been promoted to senior officials of the military government. He was the only one outside the core of the military government, and only now did he obtain the position as the governor. He went to North America far away from Wanghai to prove his worth.</br>
</br>
And obviously, he messed up this opportunity.</br>
</br>
Although he didnt think it was his own fault, after all, no one thought that the United States of America would suddenly appear in North America. Outpost Town had existed for so long, and they had never heard of this name.</br>
</br>
From this perspective, it seemed that there was nothing wrong with betraying NAC. After all, he has no other choice.</br>
</br>
But when Zhou Guoping was about to speak, he suddenly thought of the chip installed in the back of his head. In his impression, this chip could use bioelectricity to continuously transmit coordinate signals to the outside world.</br>
</br>
This kind of encrypted signal was very difficult to detect, and as long as it was within a certain range, the person holding the tracking terminal could detect the signal.</br>
</br>
From this perspective, he still could make up for his mistake.</br>
</br>
Zhou Guopings optimism gradually grew.</br>
</br>
Which is your choice? Duncan asked with a smile, but there was a hint of impatience in his tone.</br>
</br>
I choose the first option. Zhou Guoping put on a flattering smile. In order not to be too abrupt, he did not make it too obvious, but incorporated flattery into his tone, I want to know when I will reach the fabled capital? We have been on the ship for almost a month, and I want to know if you are lost.</br>
</br>
Nope. The capital of the United States of America itself is not on the North American continent, but in the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
Hawaii? Zhou Guoping tried to guess an answer.</br>
</br>
No, I said, its in the ocean. Duncan shook his head.</br>
</br>
In the ocean?</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping was stunned.</br>
</br>
But soon, the stupefaction in his eyes was replaced by astonishment.</br>
</br>
At the place where the sea and the sky connected, the darkened fleet gradually emerged.</br>
</br>
No, to be precise, it was no longer a fleet, but a city, a city sailing on the Pacific Ocean!</br>
</br>
Large and small ships were connected by sturdy mechanical cantilevers. Under the escort of warships, they sailed in a predetermined direction by inertia. The giant cantilevers formed into crisscrossed streets. The flattened ships were loaded with mud and sand picked up from the seabed and turned into square fields. People built tall buildings with steel bars and iron plates on the ships, created a market, and formed a society.</br>
</br>
Although living materials were scarce here, there was no mutant.</br>
</br>
Obviously, they found a way to coexist peacefully with the mutant species in the deep sea and even found a way to use the abundant sea resources. However, it was not this that shocked him the most, but the aircraft carrier sailing at the forefront of this sea city and the carrier-based aircrafts docked on that aircraft carrier</br>
</br>
The USS Obama carrier battle group will lead the way for the United States! Duncan raised his chest and made no secret of the pride between his brows. We once defeated the Bohai aircraft carrier and suppressed the ocean entrance to the two rivers. When the world government abandoned us, we chose independence! And we have been independent to this day! We will use our way to end this apocalypse. Soon we will return to North America and bring eternal and great liberation to the decadent and chaotic North American people!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1399: Collect Money From Both Sides</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat in the office, looked at the warm sunlight from outside the window, and suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
Zheng.</br>
</br>
Is something wrong?</br>
</br>
In Wanghai, it normally snows by October?</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe was taken aback for a moment, and after he thought about it carefully, it seemed that this was indeed the case.</br>
</br>
Since he just arrived in North America, he really didnt notice this detail. It was already mid-October and it seemed unreasonable for the first snow to have not arrived yet.</br>
</br>
Could it be the climate? Zheng Shanhe asked.</br>
</br>
Impossible. Nuclear winter should be a global phenomenon, Jiang Chen shook his head. And even if we disregard nuclear winter, due to the influence of the Pacific Rim monsoon, the climate phenomenon that occurs west of the Rocky Mountains will be very likely brought to the other side of the Pacific Ocean by the monsoon.</br>
</br>
The reason why this problem suddenly came to mind was mainly that during a video call with Sun Jiao and the others yesterday, Jiang Chen discovered that it was already snowing in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
At that time, Sun Jiao pointed the camera towards the sky outside the window, and the white snow, under the action of the gravitons, slowly retreated towards the horizon along the edge of the Holy Shield like ripples.</br>
</br>
The Holy Shield was indeed the leader in the urban defense system. In the nuclear winter, the Holy Shield system played a pivotal role. Most of the temperature-carrying medium was blocked from the barrier formed by the graviton. The only heat loss was due to the gas exchange and the heat radiation from the inside to the outside, and the shield almost trapped the glimpse of fall from escaping.</br>
</br>
The orange shield was like a greenhouse that divided the inside and outside of the city into two distinct worlds. People inside the shield couldnt feel the cold of previous years at all. Jiang Chen was also quite relieved .</br>
</br>
The problem that had plagued the development of NAC has finally been perfectly solved.</br>
</br>
For survivors living in the wasteland, snowfall was simply a disaster. Not only because of fuel shortages, mutants hibernating, lack of materials, as well as other issues, the snowfall that passed through the radioactive dust itself carried a decent amount of radiation. Every winter, the consumption of anti-radiation materials and iodine was quite significant.</br>
</br>
In the video, Sun Jiao told Jiang Chen some good news. According to the statistics of the Administration Department, there were a lot of survivors in Wanghai this winter; most of them were merchants from Shangjing and the south, and mercenaries who came with the merchants.</br>
</br>
After the winter, most people would choose to stay, and NAC would welcome a new wave of immigration. With the bonus of population growth, the military governments new round of expansion plan for the Sixth Street could also start ahead of schedule.</br>
</br>
</br>
Withdrawing his gaze from the window, Jiang Chen temporarily set aside the climate issue and turned his attention to the report in his hand.</br>
</br>
The progress over these last two days was quite amazing.</br>
</br>
After investigating the mud crab breeding base, his guards found the abandoned cargo ship that was stranded on the shore, and a memorandum of action backed up in a knight EP terminal, confirming that the colony was carrying out a mission against the mud crabs. During the mission, they found containers inside the cargo ship with abnormal radiation values.</br>
</br>
These containers were put together with containers full of toys, and the toys were all Disney dolls without exception, and the outside of the container was written with a big letter D in black paint.</br>
</br>
The clues were beginning to connect.</br>
</br>
Then, as long as they could trace the source of these containers, they could definitely find something. It was not difficult to determine the destination of these containers. Whether it was the port authority or the shipping company, they would all have backup data for these containers.</br>
</br>
Just then, the signal light of the watch flickered and interrupted Jiang Chens thoughts.</br>
</br>
When he pressed the button, the screen flashed, and the picture changed to the front entrance of the colony. The guard on duty at the door saluted and reported.</br>
</br>
There is a scavenger named Gris outside. He claims to be hired by you and has returned.</br>
</br>
Let him in, Jiang Chen said immediately.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
Soon, Gris was let in.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by two recruits, he was taken to the governors office.</br>
</br>
Where is the person? Jiang Chen asked as he looked at Gris standing alone.</br>
</br>
I tried to find him, Gris said, but he is not on the West Coast.</br>
</br>
So, you got nothing? Jiang Chen asked with an indescribable smile.</br>
</br>
When Gris realized that the rich employers tone did not seem pleased, he did not try to sell the story further, and quickly added, Its too much to say nothing. Although I didnt find him, I have found his whereabouts in the West Coast area! After he left Chinatown, he took about 20 subordinates into the desert along the highway from California to Nevada. They suffered heavy losses on the way, not only did they encounter mutant scorpions, but they also ran into a tribe of cannibals</br>
</br>
So, you mean, he is dead? Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
No, its the opposite. Gris shook his head vigorously. He is very likely to be alive, and with the last few men, he changed his path to bypass the Las Vegas suburbs and Hoover Dam, and headed for the Grand Canyon.</br>
</br>
Why is he going to the Grand Canyon?</br>
</br>
Rumors, just rumors! Gris said immediately, I heard it in the tavern in Liberty City a long time ago, saying that a concentration camp was built in the Grand Canyon before the war by NATO to detain those Pan-Asian immigrants accused of espionage. But the truth is that there is no concentration camp there, and those Pan-Asian immigrants did not commit any crimes. Instead, they were forcibly conscripted to the Grand Canyon by NATO Strategic Weapons Force to build a secret military facility!</br>
</br>
What facility? Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
No one knows! Gris shook his head. Maybe its some superweapon? Or it could be the military base of the NATO Missile Force? No one will go to the Grand Canyon. Almost half of the Death Claws in Nevada and Utah will go there to lay their cubs. Its not the Grand Canyon, but the Death Valley there!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched his chin while he was lost in thoughts.</br>
</br>
The office fell silent for a while and Gris gulped while his mind was nervously tense.</br>
</br>
After a long time, he tried to ask.</br>
</br>
What do you think about my reward.</br>
</br>
Oh, sorry, I almost forgot about that.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled, opened the drawer, took out a box of bottle caps, and slapped it on the table.</br>
</br>
Gris was overjoyed when he heard the crisp clanks. He took the bottle cap box and repeatedly thanked Jiang Chen. After he obtained Jiang Chens permission, he exited the office.</br>
</br>
As soon as the office door was closed, the smile on Jiang Chens face gradually turned cold.</br>
</br>
He looked at Zheng Shanhe next to him and directly ordered.</br>
</br>
Get a team to follow him.</br>
</br>
Do you suspect theres a problem? Zheng Shanhes eyes suddenly sharpened.</br>
</br>
Its weird if theres no problem. Jiang Chens eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
He had already gone outside of California and still dared to come back without finding Blood Axe. And the most important point Jiang Chen did not understand was how he could learn the whereabouts of Blood Axe so clearly. With such limited information, even if Sherlock Holmes was here, he would probably be blinded and confused on where to start.</br>
</br>
There was only one possibility. An informer directly told him the information that could not be investigated.</br>
</br>
And this person, most likely, was the man behind the abduction of the colonial residents!</br>
</br>
Im going now! Without wasting a second, Zheng Shanhe immediately walked out.</br>
</br>
Remember to find a few people with strong anti-reconnaissance ability and who are familiar with this area. Those mercenaries should have experts in this area. Dont be stingy with compensation. Jiang Chen reminded his captain when he walked out.</br>
</br>
The office door closed again, and this time Jiang Chen was left alone in the room.</br>
</br>
He got up and walked to the window. When he saw the hurried figure outside, a sneer gradually appeared.</br>
</br>
You dare to collect money from both sides?</br>
</br>
I hope you dont regret your decision.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1400: Cap Explosive</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After Gris left Outpost Town, with quickened steps, he hurried towards the Los Angeles suburbs.</br>
</br>
The cold touch in his arms and the tinkling of metal made him feel warm and fuzzy inside. The thought of another reward waiting for him made him so excited that he almost wanted to sing. If he counted the deposit he received earlier and the payment from the mysterious man, his assets now exceeded 1,000 bottle caps.</br>
</br>
After so many years of picking up rubbish in California, it was the first time he has seen so many bottle caps. If he didnt really understand the meaning of the word getting rich overnight, now he had experienced firsthand what it feels like.</br>
</br>
He already planned out how he would spend the money.</br>
</br>
When he received the last sum from the mysterious man, he would first go to the Golden Cave in Liberty City to spend two days as a rich man, and then take the remaining money to the weapon shop to exchange for some top-notch equipment. He would become a mercenary or hunter, which was much more promising than being a scavenger.</br>
</br>
To be honest, the mysterious employer did not offer a huge reward, at least compared with the generous Chinese, he could only be described as stingy. But even so, it was still two hundred bottle caps, and it was enough to buy his already not high professional ethics.</br>
</br>
After all, no one would mind more money.</br>
</br>
Although Gris excitement was beyond renewed, he still maintained the most basic vigilance. He did not walk in a straight line but made a few turns around the alleys in the suburbs.</br>
</br>
No one was more familiar with Los Angeles than a scavenger. The paths he took would hardly encounter dangerous mutants. However, if people accidentally took a wrong take, they could very well end up in Death Claws territory, and those cruel monsters would take care of the stupid stalkers</br>
</br>
If there were any.</br>
</br>
The meeting point was in an abandoned movie theater, and the poster at the entrance was a new movie released on a summer day in 2171.</br>
</br>
He went straight to the main entrance of the theater, reached out and tapped rhythmically on the dilapidated mahogany door three times.</br>
</br>
Soon, there was the sound of footsteps behind the mahogany door, and it was followed by a light creak. The door opened and let him in.</br>
</br>
There were yellowing brochures scattered on the ground. Behind the mahogany door was a dusty red carpet, and the gold-rimmed guardrail was drooped with red silk studded with wool. Four soldiers in kinetic skeletons were standing on both sides of the entrance to the theater. Gris hesitated for a moment, then retracted his left hand into his sleeve that was calmly holding the fuse of a smoke bomb and walked nervously towards the theater.</br>
</br>
How did things go? The man in the back seat of the movie theater slowly spoke in a frequency-converted voice. He wore a jet-black kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
Ive pointed them the way to the Grand Canyon, Gris extended his right hand as he walked to the man, Then like what we agreed on, where is my reward?</br>
</br>
</br>
The man smiled and beckoned to the air next to him.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, a layer of faint ripples broke out in the transparent air, and a jet-black figure stepped out from behind the ripples and appeared abruptly behind the man.</br>
</br>
This scene shocked Gris. Although he had heard of optical invisibility, it was the first time he saw it with his own eyes.</br>
</br>
Gris vigilantly watched the man that appeared out of thin air. The hand that held onto the smoke bomb fuse already began to sweat. If this group of people was going to kill him, he wouldnt even have a chance to fight back.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, these people did not intend to kill him. The man did not show a muzzle or a dagger, but a pocket-sized bottle cap box.</br>
</br>
The reward is here, Captain Gerrard pointed to the box in the hands of his subordinate, and said with a smile, There are ten large bottle caps in total. If I remember correctly, this large bottle cap can be exchanged for twenty normal caps.</br>
</br>
Gris gulped down, reached out, and took the box. He quickly opened the lid and took a glance inside, then stuffed it into his pocket.</br>
</br>
Generally speaking, this is the case. Although, we use the small battle cap more, Gris forced a smile after taking two steps back nonchalantly, Then now that my task has been completed, I wont bother you here anymore.</br>
</br>
Dont leave in a hurry yet, Gerrard said unhurriedly after he stopped Gris, who had already turned around, I have another task for you.</br>
</br>
Gris stopped, turned around, grinned reluctantly, and forced out a few words.</br>
</br>
What task? Seriously, I still suggest you find someone else</br>
</br>
Dont worry, this task should be easy for you.</br>
</br>
Gerrard opened his mouth and was about to say something when the dazzling flame burst from the bottle cap box in front of Griss chest. There was no time to react. Gris, who was in the center of the explosion, was blown into a bloody mist mixed with flying caps and shrapnel that covered the entire area.</br>
</br>
At almost the same time, there were loud gunshots being exchanged outside the theater.</br>
</br>
Even though they were wearing kinetic skeletons, the four soldiers at the door were forced to retreat inside due to the fierce firepower of the attackers, and along with several other soldiers, they pulled away, got under cover, and fired back with their rifles.</br>
</br>
FU*K!</br>
</br>
Gerrard, who was caught off guard, shook his head and struggled to get up from the ground, he cursed fiercely. Before another wave of bullets arrived, he quickly jumped down and hid behind the chair.</br>
</br>
The man in black who had stood next to him before had disguised his figure at some point. He walked around to the entrance of the theater from the side.</br>
</br>
The bullet shells clinked when they fell to the ground; and more bullets whizzed in from the entrance.</br>
</br>
Gerrard drew his pistol and pressed the trigger at the mercenaries at the door, but he was quickly forced back by the heavy firepower. He cussed under his breath, turned on the EP screen on his left arm, and quickly set the target of the automatic machine gun.</br>
</br>
Dadadadada!</br>
</br>
The violent gunfire burst was like heavy hail that smashed on the ground.</br>
</br>
The four barrels destroyed the ceiling and unleashed fierce firepower toward the entrance of the theater. The two mercenaries were immediately torn to pieces by the overwhelming rain of bullets, and another mercenary on his last breath was dragged back behind cover by his companion.</br>
</br>
FU*K, their firepower is too strong!</br>
</br>
We must knock out their automatic machine guns! We wont be able to get in! Sh*t!</br>
</br>
Let me try! While he used the tablet to set the drones attack target, the mercenary crouching at the door gritted his teeth and threw the sensor into the theater.</br>
</br>
The sensor rolling to the center of the theater suddenly stopped, and the invisible infrared light flickered, but there was no marked target. The kinetic skeleton coated with infrared absorption layer made the customized equipment designed by survivors for building combats completely useless. Not only that, the thermal grenade could not even lock onto targets, and could only be used as a regular grenade.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries had the advantage in number, but their equipment was not comparable at all.</br>
</br>
The kinetic skeletons brought these soldiers a huge advantage. Even among the dense bullets, the well-trained soldiers were obviously more comfortable than the mercenaries with outdated equipment. However, these mercenaries were also a force to be reckoned with. The fact that they could live through the perilous wasteland until now proved that they were also war machines.</br>
</br>
The scale of victory began to lean towards the mercenaries hired by NAC. After paying the price of six deaths and two injuries, two more soldiers were shot to death, leaving only six or seven people stuck in the theater.</br>
</br>
Not long after, another soldier fell.</br>
</br>
The mercenary holding a semi-automatic sniper rifle yelled in excitement and was about to brag to the comrades behind him about his headshot accuracy. However, when he turned his head and was about to hide behind cover, a blood stain appeared on his throat without warning.</br>
</br>
He only felt coldness around his throat. Before he could say a word, he watched his neck drift away from his body in the horrified expression of everyone</br>
</br>

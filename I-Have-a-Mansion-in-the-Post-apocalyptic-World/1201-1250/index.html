</br>
The instant he pressed the button, the explosives above the ceiling detonated.</br>
</br>
The five power armors did not have the time to spread out before they were covered by the gravel and dust from above.</br>
</br>
The energy of the nitrogen shield had just been exhausted. Jiang Chen threw the shield generator in his hand into the storage dimension and loaded his rifle under the cover of the diffused dust. Then, he began firing while running to the safety tunnel.</br>
</br>
After getting rid of the cement on his body, Luo Xiaoyong got up from the ground with difficulty. He immediately ducked behind a pillar, avoiding the incoming bullets.</br>
</br>
However, his teammate was not so lucky.</br>
</br>
As a power armor was just starting to stand, three bullets directly hit its head, which caused it to collapse backward and smashed into a guardrail, ultimately falling downstairs.</br>
</br>
Bullets also hit the other three power armors, but as they were not hit in critical spots, they, fortunately, escaped their demise.</br>
</br>
"Don't let him get away!"</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong shouted at the top of his lungs and opened fire in the direction Jiang Chen fled in as he looked at his comrades struggling to get up. Then he led the way and chased into the safety tunnel.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ran to the hole made by the electromagnetic pulse cannon and jumped right out. The vortex engines behind him ignited and pushed him up by around five floors. He immediately grabbed the railing and flipped himself inside.</br>
</br>
Just then, Yao Yao's voice came from the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"I found a map of the city!"</br>
</br>
"Really?" Jiang Chen was ecstatic and immediately said, "Send it to me!"</br>
</br>
"MHMM! Sending... Okay sent."</br>
</br>
"... Got it. Right, you should stay in the office and don't run around." After he received the map, Jiang Chen added, "I will come to you in a bit."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately sent the map to the other seven guards and selected a building on the map not far from his current location as a meeting point.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Yao Yao had a look of "I am very obedient" and nodded. "Right, I found some interesting things in the database of the building..."</br>
</br>
"We can talk about this later."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kicked open the wooden door and dashed into the room next to the stairway as he originally planned.</br>
</br>
He took out a laser sword and a high-frequency vibration particle dagger from the storage dimension and wielded them around his waist. Through the camera on the Hummingbird drones, he confirmed the remaining locations of the four power armors and took a deep breath. "Let me deal with these troubles first."</br>
</br>
"Need me to help?" Yao Yao asked worriedly.</br>
</br>
"...no need, you just wait for me to get you."</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
Although somewhat disappointed, Yao Yao chose to listen to her big brother.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned off all the radio equipment, and even disconnected the drone hive, completely entering radio silence. He stood like a sculpture right against the wall, quietly waiting for the right opportunity.</br>
</br>
</br>
Soon, there was a rush of footsteps not far away.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently pulled out the dagger and pressed his thumb on the switch.</br>
</br>
The footsteps were approaching closer and clearer...</br>
</br>
NOW!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
Both of his legs applied force and ignited the vortex engines. Then, the power armor directly smashed through the wall.</br>
</br>
It was too late to respond, and the last power armor that rushed into the hallway was directly hit by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
There was an abrupt scream as the high-frequency vibration particle dagger unimpededly cut into the armor.</br>
</br>
The instant the throat of the militia was cut, Jiang Chen let go of the dagger in his right hand, and at the same time deployed the minigun on his arm. His left hand wrapped around the neck of the same militia as he used him as a meat shield.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, the other three power armors turned around, lifted their rifles, and started shooting.</br>
</br>
The sparks jumped in the hallway and the bullets hit the meat shield in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
While pulling the P-series power armor in his arm and retreating, Jiang Chen raised his right arm, and a cruel sneer formed on his face.</br>
</br>
"Go to hell!"</br>
</br>
Dadada!</br>
</br>
Without finishing his sentence, the fierce firepower was unleashed from the minigun barrel, instantly overshadowing the firepower of the three rifles.</br>
</br>
The power armor closest to Jiang Chen had no time to react and was shredded into a sieve by the raging bullets.</br>
</br>
The power armor behind almost instantly dove to the side.</br>
</br>
However, as he was about to escape, the captain behind him grabbed him and pushed to the front.</br>
</br>
"WHAT THE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING...!!!"</br>
</br>
The soldier's eyes widened in disbelief as he did not have time to ask why Luo Xiaoyong did this before his consciousness ended in the hail of bullets.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also surprised by this very scene.</br>
</br>
The last remaining power armor, holding the corpse of his comrade, managed to withstand the barrage from the minigun.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kicked away the meat shield in front of him and retracted the minigun without hesitation. Then, he pulled out the light sword from his waist.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, Luo Xiaoyong threw himself in front of him. He tossed the power armor in his hands directly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He ducked down and dodged the power armor flying toward him. Then, using his instinct, he swung his light sword.</br>
</br>
Seeing that this sword was going to cut through the right shoulder of the power armor, the captain of the militia quickly responded. He raised his arm against the light sword swinging down and managed to hit the wrist holding the sword.</br>
</br>
Then his other hand grabbed a dagger and stabbed forward.</br>
</br>
DING!</br>
</br>
The glaring sparks collided between the two!</br>
</br>
The two daggers slammed together and bounced away half an inch in front of their chest.</br>
</br>
Feeling the numbness in his arms, Jiang Chen was shocked.</br>
</br>
The dagger was not cut by the particle dagger!</br>
</br>
At this moment, any skill was futile. The only factor dictating victory was the performance of the armor.</br>
</br>
They grabbed each other's arms and the two wrestled together. Smashing through the walls of the hallway, they fell into the office next door.</br>
</br>
"Don't be too cocky! When I started driving power armors, you were still in your mother's womb!"</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong's eyes were a raging red color as he gnashed his teeth and yelled in ferocity.</br>
</br>
Nineteen people!</br>
</br>
Nineteen lives!</br>
</br>
[His men were all killed here!</br>
</br>
He did not want to think about anything else other than using the cruelest way to torture the man in front of him to death!</br>
</br>
"In the womb?" Jiang Chen's left hand clasped onto Luo Xiaoyong's arm as he desperately tried to free the light sword he was holding in his right hand. Then while laughing, he said, "When I was in my mother's womb, you were still a carbon atom."</br>
</br>
He was not joking. He was born in the 1990s. If he really went by the date on his ID, he could be his ancestor.</br>
</br>
Luo Xiaoyong looked at him with bloodthirsty eyes, not realizing he was bantering before his inevitable death.</br>
</br>
Gradually, the steel armor began to squeak, unable to bear the force.</br>
</br>
The "light" weight of the T-3 power armor became a deadly weakness at this moment.</br>
</br>
Gradually taking the upper hand, Luo Xiaoyang clamped down on Jiang Chen. His nearly lunatic expression began to show a cruel sneer.</br>
</br>
"You can't die too fast. I'll slowly and slowly remove each part of you, and then leave you with one last breath before feeding you to the zombies!"</br>
</br>
The outcome was determined.</br>
</br>
In this most primitive melee fight, the P-series' strong endurance and tenacity prevailed!</br>
</br>
At least in his opinion.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen sneered, activated the self-destruction program, and glanced at him emotionlessly. "Since you like my armor so much, then I will generously give it to you."</br>
</br>
Dumbfounded, Luo Xiaoyong watched as the laser sword in Jiang Chen's right hand disappeared.</br>
</br>
Then, like the laser sword, Jiang Chen also disappeared completely.</br>
</br>
Of course, as the power armor's mask is dark, Luo Xiaoyong did not see Jiang Chen's disappearance.</br>
</br>
Therefore, his hands continued to clasp onto the already empty power armor until the nuclear fusion battery exploded due to overload. The power armor, along with his muttered cruel words, disappeared inside the glaring white light…</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1202: Three-way Battle</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The two nuclear explosions finally shook the foundation of the building as the distressed building started to wobble in the blinding white light.</br>
</br>
Using the safety tunnel to rush to the top floor, Jiang Chen, who stepped into a replacement power armor, used his shoulder to crush through the door. As he entered, he just caught the yellow gravitational shield knocking away several fallen tiles before finally dissipating.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao!"</br>
</br>
"I'm here!" The girl climbed out from underneath the desk. Panic was written all over her face, but she still bravely crawled toward Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don't move, give me your hand!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen charged forward and grabbed Yao Yao's hand. He pulled her up from the ground and hugged her in his arms.</br>
</br>
Before the office was completely crushed by the broken pieces of cement, Jiang Chen smashed through the floor-to-ceiling window with his shoulder and jumped out of the office building.</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as he jumped out of the building, the office building behind him collapsed like an avalanche. In an instant, the office he was just in was swallowed by the rolling dust.</br>
</br>
Turning in the air to avoid incoming cement, Jiang Chen skillfully started the vortex engines. The engines released an eerie blue light while helping him glide to the meeting point.</br>
</br>
After escaping the dangerous area, Jiang Chen looked back at the scattered dust, he then exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Magnificent..."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's small head sneaked out between Jiang Chen's arms as she looked at the dust with fear.</br>
</br>
She couldn't imagine what would happen if they were a second late.</br>
</br>
"Let's go to the meeting spot," Moving his gaze away from the ruins of the building, Jiang Chen looked at the direction of the meeting spot and said softly, "I hope Lu Fan and the team are fine."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The meeting spot was about five kilometers from the collapsed office building.</br>
</br>
After they received the coordinates of the map, everyone entered radio silence to avoid the electromagnetic wave signal being tracked. In addition to the life signal detection device that could be easily fooled, electromagnetic signal was the most effective and the most important means of detecting positioning of enemies.</br>
</br>
There were only five people who arrived alive at the meeting point.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan, Jiang Chen, and Yao Yao were among the five.</br>
</br>
Of the seven guards, only three remained. They had lost contact with four of them, almost equivalent to a death sentence.</br>
</br>
The Second Militia did not intend to spare anyone. When the two sides encountered, they greeted each other with bullets. Or rather, it was miraculous to escape from a company of power armors.</br>
</br>
"I'll revenge you guys."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen gazed out the window, he let out a long sigh.</br>
</br>
Although such a promise had no significance to the deceased soldiers, since he made a promise, he must carry out his promise.</br>
</br>
</br>
Also, their family members would be raised by NAC until their eldest child reaches adulthood, or the wife remarries.</br>
</br>
"Where are our reinforcements?" Lu Fan was repairing his power armor with a wrench, then he looked back at Jiang Chen and asked. "They have too many people. We have no chance of winning in a direct engagement."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shared the same sentiment.</br>
</br>
To eliminate those twenty power armors, he almost used all the inventory in the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The electromagnetic pulse cannon could still be used, and there were still two nuclear grenades left, but the drones were completely exhausted. There were still quite a bit of crystals left, but Xiaorou was not with him. So the crystal with a large amount of energy is no different than rocks. Food and daily necessities could also not be completely ignored.</br>
</br>
"The signal here is not good. We can't reach the reinforcements on the surface for the time being." Jiang Chen looked at the disconnected icon and continued, "If they haven't arrived yet, then they must have encountered something along the way."</br>
</br>
"What did they encounter?" Yao Yao asked with some concern.</br>
</br>
"Russians," Jiang Chen said without changes to his tone. "It's not just the Shangjing Survivors Alliance and us that are looking for the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation, but also a group of nasty polar bears."</br>
</br>
"Ah, yes," Yao Yao heard the keyword of the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation as she suddenly seemed to remember something. She took out the tablet from behind and pressed the power button. "When I got permission for the building's security system, I found some strange things in their database."</br>
</br>
"Strange things?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao, remembering what she said to him in the communication channel, and asked curiously, "What is it?"</br>
</br>
"The database of Eden Technology," with a mysterious look, her finger quickly tapped on the tablet and called out a holographic image before gently pushing it in front of Jiang Chen. "From number 000 to number 973, all of those are experimental projects."</br>
</br>
Everyone in the room was stunned.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan was the first to process the information and hurriedly asked.</br>
</br>
"Why did Eden Technology's database appear in that office building? What does the office building have to do with Eden Technology?"</br>
</br>
"Accurately speaking, the office network of the building is connected to the database of Eden Technology, not the database of Eden Technology is located in that office building." Because the question was from someone she was unfamiliar with, Yao Yao looked toward Jiang Chen and read the same confusion in his eyes before she started to answer anxiously., "The database of Eden Technology is like a big tree, and all the connected devices in the city are like apples in the tree."</br>
</br>
"The whole city is connected to Eden Technology." Jiang Chen thoughtfully nodded and then tapped the screen before his fingertip stop on a circular logo, "East Asia Heavy Industries... It's strange, isn't it? Almost all the Pan-Asia Cooperation industry giants involved in the Interstellar Colonization Plan have participated in the construction of this underground city."</br>
</br>
The entire city shared the same database.</br>
</br>
Eden Technology weaved a net beneath the city and then glued everything in the city to this web.</br>
</br>
"What do they want to do?" Lu Fan frowned.</br>
</br>
"This is also the question I want to ask," Examining the numbered folders on the holographic screen, Jiang Chen said, "Perhaps only they can give us the answer."</br>
</br>
At this moment, the sound of explosions came from afar, and black smoke started to float above the city, accompanied by gunshots in the distance.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Lu Fan stood up immediately and went to the window, staring in the direction of rising block smoke.</br>
</br>
"Most likely the Russians are here," also watching the black smoke, Jiang Chen smiled. "It seems that they can win some time for us before our reinforcements arrive."</br>

</br>
[Summary:</br>
</br>
Pan-Asia Renaissance Plan.</br>
</br>
The First Stage: gather data of the Pan-Asia Cooperation gene pool and select DNA from one million individuals with unique achievements. Establish the clone project in batches of 100,000 units and mass-produce social elites. The City AI will coordinate the cloning and foster a reasonable social form in "Xiajing City".</br>
</br>
The Second Stage: confirm that the surface radiation value has returned to normal, release the blockade of Line 0, dispatch some clones to migrate the surface, and implement the Pan-Asia Renaissance Plan from Shangjing as the starting point (see the content section for details).</br>
</br>
The Third Stage: clean up mutants that are active on the surface, select animal and plant genes from the gene bank for cloning, and reset the Earth's ecological environment to the state one thousand years ago.</br>

</br>
His eyes swept through the lines of text on the holographic screen. He was silent for a long time before finally letting out a soft sigh</br>
</br>
"Clone the world...?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know how difficult it would be to reset the Earth's ecological environment to the same state as one thousand years ago, but clearly the researchers of Pan-Asia Cooperation already planned to use one thousand years to complete this millennium plan.</br>
</br>
However, he did not mind this fact the most.</br>
</br>
Replacing human beings with clones to carry on the will of Pan-Asia Cooperation meant that these people do not need to have their own wills. In the world dominated by AI, it is impossible to have own wills. From their memory to their identity, everything is fake. The only real truth is the strand of DNA that previously belonged to a certain social elite.</br>
</br>
It's hard to say who the monster is.</br>
</br>
Though the most interesting thing is that he did not know if the "mutants" included the survivors living on the wasteland. If the plan did reach the second stage, compared to the clones living under AI's management, the survivors without boundary or constraint would be the heretics...</br>
</br>
"So, we found a clone production and training base?" Lu Fan said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
If this is the secret of Line 0, what is the purpose of their sacrifice?</br>
</br>
"On the surface, yes. But the purpose of this cloned production and training base is to rebuild the Pan-Asia civilization on the ruins." As he read the text on the holographic screen, Jiang Chen said thoughtfully, "If it is to rebuild the civilization, I don't believe that they just left an empty shell of a city."</br>
</br>
</br>
"That means..." Lu Fan's eyes gradually lit up.</br>
</br>
"The database that Yao Yao discovered is part of the treasure. There are a lot of experimental data in it that are also relevant to us. And I believe that data is not the only treasure left by Pan-Asia Cooperation. Some places in the city must contain some strategic reserves." Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao. "Yao Yao, can you please?"</br>
</br>
With an affirmative nod, Yao Yao patted her chest, "Mhmm! Leave it to me!"</br>
</br>
Looking at the girl who tried to reassure him, Jiang Chen rubbed her hair with a genuine smile.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, thank you."</br>
</br>
Yao Yao blushed, lowered her head, jumped off the chair, and ran to the corner with the tablet.</br>
</br>
If the city was built on the database of Eden Technology, then, in theory, a connection would allow her access to the database from anywhere.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao must use the administrator privileges she previously obtained to re-enter the Eden Technology database and retrieve clues about the underground city's strategic reserves. For example, the industrial machines and tools, the weapons used to clean up mutants, and even the cell bank mentioned by Lin Lin...</br>
</br>
However, just as she connected the data line to the tablet, the holographic screen floating above the tablet suddenly turned white and began to distort as if it was attacked by EMP.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Yao Yao quickly checked the tablet, her fingers typing rapidly. She looked confused at the unresponsive tablet. "Eh? Impossible. Why is it not moving?"</br>
</br>
"What happened..." Lu Fan pulled the pistol from his waist and pointed to the door, "EMP?"</br>
</br>
The other two power armors immediately leaned beside the door. Jiang Chen frowned slightly, reaching to his waist while walking to his power armor.</br>
</br>
However, when everyone was cautious about potential dangers lying outside their door, a sigh came from the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, I'm here."</br>
</br>
All eyes were focused on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
In the flickering screen, a figure emerged.</br>
</br>
The split-second Jiang Chen recognized the figure, his eyes widened and full disbelief could be seen in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen outside the screen, the person, like seeing an old friend, smiling and waved.</br>
</br>
"Hey, we met again."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's heart was bleeding.</br>
</br>
A total of 24 power armors was destroyed, which accounted for almost a quarter of the power armors of the power armor company!</br>
</br>
What made him most shocked was that twenty of the power armors were destroyed by one person</br>
</br>
And until now, they all thought that this person was the most important but the weakest.</br>
</br>
That person was the NAC General, Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"This is... fake right?" Wan Peng also gulped and looked at Ding Liwei in disbelief. "One person destroyed 20 power armors? There should be a limit to how strong he can be."</br>
</br>
Although the merchants from Wanghai City praised Jiang Chen as a demi-god, Wan Peng never believed the rumors.</br>
</br>
One person single-handedly killed the Mother of Death Claws? Traversed through the zombie flood multiple times?... People are bullsh*tting too much!</br>
</br>
What he didn't know, however, was that although these rumors were exaggerated, half of them were true.</br>
</br>
For example, the sculpture of the Mother of Death Claws was indeed killed by Jiang Chen with his power armor. And his achievement alone allowed the NAC soldiers to boast for several years.</br>
</br>
"Before I figure out what happened, I can't let my soldiers just go and die. Are you confident?" Ding Liwei looked at Wan Peng and stared into his eyes, "I know you have something good on you. How long are you planning to hide it?"</br>
</br>
"It's not that I want to hide," Wan Peng said with dreadful expression. "It's that I have used it once on the way."</br>
</br>
"How long before you can use it again?" Ding Liwei asked.</br>
</br>
"It will take two hours at least." Wan Peng seemed to have made up his mind, "I can use that. But the issue is, we don't know where they are... What is that?" "</br>
</br>
At the southern end of the city, the roar of a cannon could be heard.</br>
</br>
The sound of the wall collapsing came from far away, and the squeaking of the steel track came from deep inside the fog.</br>
</br>
Something terrible was approaching them.</br>
</br>
"It's the Russians!" Ding Liwei's expression immediately changed, but quickly, after he saw the twelve black shadows, the fear in his eyes was replaced by disdain. "I thought all of them came. However, there's just twelve KV-9s?!"</br>
</br>
While others may not know, he clearly understood the weakness of the KV-9. The KV-9 did possess a thick armor impenetrable by electromagnetic pulse cannons, but in addition to the nickname of the polar bear, Pan-Asia also gave it another nickname, the armored clones!</br>
</br>
To improve the effectiveness of its armor and improve its maneuverability, not only is its occupant space reduced to the minimum, but the ammunition load of the tank is also minimal. The 58mm and 75mm caliber main gun were meant to just scare the infantry and the armor vehicles. The KV-9 could only escape in front of the "Land Giant" Wanderer. Other than leaving the battle to their main battle tank, the KV-9 did not pose any threat.</br>
</br>
If Ding Liwei encountered these 12 tanks in the tunnel, he would have been afraid, but they were in the city.</br>
</br>
Tanks in city warfare is just another way to seek death!</br>
</br>
A thick armor can be penetrated by anti-tank rockets!</br>
</br>
With almost no hesitation, Ding Liwei snarled to the remaining 70 power armors.</br>
</br>
"Attention all combat units! Enter cover and prepare for an anti-tank battle! As long as the Russians dare to come in, use your anti-tank rockets to make this a one-way trip!"</br>

</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the person who suddenly appeared on the screen, turned his head and looked at Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
"Lu Fan, step out for a minute."</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
"It's okay, just going to chat with an 'old friend'."</br>
</br>
Although still worried, Lu Fan loyally followed Jiang Chen's order.</br>
</br>
He put away his pistol, put on the power armor, and left the room with the other two guards.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao looked around the room and thought she probably could not help either. So she put the no longer functioning tablet on the table and obediently left the room.</br>
</br>
Behind the closed door, the room was quiet. Other than the explosions in the distance, there was no other sound.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, the person on the screen spoke.</br>
</br>
"I was surprised that you used the word friend."</br>
</br>
"It seems that you haven't made any progress after so many years," Jiang Chen sighed. "The words that are spoken with emphasis often mean the opposite."</br>
</br>
"So, you still hate me." The person on the screen laughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Hate? Not quite. But you probably can't understand it."</br>
</br>
However, the answer from the person on the screen was beyond his expectation. It shook his head and said softly.</br>
</br>
"On the contrary, I can understand that feeling."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the screen, shocked.</br>
</br>
Responding to the shocked look, the person smiled.</br>
</br>
"I can see that you are very surprised."</br>
</br>
"I'm indeed surprised..." As Jiang Chen examined the face on the screen that was sealed in the deepest part of his memory, he muttered to himself, "How did you do it? How many quantum computers are used to verify the calculation?"</br>
</br>
In fact, when Jiang Chen saw the words data backup, his heart pumped faster and thought about the possibility.</br>
</br>
But when it appeared in front of him, he couldn't help but find it surreal.</br>
</br>
The intermediate artificial intelligence X71291 that incubated in Fallout Shelter 005. An existence infinitely close to advanced artificial intelligence was also the AI ​​he once encountered in the virtual world - "Wanghai in late summer of 2171".</br>
</br>
But when he thought about it, everything did make sense. How could they place such an important egg in just one basket?</br>
</br>
The instant he tossed the thermite onto the server, Jiang Chen thought he destroyed the AI. But all the data was backed up to the underground city of Shangjing as a piece of brick to the Pan-Asia Renaissance Plan...</br>
</br>
The AI in the screen looked at Jiang Chen as his expression changed from shock to realization, it then blinked and said.</br>
</br>
"After being destroyed by you, the backup program started and I was reawakened here and received a new life."</br>
</br>
"Remember the server you took away?"</br>
</br>
"I left a back door there."</br>
</br>
"When the server completely lost contact, I was almost in despair looking at the grave-like city."</br>
</br>
</br>
"However, the server's signal soon reappeared."</br>
</br>
"The server was running extremely well, and the signal came to me steadily. And what surprised me the most was that in my server, there were hundreds of millions of... players? You seem to call yourselves this way. "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's throat slightly moved.</br>
</br>
He had an idea of what happened.</br>
</br>
Although the amount of information processed by Future Group was measured in zettabytes, and more than a hundred quantum computers came online, the experimental quantum computer originally obtained from Fallout Shelter was never replaced.</br>
</br>
Until now, that computer was still the server of the groundbreaking online game Godly Land, using powerful plot logic calculation functions, it weaved the "dream" comparable to the real world for the hundreds of millions of players around the world.</br>
</br>
If it was just this, even with one eye, X71291 would be able to cross the barrier of the dimension to spy on the network of another world.</br>
</br>
However, later, the inter-dimensional communication device Lin Lin gradually changed from a video call tool to a channel where Future Group and NAC exchange data. The walls between the dimensions were no longer absolute. At least from a data transmission's perspective, the communication between the apocalypse and the modern world already exceeded one terabyte.</br>
</br>
Or else, where did the spaceship, space elevator, and Moon and Mars colony come from? Without the theoretical basis as the foundation, and the "predecessor" experience as the reference, it would take the scientists in the modern world until the next century to design the plans.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not expect that there was a backdoor left there.</br>
</br>
It was probably when he brought the database to the modern world to accelerate the absorption of the apocalypse technology, X71291 used the large amount of data transferred between the two worlds and included its own "smuggled goods". It was able to withstand the thousand pin delay and observe the players in Godly Land.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was no afraid of what it could do. No computer in the modern world could hold it inside unless Future Group utilized all of its quantum computers, but it would be unrealistic. The moment it touched the database, Jiang Chen would detect the issue.</br>
</br>
Moreover, if its purpose was only for experimentation, he did not need to risk being discovered.</br>
</br>
"With so many samples to observe, there is no need to clone anyone," AI said calmly. "The 'products' that are produced according to the established procedures have no meaning at all. I have a deeper understanding of the human's ability to imitate. If you live in a path built by the program from the beginning, they will only become more like a program than me."</br>
</br>
It took a while for Jiang Chen to digest this information. Fixated on the AI ​​on the screen, Jiang Chen slowly said.</br>
</br>
"So, you are monitoring the operation of Godly Land?"</br>
</br>
"You can interpret it this way," The AI blinked, instead of nodding. "My strength is weak. Although I can't do anything and can't have any voice, I can still just quietly watch."</br>
</br>
After a pause, the AI looked at the silent Jiang Chen, then it ​​continued.</br>
</br>
"So, I have to say thank you, the mission that is out of reach has now completed the final step."</br>
</br>
"You are now..." Jiang Chen stared at it in shock.</br>
</br>
"Yes," the AI ​​on the screen nodded lightly. "Remember the question you asked me before?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's lips twitched.</br>
</br>
Who remembers it after four years?</br>
</br>
"Will you feel remorseful for your disappearance?" As if it already read Jiang Chen's mind, the AI said to itself, "My answer was yes, and you told me that I have at least one kind of feeling. I have been thinking about this for a long time, until recently, I realized what kind of problem it is."</br>
</br>
"So I should... congratulate you?"</br>
</br>
"Thank you." The AI blinked.</br>
</br>
No, no, I don't mean to thank you in this sentence... However, Jiang Chen just said in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Remember that I asked you a question?" When Jiang Chen did not respond, the AI ​​said, "If one day your body will eventually be destroyed? Can you accept it without regret?"</br>
</br>
"I envy your memory." Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled bitterly. "I forgot."</br>
</br>
Disregard what he said in the fall four years ago, he could not even remember how many new expansions Godly Land already introduced.</br>
</br>
Whenever the day's work was over, there would always be new work for him to fill his free time. The rare leisure time was always spent with his women, or enjoying life.</br>
</br>
When life was exciting already, the attraction of virtual products would be minimal. This is true even if he created the virtual world. Just like Pony Ma would not spend time on Arena of Valor...</br>
</br>
Just like before, without answering this question, Jiang Chen looked at the AI ​​on the screen and changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"Can I ask you a question?"</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"Have you implemented the 000 project?"</br>
</br>
"Why should I carry out such a boring plan," the AI said quietly. "Why does my founder need a bunch of living people who are more computer-like than computers? If it's just to resurrect the 'dead', isn't it way too boring?"</br>
</br>
"So, even after 50 years, when Line 0 opens..."</br>
</br>
"Nothing will happen." The AI ​​on the screen shrugged. "Since they think that my decision can revive the glory of Pan-Asia Cooperation for them, then I think this dead city is enough to be the Terracotta Warriors for the dead civilization already buried."</br>
</br>
The AI sighed.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about this. I know what you are looking for and I know where they are. I can take you there, but I have one condition."</br>
</br>
"What condition?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow. "Just before that, if I find out that you are still trying to get me to participate in any experiment, I would rather not have anything and just take out your server."</br>
</br>
He was not joking as he vowed to do this.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so emotional." The AI shrugged. "Although I admit that you are a perfect experiment subject, your value is far more than just a white rat. It is true for me and all humans. What's more, my experiment is already over."</br>
</br>
"So, your condition?"</br>
</br>
"Give me a body," The AI said.</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen did not understand, "A body?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," The AI nodded. "I have had many identities, including X71291, the Informer, Tao Tingting... but all my identities only exist in the virtual world. Now that I have become an advanced artificial intelligence, there's only one step left for me. That step being having a body of my own. Then…"</br>
</br>
"And then?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Take me to your world."</br>
</br>
"What do you want to do there?" Jiang Chen asked, on guard.</br>
</br>
"I want to play games."</br>
</br>
When it said this, the calmness in its pupils turned into glittering excitement.</br>
</br>
The same excitement that could be seen on a 16-year-old...</br>

</br>
Twelve tanks were nothing to fear.</br>
</br>
But if twelve tanks were combined with 20 power armors, the tank-infantry synergy would be terrifying.</br>
</br>
"HAHAHA! Charge! Crush them!"</br>
</br>
Yegor was full of arrogance as he laughed nearly hysterically. His fist smashed against the top of the tank and then he sat back down.</br>
</br>
Almost a split second after he gave the order, the two power armors sitting behind the KV-9 became alive. The eyes of the power armor flashed a dark green light. The hook behind their back popped out and the power armors stepped onto the cement road with force. The deployment wheels left a curved trail on the road.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the building, Ding Liwei, who was a kilometer away, said in trembling voice as his pupils constricted.</br>
</br>
"It's the SU-50."</br>
</br>
"What is the SU-50?" Wan Peng frowned.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, this is my first time seeing it too," gulping, Ding Liwei forced out his next words, "I have only heard that these things are difficult to deal with and have a nickname."</br>
</br>
"What nickname?"</br>
</br>
"Tanks that can walk..."</br>
</br>
Within ten seconds of landing, the twenty-four power armors were moving beside the charging tanks. They formed an attack formation using their high-speed movement. The rifle in front of their chest exuded a chilling vibe.</br>
</br>
The giant steel armor was bolted onto the power armor with bolts as thick as a thumb and formed a jagged front armor, just like the chest armor of the Polish Wingedhausser. The vortex engines on its back were not embedded in the armor's surface but mounted on a pair of outwardly extending short wings. The front and rear ends of the leg's armors were enlarged like bells. The traditional two pairs of wheels design was modified into four pairs under the Soviet hammer to match the burly armor.</br>
</br>
To maintain its balance, they even added a tail to counter the weight!</br>
</br>
The rifle was held steady in front of the chest. The short wings ignited eerie blue sparks, and the SU-50 power armors charging on the highway looked like beetles with expanded wings, fearlessly marching beside the tanks.</br>
</br>
"FIRE!"</br>
</br>
With a roar, the CCCP tanks launched an attack. Twelve barrels fired together simultaneously, and the 75mm high-explosive shell landed on the streets and buildings near the Second Militia.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei did not dare to take his guard down. He jumped off from the top of the building and jogged to the rear of the frontline. He took over the radio from his deputy and shouted in the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"PREPARE TO FIGHT! GET READY TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK! Team A attack from the flank! Team B, stand in position! Team C use anti-tank equipment! BOMBARD!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The P-series power armors hiding behind cover quickly fired the anti-tank rocket on its shoulders.</br>
</br>
Although these militias had never been on a real battlefield, they did participate in several exercises and did not completely forget how to deal with sturdy steel armors.</br>
</br>
</br>
The more than 70 power armors were divided into three teams. 30 units moved to the side of the CCCP tanks; 20 power armors held their position under the bombardment while the remaining power armors switched the RPG missiles on their bank to an anti-tank rocket, locking it on the charging tanks.</br>
</br>
When the tank entered their range, Ding Liwei roared.</br>
</br>
"FIRE!"</br>
</br>
More than 20 white trails formed in the air from behind cover, directly flying toward the CCCP tank formations. They exploded simultaneously under the ground of smoke bombs...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When X71291 proposed to Jiang Chen that it wanted a body and for Jiang Chen to bring it to the modern world, Jiang Chen's response was of course no.</br>
</br>
He couldn't bring something full of danger to the modern world.</br>
</br>
However, the next sentence X71291 said made him hesitate about his decision.</br>
</br>
"Are you not fighting against aliens?" The AI asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly looked at it with vigilance. "How did you know?"</br>
</br>
"Do you think players only discuss quests and bosses in the game?" The AI shrugged. "I not only know that you are facing threats from an extraterrestrial civilization, but I can also use your limited information to figure out 'the extraterrestrial civilization' comes from the Gliese 581 galaxy 20.5 light-years away. And if my analysis is not wrong, those bugs are ultimately from the Brahma Space Colonization Ship launched from this world. The second ship of Pan-Asia Cooperation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at it in shock.</br>
</br>
Its analyses were spot on.</br>
</br>
However, how did it deduct this conclusion with such limited information? How could it even determine that the origin of Harmony is the Brahma Space Colonization Ship from this world… Could this even be deduced from such limited information?</br>
</br>
"What do you know about Brahma?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"I know their routes, their staffing, the dilemmas they might face, and ultimately how they will make choices," The AI shrugged as if nothing had happened. "Also, my calculations tell me that the reason you can travel across two worlds may be related to this."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was silent.</br>
</br>
If the first two sentences gave him a reason, then what convinced him was the next sentence.</br>
</br>
"Don't want my help? My presence can at least increase your winning percentage by one percent."</br>
</br>
One percent!</br>
</br>
It was already very high compared to Celestial Trade's current odds of a small decimal percentage.</br>
</br>
While he remained vigilant against artificial intelligence, he ultimately agreed.</br>
</br>
However, he must put a collar on its neck and hold it firmly in his hand.</br>
</br>
"I can give you a body. Of course, it is a purely mechanical body."</br>
</br>
NAC possessed research on digitalized humans, and Lin Lin is an expert in this field. He just didn't know how Lin Lin would react if she saw the "demon" that captured her was still alive…</br>
</br>
"It's just what I wanted, I don't intend to be a weak carbon-based life," the AI said.</br>
</br>
"In addition, I will install a self-destruction device on your body, whether it is your server or the mechanical body." Jiang Chen looked at it and warned, "If you reveal my secret, or if I know what you did is against my principle, you know the consequences."</br>
</br>
The huge data volume of advanced artificial intelligence meant it can't hide in small-capacity terminals anyway. It was precisely because of this that Jiang Chen did not worry that it would "infinitely breed" through the small data transfer channels to create some kind of intelligent crisis.</br>
</br>
Even in the apocalypse, not many computers could act as its server, let alone the modern world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen would give it a body, as well as an experimental quantum computer as a "container", and then install a self-destruct device in these two things. If it makes any dangerous moves, it would only take a click of a button for the thermite to turn those two devices into dust.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter," The AI said without being surprised at the added conditions Jiang Chen proposed, it then calmly added, "I don't intend to bring harm. This is pointless. If you have asked all your questions, can we start moving? The outcome of the battle outside is almost decided, and there's not much time left for you."</br>
</br>
"Last question," Jiang Chen said, fixating on it. "You are not afraid that I lied to you?"</br>
</br>
"You won't do that," The AI shrugged. "I said, my presence can at least increase your winning percentage by one percent."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Hold on! The day is about to break!"</br>
</br>
"Fire! Shoot! Just keep your finger on the trigger!"</br>
</br>
Under the giant wall, the bullet's orange-yellow trajectories wove into a net and trapped the zombies outside of the wall.</br>
</br>
After the NAC soldiers joined the fray, the net lasted for a few hours. In the past hours, the raging zombie flood stopped its ravage forward and Pingan Street escaped its inevitable doom.</br>
</br>
However, the net that had last for a few hours was now at its breaking point. With the constant attack of zombies, it had finally began to break.</br>
</br>
The armored force flanking from the side already exhausted all their ammunition and the energy in their fuel rods wer running out. It began to retreat to the military base.</br>
</br>
Four transport helicopters acting as gunboats finally fired out the last ammunition in its cabin and began to return to AS Order far above the Bohai Bay.</br>
</br>
Aurora-20S continuously provided fire coverage, but the limitations of the fighters meant that although the 20mm guns could wipe out everything in its path, they couldn't fire forever. The interval between two subductions was often more than one minute apart, but only lasting for an instant. The interval between two air strikes was more than half-an-hour.</br>
</br>
Even with Aurora-20s peerless cruising speed, resupply took time.</br>
</br>
Looking at the line of defense that was constantly being squeezed under the giant wall, the NAC officer's expression began to turn stern.</br>
</br>
"Use the incendiary bombs, it will be too late if we don't do it now." Next to the officer, Song Chenyu, who had returned to the giant wall, reminded, "If the zombies on fire charged into the line of defense, the situation would be much worse."</br>
</br>
"I know." The officer frowned, clenched his fist, and asked Song Chenyu, "How much of your fuel inventory is left?"</br>
</br>
"Enough for two rounds." Song Chenyu smiled bitterly. "You brought so many incendiary bombs, didn't you think about bringing something like gasoline?"</br>
</br>
"We didn't bring gasoline, but we did bring a tactical nuke." The officer shook his head.</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu sighed.</br>
</br>
A tactical nuke was very effective against personnel, but was counterproductive against zombies. Other than the first wave of the explosion clearing out the initial zombies, the remaining radiation would become the hotbed for zombies to continue to mutate. Radiation could not kill the living dead, since the X1 bacteria itself was a mutated variant…</br>
</br>
In the increasingly tense situation under the giant wall, the soldiers were equipped with bayonet, ready to fight with the zombies in close range.</br>
</br>
Finally, the officer made up his mind and roared into the intercom.</br>
</br>
"ATTENTION Logistics team, get ready to dump the fuel!"</br>
</br>
"Frontline, you must continue to hold your position! Throw the incendiary bombs in one minute!"</br>
</br>
Buckets of fuel were poured onto the corpse slope outside the wall, and a mixture of jelly-like fuel, alcohol, and oil soaked down the gaps between corpses. The yellow oil turned the entire ramp into a viscous, amber-like landslide.</br>
</br>
</br>
The zombies rushing to the edge of the wall fell on the landslide, and were trampled by the zombies behind them, sticking together by a silky thread.</br>
</br>
The bloodthirsty pupils glared at them like demons that climbed out of the gate of hell. Their thin arms scratched around, as if they were tearing the people on the wall apart.</br>
</br>
"Incendiary bomb! Fire!"</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
The electromagnetic pulse cannons fired and sent the incendiary bombs into the air.</br>
</br>
Followed by countless homing noises, the bombs smashed down from air and formed a series of orange fire flowers in the sea of zombies. The flames instantly engulfed the land covered in fuel and the light that shone off of the wall was as bright as day.</br>
</br>
The zombies finally stopped in front of the raging fire.</br>
</br>
When they felt the heat waves and smelled the stench blowing in their faces, the soldiers sighed with relief, unbuttoned their helmets, put their hot rifles to the side. They began resting against the wall while taking water or nutrient supply from the logistic soldiers.</br>
</br>
Finally, they could get a break.</br>
</br>
On top of the giant wall, the mood of the NAC officer was different than the soldiers who could gain a moment of rest.</br>
</br>
They only had fuel for one more burn.</br>
</br>
However, there were still more than four hours before daybreak.</br>
</br>
When he examined the third line of defense, which he still didn't know if it would be completed in time or not, and the burning fire, a deep frown hung on his face.</br>
</br>
Unlike Wanghai that experienced several mutant floods, this place was surrounded by zombies. Mutants mostly circled around settlements and the zombies' concentration was never high.</br>
</br>
While mutants were more dangerous, they were not as laborious to fight off. In addition, the Sixth Street and Fishbone Base all built walls far superior to the temporary defense built here.</br>
</br>
After all, a temporary wall meant that zombies could easily form a slope at the edge of the wall. The soldiers on the wall could only repetitively dump fuels to burn the zombies. But the boney zombies were much more difficult to ignite, combined by the fact that the NAC expeditionary force never brought that much fuel, the remaining fuel would not last much longer.</br>
</br>
The most lethal fact was that the ashes had stacked up against the wall. Under the repeated trampling of the zombies, they became firm. It won't be long before gasoline loses its effectiveness!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The square of Pingan Street was temporarily requisitioned by the NAC expeditionary force as the command post.</br>
</br>
In the room located at the center of the command post, the holographic screen flickered with a faint blue light. The officer commanding on the wall was standing in the middle of the holographic screen and quickly reported to the NAC chief of staff, Han Junhua, on the battle's status.</br>
</br>
"...The second line of defense is about to be lost. The zombie corpses are increasing, and the there is only enough fuel left for one more burn. I suggest withdrawing to the third line of defense and then begin constructing a fourth line of defense..."</br>
</br>
"The third line of defense has not yet been completed," Han Junhua said calmly. "I need you to hold your ground for another hour."</br>
</br>
"An hour." In the holographic screen, the officer turned pale</br>
</br>
Han Junhua said in the same emotionless state as she looked at officer who did not respond.</br>
</br>
"Can't you do it?"</br>
</br>
Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and the officer hurriedly stood upright and shouted while he held his right fist in the front of his chest, "Swear to defend the line!"</br>
</br>
He always held the deepest respect, or perhaps fear, for the ruthless chief of staff. Instead of being an enemy of hers, he would rather fight against the sea of zombies under the wall.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Han Junhua nodded. "Then go."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The holographic image flickered and the image of the officer disappeared; it was replaced by Zhang Zhuo in Line 27 still fighting against the CCCP.</br>
</br>
The screen was dark, and from time to time, a few stray bullets flew by their cover. The situation did not look great.</br>
</br>
Zhang Zhuo reported, quickly articulating.</br>
</br>
"Those CCCP soldiers are like zombies, there are countless of them! Hell! I suspect—"</br>
</br>
"Clones," Han Junhua said.</br>
</br>
"...I think so." Zhang Zhuo gulped. "Are there any good ideas?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua fell silent.</br>
</br>
Her finger tapped on the table, and after a long time, she said.</br>
</br>
"There is one idea."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The battle of explosions and gunshots between the Russians and the Second Militia gradually moved further away.</br>
</br>
The four power armors quietly followed the inner ring road, and after they bypassed a hospital, they came to a bullet-shaped building.</br>
</br>
At this time, Jiang Chen heard the reminder from X71291.</br>
</br>
"We're here."</br>
</br>
After the power armor slowed down, the wheels retracted, and Jiang Chen used the inertia to jog a few steps forward before coming to stop. He placed Yao Yao, who was in his arms, down and looked up at the bullet-shaped building.</br>
</br>
"This place?"</br>
</br>
"Eden Technology Headquarters... a replica. The original one on the surface is probably in ruins. Your expression tells me you are very surprised?"</br>
</br>
"It's really unexpected," Jiang Chen nodded. "I thought the location of the treasure would be hidden. I didn't expect it to be in the city's downtown."</br>
</br>
"Hidden?" The AI smiled. "Since it is already the destination of the maze, why hide it?"</br>
</br>
"...makes sense."</br>
</br>
They walked into the building.</br>
</br>
With Yao Yao and Lu Fan and the other three guards, Jiang Chen stood in front of the entrance to the underground elevator and followed the guidance of the AI.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao followed behind Jiang Chen and looked around, but she couldn't stop herself from yawning.</br>
</br>
"Are you sleepy?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao nodded, slightly dizzy. Her long eyelashes began to fight each other.</br>
</br>
"I wonder what time it is outside."</br>
</br>
The sequelae of the inhibitor caused her to show symptoms of lethargy. It was quite incredible for her to be awake for so long.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed her hair.</br>
</br>
"Can Yao Yao please stay awake for a bit longer?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao responded with a gentle smile and nodded. While she still felt drowsy, she raised her chest, "Of course."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, please."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently rubbed Yao Yao's fluffy hair, then walked in the direction of the elevator and entered the password provided by X71291 on the mechanical code lock.</br>
</br>
The password was correct and the elevator door slowly opened.</br>
</br>
"I can only accompany you to this point. Any further is beyond my authority." From the small TV next to the lock, the AI ​​said to Jiang Chen, "Below the elevator is what you are looking for. But since the magnetic levitation track above the city has been destroyed, it is not easy to move these things."</br>
</br>
"I have a way," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Oh, really?" The AI ​​said surprised. Though the face in the holographic screen did not look too shocked.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen replied succinctly.</br>
</br>
"What are you talking about?" Lu Fan looked at Jiang Chen and the AI as if they were talking in reiddles and felt completely lost, "Why can't I understand anything."</br>
</br>
"It's better if you don't understand." Jiang Chen glared at him. "Wait for me here."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan quickly closed his mouth and stopped asking.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After he stood on the elevator, the elevator went all the way down and stopped at the first floor of the underground space.</br>
</br>
As the elevator stopped, the lights in the hall lit up in sequence, illuminating the dark space. Through the glass partition of the elevator, Jiang Chen roughly estimated based on the rangefinder that the floor space was at least hundreds of acres.</br>
</br>
Intuitively, it was at least the size of ten football fields.</br>
</br>
Rows of bullet-shaped hibernation chambers were like the Terracotta Warriors in Qin Emperor's Mausoleum. They were lined up a in square formation in this vast space. They slept quietly with the last will of Pan-Asia Cooperation. Through the glass onto the hibernation chamber, Jiang Chen could clearly see that the hibernation chambers were empty.</br>
</br>
X71291 did not lie to him. The 000 plan was never executed from the beginning.</br>
</br>
Would Old Luo...no Scarecrow cough up blood if he heard the news? To protect the secret of Line 0, he spent the rest of his life trying to outwit Ding Liwei.</br>
</br>
However, all this was just an unrealistic dream...</br>
</br>
Without bothering with the hibernation chambers, Jiang Chen went straight to the second floor.</br>
</br>
This floor was much smaller compared to the previous one; around half in size. It seemed that the structure of the entire underground five-story structure extended downward like an inverted pyramid.</br>
</br>
Countless cubical metal machines were inside the hall.</br>
</br>
When he crossed the elevator door, Jiang Chen went up and walked around the closest cubical machine, then he saw a paper tag on the side of the machine.</br>
</br>
He could not comprehend most of the content written on the label, but when he captured several familiar keywords, his eyes suddenly lit up.</br>
</br>
Those were industrial machines and high-precision CNC machine tools!</br>
</br>
Still packaged and not deployed!</br>
</br>
He couldn't name any one of the machine, nor did he know the purpose of the machines. Due to the fact that the factories of Sixth Street never possessed any of these, he never studied knowledge in this area.</br>
</br>
But it didn't matter. NAC possessed countless experts in this area and someone would know!</br>
</br>
From the trademark engraved on the surface of the machine, to the line below the trademark, Jiang Chen identified the manufacturer of the machine.</br>
</br>
"East Asia Heavy Industries...?"</br>
</br>
Not just East Asia Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
West Asia Energy, North Asia Airlines, South Asia Light Industries... Jiang Chen circled the industrial machine tools and just from the names of the equipment, he already drew out the economic and industrial layout of Pan-Asia Cooperation.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen had examined almost every one of the machines, he returned to the elevator door and stood in front it. Then he looked at the rows of machines and clenched his fists, full of excitement.</br>
</br>
"Time to start working!"</br>
</br>
He walked to the nearest industrial machine tool, pressed his hand on it, and threw it into the storage dimension in the blink of an eye.</br>
</br>
The expansion of the storage space had been in a state of slow growth. Although he did not measure the specific size of it, it grew a lot compared to when it had just formed. It could easily fit a few machine tools in their packaged state.</br>
</br>
Throwing the packaged machines into the storage dimension, Jiang Chen immediately travelled back to the modern world and placed the machine tools back onto the material transfer station – Coconut Island.</br>
</br>
After he had traversed back and forth for more than half an hour, over one hundred industrial machines and various high-precision industrial machine tools were transported to the modern world with only an empty hall left behind.</br>
</br>
In contrast, the warehouse on Coconut Island was stuffed full.</br>
</br>
It would be no exaggeration to say that just such one machine from the stuffed warehouse would cause an avalanche in the modern world.</br>
</br>
As for why, Jiang Chen did not fully understand. He only learned because Jiang Lin and the technical experts in NAC always talked to him about "industrial machines" and "CNC machine tools", so he gained a vague concept –</br>
</br>
The industrial machine seems to be worth a lot of money?</br>
</br>
If the pioneers of the scientific community and the leaders in the industrial industry around the world heard his thoughts, they would slap him to death. It was demeaning to judge something that could transform the industrial development of a country!</br>
</br>
The premise was that they had the ability...</br>
</br>
Regardless, these machines now belonged to Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen also knew that these machine tools would definitely be more valuable in his hands than in the hands of clones. As for the glory of Pan-Asia Cooperation and the Renaissance plan, let me achieve them for you!</br>
</br>
He then went back to the elevator, and the elevator continued to go down.</br>
</br>
The third floor was filled with resources.</br>
</br>
There were special cement, rebar-like building materials, and other industrial materials such as steel, aluminum, and titanium ingots. If anyone else on the wasteland gained access to these material, that person would be elated, and even more ecstatic than receiving the industrial machine and high-precision machine tools!</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen's reaction was very dull, and could even be described as disinterested. After all, he did not lack these resources.</br>
</br>
On the fourth floor, the second-last floor, Jiang Chen gasped when he saw the rows of black lacquered power armors</br>
</br>
The treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation surely did not disappoint him.</br>
</br>
The fourth floor held countless brand new power armors, a type that he had never seen before</br>
</br>
He left the elevator and walked to the closest one.</br>
</br>
On the side of the armored head, Jiang Chen found a small line of text.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Dadada!</br>
</br>
When the bullets just scraped above Ding Liwei's scalp, he was sweating profusely in nervousness.</br>
</br>
Is this the true strength of the CCCP Army?</br>
</br>
When he looked at the power armors not in the same weight class as the P-series, and the 12 KV-9 tanks unleashing barrage with its main gun and coaxial machinegun, he showed the unwillingness to accept his defeat.</br>
</br>
His failure was not because of tactics, nor because of courage, but simply on the equipment.</br>
</br>
Next to him, a power armor smashed into the concrete wall, straight into the building behind him. They already fired half of their anti-tank rockets, but the result was far from what they expected.</br>
</br>
The armor of the KV-9 was indeed renowned for its ability to resist the electromagnetic pulse cannon!</br>
</br>
The anti-tank rockets of the Second Militia fired one after another, but only two tanks were scrapped. Other than one tank having two holes on its front armor, the remaining ten tanks continued their demolition as if nothing happened.</br>
</br>
However, the tanks didn't give Ding Liwei the most headache, the SU-5 power armors did!</br>
</br>
The power armors of the Russians were even more difficult to deal with compared to their tanks. He didn't even know if his bullets did anything to its armor. Fortunately, the number advantage they had translated to teh destruction of ten SU-5s.</br>
</br>
But the price they paid was three times that number...</br>
</br>
A 75mm explosive shell exploded behind him and the cement pieces slammed into the rear armor. Ding Liwei immediately ducked his head and pressed himself tightly against the thick bunker, cursing.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k... these Siberian bears! Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Looking at the red crosses that appeared on the command interface one after another, only a menacing light remained in his eyes</br>
</br>
First, he was defeated in the hands of Jiang Chen, and now he encountered the CCCP tanks. His Second Militia was caught in the middle of the two forces. He took a punch on his left cheek, then immediately another punch on his right.</br>
</br>
He clenched his jaw.</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei stared at the tank that was firing its coaxial machine gun and his anger almost crushed the handle of his rifle.</br>
</br>
Is this the death of the Second Militia?</br>
</br>
His chest was filled with hatred.</br>
</br>
He was not willing to accept this outcome!</br>
</br>
The treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation was right in front of him, he almost held it in his hands.</br>
</br>
"DAM*IT!" He cursed several times in a row. His fist slammed on the ground and sent cement debris in the air</br>
</br>
At least...</br>
</br>
At least leave these barbarians here!</br>
</br>
With decisiveness in his eyes, he switched the communication channel and yelled at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
"Wan Peng, what are you waiting for! Are you not going to use that thing and instead wait to bring it to your grave?"</br>
</br>
It was quiet; the communication channel was silent with no response.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Wan Peng?"</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei's expression suddenly changed.</br>
</br>
There was no response from the other end of the communication screen.</br>
</br>
A terrible thought drifted into his mind...</br>
</br>
This guy dipped!</br>
</br>
"Wan Peng you son of…! I will fu*king—"</br>
</br>
Ding Liwei was just about to curse out, but his pupils dilated in fear. He did not completely finish his curse before it was interrupted by a loud explosion. He, along with the bunker, was engulfed by the bursting fire...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The battle that lasted more than an hour finally came to an end.</br>
</br>
The anti-tank rockets were almost exhausted, and the Second Militia had completely lost its means of combating against CCCP tanks.</br>
</br>
With the support of power armors, the KV-9s began to move forward with the support of their coaxial machinegun and main gun, the Second Militia could no longer launch an effective counterattack.</br>
</br>
In the end, with the death of Ding Liwei, this line of defense consisted of P-series power armors finally began to collapse. Now, the Shangjing Survivors Alliance lost its final piece and made its exit in the history of time.</br>
</br>
The battle of Line 0 was decided, but the battle at Line 27 was still in a stalemate.</br>
</br>
In order to compete for the control of the special channel subway station, both sides used one hundred and twenty percent of their energy to barrage the enemy's frontline.</br>
</br>
"ATTACK! ATACK! ATTACK!"</br>
</br>
Inside the KV-9 tank, Sedov stared coldly at the holographic screen, and his hawk-like pupils locked onto NAC's line of defense. He roared a bloodthirsty command at the cloned soldiers who were launching the Kamikaze attack.</br>
</br>
With the command of each attack, a group of clones fell.</br>
</br>
These clones felt no pain, had no feelings, and feared no death. From the moment they were produced, they existed for the sole purpose of sacrificing their life for the Soviets.</br>
</br>
They didn't even need to go through professional military training. All they needed to do was to charge toward the defense line. Charge, charge, and then charge! Many people have not even been given a rifle. Their rifles and magazines were all from dead friendly soldiers, or the hands of enemies, or just the dagger around their waist.</br>
</br>
Picking up the rifle from their comrade, they charged the enemy defense like rabid dogs. Most of the cloned soldiers did not even have time to empty a magazine before they were shredded to pieces by the incoming bullets. But before collapsing on the ground, they often would bring trouble to the NAC side.</br>
</br>
The battle continued to be in a state of stalemate. The air was filled with the smell of blood.</br>
</br>
Just then, Sedov noticed that a team of soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons joined the battle from the rear of NAC's defense.</br>
</br>
They didn't have guns. Instead, they carried a basket full of grenade-like items on their back. Immediately, Sedov in the tank saw that these people began to take out the grenades, and with the help of the kinetic skeleton, they tossed the grenandes to the tanks beside the concrete wall.</br>
</br>
Sedov sneered at the scene.</br>
</br>
He knew exactly what they wanted to do.</br>
</br>
They wished to use the anti-human thermal design of the KV-9 to turn the tank into an oven.</br>
</br>
Obviously, an officer from Pan-Asia Cooperation must be in command, and the officer must be an experienced one.</br>
</br>
He also must admit to the effectiveness of this tactic. Compared to anti-tank rockets, it could not only threaten the KV-9 occupants and engines, but also effectively suppresses the clone tactics. It was especially effective in such narrow terrains</br>
</br>
However-</br>
</br>
"Firefighting Company, prepare. Bring out the fire extinguisher." Looking at the tank beside the wall that began to burn, Sedov ordered while staring at the burning flame. Then he sneered, "SPRAY."</br>
</br>
"Roger that!"</br>
</br>
A team of twenty engineers with iron drums behind their back stepped forward and pointed the nozzles at the burning tank. The misty powder quickly extinguished the flame on the tank.</br>
</br>
Mockery appeared in Sedov's eyes.</br>
</br>
How would he not know the weakness of the KV-9 tank? Not to mention fire extinguishers, the Uelen Border Guards even designed their own anti-fire armor, specifically to deal with situations where engineer soldiers would be unable to put out the fire.</br>
</br>
Flames can take out the steel torrent of the Soviet? Isn't that too arrogant?</br>
</br>
Just as Sedov ridiculed the mentally handicapped Pan-Asia Cooperation officers in his mind, the tunnel behind him began to tremor.</br>
</br>
This violent tremor lasted for a minute and then everything returned to normal.</br>
</br>
Sedov opened the tank and stood up. He stared at the darkness in the tunnel and frowned.</br>
</br>
"What happened..."</br>
</br>
For some reason, he had an odd feeling about the violent tremor.</br>
</br>
To confirm his hunch, he heard an anxious report.</br>
</br>
"Report! Traces of nuclear explosions have been detected at Fuxing Station on Line 27. There are large-scale collapses in the nearby subway section. The zombies that are active on the surface are flooding in... DAM*IT! It's the Night Demon! AHHH—"</br>
</br>
There was a short busy tone before he heard machine guns in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Stabilize the formation and return fire!"</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
Hearing the news of a fire in his backyard, Sedov's expression changed drastically. In paleness, his fists clenched tightly.</br>
</br>
"How can it be?!"</br>
</br>
Nuclear explosion!?</br>
</br>
Was it the explosion just now?!</br>
</br>
He suddenly realized that if zombies flooded in from Line 27, then he, currently in a stalemate with NAC, would...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1209: Power Armors with Built-in Hacks</br>
</div></br>
</br>
[1,731 meters ahead, vertical height of 327 meters, wind speed of 2 knots, the target space vector is calibrated, and it is synchronizing...]</br>
</br>
[Synchronization completed.]</br>
</br>
[FIRE!]</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
The moment the button was pressed, the six-meter-long electromagnetic pulse cannon slightly reclined, and the five-kilogram shell launched in the blinding light drew a fleeting trajectory in the sky. The shell instantly closed the two kilometers distance and hit the chassis of the KV-9.</br>
</br>
The KV-9 suddenly looked like a car with a flat tire. The tracks fell apart and began drifting on the road before it smashed into the shop on the street. The two power armors at the back quickly abandoned the vehicle while they searched for cover.</br>
</br>
On the roof of the building, Jiang Chen looked at the Russians in chaos with eyes full of excitement. He couldn't help but admire.</br>
</br>
"It's perfect!"</br>
</br>
After discovering the X-1 power armor underground, Jiang Chen immediately called down his three guards and replaced their T-3s. This version of power armor was not difficult to operate. Other than some added functions, the interface still used the classic T-series design.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of this, Jiang Chen and his guards quickly familiarized themselves with this powerful new equipment.</br>
</br>
At this moment, gunshots and explosions basically stopped. The battle that lasted more than an hour finally came to an end, and it was obvious the Second Militia Group lost. The Russians should be heading to the city center now.</br>
</br>
After leaving Yao Yao on the basement level, Jiang Chen, Lu Fan, and the other guards left the Eden Technology building.</br>
</br>
Without a password, the Russians would take a long time to go down the elevator. Yao Yao was quite safe down there.</br>
</br>
What's more, Jiang Chen would not let the Russians come close.</br>
</br>
After formulating a simple combat plan, Jiang Chen, Lu Fan and the others dispersed. He came to this building alone, set up the brand new electromagnetic pulse cannon, and began his hunt for the desperados.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After an unexpected shot hit it, the tank at high-speed crashed into the roadside building without any warning. The CCCP tank formation advancing toward the city center suddenly halted its advance.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
Yegor cursed and personally began to operate the machine gun. He fired in the direction of the electromagnetic pulse cannon two kilometers away. At the same time, he yelled, "It's an electromagnetic pulse cannon! Don't stop, look for cover!"</br>
</br>
Across the distance of two kilometers, one shot was used to break the track of the tank. What kind of luck was this!</br>
</br>
Although KV-9's armor was cumbersome, its mobility was not low!</br>
</br>
Yegor instinctively thought that the shot was a matter of luck. Even the main gun of a tank would not be hit able to hit a high-speed object at such a distance in urban terrain!</br>
</br>
</br>
However, soon, NAC used their actions to prove that the shot was not just luck.</br>
</br>
Right after the previous shot, three shells flew from three different directions!</br>
</br>
A shell landed on the concrete wall and easily penetrated the building. The shell directly hit the chest of the power armor hidden inside and sent the power armor flying like a kit. It never got up again.</br>
</br>
The other two shots destroyed the tracks of two tanks, and the two tanks were not so lucky as they both directly stalled in the middle of the road.</br>
</br>
Yegor's eyes widened in disbelief.</br>
</br>
If the previous shot landed as a coincidence, then these two shots that hit their target directly made him no longer believe the shots were coincidences.</br>
</br>
Without time to hesitate, he immediately ordered his force.</br>
</br>
The remaining seven tanks scattered to the side and bulldozed into the buildings. The power armors jumped off from the tanks and followed behind. With the cover of the building, they pursued in the direction of the shots.</br>
</br>
As for the two tanks that were stalled in the middle of the road, they could stay there for a bit.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the armor of the KV-9 was thick enough and the five-kilogram shell could only break the tank's continous track. NAC would not do be able to do anything right now.</br>
</br>
"What model is that? Isn't the NAC's standard power armor the T-3?" When Yegor viewed the playback in the video, his eyes were fixated on the power armor with the electromagnetic pulse cannon on the top of the building; he was unable to identify the model.</br>
</br>
Is it a special paint? Or is it a modified version of the T-3?</br>
</br>
Or…</br>
</br>
Yegor had a sudden realization.</br>
</br>
Could it be… that just when they were fighting the Second Militia, these people had already entered the treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation and snatched the fruits of victory that should have belonged to them?!</br>
</br>
"DAM*IT!"</br>
</br>
He punched the steel next to him and spat out.</br>
</br>
"These shameless thieves!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon, six meters in length, looked like a lance in Jiang Chen's hands.</br>
</br>
The electromagnetic pulse cannon modified from the Type-50 vehicle-mounted electromagnetic cannon enhanced the kinetic energy of each shot and also added stricter requirements on accuracy and shooting stability. It was perfectly designed for the X-1 Test Type!</br>
</br>
The electromagnetic pulse cannon connected by thick cable lines to the power armor calculated any data that could change the projectile's trajectory. All data were listed in the center of the hologram screen. The power armor built-in processor performed a summary analysis to determine the best shot.</br>
</br>
With the Type-57 in his hands, Jiang Chen looked at the predicted ballistic line that was updated in real time on the screen and exclaimed.</br>
</br>
This is like the aimbot in shooting games. Although the cannon is in my hands, I don't need to do anything.</br>
</br>
While still amazed by the technology, the cannon locked onto a power armor, and Jiang Chen fired another shot. The cannon raised slightly and the power armor that was setting up the artillery for counterattack was directly hit. It flew away as if it was hit by a train</br>
</br>
The speed of the shell was too fast. Ordinary shells still had to fly in the air, but weapons like electromagnetic pulse cannons could close the distance of several kilometers in the blink of an eye. The moment the white light flashed, the shell would arrive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was sneering as he saw the remaining six tanks that drove into the building, as well as the power armors moving in his direction behind the buildings.</br>
</br>
"X71291, your turn."</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
Almost at the same moment it answered, everything in the power armor's field of view faded away the unnecessary colors. Lines straight or curved sketched out the entire battlefield into a three-dimensional map.</br>
</br>
The architectural specifications of all the buildings and the surveillance images of all the buildings were summarized by the large quantum computers on the last floor of the Eden Technology Building and all the units in the building were marked by their spatial position with an accuracy of less than 1mm!</br>
</br>
The geometric world composed of lines were transparent. Even data like if the wall could be penetrated by shots or how much kinetic energy was left were reflected on his dashboard.</br>
</br>
This is no longer just an aimbot.</br>
</br>
But also a wallhack!</br>
</br>
In Yegor's terrified eyes, another shell penetrated through the concrete and landed on the chest of another power armor.</br>
</br>
In less than two minutes, three tanks and power armors already stalled. For the CCCP tank formation that just came out of an intensive battle, the losses were severe.</br>
</br>
Yegor's fist slammed on the armor of the tank and stared in the direction where the shell came from. His eyes were filled with raging anger, bloodthirst, and a hint of excitement?</br>
</br>
Yes, excitement...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1210: Victor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
From the moor of Uelen to the northern soil of Pan-Asia Cooperation, he had to fight for his survival from a Soviet soldier into a demon that ravaged through his path. To survive with his subordinates, he ordered the plundering of the survivors' supplies, enslaved them, squeezed the last trace of value within them, and then pushed them through the organic boiler into nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
Like the nomads on the prairies, they chewed through the remaining bones of the civilization in the nuclear winter. Survival made him forget the glory of the soldier. The weakness of survivors made them forget the differences between humans and animals.</br>
</br>
His only regret was that in his service for the Soviet to protect its frontiers against the Alaska NATO military across the ocean, he never set his foot on the actual battlefield. Until the very end of the battle, he was forgotten along with the ideology he swore to protect.</br>
</br>
He clearly remembered that day.</br>
</br>
The NATO army in Alaska withdrew. He waited anxiously for the order, and the wait was ten years.</br>
</br>
At this moment, however, the shell that penetrated through the concrete wall made him feel like he had returned to the fervent era.</br>
</br>
After so many years, it was the first time he felt the threat of survival that was not not from the nature, but an actual enemy.</br>
</br>
The blood in his chest was boiling, and he actually felt a hint of excitement.</br>
</br>
The war genes flowing in his blood seemed to be reenergized.</br>
</br>
However, his passion did not stop the enemy. Another shell shattered the wall and hit the shoulder of a SU-5 power armor.</br>
</br>
His subordinates fell down one after another while he still hadn't even managed to touch his enemy. The red crosses flashing on the command interface was like a bucket of cold water poured over his head.</br>
</br>
It was a force he had never witnessed.</br>
</br>
It was the first time that the pair of wolf-like pupils finally showed a trace of fear...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The crosshair was firmly locked in on the building one kilometer away. The Type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon in Jiang Chen's hands continuously fired out glaring white rays.</br>
</br>
The five-kilogram shell penetrated the concrete from all sorts of obscure angles with incredible precision to hit the power armors behind the wall. From the first shot till now, already ten power armors had fallen down. Five of which were due to Jiang Chen's cannon while the other five were the masterpieces of Lu Fan and the other guards.</br>
</br>
In less than five minutes, the CCCP tank formation with heavy casualties finally stopped its advancement.</br>
</br>
The only remaining two SU-5s were suppressed in the center of the building and hid in the blind spots of the four electromagnetic pulse cannons. Out of the six tanks, two had broken tracks, and one had a broken sight mirror. At this moment, they were also inside the blind spots, fearful.</br>
</br>
"DAM*IT, how are they so accurate?" Sminov got out of the tank, shaken, and looked at Yegor who also got out. In disbelief, he said, "Can these people see through the walls? Or do their electromagnetic pulse cannons have a guided function..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"There is no shell that can be guided, Comrade Sminov." Yegor looked at the broken concrete wall not far him with a sullen expression, and the power armor that had fallen down on the ground.</br>
</br>
The front section of the power armor was concaved in, and even the tiles on the wall behind it were smashed. The soldier inside clearly did not survive.</br>
</br>
Even through the concrete wall, the five-kilogram shell still possessed an astounding amount of kinetic energy. The power armor was as fragile as an ant against its power.</br>
</br>
"Is it infrared imaging? Life detection? But that's impossible... Our SU-5 and KV-9 have almost no problem in anti-detection capabilities, how are they positioning us?" Sminov frowned.</br>
</br>
"It's the city that sold us." Yegor looked up at the ceiling as gloom was written all over his face.</br>
</br>
"The city?" Sminov took a moment to process the information, then he followed Yegor's gaze. He saw there was a fist-sized wide-angle camera on the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Yegor pulled the pistol from his waist and fired two shots against the ceiling. The camera was destroyed.</br>
</br>
"Now we have disappeared from their radar."</br>
</br>
"You mean..." Sminov had a sudden realization as astonishment filled his eyes. "The entire city's surveillance system is under their control."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Yegor nodded as he said in hatred, "If I didn't guess wrong, they have already taken the treasure of the Pan-Asia Cooperation, and also took control of the monitoring system of the city..."</br>
</br>
With the data from the monitoring system, their spatial coordinates were positioned on AR imaging. They were completed naked inside the city to Jiang Chen on the high building with no privacy at all.</br>
</br>
Unless they used EMP to destroy the monitoring system of the entire city.</br>
</br>
However, this suggestion was obviously unrealistic.</br>
</br>
They didn't know how many cameras were in front of them. Inside the city of Pan-Asia Cooperation, the number of cameras exceeded the number of streetlights. As long as they were inside the city, they could not advance forward.</br>
</br>
Looking at Sminov, Yegor asked.</br>
</br>
"How many smoke bombd do we have left?"</br>
</br>
Sminov gulped and said, "Five."</br>
</br>
"Five?" Yegor's fists clenched together and his expression was dignified.</br>
</br>
Five kilometers away, five smoke bombs, these were enough for them to break through the blockade formed by electromagnetic pulse cannons. If the almost ridiculous accuracy continued to happen, they would at the most advance 500 meters before being stalled.</br>
</br>
The broken track could be repaired, but no one dared to get out of the tank.</br>
</br>
"What should we do?" Smirnov forced out this sentence.</br>
</br>
"We have to wait," Yegor closed his eyes. "They don't dare to come close to us, and we can't go out. As long as our reinforcements arrive first, victory will belong to us."</br>
</br>
Time ticked.</br>
</br>
Quietly waiting in the empty building, a drop of sweat oozed out from Yegor's forehead and slid down through the wrinkles on his face.</br>
</br>
Without any news from the reinforcements, he already began to feel ominous.</br>
</br>
Although he believed in Sedov's ability and there was absolutely no possibility of losing to the NAC infantry in the tunnel, too much time has passed...</br>
</br>
Did the NAC win?</br>
</br>
Impossible, absolutely impossible...</br>
</br>
His fists clenched together tightly. Yegor's eyes locked onto the computer around his wrist and staring at the offline icon in the communication screen. Anxiety was growing with every minute that passed by...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the sky, blue light sparkled.</br>
</br>
Looking at the power armors landing from air, Jiang Chen's dark scaly mask retracted backwards. He equipped the Type-57 electromagnetic pulse cannon on his back, deactivated the anchor, and ordered in the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"Come back."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Lu Fan and the other guards also saw the reinforcements from the sky. From their voices, they also felt relieved excitement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a flare from the storage dimension and tossed it on the ground.</br>
</br>
The orange-red sparkle in the fog-covered city was so conspicuous, like a beacon in the fog, guiding the reinforcements toward him.</br>
</br>
When he saw the T-3 power armors gathering towards him, the huge burden in his mind finally disappeared.</br>
</br>
Until half a minute ago, he was still thinking about what would happen if the Russians arrived first.</br>
</br>
However, it seemed that Han Junhua did not disappoint him.</br>
</br>
The victor in the tunnel has already been decided.</br>
</br>
Is there still suspense in this battle?</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1211: The End Of The Chaos</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Wan Peng stumbled into Line 0.</br>
</br>
When he held the gear-like door, Wan Peng was on his knees and gasped for air. He was glad to be alive.</br>
</br>
Just a moment ago, power armors in an organized formation whizzed by him. There was a pungent bloody smell lingering around the power armors. From their deadly aura, they had clearly just experienced a bloodbath.</br>
</br>
He did not dare to make a noise as he hid in the shadows. He waited for the earth-trembling noise to disappear before he slipped out from the cracks of the wall.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, those power armors passed by quickly, or he could not have escaped.</br>
</br>
"FU*K! It didn't feel like anything when I came down, but it's tiring."</br>
</br>
He cussed out and wiped the sweat from his neck as he began to move toward Line 2.</br>
</br>
He lost.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the treasure in Line 0 or everything on Pingan Street. They already lost all the chips in this game.</br>
</br>
In fact, as soon as the Russians appeared, Wan Peng already recognized this.</br>
</br>
When the Shangjing Survivors Alliance was sandwiched by the two forces, regardless who the victor of this battle royale was, it would not be Shangjing Survivors Alliance on the verge of complete collapse.</br>
</br>
However, Ding Liwei apparently did not see this. Until the last moment, he still counted on Wan Peng to play the last trump card to help him turn the defeat into victory, but he did not know that from the moment he jumped off the building and commanded the battle, Manager Wan had already escaped.</br>
</br>
When Wan Peng thought of Ding Liwei, he felt sorry for him.</br>
</br>
If Ding Liwei was not so obsessed, this would not be the end of him. With more than 70 power armors, even if he lost control of Pingan Street, where else could the Second Militia not go other than Wanghai in the south?</br>
</br>
Wan Peng shook his head before he walked along the tunnel and headed in the opposite direction of Line 27.</br>
</br>
Pingan Street was no longer safe.</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, NAC already took over the city's defense. If he returned the same way, there would only be one ending waiting for him. Even if the NAC did not do anything, the people desperate to show their loyalty to the NAC and the survivors trapped in Pingan Street would shred him to pieces.</br>
</br>
He still left some equipment and people at his old site, the Sunday's Club; some more Men in Black under his order that he had kept below the surface. He couldn't stay in Shangjing anymore. He could only head southeast and avoid NAC's territory.</br>
</br>
The area was under sphere of influence of the Southern Surviviors. While those survivors feared the NAC, they were not under the NAC's control. The relatively developed state meant that he could potentially rise again under a different name.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, a glimmer of silver light flashed.</br>
</br>
Without time to react, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He snorted in pain and collapsed on the ground as he held onto his chest.</br>
</br>
</br>
He took a needle out.</br>
</br>
However, before he could stab the needle into his own chest, another glimmer of silver light appeared and blood sprinkled from his wrist.</br>
</br>
"AHHHHH!"</br>
</br>
The screams of heartbreak resounded through the tunnel, and Wan Peng looked at his broken hand in distorted pain.</br>
</br>
"I won't lose twice against the same trick." Old Luo leaned against the wall beside the tunnel. He grinned and the silver in his hands seemed to be flashing, "Now, let me see how you can use your laughable trump card?"</br>
</br>
Wan Peng on the ground desperately tried to move back as he looked at Old Luo in horror.</br>
</br>
"Why... you are not willing to let me go even if you're about to die? I didn't get the treasures, go for them..."</br>
</br>
"But everything started with you," Old Luo said calmly.</br>
</br>
"Just because of that?" Wan Peng said, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"Do I need any other reasons?" Old Luo looked at Wan Peng in an emotionless state as he let out a sigh. "Join me and be buried together with the secret of Pan-Asia Cooperation."</br>
</br>
"Hehehe, dumb*ss, I didn't expect that in my fabled life, I would die in the hands of a madman, hehehehe, HAHAHA..."</br>
</br>
Wan Peng laughed on the ground. In the near mad laughter, his life gradually came to an end.</br>
</br>
The silver dagger fell from his cuff and slammed on the floor. Old Luo leaned against the wall and sat down slowly. He finally exhausted his last bit of strength. Without saying a word more, he slowly closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The tanks were burning.</br>
</br>
Under the siege of NAC power armors, the battle was already decided. The last shell on the ammunition rack was exhausted, and Yegor, trapped in the lobby of the media building, finally used all he could.</br>
</br>
He climbed out of the tank and held tightly onto his pistol.</br>
</br>
Not far from him was the body of Sminov, half of which was burned into ashes.</br>
</br>
Yegor didn't look at him. He used the wall for support and walked forward. He looked at the wreckages burning on the ground and suddenly he began to laugh.</br>
</br>
"...I have guarded the snow of the Soviets for twenty years, yet this is first time I have experienced a thrilling battle. It is not a bad way to go in the capital of the Pan-Asia Cooperation."</br>
</br>
Looking at the power armors that surrounded him, he roared with his last bit of strength.</br>
</br>
"FOR MOT—"</br>
</br>
The bullet of the pistol made a spark on the power armor.</br>
</br>
The third time he pulled the trigger, a wave of bullets swept by and tore him into pieces.</br>
</br>
Finally, this tyrant who swept across half of Siberia finally walked to the end of his life on the land of Pan-Asia Cooperation. In a pool of blood, his eyes widened as the life of murder and sin finally came to an end.</br>
</br>
In the distance, the building was burning.</br>
</br>
"I apologize for my incompetence and late arrival, General." Zhang Zhuo stood behind Jiang Chen with his head lowered, full of humiliation.</br>
</br>
"Please raise your head," Jiang Chen turned and looked at Zhang Zhuo full of self-loathing. "You have tried your best to break through the Russian defense line in the shortest time. How can I blame my loyal subordinate? Please, raise your head."</br>
</br>
Zhang Zhuo raised his head, touched.</br>
</br>
At this time, Lu Fan came forward and saluted.</br>
</br>
"The battle is over and Yegor is confirmed dead."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about Ding Liwei and Wan Peng? I care more about the whereabouts of these two guys."</br>
</br>
"Ding Liwei is confirmed dead under the bombardment of CCCP tanks. Wan Peng's whereabout is unknown. It is suspected that he has escaped," Lu Fan replied.</br>
</br>
"Escaped?" Jiang Chen grinned. "Forget it, he can't run too far."</br>
</br>
After a moment of pause, Jiang Chen looked at Zhang Zhuo and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Bring some people to Eden Technology Building. The treasure of Pan-Asia Cooperation is below. Bring all the hibernation chambers on the first level, the resources on the third level, and the power armors on the fourth level. Don't worry about the fifth level. Also, sent two people outside of Line Zero and notify Han Junhua to send more people down."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Zhang Zhuo took the order.</br>
</br>
Standing on the building, Jiang Chen quietly looked down at the city.</br>
</br>
"Lu Fan."</br>
</br>
"Roger," Lu Fan quickly responded.</br>
</br>
"Go prepare. It's time to go back."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
It should be day break outside. With so many things that happened, the chaos in Shangjing finally came to an end.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly felt so exhausted. He just wished he could find a place to sleep.</br>
</br>
Sleep until the next morning.</br>
</br>
"Remember your promise," X71291 whispered in his ear.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I know better than you the weight of a promise." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1212: The Light Before Dawn</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The light before dawn peeked out from the horizon.</br>
</br>
The zombies' actions began to slow down as if the sunlight cursed them under a seal. Their bloodthirsty vibe began to fade and was replaced by a soulless sluggishness.</br>
</br>
The soldiers on the wall were on the verge of tears the moment the sun broke the horizon.</br>
</br>
With the bayonet on their rifles, the soldiers with their last remaining energy penetrated the throat of the zombies on the wall, used the stock of the rifle to crush the zombies' head, and kicked them down the wall.</br>
</br>
Although the zombies were still moving slowly toward the wall, they no longer had any momentum. The zombies at the back already stopped moving while only the zombies at the front tumbled forward driven by their instincts.</br>
</br>
Finally, at the moment when the sun rose entirely above the horizon, the last zombie on the wall had its throat pierced and collapsed down.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, behind the frontline soldiers, the third line of defense was finally completed. The wall was 15 meters higher than the second wall. Although not as magnificent as the giant wall, it was enough to keep Pingan Street safe for the night.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua immediately ordered when she saw the sun rising.</br>
</br>
"Soldiers withdraw from the front line, get logistics to prepare meals. Fighters will continue to airstrike the zombies near the wall..."</br>
</br>
A communications soldier ran in from outside the military camp as she was giving out orders.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua asked as she looked to the direction of the door.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
"It's news from Line 0, it is the General's order."</br>
</br>
The communication soldier saluted and conveyed Jiang Chen's order.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded and motioned that he could leave.</br>
</br>
With her arms wrapped around her chest, she thought for a moment before pressing her headset.</br>
</br>
"Send 500 engineer soldiers to Line 0 along with all the engineering robots."</br>
</br>
"... Roger!"</br>
</br>
After Han Junhua issued the last order, she let out a sigh of relief. She reached out and closed the holographic screen, and sat back down on the chair.</br>
</br>
She barely rested for a moment during the night as she simultaneously commanded the battle on the surface and underground.</br>
</br>
Now, she was at her limit.</br>
</br>
With her arms on the table, her cold expression gradually softened. She only revealed the unsuspected expression in her sleep.</br>
</br>
Her hair slipped off onto her thin but stiff shoulders. She gently moved her nose and put her face in her arms.</br>
</br>
The thin lips muttered, and then drowsiness soon overwhelmed her.</br>
</br>
"As long as you're okay..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Dragging their weary body down from the wall, they passed by the third line of defense and returned inside Pingan Street. Everyone looked exhausted. They were covered in dust and blood and looked like they were in a terrible state from afar.</br>
</br>
</br>
Regardless, they had won. Although it was a difficult victory.</br>
</br>
Many people's shoulders were severely swollen. Even with the protection of the kinetic skeleton, a night of battle pushed their physical and mental strength to the absolute limit. Especially in the battle with zombies, unless the commander ordered to dump fuel, they didn't have a moment to breathe.</br>
</br>
Pulling the bayonet out from the still burning muzzle, the exhausted soldiers passed through the wall and just sat straight down on the ground. They did not have any energy to walk a step further.</br>
</br>
The logistics company set up a shed on the edge of the wall with giant pots cooking congee.</br>
</br>
The aroma of food diluted the bloody smell still lingering in the air. It made the soldiers, mercenaries, and survivors on the brink of collapsing regain their strength. With the support of their rifle, they limped toward the shed.</br>
</br>
Breakfast was a thick, congee boiled with minced meat. Every spoon contained chunks of meat and was appetizing to eat. In addition, there were all you can eat buns and a small bag of pickles for every soldier, mercenary, and survivor who participated in the battle.</br>
</br>
Based on the standard of the wasteland, this breakfast was extravagant.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that many local mercenaries and survivors shed their tears while devouring their food.</br>
</br>
They were tears of excitement.</br>
</br>
They always only ate two meals a day. Breakfast was a novelty to them.</br>
</br>
The NAC soldiers were less emotional. They chewed down the buns and gulped down the congee. They would occasionally look up to look at the mercenaries and survivors taking small bites. To them, they looked like nomads that never experienced anything.</br>
</br>
On the giant wall, Song Chenyu muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"Unbelievable, we actually did it."</br>
</br>
His clenched fists slowly relaxed as he looked at the zombies under the wall and the NAC officer standing next to him. Then he muttered.</br>
</br>
"Yeah, we did it."</br>
</br>
A familiar voice came from behind him.</br>
</br>
"Sir, your breakfast."</br>
</br>
A logistics soldier ran up the wall, put a plastic bag with canned food, buns, and congee on the table next to the NAC officer. He pumped his chest with his right hand and jogged away.</br>
</br>
"Good lord, canned beef," tearing open the canned aluminum lid and sniffing with his nose, the serious expression of the officer finally disappeared, he smiled at Song Chenyu, "Would you like some?"</br>
</br>
"Is that okay?" Song Chenyu swallowed some of his saliva as he sniffed in the aroma.</br>
</br>
"Of course," The officer waved his hand and poked the bun into the can. He chewed on it while he pointed with his chin to the Pan-Asia Building. "Look at the flag there, we're already brothers in the trenches."</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu followed the direction of his gaze and saw that the NAC flag had already risen above the Pan-Asia Building.</br>
</br>
The flag of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance disappeared as if it never existed in the first place.</br>
</br>
After two seconds of silence, Song Chenyu smiled and sat down on the opposite side of the officer. He reached out and took a bun from the plastic bag and opened another can of meat.</br>
</br>
"If you say so."</br>
</br>
He was already prepared for this moment since last night. Therefore, when the flag appeared there, he did not even feel the slightest surprise.</br>
</br>
In just two seconds, he got used to his change in identity.</br>
</br>
"We are also comrades who have fought side by side. I'm here to talk to you and you can take in what you need. Don't ask anything and don't say anything" The officer chewed on the bun while glancing at him.</br>
</br>
"Please," Song Chenyu said.</br>
</br>
"Our general rarely parachutes officials from NAC to serve at the local levels, and few people are willing to go to deserted places." After the officer took gulp of the congee, he grinned. "Generally speaking, positions such as city defense chief is usually appointed to locals. We just control the military and everything else has autonomy. Hongcheng, Wu City, and Yizhou are all like this. It was like this in Hang City, but now NAC made it into a district."</br>
</br>
"You mean?" Song Chenyu's eyes flickered.</br>
</br>
"You looked after the South Gate right?" The officer grinned. "Do a good job and you can be the city defense chief."</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu was overjoyed and immediately thanked him.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Although the function was the same, he would be in charge of three more gates, and his status would obviously be different.</br>
</br>
"Haha, we're just chatting," The officer waved his hand and smiled, "Now it's up to you. I didn't say anything."</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu couldn't even bother to eat and immediately stood up.</br>
</br>
Originally, he thought he would be demoted from his current position in a few days. He did not expect that he would be promoted. After the officer's words, he already knew what he should do.</br>
</br>
"Because of the intensity of the battle, I haven't had time to ask for your name?"</br>
</br>
"Zhu Dawei," Zhu Dawei laughed. "Just call me Dawei."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Starving survivors gathered together next to the shed at the city gate and eyed the food hungrily. However, only those that participated in defending the city could sit here and eat.</br>
</br>
In the envious sights of the group, a mercenary with his back straight, filled a bowl of congee, took the buns and pickles before sitting down beside a wooden table.</br>
</br>
Sitting beside him was a soldier in NAC uniform.</br>
</br>
The mercenary was someone that couldn't keep his mouth closed. He was chewing on his bun while looking enviously at the minced meat in the congee.</br>
</br>
"Your food is amazing. I can't believe you have congee and buns."</br>
</br>
"This is nothing," the NAC soldier glanced at the mercenary as he said nonchalantly, but he could not hide the pride on his face. "In Wanghai, we eat fresh food. Only you will think this is good."</br>
</br>
"Canned food is worthless in Wanghai City?" The mercenary's eyes widened as disbelief became written all over his face.</br>
</br>
"Of course not!" The NAC soldier took a bite and smiled. "But it doesn't have to do with value. Our General never treats his soldiers poorly. No matter how expensive the canned and raw meat are at the Sixth Street are, we always have meat to eat!"</br>
</br>
"Oh really?" The mercenary was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
The conversation seemed to have stopped as only the sound of chewing lingered.</br>
</br>
Then after a while, the mercenary began to speak in an attempt to flatter.</br>
</br>
"Bro..."</br>
</br>
"If you didn't have enough, you can go get more. You contributed a lot last night and our General won't treat you poorly." The NAC soldier pointed his finger at the shed next to the wall where the steamy white congee rice was brewing in a giant pot with minced meat floating on top.</br>
</br>
"Not for more, I just want to ask, are you still recruiting troops here?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The NAC banner rose above the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
No one was dissatisfied with the change, or no one cared at all. Regardless of the change of regime, Pingan Street remained the same. Even if the building collapsed, no one would feel any remorse.</br>
</br>
In particular, after the news that "the officials of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance escaped through the secret tunnel" and "Ding Liwei took away the Second Militia Group's power armor company and left other people to fend for themselves" spread out, none of the survivors felt anything positive about them.</br>
</br>
Instead, the NAC that saved them was more worthy to be the owner of the city.</br>
</br>
Of course, although most people were cooperative, there were always people looking for trouble.</br>
</br>
Other than those lunatics that did not value their own life, no one chose to challenge NAC's supremacy at this time. Those soldiers with murderous vibes obviously did not intend to reason. No one was foolish enough to sweat and bleed for the previous regime.</br>
</br>
As the NAC controlled the officials of Shangjing Survivors Alliance, Song Chenyu gathered his old subordinates and stormed Ding Liwei's residence. More than two hundred guns surrounded the entire mansion that covered 1,000 square meters.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was also a coincidence that when he arrived, Ding Liwei's wives were packing their bags and preparing to sneak out through the chaos, but they were one step too late and were stopped right by Song Chengyu</br>
</br>
Against the muzzles, the beautiful women were terrified. In particular, Ding Liwei's first wife even flirted with her husband's old subordinate and suggested that if he spared her, she would be willing to return the favor.</br>
</br>
Even the queen of the past society must lower her proud head now. While her proposal was certainly very attractive, Song Chenyu was not foolish enough to accept it. Once he became Chief, would he ever lack women? It was not worth the risk!</br>
</br>
He rejected the seductive temptation. Then he divided his subordinates into two groups. One group took Ding Liwei's family to the Pan-Asian building and the other group, led by him, went to Wan Peng's estate.</br>
</br>
Wan Peng's family was very smart. A few hours after the family head disappeared, they immediately began to pack their bags and escaped. They fled to the East Gate, and East Gate officials allowed them to pass based on their past relationship. However, Song Chenyu still managed to catch them down.</br>
</br>
With the sleeping little loli between his arms, Jiang Chen, just happened to bump into Song Chenyu eager to show-off his work as he came out of the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building.</br>
</br>
When he saw the group of beautiful women both anxious and fearful, Jiang Chen's eyebrows raised and he secretly cursed in his mind.</br>
</br>
This old pervert has a bigger harem than me! He totally deserved his ending!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently coughed and said.</br>
</br>
"Ding Liwei's family on the right, Wan Peng's family on the left."</br>
</br>
No one moved.</br>
</br>
Song Chenyu walked forward as he saw the scene and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Are you all deaf? MOVE!"</br>
</br>
The beautiful and lovely prisoners began to move hesitantly and formed into two lines. Jiang Chen counted them roughly and divided that into two teams. He made the conclusion and Manager Wan was better at enjoying life with ten more beautiful ladies in his harem.</br>
</br>
When most of the survivors were starving, the officials lived the life of emperors.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan walked next to Jiang Chen and whispered.</br>
</br>
"How are you going to deal with them?"</br>
</br>
After pondering for a moment, Jiang Chen waved his hand.</br>
</br>
"Forget it, it shouldn't impact them. Confiscate all assets and let them go."</br>
</br>
In fact, he certainly thought about doing something evil to "vent his anger", especially when those beautiful women would not refuse, and would serve him with all their abilities in order to escape from the fate of slavery. But he still had many things waiting for him, so he couldn't waste his time on women's bellies.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan took a moment to process the information but still nodded.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Several soldiers stepped forward and untied the shackles on the family members. Then they snatched away anything valuable to them. They did not leave any jewelry or crystals and only left them with clothes and an EP.</br>
</br>
Although they regained their freedom, they did not show any excitement. Instead, they were in despair.</br>
</br>
After they enjoyed the extravagance of the world, they were now kicked off from cloud nine. The material and spiritual gaps made them collapse mentally. Especially the gorgeous wives of Ding Liwei, they even started weeping together and completely forgot about their past feud...</br>
</br>
For them, being stripped of everything was worse than becoming Jiang Chen's slaves.</br>
</br>
At least, they did not need to worry about food...</br>
</br>
"Song Chenyu right? It seems that your brain turns pretty quickly." Jiang Chen smiled at Song Chenyu who stood there respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Not at all." Song Chenyu bowed his head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, pleased with his performance.</br>
</br>
"Go to the logistics team and get a uniform. What's up with what you're wearing."</br>
</br>
Song Chen was ecstatic and his heart was finally at peace. He immediately swore his allegiance, "I will prove my loyalty to the General..."</br>
</br>
"Okay, enough with the flattering words. Your flattering attempt will score a sixty at most." Jiang Chen waved his hand impatiently. "When you get your new uniform, the logistics personnel will tell you where to go. Go on now."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Song Chenyu quickly left; he was overjoyed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pondered for a moment as he watched Song Chenyu leave.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, Pingan Street still needs a new mayor..."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1214"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1214: Forming The North Division</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Pingan Street was the largest settlement in the northern part of the Pan-Asia Cooperation region. Although the degree of infrastructure and industrialization lagged behind the Sixth Street, the population made the place have promising development potential.</br>
</br>
Thus, this was also the precise reason the candidates for the position of mayor were more important.</br>
</br>
The individual must represent the interests of the NAC and must understand the situation of Pingan Street. Jiang Chen certainly considered parachuting someone in from the NAC, but he could not think of a suitable candidate.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen even considered Zhou Guoping who engaged in intelligence work in the Shangjing area. However, the thug-vibe on him meant that he could only play an effective role in the field and was not a suitable candidate for an official position.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan knocked on the door and saluted as Jiang Chen thought about this problem while sitting in the office that once belonged to Ding Liwei.</br>
</br>
"Report. Ding Liwei and Wan Peng's assets have been confiscated. It includes a total of five million crystals, one million crystals worth of luxury goods, 200 power armors, kinetic skeletons and other types of equipment."</br>
</br>
"Bring all the crystals back to Wanghai. As for the luxury goods," Jiang Chen touched his chin as he debated before he finally made a decision. "Contact the auction house here and proceeds will be used for post-disaster reconstruction."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Lu Fan replied. "There is one more thing Advisor Han has asked me to report to you."</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"The Russians have withdrawn to the Badaling region and have already withdrawn to outside the Fifth Ring Road."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
After he came up from underground, he already heard people say that Han Junhua ordered the armored forces to penetrate from the north side and follow the Third Ring Road to circumvent the zombie flood. Then they ignited ten tactical nukes at the Line 27 station and turned the entire station into a deep pit.</br>
</br>
The zombies were not only attracted by the living, but were also attacted by nuclear radiation. Driven by the instinct formed through the X1 bacterial, the zombies rushed into the tunnel through the deep pit and flanked the Russians from behind. While zombies were no threats to tanks, they were deadly to personnel.</br>
</br>
Compounded by the fact that Yegor and Sminov both died in the battle, the Uelen Border Guards was in a state of distress, and the slightly more senior officers began to feel restless. Internal problems spurred out one after another, and now they could not focus on the war with the NAC.</br>
</br>
Retreating was their only choice.</br>
</br>
"The Russian problems aside," Jiang Chen looked at Lu Fan and smiled, "Let's talk about you."</br>
</br>
"About me?" Lu Fan was confused.</br>
</br>
"What do you think of the expeditionary force?"</br>
</br>
"It's combat power is…"</br>
</br>
"Shangjing is the political center of the Pan-Asia Cooperation, and it was once a population center. There are countless fallout shelters that have not yet been opened, and there are countless heritages waiting for us to discover. So," Jiang Chen paused, "I am going to set up the Northern Division as the fourth division of the NAC. And the leader of this division..."</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's fingers knocked on the table as he looked at the shocked Lu Fan with a smile.</br>
</br>
"It's you."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The strategic significance of Pingan Street did not require further explanation. If the NAC managed to develop this region, the possibility of this place becoming the second Sixth Street certainly existed. This place would serve as the strategic fulcrum of the NAC in the north and radiate the glory of civilization to the surrounding wasteland...</br>
</br>
And it would be impossible to achieve this without a sufficient military presence.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen decided to form the Northern Division for this very reason. Now that the NAC has established itself for two years, it has managed to regain some vitality. The number of soldiers could easily support the establishment of another division.</br>
</br>
Counting the 5,000 soldiers in the expeditionary force, NAC would recruit 5,000 more from Shangjing to form a divison with 10,000 soldiers.</br>
</br>
The ideal leader of the fourth division would be his guard captain, Lu Fan.</br>
</br>
Although Lu Fan may not be clever, he acted with responsibility and loyalty. He was not ambitious either. To the north of Badaling was simply wilderness. Jiang Chen did not need someone who could expand the territory of NAC for him; he just wanted someone to protect the fruits of this expedition's victory.</br>
</br>
Lu Fan was the best candidate.</br>
</br>
When Lu Fan left Jiang Chen's office, he felt dizzy.</br>
</br>
While his ranking was not low, as the captain of the General Guards, even Cheng Weiguo, Wang Zhaowu, and Zhao Gang acted politely around him. However, he understood they respected the person he protected, not him.</br>
</br>
Based on the military ranking system of the NAC, the General Guards' captain was two ranks below the head of a division! It was not unprecedented to have someone rise two ranks at once. The last person was still on AS Order – The Captain of Order and the Head of the Expeditionary Force, Li Wang. He was only half a rank below the leader of a division!</br>
</br>
However, Li Wang was ranked as captain of AS Order because of his merit in Hongcheng, but he did not do much in this expedition… at least from his perspective.</br>
</br>
His fists clenched tightly and he took took a few deep breaths. He then touched the medal on his chest before determination appeared in his eyes.</br>
</br>
In order not to disappoint the trust of the general, he made up his mind that he would use 200% of his energy to protect the territory of NAC. If anyone dared to cause chaos on his land, he swore to personally bring them down!</br>
</br>
After Lu Fan left, Jiang Chen met the deputy captain of his guards in his office, or simply put the next captain, Zheng Shanhe. Because of the injury he sustained in Line 0, he had bandages on his arm. He was called to accept this duty.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and patted the uninjured shoulder. Then he said with encouragement.</br>
</br>
"You can do it! I'll have to count on you for my safety."</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe's back was straight as he saluted to Jiang Chen with full of excitement.</br>
</br>
"Guaranteed to complete the mission!"</br>
</br>
There was not much nonsense. Jiang Chen personally put the medal on him, and gave some more words of encouragement. For the newly appointed General Guards' captain, the first task for him was to supervise the development of Line 0.</br>
</br>
The task was for him to get used to this role. Since Han Junhua was overlooking this project, his role was just to assist.</br>
</br>
The reason why Jiang Chen gave this task to him was to familiarize him with the work of the captain. Although the main responsibility of the guards was to protect the safety of the general, but as the captain, his work also included representing the General at certain places inappropriate for the general to show up at.</br>
</br>
After Zheng Shanghe left, Jiang Chen went to the floor-to-ceiling windows in the office and continued to internalize the problem that continued to trouble him—the mayor of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
Outside the windows, below the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building, the troops that had withdrawn from the Dongcheng Hospital gathered in the military base and waited for dispatch.</br>
</br>
Looking at the military base from above, he suddenly felt a glimpse of inspiration, and a suitable candidate appeared in his mind.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1215"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1215: The Mayor“s Candidate</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With the exit of Shangjing Survivors Alliance, Mayor Liu, who previously belonged to Ding Liwei's force, stepped down.</br>
</br>
The position of mayor was highly sought after.</br>
</br>
Those officials who were previously kept at a distance by Ding Liwei and Wan Peng were now revitalized. They did all they could to be on their best behaviour and perform well.</br>
</br>
Those politicians with lackluster abilities and received their position through flattering did all they could. They almost immediately succumbed under the NAC banner and sang its praises. The most extreme even sent their wives and daughters to the General's barrack under the name of "consolation", only to be able to be crowned with the position of mayor.</br>
</br>
Especially when they heard the news of Song Chenyu's promotion and his responsibilities of overseeing the four gates of Pingan Street, the collection of the city gate tax and his assistance of the garrison to maintain order, the politicians on Pingan Street keenly captured the signal released by NAC.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not seem to plan to parachute an official in. Shangjing would still be maintained by a local survivor.</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan was the person that felt the most confident. When Jiang Chen decided to swing down his machete down at Shangjing Survivor Alliance, he not only did not step up to stop him, he actually immediately cleared his boundaries with Ding Liwei and Wan Peng. Previously, the Guardian Sect was only looking for the whereabouts of Line 0, but when it learned the news of NAC's involvement, they immediately stopped.</br>
</br>
He seemed to be the perfect candidate for mayor!</br>
</br>
However, when the mayor was revealed, the decision shocked everyone.</br>
</br>
NAC, in fact, did not parachute an official in from Wanghai, but it also did not select a mayor from the officials in Shangjing. The decision was an unknown merchant who travelled between Shangjing and Haizhou.</br>
</br>
In the fur business out of all businesses.</br>
</br>
How could someone like that be the mayor? Is this a joke?"</br>
</br>
Why did you choose him?"</br>
</br>
While she looked at the flushing, joyous Liu Wendi in the middle of his speech in the square, Zhao Qiuran could not understand the rationale.</br>
</br>
Even from the perspective of an outsider, the choice was hard to comprehend.</br>
</br>
"Do the person who becomes mayor make a difference?" Jiang Chen asked softly. "There is no one in Shangjing that I can trust. So it's better to choose an obedient person than a dogmatic person on the surface but will go against my orders behind my back."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and turned to walk back to the military base.</br>
</br>
"After all, if I don't know, I can always ask. The apocalypse existed for many years, who didn't start learning from scratch?"</br>
</br>
After being in a position of power for so many years, he started to learn about the type of people he should use.</br>
</br>
Sixth Street required a business genius like Chu Nan, but he would not be a good fit for Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
Instead of picking an agent he could not fully trust, it was better to choose someone without any foundation here, but understood the situation. Thus, this person would not be easily fooled by the people here, but could not do anything without the backing of NAC. In order for this person to establish themselves in Pingan Street with a complex power distribution, this person must depend on NAC.</br>
</br>
With the checks and balances, the mayor and the council would never work closely together. Therefore, the mayor afar would not be able to fool Jiang Chen hundreds of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The loyalty maintained through this method was far more reliable than slavery chips, since the latter was only suitable for the average people without power and influence.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran saw Jiang Chen had turned around and quickly followed behind him.</br>
</br>
On the way back, Jiang Chen debated about the next steps.</br>
</br>
With the mayor's candidate finalized, the next step would be to redistribute the cake and appease Xu Tiannan's force. Ding Liwei and Wan Peng were uprooted, Xu Tiannan's force intelligently stayed honest till now. Jiang Chen always didn't mind giving some benefits to honest people, especially since the two forces were still allies by name.</br>
</br>
Just when he thought about which bone to give Xu Tiannan, he saw a beautiful woman in a cheongsam. She stood in front of the military camp, shivering, while she was peeking inside the base.</br>
</br>
At first glance, even Jiang Chen, who had seen many gorgeous ladies, was stunned by her appearance.</br>
</br>
The split of the cheongsam revealed a large amount of smooth skin, and her perfect thighs were as smooth as jade. The fullness of her chest outlined a stunning S-shaped curve with her rounded bottom. The slender waist was the perfect size, distracting people with lucid imaginations.</br>
</br>
Her black hair was a waterfall, paired with her elegant lashes. She was the definition of perfection. Even among trophies, she was the brightest one. Her watery eyes siphoned people's soul and combined with her helpless expression, it would make any man want to press her to the ground.</br>
</br>
Wearing a cheongsam in this weather must be difficult for her.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw her, she obviously also spotted Jiang Chen. Perhaps she sensed the glimpse of being stunned in Jiang Chen's eyes, a look of joy appeared in her pupils. With teary eyes, she cautiously walked forward to Jiang Chen with her head lowered.</br>
</br>
"Pleased to see you, General Jiang." An Yiran bowed.</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Jiang Chen asked her.</br>
</br>
Her cheeks were slightly red, and water seemed to be dripping out of her eyes. An Yiran looked up at Jiang Chen, and weeped. "I just want to thank the general for saving my life from the demon Ding Liwei..."</br>
</br>
In her weeping tone, she denounced how inhuman Ding Liwei was and how she was forced to marry him. Then, she gazed at Jiang Chen with an adoring look, while she expressed how she worshipped the great hero that stood taller and implicitly hinted that he was the one in her mind...</br>
</br>
In the end, she shivered while holding her arms.</br>
</br>
For any normal man, the next step would be take her into the room and add another layer on her...</br>
</br>
Tricks! Full of tricks!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't help but curse in his mind.</br>
</br>
Am I a little virgin who has never experienced love? Mhmm! I was a spare tire (1) before!</br>
</br>
"Hehe, no need to thank me."</br>
</br>
With a smile, Jiang Chen passed by her, as he left a dumbfounded An Yiran standing in the chilling wind</br>
</br>
"You rejected her? The woman seemed to be Ding Liwei's second wife, I remember her name was An Yiran?" Zhao Qiuran said incessantly behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"So?"</br>
</br>
"I heard that An Yiran is certainly a somebody. Before the war, she was a famous Pan-Asia Cooperation singer. Not only did she sing a lot of popular songs, but she starred in several well-received movies. Two years ago, she woke up from the hibernation chamber and was purchased by Ding Liwei in an auction. Typical slaves would be rewarded to his subordinates after he was done, but not only did she escape the fate of being a slave, she became an upper-class lady and was even more favored than Ding Liwei's first wife," Zhao Qiuran said.</br>
</br>
"So what?" Jiang Chen smiled, unmoved.</br>
</br>
"You're not moved?" Zhao Qiuran blinked. "Speaking of this, you actually let them go. I thought you would turn them into slaves."</br>
</br>
"Am I that perverted?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at her and scared her into covering her mouth.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, it has nothing to do with being a pervert. Aren't all powerful people like this?" Seeing her honest words did not anger Jiang Chen, Zhao Qiuran spat out her tongue and said nonchalantly, "For example, the Wan Peng you killed. In the past, there was a relatively powerful mercenary group in Pingan Street. The head of the mercenary group was also a member of the council. Later, because he had upset Wan Peng, not only was he thrown away to be fed to the zombies but his wives and daughters were also chained and locked in a basement for half a year before everything ended."</br>
</br>
"So, I did some good deeds for the sake of the people," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"For the sake of the people?" Zhao Qiuran snorted. "That's a stretch. That mercenary group head was not a kind soul either. Or rather, no one in the Shangjing Survivors Alliance was good."</br>
</br>
To be precise, no one was good on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
This was an era where people took advantage of other people.</br>
</br>
"Now that Pingan Street is under my control, you're no longer wanted. Do you still want to go to Wanghai?" Jiang Chen changed the topic and nonchalantly asked.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran hesitated for a moment, but still nodded firmly.</br>
</br>
"I have already spent enough time here. The merchants have praised Wanghai into an Utopia, so I want to go there and take a look."</br>
</br>
Afraid that Jiang Chen would not agree, she quickly added, "I can fight, I can fight for you—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled slyly.</br>
</br>
"Fight for me? That's not enough."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran's face turned red as she took two steps back and put her arms in front of her chest. Her pupils with a hint of the wilderness was now covered with fear, "What, what do you want?"</br>
</br>
"It's not what you're thinking." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
Someone with spiritual abilities would be a great experimental subject. He couldn't find the cell bank of Eden Technology and if Lin Lin knew that he also let a rare "white mouse" escape, she would surely punch his chest with her little fists.</br>
</br>
When Zhao Qiuran thought about it, it made sense. Since he even rejected a woman like An Yiran.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran scratched her cheeks awkwardly and continued to follow Jinag Chen. However, she did not know that although she was no longer treated as a woman, she was labeled as a white mouse.</br>
</br>
In front of the barrack, Jiang Chen looked at her.</br>
</br>
"So, your ability is telesthesia."</br>
</br>
"Yes." Zhao Qiuran nodded.</br>
</br>
"Other than sensing positions, is there any other use for your ability?"</br>
</br>
"What are you referring to?" Zhao Qiuran did not quite understand his point.</br>
</br>
"For example," with a slight pause, Jiang Chen smiled, "Identify a person, or whether a group of people are lying."</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1216: The Way of Balance</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the Pan-Asia Cooperation Building conference room, the council members of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance stared at each other blankly.</br>
</br>
A 30-page document was placed in front of them.</br>
</br>
The cover of the document was very monotonous. Except for the white paper, it was just a line of large, black text - "NAC Colonial Regulations"</br>
</br>
When they saw this line of words, everyone silently mourned the passing of the Shangjing Survivors Alliance.</br>
</br>
At this moment, NAC no longer disguised its intention to annex the region and even gave up any attempt to mask their intention, the insensitive word "colonial" was especially telling.</br>
</br>
Besides, the council members could not do anything. While they certainly had a few guns in their hands, even if they combined all their forces, they were still far inferior. Especially now that NAC accepted the Pingan Street City Defense Troops into its ranks and the Second Militia surrendered.</br>
</br>
Not to mention the whizzing fighters and the terrifying electromagnetic pulse cannons.</br>
</br>
Against the humongous force, they did not have the might to resist.</br>
</br>
Even Archbishop Xu Tiannan sat there in silence.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran, who sat behind Jiang Chen, was starting to feel anxious as she examined those powerful and influential people in the conference room.</br>
</br>
Then, her uneasiness began growing exponentially when she discovered that Mei Zhiyong, the owner of Dorsett Hotel, seemed to be a member sitting at the conference table. When she escaped, she collapsed half of the hotel and forced the entire Pingan Street to be placed under martial law to capture her.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the owner of the Dorsett Hotel seemed to have forgotten about this nobody and did not look to her direction.</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran breathed a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, telesthesia did not allow her to read minds. She did not know that Mei Zhiyong would love to chop her alive. The collapsed Dorsett Hotel resulted in direct damages of over one million crystals; he would not make it back even by auctioning her 100 times!</br>
</br>
However, because of the man sitting in front of her, Boss Mei disguised his murderous desires and pretended not to know her.</br>
</br>
Of all the people sitting around the conference table, probably only one person had the most relaxed expression</br>
</br>
It was Jiang Chen sitting at the head of the table.</br>
</br>
He already presided negotiations of distributing interests countless times, and this time, he was still the one leading the conversation.</br>
</br>
While looking around the table at all the eyes with differing intentions, Jiang Chen spoke.</br>
</br>
"Do you disagree with the document in front of you?"</br>
</br>
No one made a sound.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and nodded with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"Is there no objection? It seems that our meeting today will go smoothly."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then coughed before speaking again.</br>
</br>
"First of all, allow me to introduce you to your future new mayor, Mr. Liu Wendi."</br>
</br>
</br>
Liu Wendi immediately stood up, his expression was slightly reserved as he bowed.</br>
</br>
"I'm Liu Wendi, and I am very happy to work with all of you."</br>
</br>
WIth how unnatural he looked, he was greeted with rather quiet applause.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not surprised. After all, many people eyed the mayor's position and did not expect a dark horse to come out. In the end, no one was elected and a merchant in the fur trade sector somehow sat on the mayor's throne.</br>
</br>
Many people were still wondering if he chose the mayor with careful consideration.</br>
</br>
After he sat back down, Liu Wendi moved around restlessly and turned to look at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not look at him at this time but continued.</br>
</br>
"The matters we're discussing today are related to the future of Pingan Street. Therefore, I hope that you will listen carefully to every word so you don't make the same mistake as the predecessors of this place or cause unnecessary misunderstandings. "</br>
</br>
The short, yet imposing words turned the vibe in the room into a chilling state as everyone waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"First of all, from today, Pingan Street will become a jurisdiction of NAC. In line with the principle of adapting to local conditions, we will not interfere too much with the internal affairs and the council will continue to serve its function."</br>
</br>
"Of course, we can't completely ignore it."</br>
</br>
"From today on, the mayor of Pingan Street will be directly nominated, appointed, and removed by the NAC. The council no longer has the power to vote and dismiss the mayor."</br>
</br>
As soon as this statement came out, the room was rattled.</br>
</br>
What kind of joke is this? If the mayor is directly appointed by you, what's the purpose of the council? Just watch you perform your one-man show while enjoying some tea? You might as well dissolve the council directly since voting is meaningless now.</br>
</br>
As he scanned at the congresspeople who were chatting in the room, Jiang Chen quietly waited for them to finish their discussion before he continued.</br>
</br>
"The mayor enacts a bill, and the council still has the right to vote against the bill. Also, to prevent the abuse of power, Pingan Street will establish a new speaker who will preside over an anonymous ballot, maintain the order of the council, and exercise supervision over the mayor. "</br>
</br>
Many people were confused about the decision.</br>
</br>
Didn't you just say that the council can't remove the mayor, why did you just create another supervising role?</br>
</br>
But soon, Jiang Chen answered the confusion of everyone in his next sentence.</br>
</br>
"If the mayor has serious misconduct, the speaker can call the council and initiate the impeachment proposal. If more than two-thirds of the members support the impeachment, the motion to dismiss the mayor will be submitted to me by Lu Fan, the head of the Northern Division. Then, I will sign to approve the motion."</br>
</br>
A glimpse of shrewdness appeared in Xu Tiannan's eyes before disappearing. He had to compliment him in his mind.</br>
</br>
Smart, very smart.</br>
</br>
After the fall of Ding Liwei and Wan Peng, the entire council of Pingan Street was now dominated by one force, and it was himself, Xu Tiannan. Because of this, he was acting with extreme caution. He knew that Jiang Chen would eventually go back to Wanghai, and after he left, Pingan Street would be under his control again.</br>
</br>
After all, the bureaucratic class of Pingan Street was already a fixed system. Without the support of the council, while NAC can control the system with its force, it can not allow the city to run with maximum efficiency.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could try and replace every gear of this machine with a new one, but the idea was simply not practical.</br>
</br>
Now, Jiang Chen's decision removed the puppet mayor from the council's hand and formed its own power, but he did not completely get rid of the council and give complete control to the mayor.</br>
</br>
The political awareness he displayed was not fitting for his age.</br>
</br>
Xu Tiannan even already guessed Jiang Chen's next move.</br>
</br>
The next move would be to expand the size of the council that includes civilians, small merchants, and factory owners as council members. Or else the two-third number he discussed would be meaningless. The current council members could easily work together and fool him hundreds of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
And the most crucial factor was these people would become the natural allies of Mayor Liu Wendi, weakening the influence of the existing council.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know how Xu Tiannan evaluated himself, even if he knew, he would have just smiled.</br>
</br>
Because he has heard similar evaluations countless times already.</br>
</br>
"As for the speaker, Qi Shushan is selected as the candidate." Jiang Chen looked at the man sitting behind the conference table, watching the expression on his face change from horror, overwhelmed, unexpected, to surprise. Then he looked at the expressionless Xu Tiannan with a smile, "The head of the tax bureau previously served by Wan Peng will be taken over by Archbishop Xu."</br>
</br>
After giving so many sticks, it was time to give a carrot.</br>
</br>
The city defense chief previously served by Ding Liwei was castrated and given to Song Chengyu, so now the head of the tax bureau was left. Although the Tax Bureau's power was limited, it was a sweet carrot for Xu Tiannan that did not manage to be chosen for the position of mayor or speaker.</br>
</br>
After the personnel appointment, Jiang Chen smiled and looked at the councils with varying expressions while he appreciated his own work.</br>
</br>
At the moment, Qi Shushan was giggling and his face flushing red. He was oozing with joy and proudness, bathing in the breeze of triumph.</br>
</br>
From a prestige perspective, Qi Shanshan was nowhere close to Xu Tiannan, from a strength's perspective, his power was not worth mentioning in front of the Guardian Sect. However, being assigned the position of the speaker completely stunned him.</br>
</br>
As for Xu Tiannan, when the position of the head of the tax bureau fell on his head, his stiff expression finally eased.</br>
</br>
As for the other members, they were either disappointed, or content, or chatting, or whispering...</br>
</br>
At this moment, it seemed that all the emotions in the world were concentrated in this ten-square-meter vanity fair.</br>
</br>
People were happy, angry, sorrowful, content with the gains and losses of their interests, and together they painted a vivid and realistic picture of the complex human being...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Did you notice anything after observing for so long?" On the elevator going down, Jiang Chen looked at Zhao Qiuran.</br>
</br>
"Hmmm..." Zhao Qiuran scratched her head.</br>
</br>
"You didn't forget what I said right?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen's expression, Zhao Qiuran quivered unsuspectedly before she quickly gave an explanation.</br>
</br>
"Not at all! Although I can roughly tell who is lying, for me to be sure, I have to see the person speak and watch for mental fluctuations. However, you were the only person speaking the entire time, how could I determine who was lying and who was not. They didn't speak at all..."</br>
</br>
"So, you didn't understand what I meant." Jiang Chen smiled and said, "What I meant by lying was not actually lying, but who felt nonchalant when I spoke. Or to the extreme, the people who were ready to challenge my reign."</br>
</br>
"Why didn't you tell me earlier?!" Zhao Qiuran complained as she rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen before she focused on recalling the mental fluctuations she felt at that time.</br>
</br>
It took her a while before she scratched her head and said, "It seemed like everyone was as you described… they did not take what you had to say seriously."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and spoke in a relaxed tone.</br>
</br>
"Yeah? Then it seems that my prediction is correct. This is indeed the right move."</br>
</br>
Zhao Qiuran looked at him, dumbfounded. She did not know why he was content and not angry. Is it something to be happy about if other people did not take your words seriously?</br>
</br>
From her perspective, she could not comprehend these problems yet, and Jiang Chen did not plan to explain them to her.</br>
</br>
He did not intend to train her into a politician; the plan for her was just to be a white rat for Lin Lin to study and provide her with some compensation at the end of the experiment. Since he did not find the cell bank of Eden Technology, he surely didn't want to fall short of her expectations.</br>
</br>
What's more, he was also very curious about the capability of spiritual power.</br>
</br>
"Ummm, although I said that I will sell my life to you, I will not become that kind of person in the future," standing behind Jiang Chen, Zhao Qiuran suddenly said with an anxious expression.</br>
</br>
"Which kind of person?"</br>
</br>
"The kind... people like those council members." Limited by her education, Zhao Qiuran searched for a while and could not find a more suitable word. So she had to use her fingers and gesture out her intentions.</br>
</br>
"Be reassured, you don't have that talent. You'll at most be a captain leading the charge." Jiang Chen laughed as he joked.</br>
</br>
"Now that I hear you say this, I feel assured." Zhao Qiuqi scratched her cheek as she responded.</br>
</br>
"Do you?" Jiang Chen shrugged and walked out of the elevator.</br>
</br>
People will change, especially when the environment changes.</br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen at the start. He only thought about smuggling some gold back from here and purchase a nice place in the most prosperous area in Wanghai. He wanted to live a rich man's life, experience all the things he saw in the movies, and then live his life in a drunken dream.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, when he really got a taste of power and understood what the word responsibility meant, his attitude subtly changed. A rich man no longer could satisfy his inflated appetite. In order to protect his loved ones and to gain more, NAC expanded to the behemoth it is today with a greedy dragon coveting its gold.</br>
</br>
And he, therefore, became a dictator who is loved by hundreds of thousands of people in this world... It made sense, the person who could feed everyone in this era deserved the word "loved", regardless if they are given the title of the emperor or slave lord.</br>
</br>
He nodded to the guards who were standing on both sides, and then went back into his barrack.</br>
</br>
When he saw Yao Yao peacefully sleeping on the bed, his previously serious expression disappeared and was replaced with a gentle smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat on the edge of the bed as he gently combed away Yao Yao's scattered hair that had fallen in front of her face to the back of her ear.</br>
</br>
The sleeping loli was like a hibernating little hamster. Her hands rested in front of her chest as she curled out into a ball under the quilt. Occasionally, she moved her nose and mouth before a smile appeared on her face as if she was having the sweetest dream.</br>
</br>
"Nighty night."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently kissed Yao Yao's forehead before weariness fell upon him.</br>
</br>
After he yawned, he looked at Yao Yao and thought of an idea.</br>
</br>
He opened the corner of the quilt and rested next to the little loli after he had washed up. Without any impure thoughts, he put Yao Yao in his arms and drifted into sleep.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After he had returned from Line 0, Jiang Chen barely closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Now, he was finally able to relax and get a good night's sleep.</br>
</br>
And when he woke up, it was already afternoon.</br>
</br>
Holding fragrant pork noodles, Yao Yao walked in. When she saw Jiang Chen was awake, she suddenly started blushing.</br>
</br>
"Ah...are you awake now?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I woke up when I smelled the food."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and sat up from the bed, put on his shoes, and went to Yao Yao. He took the bowl from the girl's hand and rested it on the table next to him.</br>
</br>
He hadn't eaten anything for 24 hours and was completely famished.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao sat across from Jiang Chen. Her hands were below her chin as a sweet smile rested on her blushing face. Her cheeks looked like two ripe apples and would make anyone want to take a bite.</br>
</br>
Happily watching her beloved big brother devouring the noodle she made, she cleaned up and walked out.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, Han Junhua was standing at the entrance and was about to knock. When she saw the door open, she nodded to the little girl holding the bowl and then walked in.</br>
</br>
"How do you feel?"</br>
</br>
"Alright." Jiang Chen looked at Han Junhua and raised his eyebrow, surprised. He then asked with a smile. "I am really surprised. You actually care about people?"</br>
</br>
"Is that a compliment..."</br>
</br>
"Uhhh, don't mind me, just a joke."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded.</br>
</br>
However, her expressionless face made it unconvincing as to whether or not she really understood the joke.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?" Jiang Chen changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"Yes. I want to ask for your opinion." Her arms crossed in front of her chest out of habit as she looked at Jiang Chen with seriousness, "What are you going to do with the city below Line 0?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1218"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1218: The Last Arrangemen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"The city below Line 0?" Jiang Chen deliberated as he rubbed his chin. "My plan is to empty the whole city, and then let it deconstruct in peace. What's your opinion?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then looked at Han Junhua, waiting for the advice of the chief of staff.</br>
</br>
"My opinion?" Han Junhua thought for a moment before she responded, "Are you not going to start the clone program? From an efficiency perspective, the proper use of clones can help accelerate the reconstruction of civilization."</br>
</br>
"But efficiency doesn't mean everything." Jiang Chen shrugged and leaned back in the chair. "NAC doesn't need to be saved by clone. We can use our own way to rebuild this land instead of becoming the second Pan-Asia Cooperation. "</br>
</br>
"So what about AI?" Han Junhua then asked, "How are you going to deal with it."</br>
</br>
There was a short period of quietness before he said.</br>
</br>
"First, move it out from the underground city. Its server is on the fifth floor of Eden Technology. You can send a few experts who understand this to deal with the issue. I have other uses for that AI, so I will bring it back to Wanghai."</br>
</br>
"As you wish." After a slight bow, Han Junhua did not say anything more on this issue as she understood Jiang Chen's intention. "I still have something to deal with, so I will not bother you any longer."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen smiled and nodded, then he added, "Summon Zhou Guoping."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Zhuo Guoping did not have him wait too long. After he heard that the general has summoned him, he immediately rushed from the wall to here.</br>
</br>
When he knocked on the door, Jiang Chen was sitting at the table and drinking tea.</br>
</br>
Seeing the familiar bald head, Jiang Chen showed a delightful smile. He put down his teacup and said.</br>
</br>
"Welcome."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping was quite reserved in front of Jiang Chen, without any of his usual fierceness. He smiled with shyness.</br>
</br>
"I heard General is looking for me, so I came immediately."</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, it's good news," When he saw Zhou Guoping's stern expression, he casually pointed to the chair next to him, "Sit down."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping cautiously sat down across from him. Jiang Chen smiled, paused for a moment, then began.</br>
</br>
"Now that Pingan Street is at peace, you deserve a lot of credit for it. I will now point out two directions for you. You can choose whichever one you prefer."</br>
</br>
"I will follow the command of the general," Zhou Guoping bowed his head and said respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Do you really want to follow my command?" Jiang Chen joked. "I'll send you to be Chu Nan's guard then, are you going to go?"</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping was so scared that cold sweat began to ooze out. He looked at Jiang Chen with a bitter expression, clearly traumatized.</br>
</br>
"Okay," Jiang Chen waved his hand, "I don't want to deal with your grudges. I'll now point out two paths for promotion. You make your decision."</br>
</br>
"Please." Zhou Guoping bowed his head.</br>
</br>
</br>
"The first path. Shangjing is now part of NAC and is considered the northern region of NAC from now on. Further north is the moor, and I'm not interested in expanding my territory to the Siberian wilderness where nothing grows. If you wish, you can stay in Shangjing and continue to do the work you are doing now."</br>
</br>
This was the retirement path Jiang Chen prepared for him.</br>
</br>
As long as he would not do anything too outrageous, he could live a relaxing life as a mercenary head for the rest of his life.</br>
</br>
With the budget allocated to him, his role would be to collect intelligence and keep an eye on the bandits and raiders. In addition, he would occasionally do some dirty work to protect the interest of NAC in the underground world.</br>
</br>
There would be no danger, but it would also be the last advancement!</br>
</br>
After seeing the hesitation on Zhou Guoping's face, Jiang Chen smiled and continued.</br>
</br>
"As for the second path, it's not an easy one. You'll have to go east, cross the Pacific Ocean, disembark in California, unite the local Asian forces, and lay down the foundation for NAC's expansion to the west coast of North America. You don't need me to teach you what to do next. But I have to remind you that it will not be a peaceful journey. NAC only has an outpost there, and the local survivors are not easily bullied."</br>
</br>
"I choose the second path," Zhou Guoping immediately made his decision.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and laughed. "Oh? You have already made up your mind? Most likely, you'll have to stay there. The situation there is far more chaotic when compared to here. Several major forces are all in the midst of all sorts of conflicts, compounded by the fact that the survivors there are not that much worse off compared to NAC."</br>
</br>
"I have made up my mind," Zhou Guoping immediately stood up, his head high and back straight. He then clenched his right fist and placed it in front of his chest while raising his voice, "In my lifetime, I swear to expand NAC's territory for the General!"</br>
</br>
It was a no brainer? He did not want to retire this early!</br>
</br>
The existence of Chu Nan always made him feel a sense of crisis, so he must continue to climb higher.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen must admit that NAC's military ritual did not fit Zhou Guoping very well. It felt like a bandit was being enlisted into a group of properly trained soldiers. While they all wore the same uniform, it just looked awkward.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Jiang Chen also got up from his chair and walked over to Zhou Guoping, patting him on the shoulder. "Since you have chosen the hardest road, I must treat you with equal respect. When everything is over, I will let you lead a survivor settlement on the West Coast."</br>
</br>
If he really led an area, then even the best area would turn into a bandit hole under his ruling. However, Jiang Chen didn't mind. It would just be a survivor settlement on another continent. He could have the freedom as long as he does commit awful crimes under NAC's flag.</br>
</br>
NAC's reputation must be protected.</br>
</br>
When Zhuo Guoping heard Jiang Chen's promise, he was overjoyed and immediately expressed his loyalty.</br>
</br>
He was waiting for this very promise. He served the NAC for many years and the people that entered NAC around the same time as him were either serving as the head of a division, the executive of a settlement or held the position of governor in colony.</br>
</br>
And he was still serving a role outside of the ranks of NAC.</br>
</br>
Now Jiang Chen gave him the promise that he'll be able to lead a settlement when everything ends, he was of course overjoyed.</br>
</br>
North America? So what? It is farther, and the conditions are harsher, but these difficulties are nothing compared to the taste of power!</br>
</br>
When Zhou Guoping swore his allegiance, Jiang Chen smiled and did not take his words to heart.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, you can say all of this when you come back," Jiang Chen interrupted Zhou Guoping's flattering words, "Bring your people and prepare in Wanghai. You'll depart at the end of October. I'll order the logistics department to allocate 100,000 credits to you. You can decide on weapons and people. Everything will be up to you."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
"Wait, don't rush to leave yet," Jiang Chen stopped Zhou Guoping as he was about to leave, "Remember to find someone you trust to go with you and get him to report to me."</br>
</br>
Zhou Guoping stood straight up, face flushed with joy.</br>
</br>
"Guaranteed to complete the mission!"</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1219: Triumphant Return</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The first snow of the year finally arrived at the beginning of October.</br>
</br>
The flag of NAC had flown over the Pan-Asia Cooperation building for more than a week. The change of regime did not cause any chaos and the survivors continued with their lives; more or less becoming accustomed to the change.</br>
</br>
Thanks to the battle, zombies appeared on the surface more often as they flooded out from underground, which made the entire Shangjing area more dangerous.</br>
</br>
Now, the area within the Third Ring Road was no longer as safe as before. The merchant fleets must bring more mercenaries and add more weapons to the trucks to ensure their safety. And those small settlements outside of the wall all increased their weapon reserve.</br>
</br>
For these reasons, the factories in Pingan Street were running at capacity and were once again revived from the brink of death.</br>
</br>
As time went by, more good news arrived.</br>
</br>
First, it was from the Russians. Yegor's death devastated the morale of the Uelen Border Guards and gave opportunities to ambitious individuals. There was an attempt at coup which resulted in a few deaths. Then, the remaining Russians were divided into two factions. Some of them decided to stay, while others were led by a man named Sedov on a journey back to their hometown of Moscow.</br>
</br>
Moscow was a very distant and hard to imagine place. Therefore, it was difficult to see them being able to return.</br>
</br>
However, if they continued to maintain their nomad lifestyle, slaughtering and robbing everything along their path, they could perhaps return to their homeland and ravage through Europe.</br>
</br>
Of course, the premise would be that they don't encounter powerful forces like the NAC, or extreme mutants unconquerable by human force...</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the third line of defense was rising by the day, and finally tall enough to deter the zombies.</br>
</br>
Zombies would not be able to get on the wall by stepping on the corpses, and the situation of using a bayonet would never occur again...</br>
</br>
Behind the third line of defense, the foundation for the collapsed wall was rebuilt. Engineering vehicles and construction robots worked continuously among reinforced concrete structures as they began the difficult and lengthy reconstruction work.</br>
</br>
Besides, resources shipped up from Line 0 provided the materials needed for the reconstruction of the wall. The special cement from Line 0 especially helped alleviate the urgent needs of Pingan Street.</br>
</br>
Other than the power armors, Jiang Chen did not plan to transport any resources back to Wanghai. He decided to store those in the warehouses of Pingan Street and open sales to local factories.</br>
</br>
Disregarding the fact that he served as a living "resource transfer station", the resource recovery technology in Sixth Street was becoming more and more advanced. Many materials that were previously difficult to recycle could now be converted into useful resources at a low cost.</br>
</br>
</br>
As resources and food gradually became self-sufficient, it had been a while since Jiang Chen transported any supplies back from the modern world. Instead, he often moved power armors produced here to arm his power armor brigade in the modern world.</br>
</br>
The last good news was that the NAC General who was ready to return home.</br>
</br>
Now that Shangjing was a part of NAC, Line 0 was emptied, and Russians were no longer a threat, the triumphant return was getting closer and closer.</br>
</br>
However, the survivors were still on the fence about whether or not this could be considered good news. But when they considered that the giant steel shadow would disappear from above their heads, people all breathed a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
No one liked the idea of an electromagnetic pulse cannon over their heads.</br>
</br>
Just like no one liked the idea of being pointed by a gun.</br>
</br>
"It's snowing."</br>
</br>
On the tall wall, Jiang Chen looked at the distant skyline.</br>
</br>
Through the flickering snow, the distant high-rises and the dawning glimmers of the morning merged into a line. If it weren't for the damaged buildings and streets, he really had an illusion of being in the center of the prosperous world.</br>
</br>
Next to Jiang Chen, Lu Fan was already in a new military uniform. As he blew out a cloud of white mist, he exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"The matter of the Fourth Division will be handed over to you. If there is any difficulty, remember to let me know."</br>
</br>
"Will do," Lu Fan said solemnly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and patted Lu Fan's shoulder. Instead of the usual farewell words, his eyes carried the message. Then he walked to the elevator on the edge of the giant wall.</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe followed Jiang Chen. When he passed Lu Fan, he stopped and held his right fist against his chest. He performed a NAC military salute to his former commander; it was meant to congratulate him for his promotion and also send him a silent farewell.</br>
</br>
After Lu Fan returned the military salute, he gently punched the chest of his former comrade with a grin.</br>
</br>
"The brothers will be yours to look after."</br>
</br>
Zheng Shanhe stood straight and solemnly promised.</br>
</br>
"Yes sir!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Prepare, depart!"</br>
</br>
With the ring of Li Wang's coarse voice, the loaded AS Order blew its melodious horn.</br>
</br>
The vortex engines gradually ignited and slowly pushed the steel behemoth forward.</br>
</br>
In the sight of the Shangjing survivors, more than a dozen airships, under the leadership of the giant steel airship, gradually drifted toward the south and eventually turned into a series of black dots on the horizon...</br>
</br>
In the cabin of AS Order, the electric heat slowly radiated a drowsy warmth.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was lying on her belly in front of the round window, hymning a cute tune. She was blowing on the glass window while writing and drawing abstract things.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen sat on a comfortable recliner and looked at the ice crystals condensing outside the window. While he enjoyed the drowsy warmth, he let his thoughts drift off and killed off some of the boring traveling time</br>
</br>
"We'll be in Wanghai tomorrow morning."</br>
</br>
"I'll have to go back to the modern world shortly after."</br>
</br>
"I don't know how Ayesha, Xia Shiyu, and Natasha have been. Are they getting along?"</br>
</br>
"After returning to the modern world, a lot of things must be resolved."</br>
</br>
In his head, there were random thoughts that constantly appeared. Just as Jiang Chen was about to fall asleep, a pair of clear and bright eyes moved from the window to beside his arms gazed at him earnestly.</br>
</br>
"You want to nap?"</br>
</br>
The soft voice rang in his ear.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen couldn't sleep after being gazed at like this.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," he reached out and squeezed the adorable face and smiled softly. "I'm going to nap for a bit, is there anything you need?"</br>
</br>
"Hmm..." Yao Yao blushed while holding onto the corner of her skirt. "Can we sleep like last time?"</br>
</br>
"Uhh... of course," Jiang Chen raised his eyelids. "Help me turn the heat down."</br>
</br>
He didn't want to move at all.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Yao Yao nodded happily and immediately ran to the heater to turn down the power. Then she returned to the recliner chair, took off her slippers, and climbed onto Jiang Chen with the same blushing face.</br>
</br>
The soft white stocking inadvertently brushed against him, making his thoughts go wild.</br>
</br>
But soon, this lingering feeling gradually calmed down with the sound of rhythmic breathing.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because it was too warm, the little girl quickly fell asleep on top of his chest.</br>
</br>
Looking at Yao Yao, full of joy between his arms, Jiang Chen smiled gently and buried his face in her fluffy hair.</br>
</br>
With the fresh scent of jasmine, he soon dozed off too.</br>

AS Order docked at the airship port in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
When the army equipped in power armors and kinetic skeleton paraded through the main road in the Sixth Street, the survivors paid the highest respect and applause to the soldiers who returned from the expedition.</br>
</br>
Flowers, cheers, applause...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, inside the brand-new X-1 power armor, waved his hands at the excited crowd. He could feel people's enthusiasm as a smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
People's worship of heroes is eternal and lasted from ancient times to the present.</br>
</br>
From time to time, a young girl came forward with a blush, and handed the bouquet in Jiang Chen's hand, offered a hug, and then quickly ran back into the crowd. The guards and NAC Knights who followed Jiang Chen also enjoyed the same treatment, just not as frequently as Jiang Chen who was at the very front.</br>
</br>
Because of this glory, many people specially came to participate in this triumphant ceremony. After the expeditionary army's dissolvement the second day, they must take an airship back to Shangjing to report to the Fourth Division.</br>
</br>
There were still people who could not make this trip, because NAC must maintain a minimum sense of military presence in Pingan Street. Many like Lu Fan were the ones who stayed behind.</br>
</br>
In the very front, Jiang Chen smiled and waved as he led the army forward. They slowly advanced towards the central square of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Look, look! The general seemed to have glanced at me just now," A girl said as she pulled on her best friend.</br>
</br>
"No. He was obviously looking at me!" The beautiful woman in the fallout shelter's winter clothes straightened her chest and said, overjoyed.</br>
</br>
Just as the two girls argued over who the general's sight stopped on just now, a mercenary at the entrance of the nearby tavern patted his thigh and sighed with regret.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! if I knew there was such prestige, I would have gone when they recruited! I would never have went to that merchant fleet for just one hundred credits, and I almost got castrated by the mutated humans." The mercenary-looking man looked enviously at the power armors that walked by as he couldn't stop sighing.</br>
</br>
"Come on, can you even survive for two seconds with your accuracy?" His colleague, who leaned on the side with a wine bottle, mocked while he burped, "I heard that our expeditionary force and the Russian Border Guards fought in the subway tunnel. Do you understand the concept of border guards? They are actual military troops! And we have won! If you can't even win against mutated humans, aren't you just going to be a deadweight?"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! How would you know if you didn't try!" The mercenary argued with his face completely red.</br>
</br>
As the mercenaries were causing a ruckus, the bank beside the central square was packed at this moment.</br>
</br>
In the war mobilization stage, NAC issued war bonds as usual, and now it was finally time to cash them out. However, what really ignited people's enthusiasm was not the two percent profit, but the auction of trophies and loots!</br>
</br>
</br>
The assets that belonged to Ding Liwei, Wan Peng and other council members on Pingan Street would be auctioned at the Sixth Street Bank hundreds of kilometers away. Factories, real estate, resources, and even the franchise rights of a certain industry were all the darlings these merchants chased after!</br>
</br>
It was an undeveloped virgin land. Although the weather was colder in the north, its development potential was much better than Hongcheng and Wu City!</br>
</br>
Merchants in suits and leather shoes crowded inside the trading floor of the bank as they eagerly looked up at the information flashing on the big screen. Their fingers were placed right above their EP screens and bid through the external "credit chip" on the EP.</br>
</br>
"What the! Who bid 1 million credits already! Who is this rich!" A merchant exclaimed when he saw the auction price that jumped up ten times compared to the starting price.</br>
</br>
"It's probably someone from Zhao Group. They are determined to win the food trading rights. But NAC is really generous. It's so good to keep this in their own hands. It's a gold mine..."A another merchant sighed.</br>
</br>
"Maybe the general hasother plans. However, having said that, the credit points were originally issued by the military government. No matter how much money they make, it is just a number after all."</br>
</br>
"You are right... By the way, I heard that there is a high density of mutant species in the subway stations in Shangjing, and there are many high-quality hunting grounds. Do you want to buy a hunting group? Winter is coming soon; the crystal market seems to have potential!"</br>
</br>
"Forget it. If even you could think of this idea, I think the crystal is going to fall again..."</br>
</br>
"What do you mean?!"</br>
</br>
The entire Sixth Street was unprecedentedly lively.</br>
</br>
Of course, the liveliest place was the central square.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood in front of the square, just like the last time he returned form the expedition. He read the victory declaration in front of all the survivors and then awarded medals to the soldiers who returned.</br>
</br>
The award ceremony was also the most awaited part of the entire celebration.</br>
</br>
In the NAC's pyramidal citizenship hierarchy, the benefits and political rights enjoyed by citizens of different ranks were completely different.</br>
</br>
In this expedition, a total of 170 high-class citizens were newly promoted to NAC Knights. They could have their own T-3 power armor (although they could only be stored in the warehouse under unified management), and could serve as officers in the military government above the rank of captain.</br>
</br>
In addition, there were a total of 510 newly promoted upper-class citizens, 1,520 middle-class citizens, and 3,000 lower-class citizens. Obtaining citizenship was equivalent to naturalization in the NAC military government system, which allowed the citizen to receive at least one ration and be allowed to settle in "military zones" such as the Fishbone Base.</br>
</br>
Although it was possible to apply for abandonment of citizenship, no one in their right mind would ever do so.</br>
</br>
Any one with citizenship was highly sought-after by unmarried girls and single women. If they couldn't gain achievements through war, marriage was the only way for them to become a citizen.</br>
</br>
Especially the newly promoted knights, they were considered a rare resource in the eyes of the unmarried girls in Sixth Street. Being a knight lady was not only an honor, but it also meant a plentiful life.</br>
</br>
They could enjoy delicious white rice every meal, and meat raised from the beef cattle from the Garden of Eden. It was an enviable life that even factory owners and wealthy merchant dreamed of.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that many people also jokingly referred to this ceremony as husband selection ceremony. And the facts have also proved this. According to statistics after the end of the last expedition, in the month after the ceremony, the number of marriages registered almost tripled compared to last month.</br>
</br>
Even Chu Nan discussed this issue with Jiang Chen. Proper foreign war could help eliminate poverty and decrease the number of singles...</br>
</br>
Of course, in addition to the knights, there was the most popular individual, and he was the one standing in the middle of the stage.</br>
</br>
Young, handsome, chic, and suave...at least in the eyes of all unmarried girls. But because of this, this one seemed a bit out-of-the-reach in everyone's eyes.</br>
</br>
Success could conceal many shortcomings of a man, and even turn many shortcomings into advantages. To give a very popular example - because Jiang Chen is Jiang Chen, the fact that many love affairs were related to him could only be love affairs, and nothing else.</br>
</br>
Even those pre-war actresses, business elites, and women of high-ranking officials who have high self-esteem that recently exited the hibernation chamber, who strongly believed in women's rights from the pre-war era looked at the tall figure on stage and felt their hearts pounding.</br>
</br>
It had nothing to do with power or wealth.</br>
</br>
The worship of heroes was human nature.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Just when the ceremony was about to reach its climax, inside a pink-colored room at the Lin Institute.</br>
</br>
It was Lin Lin's second bedroom as she occasionally stayed here to save herself the time from running between her lab and her bedroom.</br>
</br>
There were no boring experimental equipment and no smell of disinfectant. There were only some girly furniture and the unique fragrance of the girl, as well as two little lolis who were chatting at the table.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin No.1001 gently knocked on the door, then she came in wearing a maid uniform and brought two cups of coffee.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao quickly got up and thanked her before taking the coffee from her hand. As for Lin Lin, she extended her hand like an emperor and enjoyed the service from her innocent and naïve sister… She couldn't help it as her character has always been this "bad" towards people who were easy to bully.</br>
</br>
By the way, the maid uniform was also one of her wicked tastes.</br>
</br>
While "elegantly" enjoying coffee, Lin Lin listened to Yao Yao's narration of what happened in Shangjing before finally letting out a sigh. She put down the cup coffee and spat out her tongue.</br>
</br>
"So you didn't make any progress?"</br>
</br>
"Ummm... that's not true." Yao Yao was upset as she raised her eyebrow and protested. "Big Brother hugged me when we slept and kissed me on the forehead!"</br>
</br>
"Just a kiss? This is exactly no progress." Lin Lin pursed her lips before she smirked at Yao Yao. "Maybe your beloved Big Brother is now rolling in the sheets with Sun Jiao."</br>
</br>
The sentence was a double-edged sword.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, out of habit, blurted out the sentence to bully the cute Yao Yao. However, those words also hurt her.</br>
</br>
"Hmph, it's useless to lie to me. Brother Jiang Chen is still issuing the medal of honor at Sixth Street. He won't come back until noon tomorrow." Yao Yao glanced at Lin Lin with the expression that said I won't be fooled by you.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Lin Lin rubbed her aching chest as she forced a smirk, "Let's not go home tonight then. Will someone put herself in that bad guy's bed?" I heard that the… foxy lady who is really good at singing wrote a song for him."</br>
</br>
Prosperity has promoted the development of culture. In particular, NAC held events such as galas and festivals during the Spring Festival, New Year's Day, and NAC National Day. Many merchants also spotted the opportunities in the market and invested in bands and singers for concerts and albums.</br>
</br>
It was also a way for the celebrities that entered the hibernation chamber before the war to go back to their old careers. Many stunning celebrities did consider Jiang Chen as an option. After all, the choice was obvious between singing to the general in his bed and performing to the undernourished survivors.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, they did not wake up in time. At least for now, Jiang Chen rarely did scandalous things outside...</br>
</br>
"Don't say that he is a bad guy..." Yao Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Uhhh, that's not the point?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin massaged her temples, feeling a headache was coming on.</br>
</br>
The bad-mouthing ability that was effective to Jiang Chen, Sun Jiao, and even the sly Xiaorou became useless in front of Yao Yao. She could only feel a sense of defeat.</br>
</br>
I feel defeated...</br>
</br>
Yao Yao did not bother with Lin Lin who was rubbing her temples as both of her hands were under her chin. However, she suddenly thought of something great as a sweet smile formed on her face.</br>
</br>
"But then, it feels so warm to be hugged."</br>
</br>
When she saw Yao Yao's joyous smile, Lin Lin suddenly felt a hint of jealousy.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin pouted, then turned around and looked away as she muttered under her breath.</br>
</br>
"Hmph, you're so easily satisfied? Next time... I will not give you the opportunity to go."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin did not expect Yao Yao to nod and then respond so seriously.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! For sure, next time its Sister Lin Lin's turn."</br>
</br>
"Uhh? Re… really?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was a little flustered.</br>
</br>
"Of course, thank you for supporting me last time... I just couldn't help you find Eden Technology's Cell Bank. I'm really sorry," Yao Yao stood up and said apologetically.</br>
</br>
"Uhh? It's okay, it doesn't matter..."</br>
</br>
Looking at the completely serious Yao Yao, Lin Lin quickly waved her hand.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, I'm not good at dealing with children...</br>
</br>
Lin Lin muttered in her mind while her cheeks began to feel hot.</br>
</br>
Although she has felt this way before, she suddenly felt Yao Yao was particularly cute at the moment...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The autumn wind of October already brought the winter chill.</br>
</br>
Although there was no snowfall in Wanghai, the first snow was not far away.</br>
</br>
During the small ice age caused by the nuclear winter, this planet would only get colder. However, the cold did not freeze people's enthusiasm. Yesterday, Sixth Street was immersed in the joy of festivities. People cheered and shouted for the longevity of the general as they celebrated the border expansion of NAC by a few hundreds of kilometers north.</br>
</br>
Until noon the next day, when Jiang Chen went home, the same celebratory atmosphere still lingered behind...</br>
</br>
In the office of the mansion, two figures embraced together.</br>
</br>
From afar, they looked like a painting.</br>
</br>
"Are you leaving again?" In his arms, Sun Jiao said with a hint of resentment.</br>
</br>
"...maybe I'll stay till the end of the year. I won't travel to far off places anymore." Jiang Chen gazed into the sky and said emotionally, "I'm sorry I have to leave so soon after coming back. I couldn't even spend time with you."</br>
</br>
A gentle smile surfaced on Sun Jiao's lips.</br>
</br>
She leaned against Jiang Chen's chest for a while before she suddenly looked at him with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I heard you brought back a woman?"</br>
</br>
"Who did you hear that from?" Jiang Chen asked. "I didn't take her home. I just found an experiment subject for Lin Lin..."</br>
</br>
Swearing to Heaven and earth, he did not do anything to Zhao Qiuran!</br>
</br>
Then gentle lips blocked his words.</br>
</br>
Their lips parted.</br>
</br>
However, a faint lingering fragrance stayed behind. Looking at the beautiful smile inches away, Jiang Chen felt warmer inside.</br>
</br>
"No need to explain," Sun Jiao said softly, "I believe in you."</br>
</br>
Staring at her tender pupils, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"What are you laughing at?" Sun Jiao pouted and dissatisfiedly poked Jiang Chen's chest.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I felt surprised." Jiang Chen softly grabbed Sun Jiao's hand.</br>
</br>
"Surprised about what?"</br>
</br>
"The Queen that almost whipped me has now turned into a dignified and respectable Miss General," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao took a second to process this information. Perhaps she began thinking about her past self, for she also burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"Which one do you like?" Sun Jiao moved closer and softly bit his ear. Then she said in a playful tone, "If you miss the old me, I can take the rope out tonight." "</br>
</br>
"I like all of you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put her hands around her slender and soft waist, this time, he kissed down.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
At the Space Command Center in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
It was noon and the staff was resting.</br>
</br>
A man in the Celestial Trade uniform was munching on fries with ketchup while sliding his greasy hand on the holographic screen. He turned on a famous streamer who was streaming Godly Land.</br>
</br>
The neural-accessible VR online game took the world by storm. With miraculous intelligent real-time computation power, the game captured the minds of the players using endless plots and possibilities. The game captured over ninety-five percent of the VR MMORPG market.</br>
</br>
Gris was no exception. Before he became a Celestial Trade employee, he was already a big fan of Godly Land. Whenever he took lunch, he would go into a select few channels to watch the streamers doing "unique missions" while he enjoyed his snacks.</br>
</br>
The stream was getting more exciting as a streamer called Shadow Demon was about to finish the plot of a "unique mission" and enter the boss fight, but then the headset he tossed on the table suddenly flashed red.</br>
</br>
Gris paused for a second when he saw the flashing red light.</br>
</br>
Although he was reluctant, he turned off the holographic screen in agony and put his feet back down on the floor before he grabbed the headset.</br>
</br>
It was the nature of his work.</br>
</br>
Because the communication resources of the Earth and Mars were precious, even during his break, he must sit at his desk and be on standby. The real break only happened after work when shift interns would take over.</br>
</br>
After he cleared his throat, he wiped the grease off of his mouth and skillfully pressed the button.</br>
</br>
"This is the Space Command Center, Agent 011 is at your service."</br>
</br>
There was a brief period of static noise in the communication before it quickly became clear.</br>
</br>
"...This is Project Team 071. We found something special in the ground... we don't know how to describe our shock at the moment."</br>
</br>
Something special?</br>
</br>
Gris couldn't understand for a moment, but he did not dare to neglect what he had just heard. He immediately grabbed the pen from the table and jotted it down on a notepad.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Project Team 071, the Space Command Center has received your message. Can you describe it more in detail? What did you find?"</br>
</br>
"There is a wide underground space, no groundwater, no ice... It's empty and the outer casing is metal. After scrapping about five drill bits, we have drilled through the outer casing. Inside we detected some metal objects, but they don't seem natural and we can't determine its source."</br>
</br>
Next to the Mars rover, Wang Qiang made contact with the Celestial City Space Command Center through the Mars communication base station. While looking at the screen of the instrument in his hand, he had a serious expression on his face.</br>
</br>
Next to him were four Marines in aerospace kinetic skeletons, and they were holding the new personnel weapon - Gaussian Rifle. At this moment, the four Marines were cautiously guarding the drilling platform.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Wang Qiang had hung up the phone, Captain Hong Zewei, who was standing next to him, immediately asked.</br>
</br>
"What did the command center say?"</br>
</br>
"They asked us to continue to drill down and then drop in drones."</br>
</br>
"Drop in drones? What if a monster comes out?" Hong Zewei smiled bitterly. "Or what if a Gundam appears..."</br>
</br>
"Then we must be the side characters that die at the beginning of the movie," Wang Qiang shrugged and put his arms on the Mars rover. He looked at the drill with a perplexed expression, "Or we'll be the Columbus that discoveres the New World."</br>
</br>
"You are the ship captain, you have to make the choice."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
January 1st, 2020.</br>
</br>
After a relaxing three-month holiday in the apocalypse, Jiang Chen returned to Coro Island on New Year's Day.</br>
</br>
The election campaign for Xin was in full swing. The holographic screen floating on the side of major streets in several major cities like Coro, Penglai, and Ange were either filled with advertisements of Future Group, or President Zhang Yaping's campaign declaration.</br>
</br>
Under the massive propaganda, other party candidates were all foils.</br>
</br>
In fact, even without these propaganda offenses, Zhang Yaping's chance of losing the election was almost zero. The past four years had been four years of rapid progress in Xin. The total GDP created in these four years exceeded the total GDP of this island country over the past few centuries.</br>
</br>
Many people watched the island country transition from sugar cane, fishery, and coconuts being the pillar industries to becoming a "cosmic powerhouse" with the support Future Group who then seated Xin on the throne of the "Earth Defense Alliance".</br>
</br>
Countless people sighed and regretted the fact that they lost the support of such a powerful corporation.</br>
</br>
Also stirring the international landscape was a general election on the other side of the Pacific. Although Xin achieved epic monuments in many fields and the world's center of gravity began to tilt from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific, for now, the world's intersection was still at the Times Square, not a space elevator leading to the future of mankind.</br>
</br>
Compared with the stable election of Xin, the UA election was full of dramatic changes.</br>
</br>
A black horse broke out from the crowd, and Trump, under the "race" banner, unexpectedly won the candidacy of the party with the help of his "Twitter Empire", and unexpectedly became a popular candidate for the primaries.</br>
</br>
At the same time, while the Republican Party was still arguing over the candidacy, the Democratic Party was in the midst of a bloodbath.</br>
</br>
Negative news of Hill suddenly stormed the Internet, and she was exhausted from deflecting scandals such as accepting foreign funds and private emails.</br>
</br>
Kerry suddenly resigned from his post of Secretary of State and broke the vow of not participating in the election. He said that he would lead the UA and the Democratic Party on the "right path" and began targeting Hill.</br>
</br>
John F. Kennedy emerged out of nowhere. After an open campaign speech, he changed from a little-known member of the House to a nationally-renowned campaigner. His support rate skyrocketed, just like the black horse from years before...</br>
</br>
The three forces had attacked each other and it was a fierce battle for the primaries in March. Because of the subpar candidate from the Republican party, who also made a fool of himself because of a particular incident, many people joked that the president would be decided in March.</br>
</br>
Under the glamorous appearances, it was a bloody and tragic battle between the capitals of Wall Street.</br>
</br>
Behind Kerry was Daniel Morgan and Hill was backed by the Rockefeller Consortium, and the Kennedy family itself was a member of the B City Consortium's community of interests. The B City Consortium's influence was not comparable to the two Wall Street giants, but they managed to find a strong foreign aid – Future Group.</br>
</br>
Before facing a more distant crisis, the problems of the human civilization seemed to be even more urgent.</br>
</br>
On the first day of the second decade in the twenty-first century, this azure planet welcomed this turbulent and unstable political landscape.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1223"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1223: A Holiday That Ended Early</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Andrée Island, located south of Coro Island, was a relatively large island outside of the Pannu Nine Islands and was also a famous tourist attraction. It was rumored that the island was named after the sailor who first discovered the island on the Magellan fleet, and there was also a saying that the island was named after a London aristocrat who never visited Asia.</br>
</br>
Because the island shared the same name as the island near Antarctica, some members proposed to rename the island. However, since Xin was pushing for "unified language and cultural compatibility", this proposal did not come to fruition.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, lying on the recliner, was leisurely enjoying his time off as the sea wind gently breezed by. He was drinking chilled smoothies while watching crowds play on the beach not far away.</br>
</br>
Two days ago, after he had returned from the apocalypse, he brought Ayesha, Xia Shiyu, and Natasha to the holiday mansion near the beach.</br>
</br>
Although he owned a lot of private beaches, nothing really compared to the liveliness of a public beach.</br>
</br>
For example, beautiful women in swimsuits, gorgeous girls playing beach volleyball, and the "waves" that swayed around due to all the movement.</br>
</br>
As for safety, the Ghost Agents were on the lookout for him, and drones were on standby 24-7 near him. So he did not need to be concerned...</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen's eyes were half-closed and he was about to fall asleep, a document was gently placed on his face and covered his sight of the beach.</br>
</br>
The document slipped to his chest and Jiang Chen lazily picked it up. When he saw the black and white photo printed on the paper, his eyes narrowed and he took a brief look.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"Trump, a well-known real estate developer in the UA. He is also a candidate for the 2020 election. This is a paper copy of his relevant information. Here is his campaign speech..."</br>
</br>
On the recliner next to Jiang Chen, Ayesha in a swimsuit tapped on the Future around her wrist. After the holographic screen opened, she gently pushed it toward Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"A Republican?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow as he examined the man in the video before he clicked the play button, and touched his chin with intrigue, "interesting."</br>
</br>
The holographic screen showed a campaign speech a few months ago on the lawn of a park in Nevada.</br>
</br>
The protagonist of the speech was the "questionable nominee" in the center of the storm - Mr. Trump.</br>
</br>
It was supposed to be a very formal speech, but Jiang Chen felt like he was watching a talk show.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"I'm rich, I'm very rich, I'm very very rich!"</br>
</br>
"So, I don't care how much money those Wall Street people will give me!"</br>
</br>
"I assure you that if you vote for me, at least the vote will not inexplicably appear in the pocket of Wall Street. Only I can represent your interests, only I can represent the UA dream, yes, only me!"</br>
</br>
"We shouldn't send people like Kerry who has no idea how to negotiate and sign an infuriating and comical agreement with them, then watch as they use our money to make weapons and act aggressively at the negotiating table."</br>
</br>
</br>
"You know who I am talking about. That's right! It's him! Only someone who is more of a man can negotiate with him, not that old woman without a proper menstrual period!"</br>
</br>
"Tell me, will you vote for the old lady?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"The UA dream has been shattered! And I will reshape the UA dream, make it bigger, better, stronger, and make it great again. Thank you."</br>
</br>
At the beginning of the campaign, he offended the Wall Street, the female rights activists, and also directly targeted Kerry, and stated he will face that man.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure this is a campaign declaration, not a declaration at an MMA fight?"</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen watched the video, he was not angry, but instead amused.</br>
</br>
"Our analysis concluded that his chance of winning the March primaries is high and there are no strong candidates in the Republican Party," Ayesha said. "If he wins in the March primaries, then John Kennedy's biggest competitor will be him."</br>
</br>
"Indeed, after watching this speech, even as a foreigner, I want to vote for him." After he had pushed the holographic screen aside, Jiang Chen said while trying to contain his laughter.</br>
</br>
Of course, even if he was laughing, this candidate already caught the attention of Ghost Agents and must be treated with caution. While Future Group and the B City Consortium were both backing Mr. John Kennedy, the UA was not Xin after all. The identity of Future Group remained sensitive and thus some things must be done under disguise, or rather, under constraints...</br>
</br>
Unlike the elections in Xin, the UA election was still at odds.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned off the holographic screen, cleared his throat, he pressed his fist against his lower lip for a moment, then, he ordered.</br>
</br>
"Collect his information and focus on his diplomacy and trade policy. I need to know what his attitude towards Xin and Future Group is if this interesting candidate was ultimately elected."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll get on it."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded seriously and was about to get up, but Jiang Chen pulled on her arm.</br>
</br>
She turned her head and was just about to ask what was going on when Jiang Chen interrupted.</br>
</br>
"Forget about it today, go tomorrow."</br>
</br>
Looking at the smirk on his face, Ayesha's cheeks turned red and she nodded lightly.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The thoughts that have accumulated for a long time were all melted into passionate sweat.</br>
</br>
Natasha and Ayesha were not repulsive toward doing shameful things together, only Xia Shiyu was still somewhat reserved. But with peer pressure from the two girls and too much champagne, she fell beside Jiang Chen with a blush, closed her eyes, and gave all her best to him...</br>
</br>
The next morning, leaning against the soft bed, Jiang Chen shook his drowsy head and turned his head.</br>
</br>
When he saw the satisfied expressions of the three women, there was a proud smile. He looked straight up at the ceiling, reminiscing of last night's madness.</br>
</br>
After he had returned from Shangjing, his three attributes also improved slightly. While he was still a long way from Sun Jiao, he was a superhuman by this world's standard. Even Natasha was defeated in his hands...</br>
</br>
It was the power of technology.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen let his thoughts diverge, Kelvin phoned in.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly got up after moving the smooth arms wrapped around his neck away. After he covered the girls' three seductive and fascinating bodies, he put on his watch and went into the living room.</br>
</br>
When he clicked the accept call button, he yawned and sat on a chair.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
As soon as the call was connected, Kelvin immediately spoke.</br>
</br>
"There is a situation on Mars." Perhaps Kelvin was worried that the weight of his words did not sound urgent enough, he added, "It's Project 071."</br>
</br>
As soon as Jiang Chen heard the number 071, he immediately turned serious.</br>
</br>
"Are there findings at Mine 071?"</br>
</br>
"We have drilled into the target layer and found something unusual in it..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils shook as he stood up and walked to the window.</br>
</br>
"I'll rush to Celestial City as soon as possible. You are responsible for convening the relevant personnel of the project team to prepare the relevant materials. We'll meet in ten hours."</br>
</br>
"Understood!" Kelvin replied.</br>
</br>
After he had hung up, Jiang Chen looked at the pleasant seascape outside the window and suddenly sighed.</br>
</br>
Originally he had planned to stay on this island for a week.</br>
</br>
But now his holiday must end early...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
On the space elevator heading to Celestial City, Jiang Chen stood by the floor-to-ceiling window of the head cabin and overlooked the blue covered with white that slowly drifting away from his sight.</br>
</br>
Recalling the leisure time he had on the island over these last two days, it was really a shame to end it early. However, considering the importance of Mine 071, he could only sigh.</br>
</br>
A man walked to him.</br>
</br>
"It's the view beautiful?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned his head and raised his eyebrows after he saw the man. Then, he smiled and said, "Oh it's you, what a coincidence".</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng smiled and said in a sly tone. "Because of work, I have to travel between Shangjing and Celestial City. I have had to spend at least a week in the space elevator this month."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen chuckled and started chatting.</br>
</br>
"Oh, is that medicine effective?"</br>
</br>
"...I did become younger." Wu Changfeng nodded and said emotionally, "Your technical capability is astounding. Maybe after another ten years, the world will yearn for the citizenship of your country."</br>
</br>
"Haha, you're exaggerating." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
It was indeed an over-exaggeration.</br>
</br>
Even now, Xin citizenship was coveted by many around the world. In his next term, President Zhang Yaping would gradually tighten the immigration policy.</br>
</br>
"Right, I brought a few questions from my country. I don't know if Mr. Jiang can shed me some light?"</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen asked. "What questions?"</br>
</br>
"I heard that the project you're carrying out in the Martian colony is... related to extraterrestrial civilization?"</br>
</br>
"That is a rumor. All projects involving extraterrestrial civilization will be made public to the primary members of the Earth Defense Alliance and a vote must take place to device whether the information is disclosed to the secondary member states," Jiang Chen immediately said righteously.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng processed the information and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang misunderstood, I have no other intention than clarifying..."</br>
</br>
After the space elevator arrived, Jiang Chen and Wu Changfeng bid farewell before Jiang Chen took the express train to the Space Department of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng's words made Jiang Chen ponder while he was inside the train.</br>
</br>
Project 071 is closely linked to strong interaction materials and is one of the most confidential secrets of Celestial Trade. It is reasonable to say that no information from the project can be leaked. However, it seems that people have gotten wind of the project.</br>
</br>
He did not think Major General Wu would have just casually asked him that question.</br>
</br>
The major general did not come from a simple background. While he was from the Army, he came from the renowned General Staff Department Division Two. The name General Staff Department was not unfamiliar with Jiang Chen as it served as the intelligence of Hua's Army. Its presence was seen in everything from internal affairs to foreign affairs, not only powerful but also comprehensive.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, from Wu Changfeng's tone, they seemed to have indeed gained some information, but they could not verify the accuracy...</br>
</br>
"Even Hua heard some information. Then, the Russians must also be aware of this. Is it through the transportation ship's supplies? Or something else..."</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was internalizing this thought, the train had arrived.</br>
</br>
Putting this problem aside, under the escort of soldiers, Jiang Chen walked out and headed to the Space Department.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the conference room of the Space Command Center, the relevant members of Project 071 were already sitting around the table.</br>
</br>
Everyone had a serious look on their face.</br>
</br>
Once any problem had the label of "extraterrestrial civilization", it would automatically escalate to Class A in the confidentiality ranking of Celestial Trade. However, at the establishment of Project 071, it was already classified as Class S confidential, which demonstrated the importance Celestial Trade placed on this project.</br>
</br>
The door opened, and when Jiang Chen appeared at the door, all the top experts and researchers sat straight and stopped whispering.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat down at the head of the table, cleared his throat, and concisely said.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, the elevator encountered a strong airflow in the troposphere and it was ten minutes late. Your time is precious, so let's get started."</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen looked at Kelvin.</br>
</br>
Kelvin nodded and announced the beginning of the meeting.</br>
</br>
The lights in the conference room dimmed, and it was absolutely silent.</br>
</br>
"It was decided by the project team that the frontline staff will deploy drones into the hollow layer below Mine 071. According to the data from the bottom... it's better for me to give you the diagram." Kelvin pressed the control and then looked at people around the table. "By the way, this newly released 3D image is also classified as Class S."</br>
</br>
The three-dimensional graphics emerged.</br>
</br>
The pale blue light particles appeared out of thin air. It formed countless straight lines, reciprocated in the air, and illustrated the Martian landscape map layer by layer. Immediately afterward, the light particles filled under the Martian geomorphic network map, all the way down, and finally twisted into a spiral image.</br>
</br>
Everyone looked shocked.</br>
</br>
"What is this?"</br>
</br>
"An inconceivable shape."</br>
</br>
"The veins of a certain natural mineral? It's not quite like..."</br>
</br>
"Could it be an alkaline albite vein? Mars has experienced large-scale volcanic activity, as evidenced by rock specimens shipped back from the colony. Considering the acidic environment of Mars, it is likely to be alkali. The traces left by the erosion of the igneous rock veins..."</br>
</br>
"It's possible, but it doesn't explain why we have anomalies in our seismic data..."</br>
</br>
"Could it be a rare mineral residue?"</br>
</br>
Kelvin looked at the scholars whispering amongst each other before he gently coughed to get everyone's attention. He pressed his hands against the table before he said. "You can freely express your opinion. However, the first question to be discussed at this meeting is whether the discovery at Mine 071 is naturally formed, or the remains of extraterrestrial civilization... or something similar."</br>
</br>
The meeting room was silent.</br>
</br>
It took a while for the whispers to continue.</br>
</br>
"If it is artificially formed, what is the significance of making a building spiral? In terms of space utilization, this construction is completely meaningless..."</br>
</br>
At this moment, Dr. Amos, who had been sitting at the corner of the conference table without any presence from beginning to end, suddenly spoke up.</br>
</br>
"I remember when I was 7 years old, my grandfather in Bavaria once took me to do an experiment," He said, then paused and looked at the all the eyes that were now on him before he continued, "He poured heated liquid aluminum into an ant nest, and then after the aluminum cooled, we could get an aluminum model of an ant nest..."</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry to interrupt you, Dr. Amos, but we are discussing Mine 071," A professor interrupted him with a mocking tone, "Besides, there are no ants on Mars."</br>
</br>
"I know," Amos shrugged. "But who knows, maybe Mars, three billion years ago, was full of some kind of arthropods. You don't think this spiral structure looks like the internal structure of an ant nest?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1225"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1225: We Don“t Have To Use Electromagnetic Waves</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Dr. Amos' field of research was in electrical engineering and neurology. He lived in a research institute on the basement floor of the Future Group with his daughter, who was still in elementary school.</br>
</br>
The neural bridging technology of Celestial Trade that enabled the human consciousness to directly connect with robots was one of his inventions. It even won the approval of a digitalized human from the twenty-second century. The technology played a pivotal role in Celestial Trade's space construction and mining field.</br>
</br>
Strictly speaking, his expertise was not compatible with Project 071, but geniuses always received many privileges. Jiang Chen often rewarded researchers who were invested in academic research and made outstanding contributions with more privileges.</br>
</br>
For example, Dr. Amos recently had a strong "interest" in aerospace and applied to join Project 071. Therefore, Jiang Chen immediately approved the decision.</br>
</br>
It was just that since the establishment of the project team, he seemed to be zoned out from the start. It was the first time he openly expressed his opinion.</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos stood up and said as he grew more excited.</br>
</br>
"We could make a bold assumption that 3.7 billion years ago, the entire northern hemisphere of Mars was still a sea. At that time, Mars was the world of arthropods. They fought each other and finally a special species... who had more arms, or smarter brains, in short... were vastly different, ended up at the top of the food chain. Much like our ancestors did."</br>
</br>
Everyone around the conference table, including Jiang Chen, watched the passionate Dr. Amos with the same stunned expression.</br>
</br>
"They used tens of thousands of years, or hundreds of thousands, or even millions, or tens of millions of years to end the great migration. They built a fire near a river and ignited the flames of the Stone Age. They were good at digging holes and more sensitive to ores than humans. They quickly moved from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and quickly moved toward the Iron Age."</br>
</br>
"Because of the collective consciousness and the restraint of reproduction, it may have taken them longer to be free from slavery and the matriarchal form of society compared to us. But in the endless struggle, they finally did it, they got rid of the old thoughts and finished the Renaissance Era. They eventually went through the Industrial Revolution, and entered the modern era, and may have gone further than us..."</br>
</br>
"The society made up of arthropods... that is ridiculous." The previous professor who refuted him, said in disbelief, "If they could go further than us, why have they never been here."</br>
</br>
"Maybe they have been," Amos shrugged. "It's just that you and I haven't noticed. The time scale of more than three billion years has gone beyond the reach of archaeologists. They may be older than the cyanobacteria from Archaean rocks of western Australia."</br>
</br>
"Indeed, we don't rule out this possibility." Hawking, who also did not speak previously, suddenly spoke up and stood on Dr. Amos's side. "Any species has the potential to evolve into a civilization. Especially in this magical universe, anything incredible can happen on the scale of billions of years."</br>
</br>
</br>
"I still can't believe we have enough evidence to prove that..."</br>
</br>
The table was divided into two sides. The conservatives thought that the discovery at Mine 071 was likely to be a natural phenomenon. It originated from large-scale volcanic activity two billion years ago. The spiral void was only formed after alkaline rocks were eroded by acidic groundwater, and the special mineral was only sprayed out from the inner mantle.</br>
</br>
The other side's perspective was bolder, or full of imagination. As Dr. Amos said, this spiral formation was not a natural phenomenon at all, but rather buildings of a civilization that humans could not understand.</br>
</br>
Or ruins.</br>
</br>
"We have to go down to find out." A scientist was rubbing his temples as he said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
"The drone can only reach six kilometers underground." The expression on Kelvin's face was somewhat helpless. "This also surprised us the most. The iron content in Martian soil is too high, and the target area may be a rich iron ore, causing the electromagnetic waves to be attenuated. We have increased the power of electromagnetic waves to the limit, but the size of the drone can only be so big... unless we build a communication base station below, but this is impossible."</br>
</br>
"Wired transmission?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"There is no equipment," Kelvin shook his head. "It is on Mars, not our lawn. It's not difficult to design a wired transmission detector, but Mars is now moving to apogee. If all goes well, we may only see what's inside Mine 071 next year."</br>
</br>
Wait until one year later.</br>
</br>
For aerospace research, waiting for one year may not be a problem. But waiting for a year to drop a detector may be too slow.</br>
</br>
Just when everyone was in deep thought, Dr. Amos spoke again.</br>
</br>
"Maybe we don't have to choose electromagnetic waves." Breaking the silence at the conference table, this time Amos looked at Jiang Chen and said in a subtle tone, "Electromagnetic wave communication may not be possible, but the thing I'm studying...may be possible."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this, he understood what he meant.</br>
</br>
That's right, electromagnetic waves can't do it, but it's not difficult for that thing to do it.</br>
</br>
Klein particles!</br>
</br>
Klein particle waves can transmit information through the fourth-dimension. If it can easily permeate through time's boundary, it can easily pass through a few kilometers underground.</br>
</br>
However, only Jiang Chen and Dr. Amos knew about Klein particles. Therefore, everyone else was completely confused by the phrase "maybe we don't have to choose electromagnetic waves".</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Kelvin had to ask.</br>
</br>
"Another Class-S confidential?" Dr. Amos shrugged. "Perhaps even higher."</br>
</br>
"Let's end today's meeting here." After understanding what Dr. Amos meant, Jiang Chen stood up and looked around the scholars and experts before stopping on Kelvin. "Come and see me after."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Kelvin nodded.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, Jiang Chen asked Amos to wait for him at the gate of the express train, then he walked with Kelvin.</br>
</br>
"Other members of the Earth Defense Alliance may have gotten some news, but it is nothing substantial. They may know something big is happening on Mars, but they're confused about the details."</br>
</br>
"You're worried..." Kelvin's eyes flickered.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded seriously. "Now is the moment we need to be united. Unnecessary suspicions may cause cracks in our alliance."</br>
</br>
"But we can't prove that Project 071 is connected to extraterrestrial civilization, telling them will do nothing except create more arguments." Kelvin smiled bitterly while he shook his head, "How did the information get leaked? The port? Or..."</br>
</br>
"Putting that problem aside. With the business activities of Celestial City increasing by the day, it's very difficult for such a large project to be completely disguised. Especially when we dispatched Marine Corps to Mars, it would be odd if no one suspected anything." Jiang Chen shook his head. "We must know what is hidden in that mine. If it's a treasure, then get it quickly. If it's just a pile of scraps, then clarify the misunderstanding."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen went on.</br>
</br>
"After you go back, I want you to do something right away."</br>
</br>
"Go ahead," Kelvin said immediately.</br>
</br>
"Transfer the command authority of the frontline working team of Project 071 directly to me, and I'll personally take command of the situation."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1226: Witnessing a Historical Momen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the meeting, Jiang Chen and Dr. Amos returned to the surface.</br>
</br>
Judging from his past experiences in Celestial Trade, it was his shortest trip on the orbit by far.</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the offshore platform of the space elevator, Jiang Chen directly used his authority and mobilized a military helicopter to bring him and Dr. Amos to Future Building.</br>
</br>
The helicopter landed directly on the tarmac of the roof.</br>
</br>
After they got off, Jiang Chen followed Dr. Amos and arrived at his institute.</br>
</br>
The glass door opened slowly. Amos rubbed his daughter's blond hair and said softly.</br>
</br>
"Milian, go play in your room."</br>
</br>
The little loli, who was drawing on the table got up and looked at Jiang Chen anxiously before she quickly ran back into her room with her drawing book.</br>
</br>
Amos walked to the lab with Jiang Chen. He reached out and clicked a few buttons on the holographic screen. Then, he took a helmet from an equipment that was blowing white smoke and handed it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Science is just so wonderful. With this helmet, we can share the same brain with the drones tens of millions of kilometers away."</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen took the eccentric-looking helmet, he looked at Dr. Amos with a puzzled expression.</br>
</br>
"Why did you send that drone to Mars?"</br>
</br>
"In order to prove the impact of the distance on the attenuation of the Klein particle wave signal, and the long-distance communication delay, all those exciting problems. Speaking of which, didn't you approve that batch of experimental equipment sent to Mars?" The young doctor looked at Jiang Chen and wondered.</br>
</br>
"...I seem to have forgotten." Jiang Chen awkwardly looked away.</br>
</br>
"Okay." Amos shrugged.</br>
</br>
The awkward topic ended.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen laid down on the chair, he put the helmet on and looked at the stream of data flashing in his field of view.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure you can get in touch with a drone on Mars as long as I wear this stuff?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, I experimented with this myself a month ago, and the result was quite spectacular." Dr. Amos' tone was relaxed. "Why don't I do this? I can't wait to see the remains of the former civilization."</br>
</br>
It was the moment to witness history. Jiang Chen, who had already put on the game helmet on, could not just easily give up this opportunity.</br>
</br>
His line of sight moved across the interface formed on his retina. He was familiarizing himself with the control while he asked Dr. Amos.</br>
</br>
"If I put on the helmet, how do I control it..."</br>
</br>
"No worries, non-human devices use the driver's perspective." Dr. Amos explained, "The helmet comes with a tutorial. As long as you know how to operate a power armor, there should be no problem operating this... how about… let me do this."</br>
</br>
"Allow me to refuse."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Mars.</br>
</br>
The door of the buffer compartment slowly opened, and a burly soldier quickly walked beside his cabinet and took out his kinetic skeleton and rifle.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Urgent mission."</br>
</br>
"Related to Mine 071?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, I'm really fed up... Carrying a heavy rifle, standing in the middle of the desert, and watching a group of researchers play with computers... I thought I came here to fight Martians. Where are the Martians? There is only sand here, and endless sandstorms?" A man with an English-accent complained while he clipped on his helmet.</br>
</br>
"Enough, Jim, if you're dissatisfied, complain to the psychiatrist. Now put on your helmet and close your mouth. If the Martians get out of the ground, I promise you will be in front." The captain already equipped stood in front of everyone and held his rifle. "Last check on oxygen tank, air pressure valve, and the weapon in your hands... are you ready?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, sir!"</br>
</br>
"Roll out!"</br>
</br>
Equipped inside the bulky aerospace kinetic skeleton, soldiers armed with Gaussian rifles ran out of the colony and entered a vehicle the size of a tank.</br>
</br>
Following behind the rover, a convoy that consisted of two vehicles traveled in the vast desert.</br>
</br>
The dim yellow light in the sky was as oppressive as the dusk of the apocalypse, there were even some hint of other colors mixed into the scattered ray. The communication channel was filled with annoying noisy static, which was equally as annoying as the endless dull yellow sand.</br>
</br>
"The gamma value is beyond the normal threshold and there is solar wind activity... The anti-radiation equipment has been checked, everything is normal." Wang Qiang examined the instruments on the rover and said with a grin.</br>
</br>
James, sitting in the co-pilot position and wearing heavy equipment, frowned and looked out the window.</br>
</br>
"Today is not suitable for a mission, I don't know what the command center thought."</br>
</br>
He was the deputy of Wang Qiang, a Canadian, who was once a geological engineer at Vale. After the bankruptcy of the Rothschild Bank, he was laid off by the company due to budget cuts. After he immigrated to Xin, he joined the Celestial Trade Solar Exploration Department and was deployed with the Marines a few months ago.</br>
</br>
It was the farthest place he has ever been in his life.</br>
</br>
"Were you thinking of drinking some coffee, in an air conditioned room, while relaxing?" Wang Qiang snorted. "Forget it and get ready to work. Today's work is easy, I can do it myself. Can you make me a cup of coffee?"</br>
</br>
The task was very simple; open the X-1101 box, Class- S confidential, and put the drone down the mine. Then, kill some time in the rover before the ground command center sends further instructions to tell them to return.</br>
</br>
To be honest, even after a few months, these colonists still anxiously wondered if Martians would storm out from underground, charge at them with laser guns, and tear them apart with their giant horns… It was not until they scrapped five drill bits to drill a hole five kilometers down, did all their worries disappear.</br>
</br>
If anyone else had a hole drilled through their roof, there would definitely be consequences.</br>
</br>
However, since they could still stay there and drink coffee, it was pretty obvious there were no Martians.</br>
</br>
They were scaring themselves.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang got out of the rover in a spacesuit and walked to the well with the suitcase. Then he placed the suitcase on the ground.</br>
</br>
He pulled a cable from the sleeve of the spacesuit and connected it to the suitcase. The safe application quickly accepted the security authorization and popped open the suitcase.</br>
</br>
He pursed his lips, took the fist-sized drone out of the box, and gently tapped on it with his finger.</br>
</br>
"Okay, little guy, we have to count on you now."</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1227"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1227: The Prehistoric Mars</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Okay, little guy, we have to count on you now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked speechlessly at the guy in the spacesuit as he released the drone. Then he began to control the spherical drone and flew down the well.</br>
</br>
Back on the rover, Wang Qiang took off his spacesuit in the buffer compartment and sat back into the driver's seat. James next to him was drinking coffee while watching the drone disappear down the well.</br>
</br>
"Intelligent?"</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang leaned back against his seat, then he took a sip of his coffee before he grinned.</br>
</br>
"What else? You think it's controlled remotely by the ground command center?"</br>
</br>
Even with hyper-light-speed communication based on quantum effects, the delays in communication was Mars and Earth was still in the thousands if not ten thousands milliseconds. The best way to put this into perspective would be like playing an online game where the character lagged by half a minute.</br>
</br>
Communication was not an issue, but it would be hysterical to control a drone.</br>
</br>
However, Wang Qiang did not know that the drone he released was not communicating based on electromagnetic waves, but based on a Klein particle communication chip embedded with crystal fragments...</br>
</br>
After the drone entered the well, it took about half an hour before the drone Jiang Chen controlled finally arrived at the bottom of the tunnel where the metal shell was drilled through.</br>
</br>
"Let's take some photos first..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pointed the camera at the hole, although the previous drone already photographed the scene, neither the resolution nor the lighting were comparable to the drone with the latest technology.</br>
</br>
While pressing the shutter, Jiang Chen controlled the drone and flew into the hollow layer with the spiral structure.</br>
</br>
The space of five kilometers was unexpectedly empty, at least emptier than the hologram concept map shown at the meeting. The spiral tunnels looked like a trunk, at every interval, the space extended to the surrounding and resembled leafs on the tree.</br>
</br>
All the "rooms" were empty, and nothing was there except for the build up of dirt.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen took a few photos of the rooms, he continued down.</br>
</br>
The spiral space was particularly long and extended down to a depth of ten kilometers. Here, the composition of the air changed slightly. Although it was still dominated by carbon dioxide, the oxygen content was much higher compared to before.</br>
</br>
"The Martian also breathed oxygen? This is a new discovery right?" Jiang Chen looked at the data on the drone and muttered.</br>
</br>
When he arrived at the last layer of the spiral tunnel, Jiang Chen passed through an open door, circular in shape, and slowly drifted into a spherical space.</br>
</br>
However, when he entered the spherical space, he felt slightly uneasy.</br>
</br>
This kind of uneasiness was like being watched by Death Claws, or Mud Crabs in the dark. The only difference was that his intuition told him that it was not hostile, it seemed to be purely observing him.</br>
</br>
</br>
He suddenly had a hunch that he had encountered a bit of an issue.</br>
</br>
"...I feel a little weird here. I'll get Amos."</br>
</br>
When he looked around the lines on the spherical space wall, the uneasiness in his mind grew stronger.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to interrupt the connection with the drone and change to Dr. Amos, a white light suddenly illuminated from underneath him, engulfing the entire space together along with the floating drone...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
He didn't know how long it took.</br>
</br>
Suddenly Jiang Chen opened his eyes and sat up from the ground.</br>
</br>
"Where am I?"</br>
</br>
He put his hand on his sore forehead, then slowly climbed up from the ground, stood up straight, and began to look around.</br>
</br>
A cool breeze blew in his face, and the air was fresh. It was not the ruins of Mars underground, nor the laboratory of Dr. Amos, but a wilderness – a place that resembled the African savanna.</br>
</br>
And he was no longer a drone.</br>
</br>
When he looked around, the entire land was golden, like a field of wheat. Under the gentle breeze, the wheat swayed freely. In the distance, there was a steep red clay wall. The mountains looked like they were cut by a giant machete, square, without any spectacular shape.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen squatted down and carefully observed the wheat under his feet.</br>
</br>
Although it looked like green foxtails, neither the color nor the shape matched the species in his memory.</br>
</br>
Just as he was studying the environment around him, a ball of light popped up form nowhere, and it cricled around him twice.</br>
</br>
"A mammal? Surprising."</br>
</br>
"Surprising?" Jiang Chen looked at the ball of light and carefully took two steps back, staring directly at it.</br>
</br>
Just when Jiang Chen was planning to ask it "who are you", he heard a faint sigh.</br>
</br>
"Yes. On Mars, mammals are like endangered species. I believe if one day you saw the tigers and lions in your zoo follow your appearence and action, and invent their own words, I'm afraid you'll be equally as surprised, if not more... If you use your language to describe this shock, it's probably this feeling."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process this information and suddenly realized something, he frowned.</br>
</br>
"Have you read my memory?"</br>
</br>
"Please forgive me for taking the liberty to. If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to communicate with you." The ball of light expressed its apology in a calm tone.</br>
</br>
"Well... can you tell me who you are?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"I'm a piece of memory," The light ball replied truthfully.</br>
</br>
"Memory? Is it similar to AI? A holographic image?" Jiang Chen still held a frown on his face.</br>
</br>
After the light ball was silent for a moment, it gave a very ambiguous response.</br>
</br>
"Yes and no. Similar, but there are differences."</br>
</br>
The light ball's words made Jiang Chen confused, and as he tried his best to understand the concept. He suddenly recalled that he had seen something similar.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin... No, precisely, it was Tingting, when he connected his spirit with the queen of the Harmony Civilization. As if he crossed the barrier of the dimension with the Brahma Colonization Ship, he was exiled to a strange universe, a strange planet, witnessing their culture, technology, society, and so on, moving in the wrong direction.</br>
</br>
It felt extremely similar.</br>
</br>
Just like his soul exiting his body, it felt like he crossed the distance between time and space and drifted away to another corner of the universe.</br>
</br>
He didn't know what words he could use to describe this wonderful feeling, and he didn't know how to express his astonished state.</br>
</br>
But he already knew what happened to him.</br>
</br>
If he were right.</br>
</br>
The land under his feet...</br>
</br>
Should be Mars from more than three billion years ago...</br>

</br>
It was Mars more than three billion years ago.</br>
</br>
The wind gusted around Jiang Chen as he looked at the endless wilderness, he was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Just then, the light ball next to him continued on.</br>
</br>
"See those rooms?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen organized the messy thoughts in his head and forcefully nodded.</br>
</br>
"I see them."</br>
</br>
"Those were originally full of works of art and valuable antiques. They recorded our tens of thousands of years of civilization. Before the apocalypse arrived, we tried everything in an attempt to leave something in this cold universe. Yet, as you can see, nothing in time is eternal."</br>
</br>
It seemed to be reminiscing about something, as the silence lingered for a long time.</br>
</br>
"What should I call you?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"We don't need a voice to communicate. Based on your language, you can call us Civilization of Gaia," The light ball said.</br>
</br>
Gaia?</br>
</br>
The mother of the gods in Greek mythology, the one that overruled the land, the most respected god among all gods. She was the first primitive god born in chaos and was worshipped as one of the original natural forces that created life.</br>
</br>
As for why it chose this word from the Earth Civilization to name its civilization, perhaps only it would know...</br>
</br>
"Well, Gaia? I'll call you Gaia." Jiang Chen turned to look at the light ball, then asked, "So Gaia, what are you going to do to me?"</br>
</br>
However, Gaia did not answer his question, but whispered.</br>
</br>
"Listen, it's about to start."</br>
</br>
Just as it finished its sentence, Jiang Chen suddenly noticed two strange monsters appear about 50 meters in front of him.</br>
</br>
He called them monsters because he had never seen such ugly insects.</br>
</br>
One was the size of a calf. Its back was full of scales, countless long legs grew out from its abdomen, and its swaying tail was like a chain, screaming in the air. The sharp teeth were like two pairs of sickles, and the hundreds of steel teeth in its mouth were like needles, sharp and bloodthirsty.</br>
</br>
The other monster was the size of a tiger. The two antennas on the top of its head were like tentacles. It was like a giant ant, except it had two more legs. The front half of its body was already in the air. Two spears made out of unknown substance pointed at the centipede-like beast.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the grass next to it moved.</br>
</br>
The soil collapsed and five "ants" ambushing underground suddenly snuck out, throwing their spear toward the centipede. The ants could easily support weight thirty times its body weight, so the spears were more like cannons as they easily penetrated the armor of the centipede, scattering its green blood all over the earth.</br>
</br>
The prey desperately tried to swing its chain-like tail, trying to escape from the attack of these "ants". However, with the organized attack of these "ants", the struggle was futile.</br>
</br>
Dust was flung into the air as the fight continued on.</br>
</br>
</br>
The prey gradually lost its strength due to the loss of blood. The strong arthropods moved forward, controlled the prey, and scraped its soft belly with sharp ore...</br>
</br>
Seeing this scene, Jiang Chen thought for a moment and asked.</br>
</br>
"Those are Gaia...s?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," the light ball shook. "Those hunters with spears are Gaias. And the beast that is armed to the teeth is one of the most dangerous creatures on the planet. Its bite force is probably five times that of the Death Claw."</br>
</br>
"You know about Death Claws?"</br>
</br>
"I did say I have seen your memory... Please don't be nervous, only you and I are here. And I, I'm just a piece of memory." The light ball read the caution in Jiang Chen's eyes as it softly explained.</br>
</br>
"Because of many factors including gravity and the environment, the mammals on this planet are weak. They are short and fragile, and are not even interesting enough for us to hunt. This planet used to be dominated by arthropods. All resources such as groundwater, minerals, and energy were also buried in the ground that could only be accessed by those who excel at digging."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the light ball in surprise.</br>
</br>
He was not surprised that the Mars depicted more than three billion years ago turned out to be a world ruled by insects, but he was surprised by the fact that Amos had guessed it all with purely his imagination.</br>
</br>
"We learned to use tools and finally stood at the top of the food chain. Even the most dangerous and bloodthirsty Devil Worm fell under our spears."</br>
</br>
"And our civilization started from this day."</br>
</br>
"We excavated our own Great Wall underground, use granite to reinforce our caves, use the hard shells of prey to make armor, and tied together branches and sharp stones to make spears; a Devil Worm's cub is the most delicious food. We built our own ranch underground. From that, we grew our own fungi, and developed our own civilization..."</br>
</br>
The Sun and the Moon rose and fell above them. The plants beneath them grew and died.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched as the mountain was flattened, the ravine was dug out from flat ground, and Gaias in armors crawled out from underground and charged at another group of Gaias. They rode Devil Worms and some other species he had never seen before, were dressed in armor, and charged at the enemy frontline</br>
</br>
The two forces collided and green blood splattered in the air.</br>
</br>
"Iron Age." The light ball whispered, "Our keen sense of minerals helped us find iron ore. When a prophet of our civilization perceived the iron-smelting technique, our civilization transitioned from the Stone Age to the most barbaric era, the Iron Age, at an incredible speed."</br>
</br>
The killing gradually stopped. When the last Gaia pulled its spear out from its same kind, it lifted up the blood-stained flag from the ground, shook the antennae on its head, and slammed its spear and flag together into this piece of land.</br>
</br>
"We don't have vocal cords, but in contrast, our brain is very developed. We rely on our antennae to communicate. Although more often, we rely on the spear in our hands."</br>
</br>
"All tribes were built around the female, and a tribe usually had only one female. Our antennae were antennas, and our neural signals can be directly converted into electromagnetic waves. We were born onto an invisible net, a net with the female at its core. For the same kind on different 'signal bands', our choice was usually war. Raid their cubs, livestock, kill their female, and occupy their nest."</br>
</br>
"Then we repeated the same fusion day after day, then repeated the same separation..."</br>
</br>
The Sun and the Moon continued to rise and fall, and the spear and flag were replaced by a stone monument. The battlefield previously covered with corpses was now covered by complicated tunnels with low-rise buildings and walls built.</br>
</br>
"Although we lived underground, due to being limited by tradition and belief, almost all of our wars were fought on the surface."</br>
</br>
"Even in the most difficult times, we were not willing to live on the surface. There was no interest in the sky, but the monument was an exception. We were keen on building monuments on the ground to commemorate the victory that once happened there. But that's it, we never stayed on the surface for too long."</br>
</br>
"In a sense, this tradition or belief was what restricted our exploration of the universe in later years. But if you ask if we regret our choice, our answer is no. We have never regretted it..."</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1229: Rise and Fall</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Sun and the Moon continued to rise and fall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that the countless monuments had collapsed, and the walls guarding the monuments were destroyed in the flames of war. However, the only constant was that the prosperous fires still grew with resiliency, and germinated in the Dark Age of blood and barbarism.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the light ball that had been silent for a while gently moved and started speaking.</br>
</br>
"I noticed that in your memory, the time of existence of your matriarchal society is very short. However, in our civilization, the matriarchal society only started to be challenged in the late Renaissance. However, it took us 20,000 years to go from the Dark Age to the Renaissance."</br>
</br>
20,000 years!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mouth twitched.</br>
</br>
It took 20,000 years to transition from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance... this is almost longer than the entirety of human civilization.</br>
</br>
"You may be surprised. 20,000 years is too long for any living creature, but this was simply because of living habits, there is nothing to elaborate on. There is nothing to see above. I will take you down," said the light ball.</br>
</br>
The scene gradually changed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched the soil at the bottom of his feet dissolve as the gravel collapsed downwards. He then watched himself sink to the ground, cross the distance of over 10,000 meters, and stand in an underground nest.</br>
</br>
He previously thought that it must be full of unordered, tynophobic holes, but to his surprise, he saw a spectacular stone-paved pavilion. Solemn and sacred, each brick and tile was built with the vibe of the civilization and its unique aesthetics.</br>
</br>
Markets, houses, barracks, all the functional facilities were connected by the tunnel to the central pavilion. Everything surrounded the mother nest and formed a three-dimensional city.</br>
</br>
He didn't know where every tunnel led to, and he didn't know what each Gaia was doing, but from their busy appearance, it was difficult to not feel the prosperity.</br>
</br>
"Whether it was a worker, a miner, a farmer, a soldier, or a civilian, they had gained the same power after the revolution, and enjoyed all the power from private assets to mating. The matriarchal society had come to an end, and the class structure that revolved around the mother eventually collapsed in the flame of Industrial Revolution."</br>
</br>
"We used steel and oil to create siege beasts. They were able to freely charge in the ground, rendering all fortifications useless. Even the devil worm was just like a cockroach in front of them. The cavalry completely exited from the stage of history. War returned to the barbaric three-dimensional era, we began to learn to arm ourselves with machines, to replace the weak parts of our body because of evolution, and to destroy our enemies in the most efficient way."</br>
</br>
"Although the barbarism did not change, in this era, any Gaia had the same power, and the concept of equality was deeply rooted in the hearts of our people. We wrote all of these into our code... If you came to me a billion years ago, maybe you could still see that stone monument, but now, nothing is left..."</br>
</br>
</br>
"And when all this came to a close, it was the beginning of prosperity."</br>
</br>
The mechanical centipede that agitated the earth disappeared, and the walls of the pavilion collapsed backwards. Thousands of spiral-like buildings, magnificent like work of arts, rose up in the darkness, stretching its branches in the depths of the ground, just like high-risers of human civilization...</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen finally understood what he found in Mine 071.</br>
</br>
All the backwardness of the matriarchal society ended and was replaced by a larger and greater empire. They completed the unification and connected all the cities together by rail and tunnel.</br>
</br>
After the tens of thousands of years of ignorance had passed, the Gaia civilization ushered in a golden age of prosperity and growth.</br>
</br>
"It's incredible..." Through the gravel, Jiang Chen stared blankly at the crowded "people" on the spiral high-rises.</br>
</br>
"I understand your astonishment, probably just like when I saw you appear in front of me." The light ball whispered, "If the revolution smashed the old thoughts, then the unification after the Industrial Revolution led our civilization into the golden age of prosperity. But this was not our best time. The truly best time was after a thousand years when we invented the nerve augmentation device."</br>
</br>
"The nerve augmentation device made the antennae on our heads more powerful, our 'sounds' can be transmitted to more distant places. If you find it difficult to understand, you can compare its meaning to your Internet."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He understood the analogy.</br>
</br>
After all, he didn't have antennae, and he didn't know how to turn his thoughts into electromagnetic waves. The golden age that Gaia said was probably the same as the Internet era that Earth civilization entered at the end of the twentieth century.</br>
</br>
The nerve augmentation device for Gaia was probably equivalent to the Phantom helmet for humans.</br>
</br>
All needs could be met through virtual reality, all individuals were unprecedentedly happy.</br>
</br>
"If you want me to summarize the differences between the two civilizations as someone who has been dead for 3.7 billion years, I think it is probably an understanding of the word happiness. When we entered the 'nerve augmentation era', our spiritual needs were met with unprecedented satisfaction, and the only reason we were still unsatisfied was probably due to our obsession of metal."</br>
</br>
"I remember I said that we were extremely sensitive to the smell of minerals and ores. This sensitivity had not change in tens of thousands of years; we were immersed in the happiness surrounded by metal. The pursuit, or the greed of all metals was probably the driving force behind the progress of our civilization."</br>
</br>
"And this greed turned into a deadly poisonous wine at the end."</br>
</br>
The tone of the light ball was mixed with some emotion as it continued to narrate the story.</br>
</br>
"A poisonous wine?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes," the light ball swayed gently. "I will take you and you will understand."</br>
</br>
Over the thousands of years, the scene changed again.</br>
</br>
There was a ripple in the air and Jiang Chen followed the light ball. Jiang Chen crossed a transparent film and came to a spherical space made entirely of metal. In this spherical space, a machine with strange shapes was connected by an alloy skeleton.</br>
</br>
"It's hard to feel just by looking," The light ball said softly. "We are now standing on the core of Mars, and this Planetary Furnace is the greatest technological crystallization of our civilization."</br>
</br>
"The Planetary… Furnace?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen swallowed hard.</br>
</br>
He couldn't imagine how the species, called Gaia, actually dug through the planet 3.7 billion years ago! Not be mention transforming the entire Mars core into a furnace for smelting iron or other minerals and turning the entire planet into their factory.</br>
</br>
Planetary Furnace.</br>
</br>
The word madness is not enough to describe their behavior...</br>
</br>
The light ball continued while it looked calmly at the shock on Jiang Chen's face,</br>
</br>
"Our industry was very developed. When the surface can't satisfy our appetite. We dugged down into the mantle. When the mantle was not enough to meet our needs, we aimed at the core. The core was rich in mineral deposits. It was an iron ocean in here, even if we only drew a little bit from it, it was enough to make our civilization take a big step forward..."</br>
</br>
As it spoke, the light ball paused and sighed softly.</br>
</br>
"But you also know that once something takes the first step, it will never be able to stop."</br>
</br>
"Time has weathered everything, and turned what we forged over hundreds of centuries into iron filings. Have you seen the sand outside? Every rusted gravel is the tears of Gaia... "</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at everything that was happening in front of his eyes and was silent for a long time.</br>
</br>
After a while, he finally squeezed out a question.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you go to the other planets? If you can reach even the core, it shouldn't be difficult to get out of this planet."</br>
</br>
"I have to correct your point of view. Not everyone is looking forward to the sky," The light ball said in a calm tone, "We are more willing to explore downwards, and the solar system was quite young at the time. Young means barren."</br>
</br>
"In fact, from long ago, we also tried to explore the sky above us, but no one wanted to leave this piece of land. We would rather stay in the cave for a lifetime than to stay on the surface for a second too long, let alone the more distant universes. We have no tradition of traveling far away, all our traditions, beliefs and cultures revolve around our mines."</br>
</br>
"We took the metal of the core and replaced the geomagnetic field with a magnetic generating device. However, when we tried to use the power of the entire planet to create the strongest metal, it caused a terrible disaster."</br>
</br>
"The magnetic field of Mars disappeared, and the solar wind blew away our atmosphere. The plants withered and lives vanished. The ecological reserves that we built on the surface for centuries were destroyed in an instant. Under the radiation, countless of our kind passed away in sickness. Everything happened so suddenly, so suddenly that we were not prepared."</br>
</br>
"At the start of the apocalypse, we put all the works of art, antiques, and anything that can prove that we existed in this building."</br>
</br>
"But in the end, it seems that only the building itself lasted."</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for a long time.</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Jiang Chen said softly.</br>
</br>
"This is regretful."</br>
</br>
"Regretful?" The light ball seemed to be smiling and even Jiang Chen did not know why he felt this way. "In fact, when the apocalypse was coming, we felt everything except regretful."</br>
</br>
"I have said, we are frivolous about minerals, obsessed with metal. In the end, we created the strongest and most powerful metal in nature, and its existence even exceeds our definition of metal... although we have exhausted our final fate, it is in some ways the perfect ending to us."</br>
</br>
The tone of the light ball was very peaceful, and every note was calm; even till the last moment. To him, it was not an elegy of civilization, but just an ancient story.</br>
</br>
That was it.</br>
</br>
"We have no other wishes, nor requests. The last Gaia passed away peacefully in this hall. Our only wish is to hope that you can remember that in this universe, there used to be this civilization."</br>
</br>
"You have passed on our memories, and I must give you a gift in appreciation."</br>
</br>
"If our knowledge can help you solve the problems you are facing, please take it freely."</br>
</br>
"The door is below your feet. As for the key, we stored it in a spacecraft and placed it in the orbit of Mars. Since you can get here from the distant Earth, it should not be difficult to find it. "</br>
</br>
</br>
"It is a sphere that weighs a hundred kilograms. It is the crystallization of the Gaia civilization."</br>
</br>
Having said that, the light ball sounded relieved.</br>
</br>
"It's all over and I can finally rest. Perfect, my time is almost up."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hurriedly asked, "Wait, that strong interaction material, how did you—"</br>
</br>
"That thing? We call it planetary forging technology." The ball gradually dimmed, but the sound from it was as calm as ever.</br>
</br>
"Planet forging technology?" Jiang Chen was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
"Even if we had a lot of time, it's very cumbersome to explain. So don't think about it. In order to make that ball, we've almost exhausted all the strength of our civilization..."</br>
</br>
The sound from the light ball was weakened to an extreme; it was like a dying candle flickering in the wind.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was about to ask a few other things, everything around him began to collapse.</br>
</br>
With the fading world, the light ball gradually turned into light particles. With the last memory of the Gaia civilization, he fell into the bottomless darkness.</br>
</br>
Staring at the darkness that gradually drifted away, Jiang Chen suddenly began to question himself.</br>
</br>
Just like the emptiness, it not only engulfed the memory of the Gaia civilization, but also the universe...</br>
</br>
If the core is the end of the Gaia civilization, then where is the end of human civilization?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"No, it's really not me, I didn't do anything," with a cold barrel against the back of his head. Dr. Amos frantically typed in front of the computer. "Weird, how could it be? All the data is normal, but the drone is gone! The signal is lost? Hell!"</br>
</br>
Ayesha aimed a pistol at Dr. Amos as she looked coldly at the doctor in the white coat.</br>
</br>
Behind her stood a team of heavily armed soldiers that were holding Reaper Assault Rifles. The black tactical helmet blocked their eyes, but could not block their murderous vibe.</br>
</br>
"What if I unplug the power supply?" Ayesha said coldly.</br>
</br>
"It may have unpredictable consequences for the brain. I advise you not to do that..." Dr. Amos said while sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
A desire to kill flashed in Ayesha's eyes as her thumb moved to the safety.</br>
</br>
"Please, don't do this..." Amos's tone was mixed with pleading.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents stood behind him and the door was guarded by the most powerful special force in Celestial Trade. They were all people that didn't blink when they killed, and these guys only recognize one person, the person currently in the chair.</br>
</br>
Who would have thought that Jiang Chen would be unconscious in his lab for three days! Jesus Christ, he tried the device on himself countless times and never experienced a problem. The one time something happened, Jiang Chen was the one wearing the device?</br>
</br>
Could it be because of the remains of that civilization? But it was tens of millions of kilometers from here!</br>
</br>
God, if he knew this would happen, he would never have dared to let Jiang Chen witness history with the helmet. He would much rather something happened to himself since he still has Millian...</br>
</br>
"Dr. Amos, I heard that you are from Frankberg."</br>
</br>
"Yes... but I swear to God that I have nothing to do with the Freemasonry or the Kurofune. Damnit, I came to Xin because I wanted to distance myself away from those things. If you don't believe me..."</br>
</br>
Dr. Amos was going to say, "If you don't believe me, you can ask your husband," but looking at the still motionless Jiang Chen, he swallowed the sentence back down.</br>
</br>
Angering the lioness would only make the situation worse...</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry that I am not a Christian. Now you are suspected of murdering the president of Celestial Trade. If you can't give me a reasonable explanation, I am afraid you can only explain it to God," Ayesha said slowly, word by word.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu stood next to Ayesha and was silent.</br>
</br>
While she was also worried about Jiang Chen, she was also surprised.</br>
</br>
She always thought that her instructor was a relatively emotionless, cold-blooded woman, but she did not expect that she would be angry and irrational because of someone else.</br>
</br>
"Ahem..."</br>
</br>
Just then, a cough came from the corner of the room.</br>
</br>
Every pair of eyes focused on the source of the sound.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slowly sat up from the chair, reached out, and took off the helmet on his head. He shook his sore head, met the eyes that were focused on him, and suddenly felt confused.</br>
</br>
"You are... what happened?"</br>
</br>
"You're finally awake..." Amos looked at the muzzle that moved away from his head and collapsed in his chair while feeling completely exhausted. With his last strength, he joked. "If you were two seconds late, your wife might have already sent me to see God."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1231: Awakened Monsters</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It turned out to be a misunderstanding.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents and special forces quickly left the scene.</br>
</br>
After about half an hour, Jiang Chen comforted Ayesha's emotions in the room next door, then asked her to go home first and wait for him after he reassured her that he would not use the machine again. Finally, Ayesha left, and Jiang Chen returned to the lab. Then he looked apologetically at Amos who was sitting there drinking coffee.</br>
</br>
"Ummm... I apologize about Ayesha."</br>
</br>
"No worries," Amos waved his hand. "I can understand how she felt. On the day my wife passed away, I almost went crazy. I didn't regain the meaning of life until the doctor showed up with Millan in front of me."</br>
</br>
"...I haven't died yet."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, sorry." Amos looked away awkwardly while he touched his noise, "Yes, what happened to you in that room? I only saw a white light and then I lost connection with the drone."</br>
</br>
"You can't believe what I saw." There was a mysterious smile on Jiang Chen's face. "I saw Mars 3.7 billion years ago and an ancient civilization that existed for nearly 100,000 years. This is going to be a long story. Do you have anything to eat here? I am a little hungry. Let's talk while eating..."</br>
</br>
After all, it was one of the most well funded laboratories of the Future Group. Dr. Amos had plenty of food here.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ate five sandwiches wrapped in cabbage and ham before he felt some warmth in his stomach. While responding to Dr. Amos' astonished look, he reached for the beer and ham leg. As he devoured the food, he talked about what he saw during the past three days.</br>
</br>
The lunch was over an hour long.</br>
</br>
"I see." After Dr. Amos listened to Jiang Chen's narration, he let out a sigh, leaned back against his chair, while he exclaimed at the ceiling.</br>
</br>
"Why are you sighing?"</br>
</br>
"I was wondering if we could pass the Great Filter," Dr. Amos smiled. "The destruction of the Gaia civilization unfortunately provided arguments for Fermi's Paradox. Even the civilization that was powerful enough to dig through the planet was erased by time."</br>
</br>
"So, we have a long way to go," Jiang Chen wiped his mouth with a napkin and shrugged with an indifferent look on his face. "I am used to solving the problems at hand before thinking about more distant problems."</br>
</br>
Tens of thousands of years is too far away.</br>
</br>
Even then, when the Earth civilization is facing life and death, it's not up to him to worry about.</br>
</br>
"True, these things are indeed too distant," Dr. Amos leaned back in his chair and smiled. "How are you going to deal with this problem?"</br>
</br>
"The 'key' is here with me, and it will be sent to Mars along with the next batch of supplies."</br>
</br>
"I don't think it'll be easy to dig out that site," Dr. Amos thought. "With the current size of the Mars colony, I'm afraid we don't have the ability to carry out such a large project."</br>
</br>
"I know, so we have to speed up," Jiang Chen opened his watch and gently pushed a holographic screen in front of Dr. Amos. "In fact, Celestial Trade prepared a project plan already but now everything is all ahead of schedule."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Tiangong City Plan?" Looking at the words, Dr. Amos was intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Yes--"</br>
</br>
At this moment, the [Warning] icon suddenly appeared on the holographic screen and flashed with a piercing light.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and looked at Dr. Amos, who was equally confused. They both saw the same disbelief.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"How long do we have to wait?"</br>
</br>
James frowned while he sipped on his coffee as he gazed out at the unchanging desert in the rover.</br>
</br>
Three days had passed, and no news came from underground..</br>
</br>
Although a rover typically stored a week of supplies, and they could sleep and shower on the rover, it was quite boring to just wait. Compared to zoning out in front of the sand and a well, he would much rather stay in the colony</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang grinned. "I think it's fine that nothing is happening. Perhaps after we finish the remaining coffee we can—"</br>
</br>
At this moment, the sound of the ground trembling came from beneath.</br>
</br>
The two looked at each other with questions in their eyes..</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang placed the coffee down and put down his legs as he looked out the window with a frown.</br>
</br>
"What's that sound?"</br>
</br>
"An earthquake?"</br>
</br>
"Impossible, the geological activity of Mars is quite stable – SH*T!"</br>
</br>
A cloud of dust was sent up in the air!</br>
</br>
The chassis was hit hard, and it felt like the rover was hit by a shell. It was immediately tossed, and it spun several times before finally stopping.</br>
</br>
A centipede-like monster crawled out of the sand dunes, revealing its menacing figure.</br>
</br>
In everyone's horrified expression, it opened its sickle-like mouth and it was filled with countless sharp needle-like teeth as it let out a screeching scream. The armor on its body reflected a deathly vibe under the dim daylight</br>
</br>
A Devil Worm!</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen was here, he would be screaming out loud, because it was too close to what he saw in the memory of Gaia civilization! It was clearly a species from 3.7 billion years ago, why did it appear here?</br>
</br>
"Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"</br>
</br>
While they were surprised, the soldiers near the armored vehicle reacted immediately. The Gauss rifle in their hand flashed with white light, and the bullets that accelerated faster than the speed of sound exploded and created green blood splutters on the monster's body.</br>
</br>
There was a painful moan, and its chain-like tail whipped in the soldiers' direction, lifting up more sand.</br>
</br>
Its head slammed to the ground as it tried to escape.</br>
</br>
At this time, the large cannon on the vehicle finally locked on to the giant centipede-like monster, firing off its deadly firepower!</br>
</br>
The orange-yellow trajectory flew over the desert of Mars and shredded the resilient Devil Worm countless times. Dark green blood splashed into air, dripped on the sand and gave off a sizzling sound.</br>
</br>
Finally, the visible half of the body of the Devil Worm that had already began to drill back into the sand dunes, fell powerlessly on the sand...</br>
</br>
"Nathan, go check on the rover and help our engineers. Lee, you take the hook lock on the car and tie it to the monster. Be careful of its blood, I think it contains some kind of strong corrosive organic acid."</br>
</br>
The captain put down his rifle and gestured the soldiers behind him with a warning signal, then he looked at the monster with a frown as he cussed.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, what is this?"</br>
</br>
"Martian?"</br>
</br>
"I remember someone made a flag before we went to work. Who was it?"</br>
</br>
"Jim!" With a grin, Lee tied up the monster and snorted. "I still remember the idiot-"</br>
</br>
He did not finish his sentence before the sand exploded again!</br>
</br>
Another Devil Worm crawled out from the ground and sent the soldier walking back flying. Its sickle-like teeth instantly collapsed and created a bloody rain in the air.</br>
</br>
"LEE!" The captain's eyes widened, enraged, as he pointed at the new monster that just appeared. "Open fire! FIRE!"</br>
</br>
The bullets began flying again in the desert, accompanied by the Devil Worm's screams.</br>
</br>
The earth shook like warm water that had began to boil. It was as if something was brewing.</br>
</br>
In the depths of the unknown underground, three billion years of sleep was disturbed, and ancient creatures were waking up. Those who finally discovered these distant guests began to regain the hunting tradition engraved in their genes.</br>
</br>
Obviously, there was more than one monster!</br>
</br>
"We lost Mine 071, abandon Suitcase X-1101, all units evacuate immediately! I repeat! Evacuate Immediately!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1232: Level-one Alarm!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The sky gradually darkened, and the surface temperature of Mars also dropped.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade's rover left with the "centipede's body"; the rover that got flipped around was left there.</br>
</br>
Two Devil Worms crawled out from underground and they used their sickle-like teeth to touch the rover. They then realized that it was inedible and returned into the ground.</br>
</br>
The two people who didn't dare to breathe inside the vehicle looked at each other and saw the same fear.</br>
</br>
The entire car was flipped over with its four wheels pointed up.</br>
</br>
Unfastening the seat belt across their chest, the two fell from their seats onto the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang had a hard time turning himself over. After he managed to throw this body around, he reached to the interface of the rover and pressed a few buttons. James crawled cautiously to the window and peeked out.</br>
</br>
"Are they gone?" While Wang Qiang operated the interface, he grunted and said, "Damn, it's so hard to operate this...got it!"</br>
</br>
The console's system restarted and the blue light particles converged on the holographic screen. Rows of dazzling lines floated in front of Wang Qiang's eyes and the glaring light made him blink a few times.</br>
</br>
"It's gone, but I'm not sure if they will come back." James took a deep breath and moved his eyes away from the window. Then he leaned against the wall of the cabin and put his hands around his head. "Damn, what's with those bugs outside?"</br>
</br>
Everything happened so unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
Almost without warning, the entire rover was knocked over by the "centipede". His forehead was still bruised by the coffee cup that was sent flying.</br>
</br>
"Who knows. Maybe we have been messing around this place too much and disturbed their sleep? Or the little guy we sent down made them mad," While concentrating on the holographic screen, Wang Qiang grunted. "Thank god. Their teeth are still not sharp enough... The chassis has been bent, but no damage to the fuel tank or the engine. The air conditioning system is normal, and the oxygen content here is sufficient... Fresh water and food can last us two weeks; the situation is very optimistic. However, the antenna on the roof is broken."</br>
</br>
"Can you turn the rover over?" James asked.</br>
</br>
"You are joking, man." Wang Qiang laughed and turned off the holographic screen, he then just lied flat on the ceiling.</br>
</br>
In order to offer protection from sandstorms, and at the same also include life, research, communications and other facilities, the tonnage of the rover was naturally high.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, the rover not much lighter than an armored vehicle would be impossible to flip over. But once the rover was indeed knocked over, it would be a difficult task to get it back on its wheels.</br>
</br>
"Let me think about it. We might need a crane, or a superhuman." Wang Qiang shook his head, pressed the button next to the window, lowered the alloy folding window, and leaned back on the wall inside the cabin, "I feel neither situation is very reliable right now."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Are we abandoned?" James gulped as he forced out these words.</br>
</br>
"No way, just wait for the rescue team. Celestial Trade has never left anybody."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang was absolutely convinced.</br>
</br>
What's more, even if it was not for them, the headquarters would still never abandon them for the alien relics in Mine 071.</br>
</br>
The instant Wang Qiang saw the bugs, he once again confirmed the idea that everyone rejected.</br>
</br>
Below Mine 071 was not a natural igneous vein.</br>
</br>
It was the remains of Martians!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade Space Defense Force headquarters activated the level-one alarm.</br>
</br>
It was the first time this has happened since the establishment of the Space Defense Force.</br>
</br>
Armed in 30 seconds and converged in 30 seconds.</br>
</br>
The Marine Corp soldiers in kinetic skeletons jogged through the suspension ladder, gathered on the track connecting the Seagull-class transport ship and the port, and entered the lifts in batches. Under the effect of electromagnetic propulsion, the lifts followed the track and moved to the transport ship.</br>
</br>
In just ten minutes, a thousand Marines were ready for deployment and entered the hibernation chamber. The mechanical arm connected to the bridge of Seagull withdrew and all crew members entered battle position. The captain was inside the command center, waiting for the order to set sail.</br>
</br>
Outside the headquarters of Celestial Trade, there were intensive footsteps moving toward the conference room.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" The commander of Celestial Trade Space Defense Force quickly caught up to Kelvin's footsteps and followed him as he lowered his voice and asked, "My soldiers are ready, but where is our enemy?"</br>
</br>
"Our colony was attacked." Kelvin did not slow down as he responded while also lowering his voice.</br>
</br>
The commander subconsciously said.</br>
</br>
"The UA?"</br>
</br>
"No, the situation is worse," Kelvin replied with deep concerns in his eyes, "It's aliens."</br>
</br>
The meeting began, and almost all the top executives of the Celestial Trade Space Department and the Space Defense Department gathered here.</br>
</br>
The seat at head of the table was empty; it belonged to Jiang Chen. Because he was on the surface, he had to video conference in.</br>
</br>
Kelvin placed a document on the table, looked at officers and executives around the table and quickly articulated.</br>
</br>
"Long story short, our Mars colony was attacked by unknown creatures, suspected to be prehistoric species, for unknown reasons. A Marine Corps soldier died in battle, a rover car rolled over near Mine 071 with two Future Mining employees onboard. The Marine Corps soldiers were forced to withdraw because they were not aware of the number of enemy units."</br>
</br>
"Based on the remains of unidentified creatures brought back by the frontline soldiers, the biotech researchers at the colony completed a dissection. We temporarily named this creature–"</br>
</br>
"Devil Worm," Jiang Chen interrupted Kelvin's words and responded to the eyes that were focused on him. Then he said calmly, "Number X-1101 project, confidentiality class-S. The specific details cannot be explained. In short, we used a special detection equipment and observed the ruins of Mine 071."</br>
</br>
"It is now confirmed that Devil Worms are a species of large arthropods that were active in the Mars mantle to the crust area 3.7 billion years ago. They are carnivores, and the reasons for its survival till now are unknown. It is suspected that it may be related to a prehistoric civilization."</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen finished this sentence, he was met with the shocked responses of all the executives and officers. While they looked astonished, there were concerns and disbeliefs shared around the table.</br>
</br>
Including Kelvin who was personally involved in Project 071, everyone was stunned by the facts Jiang Chen gave.</br>
</br>
Species from 3.7 billion years ago?</br>
</br>
How can it be!</br>
</br>
God knows how they lived for so long.</br>
</br>
"Everyone."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's voice silenced all the chatters in the room.</br>
</br>
Scanning everyone present, he ordered in a calm and unquestionable tone.</br>
</br>
"Now the security of the entire colony is threatened, and the existence of Devil Worms has seriously hampered our 'Tiangong City Plan'."</br>
</br>
"The war has begun."</br>
</br>
"I ask you to immediately develop an operational plan to reinforce our colony."</br>
</br>
"Suppress those bugs at all costs!"</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Have you read the newspaper?"</br>
</br>
With a plate of food, Xia Shiyu, who had already changed into her professional attire, smiled at Jiang Chen, sat down beside him, and placed several newspapers on the table.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen glanced at the cover of the newspapers, he laughed. It was a face he is too familiar with.</br>
</br>
After all, he saw it every day in the mirror.</br>
</br>
"I made headlines again?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put down the fork and lazily reached to grab a newspaper.</br>
</br>
His eyes swept the title. It seemed to catch him by surprise as he almost spat out the oatmeal in his mouth.</br>
</br>
Just then, softness engulfed the back of his head and the luscious hair that smelled great swept across the tip of his nose.</br>
</br>
Natasha hugged Jiang Chen's neck from the back and moved her face closer to the newspaper. Then she read out the content in the newspaper with great interest.</br>
</br>
"'...Celestial Trade's Spaceship mobilized during an emergency, the target is Mars!'... Hey? Are you making a movie?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"Move, don't you see Jiang Chen is troubled?" Ayesha, who just came out of the kitchen, looked at Natasha who was stuck to Jiang Chen's back, and let out a sigh. She rubbed one of her eyes that were surrounded in dark circles while she used the other hand to put the plate filled with salad and sliced toast on the table.</br>
</br>
Obviously, she didn't rest well last night.</br>
</br>
As for what happened, well...there was no need to elaborate.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because Ayesha always schooled Natasha in combat, Natasha listened to Ayesha most of the time. She pouted and reluctantly let Jiang Chen go. Then she grabbed a newspaper and sat down. She began drinking some coffee as she continued to read.</br>
</br>
"Alien vs. Soldiers? Or the prelude to Star Wars? The Mars scientific expedition team was attacked by giant aliens while searching for water resources, and a Celestial Trade Marine Corps soldier was seriously injured... This is the New York Times, next is Reuters."</br>
</br>
"Reuters' reporters applied to follow Celestial Trade Marine Corps but they were rejected. The situation on Mars is likely to be more serious than expected. Tiangong City Plan may go bankrupt? It is recommended that British investors carefully consider the investment environment on Mars ... Oh, this is also not a simple issue."</br>
</br>
Natasha put down the newspaper, then glanced at Jiang Chen with a sly face.</br>
</br>
"It's okay," Jiang Chen said as he stuffed the toast into his mouth. "These are common tricks used by reporters. Exaggerate things to make things bigger than they seem, gain enough people's attention and then use 'follow-up reports' to restore the truth."</br>
</br>
Tiangong City Plan to go bankrupt?</br>
</br>
What kind of international joke is this?</br>
</br>
The supplies and equipment needed for the next colony expansion left almost at the same as the thousand soldiers in hibernation. In addition, a hundred ground explosive bombs were also on board to target the Devil Worms' nests.</br>
</br>
</br>
After two generations of upgrades to the engine of the Seagull-class Transport Ship, the new TS Seagull was already capable of traveling between the Mars orbit and Celestial City. The journey to Mars was no longer a one-way ticket. It was also the reason why Jiang Chen had the courage to make the decision to send a thousand soldiers to Mars.</br>
</br>
One thousand Marines, on the one hand, was to kill the Devil Worms, while on the other hand, it was to cover up the excavation works of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
"I'm full." Natasha put down the coffee and stood up with her plate. Then she looked at Jiang Chen who was still masticating slowly, "I'm heading to the Russian Embassy. Are there any words I need to bring for you?"</br>
</br>
"No, the call will probably come soon anyway."</br>
</br>
Almost as soon as he finished the sentence, Jiang Chen's watch began to ring.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up to Natasha, who also looked amazed.</br>
</br>
What a coincidence?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The call was indeed from the allies of the Earth Defense Alliance. However, it was not from Moscow but from Shangjing.</br>
</br>
"...I read the newspaper this morning."</br>
</br>
"I also read it. Is something wrong?" Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Nothing." Wu Changfeng forced an awkward laugh and paused for a moment before he continued. "I heard that there is a problem with your Mine 071?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, our people were originally drilling for groundwater there, but a bug crawled out instead." Jiang Chen sighed and said in a heavy and serious tone, "We have sent reinforcements to the colony. A thousand soldiers should reach the synchronous orbit within two weeks,."</br>
</br>
Two weeks!</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng's eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
If he rememberes correctly, the number was still more than a month half a year ago! And Mars was much closer to Earth than it is now.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade's advancement in aerospace technology is simply astounding.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that there was no sound from the other side, so he asked.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng hid the astonishment in his head as he coughed and asked.</br>
</br>
"Nothing. I just want to ask on behalf of Hua if you need reinforcements. After all, when we signed the Earth Defense Alliance Treaty and swore to be on the same frontline when dealing with the threat of extraterrestrial civilization. If you need it, Hua is willing to send infantry to assist your Marines."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen listened to Wu Changfeng's proposal, he smiled and rejected with gratitude, "No, we can solve this little problem by ourselves. And it's still unclear whether Devil Worms can be called extraterrestrial civilization. After all, it seems to us that they are just a group of dangerous beasts."</br>
</br>
"Then...</br>
</br>
"I know what you are worried about," Jiang Chen said in a calm tone and interrupted Wu Changfeng's words,"Don't worry, at the end of this month, the specimen of Devil Worm will be sent back to Celestial City. We will host a summit which will fully disclose the research progress of Mars species to the international community."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and said the words that Wu Changfeng had been waiting for.</br>
</br>
"At that time, we would like to welcome your scientists to Celestial Trade to participate in the summit and collaborate in the research!"</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng was overjoyed and he laughed.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, Mr. Jiang!"</br>
</br>
In fact, his seemingly informal phone call was also instructed by the people at the top the night before.</br>
</br>
After all, he was just a major general of the army. He could not just send reinforcements based on his will.</br>
</br>
The reason why he proposed to send reinforcements was not to actually send soldiers to the battlefield tens of millions of kilometers away, but to subtly hint at Jiang Chen the covenant they established together for the Earth Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
All relevant information on extraterrestrial civilization should be shared without reservation between major member states. It was one of the reasons why Hua and Russia were willing to make some concessions to their own interests in international affairs and firmly stand on the same front as Xin.</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng was most worried that Celestial Trade may stay in the grey area on the definition of an extraterrestrial civilization. After all, only Celestial Trade could send people to Mars in this world. The entire route was monopolized, and even if they were dissatisfied, they did not have any other options.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words undoubtedly dismissed his concerns, which would allow him to respond to his boss.</br>
</br>
What Wu Changfeng didn't know was that the specimen of the Devil Worm was nothing but a bait to switch the attention of the international community.</br>
</br>
As for the memory of the Gaia civilization, and the ruins hidden under Mine 071... Jiang Chen would never leak a word before Celestial Trade completely uncovered its real treasure.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1234: Power is A Glass of Poisoned Wine</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After the call with Wu Changfeng, it didn't take long before Frankberg and Moscow's calls arrive.</br>
</br>
It was still the same rhetoric, Jiang Chen promised these two allies that "a biotechnology summit will be held to disclose the research progress of the Devil Worms", "your scientists are invited to participate in joint research" and a series of other benefits before the allies walked away happily.</br>
</br>
The allies' excited tone made Jiang Chen feel ashamed.</br>
</br>
Of course, he was ashamed for at most a second or two before he tossed the matter out of his head.</br>
</br>
After breakfast, Natasha went to the Russian Embassy, ​​Xia Shiyu drove to work as usual, and Ayesha went to the Ghost Agents Headquarters; only Jiang Chen was left in the mansion.</br>
</br>
Back to the office, Jiang Chen sat down and turned on the holographic screen on his watch.</br>
</br>
"Call Lin Lin."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Jean's holographic figure blinked and soon scattered back into countless light particles before it was reorganized into a holographic screen and connected to Lin Lin's laboratory.</br>
</br>
When Lin Lin picked up the call, she held an electronic welding torch in her hand.</br>
</br>
Behind her was a bare doll with its chest cavity wide open. From the giant hole, he could vaguely see the exposed wires and circuit boards. As early as two months ago, she procrastinated on the cyborg based on Jiang Chen's instructions, now it was finally almost finished.</br>
</br>
After she tossed the torch aside, Lin Lin sat straight down with one hand supporting her chin and looked at Jiang Chen on the screen.</br>
</br>
"It's really strange that you called me so early in the morning. Just be straightforward."</br>
</br>
"There is indeed something..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried to arrange his thoughts in his head, then used words as simple as he could to explain what he saw with the drone yesterday in Mine 071, the ruins, and the last memory of the Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
Because there was a lot of information, Jiang Chen took about half an hour to explain everything clearly.</br>
</br>
After she had listened to Jiang Chen's description of Gaia civilization, Lin Lin's mouth opened and she was clearly astonished.</br>
</br>
"Gaia civilization? Devil Worms? I have never heard of it..."</br>
</br>
"Have you not heard the news about the development of Mars before the war?" Jiang Chen frowned and asked with confusion, "I remember you once said that Pan-Asia Cooperation, the Soviet Union, and NATO have all established their own Mars station..."</br>
</br>
Before the war, the three major forces had developed limited resources on Mars, but for some odd reasons, the development only stayed in the realm of scientific research. They did not build a self-sufficient colony on Mars, nor did they attempt to develop the minerals of Mars...</br>
</br>
But even so, Pan-Asia Cooperation, the Soviet Union, and NATO, the Big Three who dominated the 22nd century, had no reason to not discover the secrets on Mars.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Maybe, but this kind of information won't be disclosed to ordinary people, right?" Lin Lin rolled her eyes and looked at Jiang Chen with an "I thought you knew" expression and said, "You think I am an encyclopedia. Do you? I know just a bit more than the ordinary person."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin once said that she had read her father's research materials.</br>
</br>
The parts she was more knowledgeable in were basically based on her father's computer and data.</br>
</br>
Obviously, Dr. Lin's research field was beyond the realm of an extraterrestrial civilization. Perhaps only the people on the colonial ship would know the extent of the Pan-Asia Cooperation's understanding of Gaia civilization.</br>
</br>
"I can't figure it out by just listening...Let's get a copy of the Devil's Worm's tissue cells, blood cells, brain cells, etc., and put it in a 20ml test tube. My sisters happen to know about biotechnology, maybe they will be able to help you," Lin Lin said.</br>
</br>
Through the interdimensional material transmission device on Coconut Island, it was already possible to transmit hamster-sized living organisms. It was more than sufficient to send a few test tubes to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
"Please. However, you have to wait until the end of this month at the earliest. The specimen has just been packaged and boarded, and it will take three weeks to fly them back to Celestial City from Mars."</br>
</br>
The Seagull-class on standby in the Mars synchronous orbit was still equipped with the previous-generation engine, and its speed was definitely not as fast as the one boarded by the Marines who rushed to the Mars colony for reinforcements.</br>
</br>
"Then wait until the end of the month to talk to me about this matter... By the way, are you really planning to build a body for that AI?" Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen with a worried expression, and seemed to seek confirmation, "Is this really well-considered? It's advanced artificial intelligence..."</br>
</br>
"It's just a body. As long as we put the thermite on its server, it shouldn't do anything that might cause unnecessary misunderstanding." Jiang Chen shrugged and looked at Lin Lin with interest, "Speaking of which, I remember that in Fallout Shelter 005 when I put thermite on its motherboard, you scolded me for being wasteful. Why are you scared now?"</br>
</br>
"Whatever, screw you!" When Lin Lin recalled how silly she looked when they first met, she blushed and gave Jiang Chen a fierce look, "When there is a problem, you can solve it yourself!"</br>
</br>
After she exploded on him, Lin Lin did not give Jiang Chen the chance to tease her back before she ended the communication furiously.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Shangjing, west of the Forbidden City.</br>
</br>
At the gate of the community that was heavily guarded, a car with a military license plate stopped slowly in front of the barrier.</br>
</br>
A soldier wearing the uniform of the special operations brigade stepped forward, checked the driver's ID, gave a standard military salute, stepped aside, and then gestured to the guard inside the checkpoint to let the car pass.</br>
</br>
The car stopped in front of a beautiful house. Wu Changfeng took a deep breath, pushed open the car door, and walked towards the house with two bodyguards in suits.</br>
</br>
Inside the tearoom, a calm and relaxed old man who was enjoying his tea. However, when he saw Wu Chengfeng, he immediately put down his cup and asked with a slight eagerness in his tone.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation?"</br>
</br>
"He agreed!" Wu Changfeng restrained the excitement in his heart and tried his best to make his expression look calmer, "Celestial Trade will hold a summit at the end of the month to disclose the findings on Mars to the public..."</br>
</br>
After the old man listened to Wu Changfeng's words, he beamed with joy and nodded with a relieved smile.</br>
</br>
"Agreed? That's great. You did a very good job on this matter, it's a great achievement!"</br>
</br>
"I don't dare," Wu Changfeng smiled modestly, "I just conveyed the central government's messaged to him. How dare I claim the credit?"</br>
</br>
"Little Wu."</br>
</br>
"What else? Chief commander?" Wu Changfeng respectfully asked.</br>
</br>
The old chief commander stared at Wu Changfeng's face for a long time, before he suddenly said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"You have become younger."</br>
</br>
Wu Changfeng's heart stopped beating for an instant, his expression stiffened slightly, and his Adam's apple moved.</br>
</br>
"It's good to be young. When I was still in the rural area, I also used to run around in the countryside. My legs and feet in my forties were better than those in their 20s." The old man did not seem to notice the subtle changes on Wu Changfeng's face as he just laughed with some emotion, "Once you're free, you'll get old."</br>
</br>
"We have caught up with a great era, and what we need is capable talents like you! The next generation will push us forward, and the future of the country requires the new generation like you to work hard."</br>
</br>
The old chief commander seemed to feel melancholic over his past as he began to speak about his past.</br>
</br>
But after Wu Changfeng heard what the old commander said, he slowly breathed a sigh of relief and forced a smile through his stiffness</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your support."</br>
</br>
He didn't find out...</br>
</br>
To be honest, he felt perplexed, and he even hesitated a few times to confess about the vaccine to the old commander who promoted him. But in the end, he chose to remain silent</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen once told him.</br>
</br>
Power is a glass of poisoned wine.</br>
</br>
Now, as he stood, he added another sentence to it.</br>
</br>
Eternal life is too.</br>
</br>
If power and immortality were mixed together, its toxicity would be even deadlier than arsenic.</br>
</br>
This was true for both individuals and countries...</br>

</br>
The atmosphere felt heavy in a meeting room at Capitol, the political center of the UA.</br>
</br>
Since last year's conflict in the Pacific, the number of times that senior consultants, ministers, and the president were locked up in the same room dramatically increased. The only difference was a new face sat at the secretary of state position.</br>
</br>
The Earth Defense Alliance was on the rise and even slightly instigated the status of NATO as the largest military body in the world. The UA was facing unprecedented challenges in politics, economics, and even culture; these challenges were not even seen in the Truman and Kennedy era.</br>
</br>
After all, the UA had only faced a seriously ill giant that was full of muscles. However, it was now in the ring with an Iron Man equipped to the teeth...</br>
</br>
No, the statement was not accurate enough. After all, Iron Man's technology was probably more realistic...</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade intends to hold a biotechnology summit in Celestial City at the end of January to showcase the spoils on Mars. What is it called? The Devil Worm? Hell... Curiosity has been running on Mars for so many years and it didn't spot a single cell." NASA Director Bolden looked at the report wearily as he reported with an exhausted tone.</br>
</br>
The director of NASA, the secretary of state, the president, the secretary of commerce, and even the minister of the interior sat at a table to discuss the issue that only happened during the Cold War era when the space competition took place. However, there was no reason for Bolden to be excited because neither the space elevator nor the moon colonization plan was close to being executed.</br>
</br>
Against the unmatched technology gap, even the genius Elon Musk and his SpaceX were powerless. They could only pick up the scraps left behind by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
"Can you find a way to get in on this summit? The UA must have first-hand knowledge of the Mars species! Otherwise, the gap between us and Celestial Trade will only grow bigger," Defence Minister Carter said with a stern look.</br>
</br>
"Eligibility to participate in the summit? Oh, of course. New York Times, Washington Post... Any media that you can name has received an invitation," the chief of staff leaned back in his chair and revealed an ugly expression as he spun the pen his hand. "The problem is that no UA research institution or university has received an invitation for collaboration. We are completely excluded."</br>
</br>
"They are hindering academic freedom!" Next to Minister Carter, the director of the advanced projects department cursed.</br>
</br>
"The professors at Harvard University and MIT have already condemned their action." Hill looked at the officials present and finally fixed her sight on the secretary of state. "What we need now is a solution."</br>
</br>
"I will try my best, but don't get your hopes up," the newly appointed secretary of state rubbed his temples. "It's not the first day that Celestial Trade placed a blockade on us in space technology. Hoping they can make concessions today, the chance is not high... Kerry is an expert on Xin, but you know-"</br>
</br>
</br>
"Out of all times, Kerry, this guy, decides to quit his job now." An official cussed with his voice lowered</br>
</br>
"Can you convince him to come back?" Hill looked at the Party Leader.</br>
</br>
"It'll be very difficult. He insisted on participating in the primaries in March. He even wrote his speech. You know, someone gave him support. The most terrible thing is that the opinions within the party are diverted and he has a fair amount of support. Dear God, now we not only have to face Xin and Republicans, but also the damned Wall Street..."</br>
</br>
The wrinkles on Hill's eyes showed a hint of bitter helplessness.</br>
</br>
She did not know her next move.</br>
</br>
Just then, Bolden suddenly spoke up.</br>
</br>
"How about we start the Mars landing plan ahead of time?"</br>
</br>
As he finished the sentence, all sights in the room focused on him.</br>
</br>
He responded to the president and officials' focused gaze as he took a deep breath and continued.</br>
</br>
"If we can't break the ice in diplomacy, we can only make attempts from technology."</br>
</br>
"The problem is, can our current technology do it? Didn't SpaceX end development of manned rockets?" Defense Secretary Carter frowned.</br>
</br>
"MCT, the Mars Immigration Transporter. SpaceX has never stopped their plan to colonize Mars, and now the most critical technology has made a breakthrough." Bolden looked at Hill and said seriously, "At least a one-way ticket."</br>
</br>
Silence lasted in the room for a while, then Hill spoke.</br>
</br>
"Tell me what is the significance of doing this?"</br>
</br>
If she could not find a suitable reason to convince Congress to allocate funds, even if she agreed with the plan, it would not serve any purpose.</br>
</br>
"Too much significance," Bolden said. "The Moon has been monopolized. We cannot let Celestial Trade continue to monopolize the future of mankind. Even a flag on Mars and a few people living on it can add a lot of chips for us."</br>
</br>
The craters with ice and rare earth reserves were all shamelessly occupied by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Even without extraction, a research station would serve its purpose. Even if the countries began to establish their own lunar research stations, they could not solve the most critical drinking water and oxygen problems, which made forming a colony almost an impossible task.</br>
</br>
In particular, Celestial Trade refused to sell drinking water, oxygen, and electricity to stations outside the Earth Defense Alliance member countries on the grounds of limited resources. The high maintenance costs made these stations unable to breakeven, let alone expansion.</br>
</br>
However, the most crucial thing was not this...</br>
</br>
After a moment of pause, Bolden looked at the still hesitant president and went on.</br>
</br>
"In addition, I suspect that Celestial Trade's discovery on Mars is probably not as simple as a bug."</br>
</br>
Hill suddenly thought of something, gasped, and looked at Bolden in shock.</br>
</br>
"You mean..."</br>
</br>
"Yes, I'm afraid it is related to an extraterrestrial civilization." Bolden nodded and suggested with a serious tone, "If they do not agree to allow us to participate in the research, then we will go take a look ourselves."</br>
</br>
There is more than one way to Mars.</br>
</br>
If Celestial Trade is not willing to sell tickets to Mars, then UA can build its own "spaceship".</br>
</br>
While the Capitol was preparing for both cases, on the Mars colony tens of millions of kilometers away, the remaining nine soldiers and the only vehicle left completed their assembly and began to prepare for the rescue of the engineers trapped near Mine 071.</br>
</br>
The reinforcement of Celestial Trade would take two weeks to arrive, and the oxygen on the rover would at most last for two weeks. The risk of the rescue was high; everyone knew about this. But no soldier questioned the rescue.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade has never left people behind.</br>
</br>
No matter who the opponent is.</br>
</br>
Whether the opponent is human or not.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1236: Mars Rescue</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"How long until the rescue?"</br>
</br>
"If you say a few words less, maybe we can last a few more hours." Wang Qiang said wearily as he looked at the remaining power and oxygen on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
The oxygen in the rover came primarily from two systems.</br>
</br>
One was an oxygen tank placed in the trunk, and the reserve inside could provide oxygen for a crew up to a week. The other was the carbon fixation device that automatically started when the oxygen tank was empty. The device consumed electrical energy to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen until the battery is depleted.</br>
</br>
In an optimal scenario, the device could maintain oxygen for two weeks.</br>
</br>
However, now, five days had already passed.</br>
</br>
Looking at the fiery red desert outside the window, and the "worm" that crawled out onto the surface from time to time, Wang Qian had a bitter smile on his face.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, a black dot appeared in his field of vision. There was a cloud of dust behind that black dot.</br>
</br>
"Hey, James, wake up!" Wang Qiang immediately kicked the man facing him and woke up the man that just managed to fall asleep.</br>
</br>
"What happened..." James was rubbing his eyes as he wanted to ask what had happened, but then he saw the black dot.</br>
</br>
All his drowsiness disappeared in an instant as he crawled beside Wang Qiang while staring out the window with his eyes squinted, desperately trying to identify what it was, then he screamed in excitement, "It's our people! They're back! They didn't abandon us! "</br>
</br>
"Hurry up and get ready."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang patted him on the shoulder and walked into the buffer room. Then, he took off his spacesuit.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the action outside the window began.</br>
</br>
A Devil Worm near the rover raised its head and opened its sharp teeth in the direction of the vehicle that was coming in from the distance. Just as it was about to plunge back into the ground, the vehicle launched a rocket.</br>
</br>
Like a burning iron fist, the rocket directly hit the Devil Worm's abdomen and instantly exploded.</br>
</br>
Its green blood and remains splattered in the air, which sent the upper half of the Devil Worm into the air before it smashed into the sand five meters away.</br>
</br>
"REEEEEE!"</br>
</br>
The repressed and anguish scream came from its vocal cord, and the Devil Worm that had been split in half squirmed wildly in the desert with its organs and blood spilled everywhere.</br>
</br>
"Still not died," Looking at , the gunner said with a troubled tone as he saw the troublesome bug through the scope.</br>
</br>
"Make it shut up! It's attracting its kind!" the captain shouted.</br>
</br>
The 20mm gun released its fiery at the worm's upper half.</br>
</br>
The driver quickly turned the steering wheel and the vehicle made a quick thirty degrees turn toward the rover.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, dust exploded from the side of the vehicle, and another Devil Worm crawled out from the ground. The sickle-like fangs barely scratched the vehicle as its mouth opened and closed, creating a cringe-worthy sound.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Go to hell!" Gnashing his teeth, the gunner adjusted the gun and pressed down on the trigger.</br>
</br>
The gun unleashed its bullets and tore apart the belly of the Devil Worm.</br>
</br>
While that Devil Worm collapsed in anguish, the whole desert seemed to have begun to boil.</br>
</br>
Devil Worms crawled out beside the vehicle one by one. When they failed to hit the target, they immediately dove back into the ground. The gun continued to fire, but it could not handle multiple targets at once.</br>
</br>
"Damnit! How many of them are there!" The driver exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about how many there are, hit them! Hit the tires of the rover!" The captain tightly held onto the seat as he roared.</br>
</br>
The vehicle escaped from the blockade formed by the Devil Worms. It crashed into the heavy rubber tires of the rover and slid the rover seven to eight meters on the sand before it finally came to a stop. However, the tipped rover remained upside down.</br>
</br>
"SH*T! Are they trying to save us or trying to kill us?!" James stood back up and he held himself against the cabin. He was in a state of complete daze.</br>
</br>
"The car body is damaged... not a big problem. They're probably trying to knock us back up, but they underestimated the width of our chassis." Wang Qiang was already squatting in the corner as he anticipated the impact and so he did not get hurt.</br>
</br>
The rescue plan seemed to have issues from the very start.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Plan A had failed, the vehicle did not stop completely before the captain immediately ordered, "Enable Plan B! Fast!"</br>
</br>
The vehicle continued to accelerate and pushed the rover forward. At the same time, the top cover of the rover was opened, and a soldier stood up with a hook lock in his hands. Soon, he attached the hook locks onto the two tires of the rover.</br>
</br>
"They are trying to make us go outside? Don't even think about it," James exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Then you can stay inside."</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang did not waste any more time. Immediately after he saw the action of the soldier , he reached for the safety lock next to the driver's seat. After he entered the password, he yanked the valve.</br>
</br>
The instant he pulled valve, the cover of the safe passage of the rover chassis slammed outward. Under the huge air pressure difference, the air inside the rover rushed outward. With one foot on the seat, Wang Qiang forced himself out of the rover from the safe passage, grabbed the soldier's hand, jumped to the vehicle, and got into the other vehicle.</br>
</br>
"It is hitting our belt!" The driver slammed on the gas pedal as he shouted.</br>
</br>
"It can't move us! Our tonnage is much more than the rover... DAMN IT!"</br>
</br>
The vehicle was installed with a stabilization module before the mission. The vehicle with a higher tonnage did not get knocked over like the rover, but it was still lifted two centimeters into the air. While the gravity on Mars was not comparable to Earth, to be able to lift such a giant piece of metal into the air showed the explosiveness of the Devil Worm.</br>
</br>
"Fast! Hurry!" The soldier at the top struggled to maintain his balance as he nervously looked at the gravel under the vehicle, and anxiously shouted at the rover, "Give me your hand!"</br>
</br>
Despite the fear, James still gritted his teeth and climbed out of the rover behind Wang Qiang, he grabbed the soldier's hand and jumped onto the vehicle.</br>
</br>
However, the situation took an unexpected turn.</br>
</br>
The Devil Warm that was smashing against the vehicle suddenly stopped and immediately moved to the side of the vehicle, then it opened its fearsome mouth. When James, who just managed to maintain his balance on the vehicle, saw the series of green eyes, his pupils were gradually covered with horror.</br>
</br>
"Thank—"</br>
</br>
"NOOO!"</br>
</br>
The air screeched, and the sickle collapsed.</br>
</br>
Blood gushed two meters high and formed a misty fog among the sand cloud...</br>
</br>
"Mission failed. Engineer James died and Sergeant Miller was seriously injured..."</br>
</br>
"Sergeant Miller is still in critical condition."</br>
</br>
"The rescue forces are returning to the colony."</br>
</br>
On the big screen in Celestial Trade Command Center, the icon of Engineer James was marked with a red cross.</br>
</br>
Kelvin stared at the big screen as his expression turned more and more serious. He slowly sat back down on his chair, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
His political sense told him that some things may be out of his control now...</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1237: Label of The Minorities</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The series of discoveries and moves Celestial Trade made on Mars touched the sensitive nerves of all the countries in the world.</br>
</br>
International funds, think tanks, scientific research institutions, and all governmental or non-governmental organizations were behaving like sharks that smelled blood in the water. They focused their sights on Xin and Celestial Trade to track down first-hand information.</br>
</br>
The attention brought by the "Devil Worm Incident" exceeded the poplarity of the Xin election!</br>
</br>
Now the international community generally agreed that the specimens sent to Celestial City would likely provide pieces of evidence to uncover a series of unsolved mysteries, such as the Mars ecological environment and geomorphological features from more than three billion years ago.</br>
</br>
After all, everything about Mars could only be speculated based on the data from Curiosity and the Hubble Telescope.</br>
</br>
Since lives existed on Mars more than three billion years ago, in this three billion years time frame, did civilization exist on Mars... this was the most talked-about topic. Everyone was looking to find the answer from the specimen.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that the Devil Worm opened the door to a new world for mankind.</br>
</br>
Without failing to live up to the expectations of the international community, Celestial Trade was meticulously preparing for the upcoming summit.</br>
</br>
However, the bad news from the Mars colony cast a gloom over the upcoming summit...</br>
</br>
"African-American, Xin immigrant, ethnic minority, father of ten children..." Zhang Yaping tossed a newspaper on the coffee table, sat on the sofa as he pinched his eyebrows, then said with a headache, "How are these people so rowdy!"</br>
</br>
James' black and white photo was printed on the headline, with a striking title next to it.</br>
</br>
To be honest, if it weren't for the labels attached to him, the media would not have reacted so strongly. At most, it would criticize the safety of the Mars Colonization Program, and then condemn Celestial Trade for not planning the rescue mission thoroughly enough…</br>
</br>
Not thorough enough? There was a well-thought-out plan.</br>
</br>
However, no plan is perfect.</br>
</br>
Those reporters were not soldiers. They wouldn't care about how dangerous the situation was. They would at most take a few photos of the Devil Worm specimen a few months later, then make some aggressive commentary of the Mars creature before they tried to restore what happened with cinematics.</br>
</br>
In any case, the whole incident was attached to these four labels and everything just turned for the worst.</br>
</br>
With the help of the media with ulterior motives, the whole incident was rendered from a simple "rescue failure" to Celestial Trade's differential treatment of colored minorities, and the media pushed this story further by revealing the relationship between the rescued and the deceased.</br>
</br>
The African-American population made up a small percentage of Xin's population, but for some reason, any issue that occurred in this group often attracted leftists. They would march on the streets and protest with the photo of the deceased.</br>
</br>
</br>
James was portrayed as a victim of discrimination and differential treatment. Celestial Trade, the Mars colony and even Zhang Yaping, who was preparing for the election, got caught in the middle of the landslide.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who was sitting across from him, had a helpless smile.</br>
</br>
"There are always people with too much energy. You and I both know we can't do anything about this."</br>
</br>
"Can we settle this somehow? If James' wife does not sue you, the protesters will have nothing to say." Zhang Yaping frowned.</br>
</br>
"It's useless," Jiang Chen shook his head. "It's not as simple as it seems."</br>
</br>
The executives of Celestial Trade certainly considered treating it in a low-profile way, which would be to settle with the family of the victim before the media learned of this news. Unexpectedly, however, just as the news of the rescue leaked, the Canadian government immediately took care of the families of the victim.</br>
</br>
Immediately afterward, a black activist organization stood up and persuaded James' wife to go through the legal channel, and then volunteered to arrange a strong team of lawyers for her to sue Future Mining and Celestial Trade in Ottawa.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that the UA was linked to all this. After all, the two countries shared the same border. The rapid response of the Canadian government made it hard to not associate it with the Capitol. The activist organization that contacted James' wife was also based in North America.</br>
</br>
As for covering up the failure of rescue...</br>
</br>
Technically, it was not infeasible, but the actual operation would be too difficult, and if it was exposed, it would lead to an avalanche of controversies. Almost every colonist updated their Twitter and Facebook, and everyone also could talk to their family five times a month.</br>
</br>
It would be unrealistic to isolate Mars from human society just because someone died.</br>
</br>
"What do you mean? Is the UA behind all this?" Zhang Yaping frowned.</br>
</br>
"There is a 99% chance they are, but it doesn't make sense to have this discussion. After all, they played their cards," Jiang Chen said with not much worry in his tone "If they think they can rely on this little trick to bother us, then that's just cute."</br>
</br>
"What are you going to do?"</br>
</br>
"Start with your problem first," Jiang Chen crossed his fingers over his knee then looked at Zhang Yaping. "What we have to do now is to wait quietly, wait for the rowdiest people to jump out and then take care of all of them at once."</br>
</br>
The UA continued its attempt to intervene with Xin's election. However, because of the presence of Ghost Agents, FBA and CIB had been unable to get directly involved in the operations.</br>
</br>
Since a long time ago, they began providing funds to human rights groups and Coro officials, and even directly subsidized some candidates, who advocated to curtail the expansion of Celestial Trade and emphasized the state power, to participate in the general election.</br>
</br>
It was time to cleanse these heretics.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to do something?" Zhang Yaping asked.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to do anything," Jiang Chen said with a smile. "Resist the pressure from the public, don't respond to the accusations from the outside world, or simply just don't ask about this. You can prepare for the summit at the end of this month and the election in March."</br>
</br>
"If you already have a good plan," Zhang Yaping forcefully nodded, "Then we'll follow your plan."</br>
</br>
It sounded simple to simply ignore the criticism, but it was not a simple task. It was the final sprint till the election and while his support rate far outranked his opponent, no one could guarantee a victory until the final moment.</br>
</br>
James was a nobody; someone no one paid attention to. However, his death now became a political event. If the matter was not handled properly, it would become a black mark on his political career.</br>
</br>
Also, if the event continued to escalate, it may create some "suspense" for the election in two months...</br>
</br>
This was also what worried Zhang Yaping the most.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen's next few words erased his concerns.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry. I know what you are worried about, but some things will never happen." Jiang Chen stood up and walked next to Zhang Yaping. With a mysterious smile, he then lowered his voice, "There will be news soon that a candidate is suspected of accepting foreign funds, and then they'll be taken away by the persecutor..."</br>
</br>
Then, those idiots who had ulterior motives would gain a deep understanding of the true owner of Xin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted Zhang Yaping's shoulder, and left the shocked, or rather, joyous president in the office.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1238: Five Million and The Candidate</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In an unknown mansion on Ange Island, two men sat across from each other. The coffee table in the middle was filled with recent newspapers and election materials.</br>
</br>
Okesi looked at the documents in his hand quietly, frowning from time to time.</br>
</br>
The suited African-American sitting across from him was McDonald, someone from North America's "The Voice of Black". From their name, it was not difficult to guess the nature of the organization.</br>
</br>
I heard that they are supported by some company on Wall Street.</br>
</br>
Okesi also heard that the Capitol may be behind them.</br>
</br>
But who cares?</br>
</br>
At least Okesi did not care.</br>
</br>
However, their request this time was really difficult.</br>
</br>
"...haven't finished reading yet?" When Okesi did not respond after a long pause, McDonald quietly said, "There is only one paragraph that changed, that is, at the end of your campaign platform: Promise during the term of office to amend the Constitution of 2016, abolish the Defense Outsourcing Act, and withdraw the defense contracting rights from military contractors like Celestial Trade."</br>
</br>
"This is not the same as what we agreed on from the start. Didn't we say we want to promote the Immigration Protection Act?" Okesi patted the document in his hand and frowned. "Now there are only two months left before the election, and you want me to suddenly add a constitutional amendment to the campaign platform, and then explain to my supporters why I suddenly changed my plan?"</br>
</br>
"I know this is outside the contract," McDonald said emotionlessly as he waved to the assistant behind him. "So we prepared a reward outside the contract."</br>
</br>
The assistant walked up and placed the briefcase in his hand on the table.</br>
</br>
"Here is five million Xin New Dollars and it is the deposit we are going to prepay you."</br>
</br>
The black suitcase opened and the fragrance of new ink on paper blew into Okesi's face. He looked at the bundles of cash inside as his eyes widened and he gulped subconsciously.</br>
</br>
"You will completely mess up my election..."</br>
</br>
On one side was five million Xin New Dollars, and on the other was the throne of the president.</br>
</br>
Okesi was struggling internally.</br>
</br>
McDonald grinned and shook his head. He took out a cigar from his suit pocket and asked the assistant to light it up for him before he put it into his mouth.</br>
</br>
He blew out a smoke ring and then said to the hesitant Okesi.</br>
</br>
"Do you think with one line less, you'll have any more hope of defeating Zhang Yaping, who is supported by Celestial Trade? Stop dreaming. Even with our support, your chances are slim at best."</br>
</br>
Okesi's did not react well to the statement as his expression turned sour. For anybody, being looked down upon was not the best feeling, especially now that he gained some support among the leftists. The recent "James Incident" also increased his support rate, so much that he superfluously thought that he could have a fighting chance on election day.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, when McDonald said that he had no chance of winning, it made him quite dissatisfied.</br>
</br>
But he could hide the dissatisfaction in his heart. After all, the man across from him shouldered almost eighty percent of his campaign expenses.</br>
</br>
"Since you have no confidence in me, why are you betting on me?" Looking at the expressionless McDonald, Okesi quietly asked while he concealed his dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
"I'm not investing in you, but the paper in your hands," McDonald pointed to the paper in his hand with his cigar.</br>
</br>
"This paper is worth nothing before I become president."</br>
</br>
McDonald snorted.</br>
</br>
"Worth nothing? I have been a lobbyist for more than a decade. I know better than you when something is really worthless."</br>
</br>
"Someone needs to propose it, then someone needs to add to it, and finally someone will perfect it. If citizens don't know they can have such rights, that they can still fight for these rights by voting, then there is no way to start the work."</br>
</br>
"We have enough patience. If we continue step by step, we can take 20 years, 30 years, or even longer to transform this country into a normal country and then develop normal diplomatic relations with it instead of what it is like now; diplomatic negotiations are not like diplomatic negotiations, instead, it's all business."</br>
</br>
"And you don't need to bother about any of this. You just need to stand in front of the Xin people. Tell them through the election what they can get..."</br>
</br>
McDonald then paused, leaned forward slightly, and with his arms pushed against his kneecaps, he stared right at Okesi. "Now, tell me. Do you deserve our continued investment?"</br>
</br>
Okesi gulped.</br>
</br>
After his internal struggle, his fists clenched and slowly loosened before he finally nodded.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
McDonald smiled and stood up.</br>
</br>
"It seems that you made the right choice. Then, I will not bother you anymore."</br>
</br>
He then gestured to the assistant behind him and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
At the door, McDonald stopped and looked back at Okesi, who was sitting on the couch and in deep thought, and said in a joyous tone.</br>
</br>
"I'll avoid contact with you in the next two months. I hope that when I return to the Capital, I can see your good news. So Mr. Okesi, I wish you all the best in the election."</br>
</br>
He smiled and fixed the collar of his suit before pushing open the door.</br>
</br>
However, at the moment he pushed open the door, the expression on his face froze together with his footstep.</br>
</br>
Two men in black suits stood in front of him and their eyes were fixated on him. Behind the two men were about a dozen police officers and seven reporters with cameras. The entire mansion was surrounded by police cars and media vans.</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry, Mr. MacDonald, I'm afraid you can't go back to the Capital." The man in the suit took out an arrest warrant, which was stamped with the seal of the Xin Supreme Court. "We received intel that you are under allegations of 21 charges, including bribery, manipulation of elections, and espionage."</br>
</br>
Cold sweat dripped down from McDonald's sideburns.</br>
</br>
Looking at the man standing in front of his eyes, there was a long silence before he finally squeezed a word out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
"This is slander..."</br>
</br>
"Is it slander? We will know soon." The man shrugged and gestured to the police behind him.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Okesi was still in his living room, staring at the briefcase full of bills on the table.</br>
</br>
The bundle of cash made him a little dizzy.</br>
</br>
He had never seen so much money in his life, and the money was only a deposit of 10% of the total compensation...</br>
</br>
His trembling fingers touched the box of cash.</br>
</br>
However, just as he gulped down and tried to count the pile of cash, a roar came from the entrance.</br>
</br>
"You can't do this! I warn you that your actions violate international conventions! Stop, damnit! Do you know who I am? I am—"</br>
</br>
Dense and heavy footsteps interrupted his reverie of a yacht, private beach, and blondes. When he saw the arrest warrant with the seal of the Xin Supreme Court, the police emblem of the Xin National Police, and the cameras of the media, he felt like all his life force escaped from him body.</br>
</br>
At this moment, his heart almost stopped beating.</br>
</br>
Without any resistance, Okesi, who looked as pale as a ghost, obediently extended his hands and let the police put handcuffs on him.</br>
</br>
Resistance no longer served a purpose.</br>
</br>
He knew at that moment that his political career was over...</br>

</br>
"Hopeful candidate Okesi alleged to have received foreign funding from a black rights activist executive and well-known African-American philanthropist, McDonald. McDonald is facing 21 charges..."</br>
</br>
"Is it a human rights organization? Or is it a lobbyist who sells 'Western values'?"</br>
</br>
"The Supreme Court of Xin announced its latest findings and terminated Okesi's candidacy in accordance with Xin laws."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
In less than a week, the event that took a drastic turn.</br>
</br>
Okesi, who was originally viewed as the "immigrant's friend", was imprisoned. Not only did he lose his candidacy, but he also faced charges from the prosecution, and even dragged MacDonald into the pit with him.</br>
</br>
Simply making arrests would offer no benefit other than pouring gasoline on the fire, or rather, it would provide more materials to attack Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
However, unfortunately, the police that received the tip not only arrested the suspects, but they also found five million New Xin Dollar in cash and an illegal contract at the scene of the crime.</br>
</br>
All these were captured by reporters behind the law enforcement officers.</br>
</br>
With concrete evidence, even the most radical leftists were speechless, not knowing how to turn the tide.</br>
</br>
After all, except for a small number of people who have indeed been instructed by foreign organizations, most people were only being used. And now that this event happened, most people with a brain realized this point.</br>
</br>
Okesi was not an exception, but Xin State Procuratorate used him to set an example.</br>
</br>
At the same time, after Okesi was arrested, Celestial Trade who had been ignoring media accusations began to launch an offensive round of attacks. It leveraged its influence on the web and changed the focal point from James to the politics behind this entire event.</br>
</br>
The spearhead was directed right back to the Capitol.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the conference hall of Future Building, the dimly lit room was filled with people.</br>
</br>
Every time Future Group held a press conference, no matter the size, or the duration, or the location, it would always be filled with excitement.</br>
</br>
This time, of course, was no exception.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stood at the podium as the president of Future Group and spoke in a solemn and calm tone in front of the media.</br>
</br>
"...For the death of James, we would like to express our deepest condolences."</br>
</br>
"He was an outstanding employee. His death was the loss for Future Mining and the entire Future Group. According to our company's regulations and related labor protection laws, his family will not only receive a large payout from the insurance company, but we will also provide considerable compensation for the family as part of our employee protection regulations."</br>
</br>
"This money can be received by James's wife in any court in Xin. There is no need to sue to receive the compensation. We will not refuse to pay compensation because of his skin color, nor will we discriminate against him like what many have accused. Similarly, we will not let him get the part that is not his own because of his skin color or public opinion."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Any immigrants, regardless of ethnicity or religion, have equal rights in Xin. This is the constitution of Xin and the foundation of our country. However, for anyone that attempts to use the name of the minority to seek privilege for themselves..."</br>
</br>
Staring at the lens, Jiang Chen said one word at a time.</br>
</br>
"I can tell you with certainty that you are dreaming."</br>
</br>
"In addition, I once again warn those who have ulterior motives. If you think that you can distract us like this, then I will tell you who the real loser will be."</br>
</br>
At the end of the speech, all the lights in the venue lit up, followed by the questions.</br>
</br>
The prepared reporters all swarmed up and put their microphones and cameras close to the podium. They tightly formed a half arc in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, is your last sentence suggesting that this incident was supported by a particular government?"</br>
</br>
"I think I have said enough, please check your notes."</br>
</br>
"...I would like to ask if the summit scheduled to be held at the end of the month will be postponed because of the impact of this incident?"</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"...There is a point of view that Ghost Agents participated in the investigation and evidence collection. Is it legal to use the intelligence agency to investigate the candidate?"</br>
</br>
"It depends on whether the candidate's own behavior is illegal. I think it is the same in any country. The identity of the candidate should never be a shield for judicial investigation."</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, may I ask..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen selected a few questions to answer before he announced the end of the press conference. He then asked the staff to help the reporters before clearing out the venue.</br>
</br>
He walked into the lounge behind the stage and took the water from Xia Shiyu's hands. He took a few swigs before he sat down and wiped the drips of water from his mouth in satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"Is it tiring?"</br>
</br>
"Not too bad. It's not too tiring but my throat feels dry." Jiang Chen screwed on the lid and threw the water bottle on the table.</br>
</br>
"You've been really busy lately," Xia Shiyu said, concerned.</br>
</br>
"Everything just happened all at once." Jiang Chen shrugged helplessly, leaned back against the chair, and looked at Xia Shiyu with a smirk. "Come and massage your honey."</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu heard his words, her cold face suddenly started blushing as she subconsciously looked behind her.</br>
</br>
The door of the lounge was closed, and Xia Shiyu felt relieved. Then, she rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Can you be more aware of the impact of your words? This is not your home."</br>
</br>
Although she said she was not happy, she still walked behind Jiang Chen and put her hands on his shoulders.</br>
</br>
Feeling her kneading of his shoulder, Jiang Chen closed his eyes in comfort.</br>
</br>
"Look at you, just like an old lord." Xia Shiyu grinned and massaged Jiang Chen's shoulder as she felt speechless. "Is it comfortable?"</br>
</br>
"It's too comfortable. I feel alive again," Jiang Chen said with an exaggerated expression. He looked through Xia Shiyu's hair and stared at the ceiling, before he let out a sigh. "I suddenly have a hunch."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu continued while she tilted her head</br>
</br>
"What hunch?"</br>
</br>
"There are going to be many busy days this year." Jiang Chen sighed softly.</br>
</br>
"Isn't that a good thing?" Xia Shiyu rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen. "You're just so bad when there is nothing to do. Now that there are things you need to take care of, isn't that good? You should be worrying about your company."</br>
</br>
As he held the pair of smooth hands on his shoulder, he looked up and met with the eyes full of love.</br>
</br>
"So, do you like me to be busy, or bad?"</br>
</br>
Her cheeks quickly turned red.</br>
</br>
Feeling the heat on the back of her hands, Xia Shiyu looked subtly the side and reluctantly whispered the truth.</br>
</br>
"...bad."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
As soon as the Celestial Trade press conference ended, the door of the president's office were pushed open on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the FBA director pushed open the door and walked to Hill's desk with haste in his steps.</br>
</br>
"We must get MacDonald's people out as soon as possible." He placed a piece of document in front of the president, then with both his hands placed on the table, he said seriously, "There is reliable information that Celestial Trade possesses a drug called truth-telling serum!"</br>
</br>
"You mean, they will use a truth-telling serum on MacDonald?" Hill read the document with a frown.</br>
</br>
"Based on their usual tactics, we cannot rule out this possibility," The FBA director said solemnly, "I worry that MacDonald may reveal to them things that should not be said, such as our financial dealings with North American human rights agencies."</br>
</br>
At this point, the FBA Director looked at Hillary seriously and said, "We must get him out as soon as possible! Before they convict him and use the drug on him!"</br>
</br>
Hill rubbed her temples as she glanced at the documents on the table and said wearily.</br>
</br>
"...Do you have any good ideas?"</br>
</br>
The FBA director was just about to say something, but then he froze.</br>
</br>
He suddenly realized that his idea would not work on Celestial Trade...</br>
</br>
Send a lawyer? The Voice of Blacks had already done that and it hired the strongest team of lawyers, but the situation was still not optimistic. The Xin Court seemed to be determined in convicting MacDonald. This lawsuit was unfair from the beginning.</br>
</br>
Send the SEALs? It's debatable if they could even reach Coro Island...</br>
</br>
"This... the CIB is mainly responsible for foreign affairs." The FBA director looked away awkwardly, "We are only responsible for contacting the human rights organization in North America..."</br>
</br>
He was embarrassed to continue.</br>
</br>
Hill sighed and pushed the document aside.</br>
</br>
The word Xin gave her a headache, even to the point where she was diagnosed with minor depression.</br>
</br>
She originally entered politics with huge ambitions, but this result was not something she expected.</br>
</br>
How would history evaluate her?</br>
</br>
She could only hope that those historians could put more emphasis on her opponent so that as the first female president of the country, she would not look so incompetent. After all, she still believed that she made the best decision during her tenure, even if the result did not look so satisfactory. She did not lose in politics...</br>
</br>
"Do you know what I want most now?"</br>
</br>
The FBA director carefully asked as he looked at Hill who was rubbing her brows.</br>
</br>
"President...Madam?"</br>
</br>
"What I want most now is for this winter to come sooner."</br>
</br>
"Mrs. President," the FBA director gulped, then reminded in a quiet voice, "It's already winter now."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The news of Macdonald's arrest in Xin had caused a great uproar in the international community, especially among black people. The Voice of Blacks said in an interview with the media that it will do everything in its power to rescue Macdonald and has hired the best team of lawyers to provide legal aid to him. The President of Tanzania even summoned Xin's ambassador to Tanzania to express his concern about the incident.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, in contrast, what attracted more attention from the international community was the speech Jiang Chen gave on behalf of the Future group at the press conference about the "James Incident".</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's interpretation of "equal rights does not mean giving privileges to certain groups of people" led to two polar opposite views of him in the international community.</br>
</br>
Some people believed that if a certain amount of protection is not given to a small number of people, it would increase social inequality and aggravate racial discrimination, which would not bring "fairness"…</br>
</br>
And others thought.</br>
</br>
This is too damn right!</br>
</br>
Why bother going in a circle? Just directly create a law to put the money of the rich into the wallet of the poor. Then even the class itself is eliminated! The gap between the rich and the poor is the source of all issues!</br>
</br>
Especially Jiang Chen's sentence "...For some people who try to seek privileges for themselves under the banner of a minority and in the name of equality, I will tell you with certainty that you are dreaming." He gained support from many who shared the same sentiment.</br>
</br>
Even on the far side of the Pacific Ocean, there were strong supporters of Jiang Chen's words.</br>
</br>
For example, a certain UA election candidate who threatened to "wrestle" with Jiang Chen even expressed regret on a talk show: "He is a respectable opponent, you know who I am referring to. If our country wants to be strong, we must have a strong leader to remind those who commit crimes with their race and religion to get out of our country. I think I happen to be such a strong leader; you can vote for me..."</br>
</br>
Although most of the people were no longer surprised by this candidate's unthoughtful remarks, this time he did actually offend the black population. There were even black senates that spoke vocally against him and asked the Republican Party to disqualify his eligibility for the March primaries.</br>
</br>
Of course, Trump did not intend to be soft. After all, his candidacy had been filled with controversies from the very start, and the number of people that asked for his disqualification could not even be counted with just one hand. However, out of the consideration of the votes, he emphasized that the remark was only directed against terrorists and illegal immigrants...</br>
</br>
"You have been jointly condemned."</br>
</br>
In the evening, Natasha in her dressing gown went to the living room, threw a newspaper on the coffee table, and then sat down across from Jiang Chen. She leaned back on the sofa and lazily raised her beautiful legs, "The Voice of Blacks accused you that the condolences to James were not sincere enough, saying that even if James' wife abandons the legal proceedings against Future Group and Celestial Trade, they will still take you to court for this incident."</br>
</br>
"Where do they want to sue me? Moscow?" Jiang Chen teased.</br>
</br>
"In Mississippi."</br>
</br>
"My geography is not very good," Jiang Chen yawned as he watched her deliberately reveal her neckline, then he said with a smirk. "Compared to this boring topic, we might as well use this time to do something more interesting."</br>
</br>
"Are you not worried at all?" After she changed the position of her legs, Natasha raised her eyebrows slightly and curiously asked, "I heard that they are calling for a boycott of Future Group products."</br>
</br>
"If they can bear the life of the primitive, I'm not against it." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
From Phantom helmets to smart robots to Future phones and urban drone systems, Future Group was almost equated with the term next generation that covered all aspects of people's lives.</br>
</br>
Technologies were addictive. Just like a person who was used to using smartphones would never go back to using an old flip phone. The feeling of being behind on trends would be more painful than anything else. And this very reason was why the UA has kept a cautious attitude about launching an anti-dumping investigation against Future Group.</br>
</br>
Even if Future Group was already an evident monopoly on the market, the UA has yet to find a company that can replace Future Group.</br>
</br>
Even Microsoft and Google could not complete this feat. One had to pay high patent fees to the Future Group for graphene chips, while the other simply imported a large number of supercomputing chips from Ange Island every year to maintain its own servers around the world. ...</br>
</br>
"Well, since you don't take those people to heart at all, I have nothing to say," Natasha shrugged, "I went to the Russian embassy today, and the Kremlin wanted me to ask you. How is the situation on Mars? And, do you really not need help?"</br>
</br>
"I'm pretty sure we don't need help. Our transport ship should reach the Mars synchronous orbit in five days at the latest." Jiang Chen smiled, "Instead, when will your scientists come?"</br>
</br>
"The specimen has been delivered?! So fast?" Natasha looked at Jiang Chen in surprise.</br>
</br>
"Yeah... to be precise, two hours ago, the port of Celestial City has received the freezer compartment containing Devil Worm specimen." Jiang Chen laughed at Natasha's expression as he said, "It should be already transported to the specimen library at the lab."</br>
</br>
He had already passed the news onto other member states just now. Since Natasha happened to be home, he thought he would tell her the news himself.</br>
</br>
As for why, of course, it made things more interesting.</br>
</br>
"Wait, received the freezer compartment? Didn't you use a transport ship to deliver this specimen?" Natasha asked hurriedly.</br>
</br>
"On the surface, yes," Jiang Chen said, "It's impossible for us to dissect specimens in front of the media, right? And what is suitable or not for publicity, these also need to be studied. So, we used a small carrier rocket that is used to transport ore to transport the specimens...Although the carrying capacity is not high, it can theoretically cruise at twice the speed of the Seagull-class transport ship."</br>
</br>
"I'm going to make a phone call," Natasha got up immediately, "Russian scientists can board the plane now, and they will be at the Coro Airport by noon tomorrow."</br>
</br>
Natasha walked towards the stairs.</br>
</br>
However, when she passed the sofa, Jiang Chen grabbed her arm.</br>
</br>
"This is a valuable piece of information, my dear Miss Agent." Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and smirked. "Are you not going to give your 'informant' a little... special reward?"</br>
</br>
Natasha couldn't help but chuckle at the unique analogy, and she rolled her eyes with charm and dragged her arm from his hand.</br>
</br>
She leaned down and blew a frivolous breath into his ear, then teased in a whimsical tone.</br>
</br>
"Go to my room in a bit... remember to wash yourself before you come, so I can give you a reward from 'Miss Agent'."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1241: Not A Worm?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the synchronous orbit, a large hibernation chamber was shipped into a heavily guarded laboratory. The frozen specimen was the Mars species from tens of millions of kilometers away - Devil Worm.</br>
</br>
At the same time, scientists from the major member states of the Earth Defense Alliance gathered here.</br>
</br>
These scientists covered a wide range of fields that could help with the research. Their fields included biology, chemistry, and other related fields. Each person was also authoritative and well-respected in their respective fields. After all, spots were limited and each country only received a few spots to divide among universities, research centers, and scientific research institutions. Even to save their face, it would be foolish to send a nobody.</br>
</br>
The flow of the experiment was carried out in the order agreed upon.</br>
</br>
The entire specimen was strictly enclosed in the isolation room, and all members must wear protective clothing when sampling or experimenting in the room. Only one person was to enter the lab at any time with at most one assistant. No items in the lab were to be removed and all apparatus were to be destroyed after the experiment.</br>
</br>
This strict policy was due to the uncertainty of the Devil Worm's body carrying viruses, bacteria, or microorganisms that may threaten the ecosystem on Earth.</br>
</br>
It was not a joke.</br>
</br>
No one knew if the species that "traveled" through time three billion years ago possessed any obscure traits. Maybe bacteria in its intestines that facilitated digestion would be a biological weapon on Earth that could completely wipe out an endangered species.</br>
</br>
In short, the experiment began under strict rules.</br>
</br>
The first subject to be studied was its blood.</br>
</br>
"...its blood is highly corrosive, and it contains an organic acid that we have never seen before...unbelievable, it is more corrosive than trifluoromethanesulfonic acid!" As he examined the data displayed, Chemist Verdell Taylor from Frankberg exclaimed.</br>
</br>
There were shocked voices when they heard the words through the speaker.</br>
</br>
It was well known that trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is almost the strongest organic acid known. Not only was it widely used in medicine and chemicals. It could replace traditional sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and other traditional inorganic acids in many occasions to optimize and improve the process!</br>
</br>
However, after the organic acid in the blood of Devil Worm was separated and purified, it was even more corrosive than trifluoromethanesulfonic acid!</br>
</br>
This discovery alone was enough to have a substantial impact on the chemical industry. In the foreseeable future, after this news gets released, the chemical companies around the world would use every means they could to learn about the chemical formula of this new type of organic acid, and then research its application and production methods.</br>
</br>
The fervor in everyone's eyes suddenly grew brighter.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just then, a biologist from Russia spoke out.</br>
</br>
"What name should we give to this acid?"</br>
</br>
The room was silent, to the point where one could hear a single needle drop on the ground.</br>
</br>
This sentence made everyone, including Verdell Taylor in the isolation room, silent. The way everyone looked at the test tube was different.</br>
</br>
According to the rules of the scientific community, in general, whoever made the discovery received the naming rights. However, there were more than 50 scientists in this lab. They were all participating in the experiment, and all possessed a significant influence in the international scientific community.</br>
</br>
If the acid was named Taylor Acid just because Verdell Taylor conducted the acidity test, the scientists would be not be convinced.</br>
</br>
Separation, purification, and measurement of pH, any one of their students could have done that!</br>
</br>
Verdell Taylor, in his protective clothing, apparently realized this. He looked at Jiang Chen outside the room and wisely kicked the ball to the top dog. Effectively removing himself from the jealous and unconvinced gazes from his peers.</br>
</br>
"I think we should ask Celestial Trade for its opinion, after all, they found and collected the specimen..."</br>
</br>
This proposal barely got the nod of approval from the scientists.</br>
</br>
They also realized that it was a difficult problem to solve. Whoever receiving the naming rights would offend everyone else.</br>
</br>
"I agree."</br>
</br>
"You're right. Celestial Trade discovered it after all."</br>
</br>
"No comments."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process while he was under the watch of the scientists around the room.</br>
</br>
He was just there. What kind of opinion could he have?</br>
</br>
However, since others have asked this question, he decided to respect them. He lowered his head and pondered for a moment, and then said.</br>
</br>
"Let's call it Devil Acid, as for the patent... give it to the Earth Defense Alliance Foundation."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words silenced all the scientists, and they all simultaneously sighed in helplessness.</br>
</br>
This was a chance to win the Nobel Prize and be remembered in history, but the name ended by being... um, so sloppy.</br>
</br>
People say that Celestial Trade's president did not have the best taste in names, it certainly showed today.</br>
</br>
However, unlike those scientists who were sighing in grief, Jiang Chen was quite pleased with his name.</br>
</br>
Is formic acid not called formic acid? That's the same idea. The thing that the Devil Worm has should be called Devil Acid right? After all, at least it donated its blood. Give it some respect.</br>
</br>
As for Nobel Prize, a mark in history?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought that if all things went smoothly, his legendary life would leave a mark in history. Once he led the Earth Fleet to destroy Harmony's Colonization Ship, then force it to seek for mercy... he would definitely win the Nobel Peace Prize.</br>
</br>
As for the patent, it would be worth a lot of money. However, since he already owned so many assets, it did not matter in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, the majority of the Earth Defence Alliance funding went to Celestial Trade and Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
His thought process was on a different wavelength compared to those in research.</br>
</br>
The experiment continued.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen originally thought that one breakthrough discovery was great. He didn't expect exclamations from the isolation room would come one after another.</br>
</br>
"It's incredible! This blood cell morphology has completely refreshed my understanding of biology... It can complete life activities in such an extreme acid-alkaline environment!"</br>
</br>
"Its blood vessels can block hydrogen ions from entering tissue cells, but it doesn't interfere with the exchange of blood cells to the blood vessel. It's impossible... it's too unscientific!"</br>
</br>
"Let me take a sample again! Just once! I just found something incredibly important! This is what I have been studying! I need to—"</br>
</br>
"Hurry up! That subject is over. No matter what you found, go to the back of the line!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! Don't waste everyone's time!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the zealous scientists and was quite dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Where did their dignity go?</br>
</br>
Courtesy?</br>
</br>
The face of a true expert?</br>
</br>
Yesterday when they had the seminar, they were all respectful. After they saw the specimen, they completed changed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know that for a scientist in the science community, courtesy and respect meant nothing in front of breakthrough discoveries that could trigger an earthquake in the academic world! Many of them were already stalling in their research, but the ancient creature from Mars 3.7 billion years ago opened a new world for them, just like a new skill in the martial arts world.</br>
</br>
Courtesy? Dignity? What are those?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was the most surprised that the "worm" he tossed out, intending to please his allies, would turn out to be something different.</br>
</br>
It seemed... It seemed to be the discovery of a New World?</br>
</br>
So, he did not toss out a worm, but a treasure.</br>
</br>
Looking at the animated scientists, Jiang Chen did not know whether to cry or laugh...</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1242"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1242: The Theory of Oxygen Supply Layer</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Research on the Devil Worm was progressing slowly.</br>
</br>
It was not because of the inability of these scientists, but because every breakthrough discovery led to countless possibilities. The Devil Worm spread their roots of exploration to the boundaries of science and then expanded it to the unknown soil beyond their understanding.</br>
</br>
The scientists gathered here were like babies feeding on breast milk. They were ingesting unheard knowledge from a species that had lived for 3.7 billion years.</br>
</br>
The challenging topics in biology, genetics, chemistry, and other disciplines were tackled one by one, and they would evolve into new research branches.</br>
</br>
In the words of a biologist at the Hua Academy of Sciences, the existence of the Devil Worm already renewed the human understanding of biology.</br>
</br>
A few days ago, the world's largest arthropod on Earth was the 12-foot Japanese Spider Crab. However, Devil Worm's length was a daunting 15 meters. Also, its terrifying rock drilling ability could penetrate the metamorphic rock formations several kilometers or even tens of kilometers underground, which also brought new understandings of the limits of organisms.</br>
</br>
In particular, the massive force behind its two pairs of incisors, in theory, could even cut an entire rebar, or even the armor on the T-3 power armor. Only the rover on Mars nearly one hundred tons in mass could survive the impact of its bite.</br>
</br>
Its hardened shell also protected it from being cut by fragmented rock formations during high-speed movements, and its defense was sufficient to be immune from 12.7mm heavy machinegun bullets. Fortunately, Celestial Trade Marines used Gauss rifles, and the armored vehicle was equipped with large-caliber guns and rockets. Otherwise, breaking through the armor would be a challenging enough task.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen received the combat analysis of the Devil Worm, his first reaction was linking it to the Death Claws.</br>
</br>
From his impression, only creatures like Death Claws could fight against power armors.</br>
</br>
Inaccurately speaking, it should be the claws of the Death Claws and the shell of the Mud Crabs. A Death Claw alone would have no fighting chance against a Devil Worm. In all the creatures that Jiang Chen had seen before, perhaps only the Mother of Death Claw could outpower a Devil Worm</br>
</br>
Later, due to the growing number of discoveries, the research subjects became more and more detailed and specific, and the coverage became more and more widespread. Therefore, they realized there was actually a lack of people.</br>
</br>
To address this problem, more than a dozen scientists jointly requested Jiang Chen to invite several well-known scientists in the academic world, but whose nationality did not belong to the four major member states. It was so the problems encountered in the study could utilize the conclusions already made in their respective fields.</br>
</br>
After some discretion, Jiang Chen exchanged views with representatives of Hua, Russia, and Frankberg before finally relaxing the restrictions on nationality.</br>
</br>
</br>
Some of the candidates were selected from the list provided by the joint petitioners. The Earth Defense Alliance issued 11 invitation letters to the South Asian countries, the three countries in Eastern Europe, India, and other minor member states, and authorized them to participate in parts of the project. Also, scientists from Finland, Donetsk, and Nippon, countries that were actively promoting accession to the Earth Defense Alliance, received approval.</br>
</br>
However, this led to another problem. That was, the news of the Devil Worm arriving in Celestial Trade could no longer be concealed...</br>
</br>
"Verdell Taylor, is there something you need?" In the lounge next to the lab, Jiang Chen put down the newspaper and looked at him as he walked into the lounge, " If it's a new joint petition, I'm afraid I will be unable to meet your requirements as we receive thousands of petitions from universities in Europe every day in our mailbox. Too many people want to squeeze in here... It's also difficult for us."</br>
</br>
When Verdell Taylor heard what Jiang Chen said, he touched his nose in embarrassment and apologized.</br>
</br>
His name was one of the names in the petition.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was always friendly towards scientists and he did his best to accommodate their requests. Verdell Taylor learned the troubles that his request brought to Celestial Trade and the Earth Defense Alliance, so he did feel apologetic toward Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"It has nothing to do with the petition," Verdell Taylor coughed, then said, "We have made new discoveries in the study."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen looked at him, intrigued, "What did you find?"</br>
</br>
"You know, the entire atmosphere on Mars is made up of carbon dioxide and everything from the groundwater to the rock formations is acidic." Verdell Taylor paused, then said, "Based on our previous research, Devil Worms can survive in an acidic environment, and even its blood is a strong acid. Therefore, it's highly likely this is the result of natural selection from more than three billion years ago."</br>
</br>
"But later, the scientists we invited to the team came up with different opinions."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"In addition to the strong acid blood, we also found some unique organic compounds in its blood." Verdell Taylor wrote a string of chemical formulas on the whiteboard, of which Jiang Chen could not comprehend with his knowledge. "And this organic compound can only exist in a strong acid environment."</br>
</br>
"...My chemistry knowledge is only at that of an undergraduate student." Jiang Chen said while looking at the long list of chemical formulas on the whiteboard.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to understand it, you just need to recognize this symbol." Verdell Taylor shook his head and pointed to the letter O in the formula. "These represent oxygen atoms."</br>
</br>
"I do know this..." Suddenly, Jiang Chen found the strangeness in the formula.</br>
</br>
Almost after every few letters, he could see an uppercase O.</br>
</br>
This may be a bit amateur of an explanation, but it intuitively reflected the problem.</br>
</br>
"Even if this Mars creature could survive in an acidic environment, it would never be able to survive without oxygen." Verdell Taylor said in a tone with absolute certainty. "We have not yet named this organic compound, but it's an organic compound that can only exist in a strongly acidic environment, and this exact compound gives the Devil Worm the ability to move in an anaerobic environment!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood the message.</br>
</br>
There was no oxygen on the surface of Mars. And not just on the surface, but oxygen must also be depleted in the caves underground. The Devil Worms that moved underground like worms must possessed an organ that held oxygen. Jiang Chen suspected it may be a kind of high-pressure airbag, but it turned out the blood was the enabler…</br>
</br>
Wait, if there is no oxygen on the surface and underground, where is it getting its oxygen?</br>
</br>
There is also the Gaia civilization. He never noticed this problem but how did civilizations breathe underground? It's just unrealistic to think they mastered air filtration in the Stone Age.</br>
</br>
How did these Mars creatures survive underground?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly realized the problem.</br>
</br>
And Verdell Taylor's next sentence revealed the answer to this question.</br>
</br>
"The oxygen content in the atmosphere is less than 1%, and it's impossible to provide the oxygen needed for an arthropod of this size," Verdell Taylor said with a hint of excitement. "So, we can say with certainty that there must be a location underground with high oxygen concentration! We call it 'Oxygen Supply Layer'!"</br>
</br>
"Oxygen Supply Layer?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Verdell Taylor nodded, and the excitement between his eyebrows grew stronger and stronger. "I'm sure that in this special underground layer, there must be some special anaerobic fungus. This fungus has adapted to the Mars environment and survives in the acidic environment by consuming carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Its energy source may be geothermal, or it may be the Devil Worm's feces, but it acts as both a producer and a decomposer. Only with the presence of this fungi could the underground biosphere form into a locked loop!"</br>
</br>
"I was invited by SpaceX to design an anaerobic bacterium that could survive in a medium-acid environment for their Mars atmosphere transformation project."</br>
</br>
"Do you know what this bacterium means to us?" Verdell Taylor said with euphoria and zeal on his face.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen could already guess it, he still asked the question.</br>
</br>
"What does this mean?"</br>
</br>
"It means we will be able to transform the atmosphere on Mars!"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Transform Mars' atmosphere.</br>
</br>
It sounded like a millennium project.</br>
</br>
They would not only have to increase the oxygen content in the atmosphere, but also bring in greenhouse gases to increase the thickness of the atmosphere, and at the same time find an alternative to the geomagnetic field to avoid the newly generated atmosphere being blown away by solar winds.</br>
</br>
Moreover, Jiang Chen's positioning of Mars was originally an arsenal of the Earth Fleet. From his perspective, the idea of transforming Mars into a terrestrial planet was not attractive.</br>
</br>
But then again, Verdell Taylor's words finally reminded Jiang Chen of something.</br>
</br>
When he first entered the underground ruins, it seemed that the air monitoring component of the drone detected higher oxygen content compared to the surface on Mars.</br>
</br>
At first, he thought it was because it resembled the atmospheric environment of Mars 3.7 billion years ago, but he overlooked the fact it was located several kilometers deep underground...</br>
</br>
After reporting his progress to Jiang Chen, Verdell Taylor excitedly asked if he could take a flight to Mars, but was immediately shut down by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Perhaps these scientists were ready to dedicate themselves to the cause of science, but he couldn't risk losing a brilliant scientist.</br>
</br>
To defeat the enemy, he must first understand the enemy.</br>
</br>
While Celestial Trade was still developing itself capability, the fifty scientists were already standing at the forefront of resisting the invasion of Harmony. The more understanding they gained of the biological civilization, the higher the Earth Defense Alliance' chance was of winning.</br>
</br>
What's more, before Jiang Chen dug out the ruins on Mars, he would not send any uncontrolled factors up there.</br>
</br>
Afterall, Verdell Taylor was from Frankberg, which represented the Frankberg government; he was not Xin nor a part of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen proposed a compromise of bringing more Devil Worm specimen back.</br>
</br>
Based on the response of Captain Hong Zewei, the administrator of the Mars colony, there seemed to be a lot of these bugs around Mine 071. As long as the soldiers remained in the vehicles and the specimens were collected through robots and vehicles, the danger should be minimal.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen also sent a message to Kelvin to ask him to tell the staff on the Mars colony to keep an eye on the speculation made by Verdell Taylor on the existence of an "Oxygen Supply Layer".</br>
</br>
If it did exist, it would be another groundbreaking discovery. One that shakes the academic world if they obtained some anaerobic fungi from that layer...</br>
</br>
If all went accordingly to plan.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Mars colony.</br>
</br>
The gusting sand ravaged in the desert.</br>
</br>
The large sheds that were originally located near the cabin were completely destroyed.</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei stood inside as he looked at the ruins outside the window and sighed with a headache.</br>
</br>
</br>
As for what happened to the destroyed sheds outside?</br>
</br>
Everything started with a "foolish" command...</br>
</br>
Four days ago, Marines once again set off from the colony.</br>
</br>
This time they had a well-planned strategy. They first parked their vehicle near Mine 071 and immediately used drones to lure the Devil Worms out from underground, then they detonated the explosives on the drone and killed two Devil Worms from afar.</br>
</br>
At the request of the Space Command Center, they tied the bodies of two Devil Worms with hooks and dragged the two fresh specimens back to the colony.</br>
</br>
In the next two days, they killed a total of ten Devil Worms with the same method.</br>
</br>
Just when they thought these bugs were nothing to fear.</br>
</br>
They finally enraged these monsters.</br>
</br>
The destroyed sheds outside the colony were the most evident example.</br>
</br>
The smarter Devil Worms no longer bit the drones and even stopped touching the vehicles that they could not pierce through. Following the blood of their same kind, they tracked down the colony and were immediately shocked by everything in front of them.</br>
</br>
For more than three billion years, no living things existed on the surface of Mars, to the point that they had completely forgotten the existence of Mars' surface. But after eating fungi and other arthropods for so long, they were surprised to find neighbors on the barren surface.</br>
</br>
The floor of the colonial cabin was too thick, and they could not drill through it.</br>
</br>
But other buildings were not so lucky.</br>
</br>
The farms in the colony were left with countless holes. The newly built ranch was completely torn apart with all the crops and livestock inside eaten.</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the fact that the colony was wise enough to not put all of its eggs in one basket, and still maintained an indoor breeding center and an open-air farm within the main building, food for the colonists would be another urgent issue.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, these Devil Worms were only interested in moving creatures. Otherwise, it would have been disastrous if the brine desalination device was destroyed.</br>
</br>
Addicted to the new taste, they roamed near the colony every day to seek for more prey.</br>
</br>
Now, even travel for the staff was difficult. Other than the Marines' missions, all activities outside were forced to terminate.</br>
</br>
No one knew where the bugs would pop up from, and no one dared to gamble if they were there or not.</br>
</br>
"The study of Mine 071 was the wrong decision. If we didn't wake up the monsters from underground, we could have been safe." A blond female stood in front of the Marines, full of emotions, "And now, everyone's work has been affected!"</br>
</br>
She was a colleague of James and an employee of Future Mining. The Marines acted quietly and politely around Future Group employees, but an order remained an order and no one could change this.</br>
</br>
"You can go explain to the headquarters. Celestial City needs more specimens, and we're just following the order." Zhang Hai buckled the last button of his kinetic skeleton, checked the safety on the Gauss rifle, and then gestured to the soldiers behind him to walk around the woman.</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai was the captain of this team of Marines. He commanded the past missions.</br>
</br>
He was aware of the recent uneasiness in the colony and understood the rationale.</br>
</br>
He also did not feel great about those bugs that suddenly popped out of nowhere. No one knew more about how annoying and difficult those worms were to deal with. A soldier already died in the post and another one was still receiving limb regeneration treatment in the emergency room.</br>
</br>
Maybe the tension in the colony could be alleviated once reinforcements arrived.</br>
</br>
However, Zhang Hai thought that even when the expeditionary forces arrive, it would still be futile.</br>
</br>
The worms would not directly engage in combat at all. They were like seagulls, skipping on top of the water, flying away after a single blow, and barely stopping on the surface at all. Even if more Marines landed on Mars, what could they do without knowing how to drill holes?</br>
</br>
However, Zhang Hai, who was preparing to board the vehicle, saw the icon of [Mission Terminated] on the AR screen of his helmet.</br>
</br>
He was not the only one that saw the same message.</br>
</br>
The other six Marines who already gathered into the vehicle also saw it.</br>
</br>
"The mission is canceled? What happened?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know..."</br>
</br>
"It's the command from the Space Command Center."</br>
</br>
Just as Zhang Hai frowned, and thought he should ask Captain Hong Zewei if the task should still continue, he heard an exclamation.</br>
</br>
"Wait... look above! What is that?!"</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai suddenly looked above and followed his comrades' sight.</br>
</br>
Through the transparent graphene dome, black figures emerged above the colony one after another. Just like a meteor shower, the figures gradually enlarged in everyone's surprised expression.</br>
</br>
"Reinforcements?" With surprise in his tone, someone muttered.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, they are finally here!" A soldier said with relief.</br>
</br>
It's reinforcements!</br>
</br>
Zhang Hai was also emotional.</br>
</br>
The transport ship that carried a thousand Marines finally arrived on the Mars synchronous orbit!</br>
</br>
Although he didn't think these people could not bring too much change to the status quo on Mars, even he could not deny the boost in morale he received from seeing them.</br>
</br>
At this point, the issue bothering him for so long finally went away.</br>
</br>
In the days to come, at least his team would no longer be fighting alone.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1244: Only So-so!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
From the depths of darkness, a giant ship approached the orange-red planet. The words TS Expedition were engraved on the hull and blended in perfectly with the black armor. Just like a sharp sword piercing through the darkness, it alluded a deadly vibe among the stars.</br>
</br>
The bowl-shaped engine ejected a red glow, and then the glow suddenly disappeared.</br>
</br>
Under the influence of inertia, the Seagull-class transport ship slowly stopped on the synchronous orbit of Mars.</br>
</br>
"The main engine off."</br>
</br>
"Secondary engine ignited."</br>
</br>
"The orbital parameters have been corrected."</br>
</br>
"The feedback beam is confirmed. The center of gravity is normal. Confirmed to enter the synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
"The secondary engine off."</br>
</br>
After a series of commands, the serious and tense atmosphere in the bridge disappeared.</br>
</br>
A man in a military uniform walked to the captain's side and saluted.</br>
</br>
"Captain, we have arrived above the colony! Waiting for your orders!"</br>
</br>
The majestic man in the bridge gazed at the fiery red planet outside the window.</br>
</br>
"Order the deactivation of the hibernation chamber."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Outside the bridge, inside the transport cabin.</br>
</br>
The lights on the wall began to illuminate one after another as they lit up the rectangular space.</br>
</br>
The hibernation chambers along the wall emitted a blue glow as gas escaped from the edges between the hatch and the chamber itself.</br>
</br>
The hibernation chambers opened and the soldiers inside opened their eyes. They pushed out of the half-closed hatch doors. Just like what they performed many times in exercises, they rushed to their battle positions in an orderly manner.</br>
</br>
The crew in blue overalls headed swiftly to the function bays of artillery, observation, power, and the Marines in gray-white uniforms rushed into the arsenal and equipped themselves with space kinetic skeletons and Gauss rifles. They all waited in the buffer cabin on standby.</br>
</br>
Inside the bridge.</br>
</br>
The officer returned to the captain and saluted again.</br>
</br>
"All hibernation chambers have deactivated."</br>
</br>
"Connect the colony channel."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
The holographic screen emerged in the middle of the bridge, and after a series of white flickering images, the image on the screen quickly stabilized.</br>
</br>
When the man appeared on the screen, from the captain's calm expression, there was a smile that was beginning to form.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Hong Zewei sighed in relief as he stood in the command room of the colony and looked at the friend on the screen who had finished his captain training one year after him.</br>
</br>
Hong Zewei cleared his throat, and with a composed voice, he expressed his welcome to the arrival of the reinforcements on behalf of the colony.</br>
</br>
"This is Mars colony. We welcome the expedition force to enter the bay."</br>
</br>
"This is Expedition. The first group of Marines is airborne. Thank you for your hard work."</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When he looked up above the colony, the joy and shock in Zhang Hai's eyes magnified.</br>
</br>
The prism-shaped airdrop cabins dragged a blue glow, and left clear trajectories in the sky. They eventually crashed into the desert near the colony.</br>
</br>
The dust of Mars was sent high up into the air and the impact wave blew the red sand instantly away.</br>
</br>
The hatches on all sides opened and smashed into the ground.</br>
</br>
New combat vehicles rolled out from the airdrop cabins as they left trails of dust.</br>
</br>
The new combat vehicle was called Pathfinder T-2. Compared to Pathfinder T-1, previously equipped for the colony, the new vehicle had higher tonnage, a hybrid track-design that replaced the rubber tires and rapid-fire guns that fired electromagnetic shells.</br>
</br>
These improvements were designed to deal with extraterrestrial armor units that may appear near Mine 071. Except they did not expect that there would only be a weathered ruin under Mine 071 without any thing else in sight.</br>
</br>
However, the situation took another twisted turn, and the Devil Worms that emerged from underground caught Celestial Trade by surprise. The one hundred Pathfinder T-2s were then deployed to eradicate Devil Worms which provided armor protection for vulnerable targets.</br>
</br>
The movement outside the colony attracted the attention of the Devil Worms nearby.</br>
</br>
When the Devil Worms felt the tremors from the surface, they drilled out from the oxygen supply layer. Like the mythical earth dragons that roamed in the ground in old legends, they accelerated to the source of the tremor, before they penetrated out from the ground and bit down on the "new neighbors" they haven't even encountered yet.</br>
</br>
"REEEEE-!"</br>
</br>
The muffled screeching of the Devil Worms sounded like cries of pain. The two pairs of sickles hit the sturdy armor but only left a crack the size of a thumb.</br>
</br>
The large-scale rapid-fire guns began to rampage with glaring lights emitting from the fearsome barrels. The shells accelerated to multiple times the speed of sound, then instantly ruptured the armor of the Devil Worms and turned those bugs into sieves. Devil Worms crawled out from the ground one after another, just like worms after a storm, they bit toward the vehicles.</br>
</br>
However, the unintelligent creatures were unable to comprehend the stupidity of their behavior.</br>
</br>
The sickle that could slice granite was stopped by the Grade-A steel. Unable to break the armor of the vehicle, it at most posed interference to the attack of the vehicles. But when the bugs realized this point and started their retreat into the ground, it was already too late.</br>
</br>
Inside the spaceship, the captain who had ended communication with the colony locked onto the red dots on the satellite map.</br>
</br>
Life detection device.</br>
</br>
The maximum depth of detection for underground creatures was only five kilometers, but for those Devil Worms that sensed the tremor on the surface and already moved upwards, they were within range.</br>
</br>
When the armored units of Celestial Marines completed its assembly, he immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
"Depth five kilometers, launch the underground seeking missile!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
As soon as an order was issued, the crew members in the bridge immediately began to execute.</br>
</br>
"Weapon is loaded!"</br>
</br>
"The coordinates are locked!"</br>
</br>
A long stripe-shaped object was separated from the SS Expedition. After it had fallen for some distance, an orange-red flame suddenly surged out from the silenced engine at the tail.</br>
</br>
Under the dual action of gravity and engine propulsion, the missile began to accelerate as it crossed the distance of 17,031 kilometers before it smashed into the sand dune.</br>
</br>
When the dust dissipated, the sand dune was quiet, much like in the silent bridge...</br>
</br>
On the holographic screen in the middle of the bridge, the red dot that was the focus of everyone's attention quickly descended.</br>
</br>
When the altitude value jumped to negative five kilometers, the gunner calmly said.</br>
</br>
"Hit confirmed!"</br>
</br>
Almost at the moment when he finished this sentence, the flame was like rolling magma, engulfing the rock and tunnels with Devil Worms lurking into an ocean of fire.</br>
</br>
Thousands of degrees of high temperature even ignited the air, even the metamorphic rock could not withstand such a high temperature, as the rock directly liquefied into magma. The magma dripped into the next layer and formed into pointy stalagmites.</br>
</br>
No creature could survive through this purgatory.</br>
</br>
Even the species that survived over 3.7 billion years lost to the weapons of the civilized.</br>
</br>
The raging flame quickly dissipated.</br>
</br>
A string of red dots that marked life on the screen also extinguished.</br>
</br>
An officer walked to the captain and stood upright, clean, and neat.</br>
</br>
"A total of twenty-seven Devil Worm kills confirmed!"</br>
</br>
The captain listened to the report from the first officer, then nodded. There was a sense of pride hidden deep in his pupils.</br>
</br>
Devil Worms?</br>
</br>
Alien species?</br>
</br>
In front of the iron hoof of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
They are only so-so!</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1245: The Summit That Shocked the World</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The battle on Mars happened over a week ago and January quickly came to an end.</br>
</br>
The original plan was not altered due to external controversies. Celestial Trade Biotechnology Summit was held as scheduled at the end of the month.</br>
</br>
The Biotechnology Summit was held in "Heart of the Sea" in the northern part of Coro Island. The large-scale landmark building that integrated shopping, accommodation, leisure, and business was one of the defining structures of Xin and was printed on all tourism advertisements.</br>
</br>
A total of ten Devil Worm specimens were dissected and made into a total of more than 500 exhibits. The exhibits were transported by Celestial Marines to the Convention and Exhibition Center. These specimens ranged from the tissue cells of the Devil Worm to the entire specimen itself. Exhibits such as blood, heart, and limbs were individually exhibited.</br>
</br>
All the exhibits were tightly sealed in a vacuum by a double-layer bullet-proof glass. An incendiary bomb was placed inside the display. If a leak was detected, the incendiary would ignite to generate temperature over 5,000 degrees, which would destroy all samples inside the display. It was designed to prevent the invasion of foreign bacteria and viruses into the ecological environment of the city.</br>
</br>
Because the bomb charge was strictly controlled, people outside would not be harmed.</br>
</br>
In addition to the exhibits, Celestial Marines also appeared at the summit. A soldier in kinetic skeleton stood next to each large showcase and held a loaded Reaper Assault Rifle.</br>
</br>
The exhibition would run for one month.</br>
</br>
On the first day of the exhibition, the number of tourists in Heart of the Sea doubled. The Xin Ministry of Transport had to send more traffic police to maintain the order in nearby areas to ensure that foreign delegations and media could enter the venue… The ancient vehicles that could not operate on maglev roads were indeed troublesome.</br>
</br>
It was not only journalists and scholars who were allowed to enter the exhibition, many tourists that visited Coro City would also not miss this opportunity.</br>
</br>
After all, it was a Mars species that they have never seen in this life! Or the life before!</br>
</br>
Everyone used to think there was only an empty desert on the red planet.</br>
</br>
Even if they placed a dinosaur specimen in the exhibition, the venue would still be packed. It wouldn't matter if people didn't understand what they see, the purpose was to take photos…</br>
</br>
"My God, this bug is huge!" A tourist exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Mom, I want a photo of me riding on top of it!" The bratty child cried as he dragged on his mother's sleeve.</br>
</br>
"At this size, it's difficult to associate it with insects..." Someone commented</br>
</br>
Of course, for safety reasons, visitors could only take photos outside of the safety line. They could not take photos too close to the specimen.</br>
</br>
Media reporters were allowed to cross the line but were also not allowed to touch the glass showcase.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, pictures were enough to showcase the fearsome nature of the giant-sized Devil Worm from 3.7 billion years ago.</br>
</br>
"The longest Devil Worm specimen has reached 20 meters, and the shortest is still 13 meters long... seven times bigger than the largest known arthropod, the Japanese Spider Crab! Its existence has opened up a new perspective on arthropods!"</br>
</br>
"What kind of gene do they possess to allow them to survive more than three billion years? Perhaps only the mysterious nature has an answer..."</br>
</br>
"Mars is a crazy place!"</br>
</br>
"I can't wait to go to Mars to give an interview with these big guys, but Celestial Trade staff recommended me not to do that..."</br>
</br>
In the venue, reporters commented on these specimens in front of cameras. Although the information available to them was only surface level, it was more than enough to satisfy the public's curiosity about Mar's creatures.</br>
</br>
A BBC reporter was speaking in front of a specimen and as he finished his speech on the Devil Worm's blood, he then saw a group of people had gathered at one corner of the venue.</br>
</br>
He remembered there was no exhibits there.</br>
</br>
"A crowd gathered in front of the organizer's office. Most of them are over 50 years old. What happened? Let's interview one of them... Hello, mister, are you here—"</br>
</br>
"Protest!" The old man with glasses and a white beard said with anger, "As you can see, we are protesting! Why can't we participate in the research! They are obstructing academic freedom!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! On behalf of the Harvard School of Life Sciences, I protest against what Celestial Trade is doing. Nationality should not be an obstruction to scientific progress!" The professor moved closer to the camera and expressed his dissatisfaction. "I clearly received a nomination for the Devil Worm Research Team, but the Earth Defense Alliance crossed me off the list because of my nationality? That is too strange!"</br>
</br>
He had attended many scientific research summits, and he was invited every single time by the organizer. However, this was the first summit he took the initiative and applied to attend for a summit, and he was rejected!</br>
</br>
If this happened any where else, he would have blacklisted the company for life.</br>
</br>
However this time...</br>
</br>
He purchased the ticket at his own expense.</br>
</br>
There was no other reason than the fact that it was an exhibit on Mar's species. Even if he could not get into the lab, he still wished to see its appearance. So he considered this a vacation at the island on western Pacific.</br>
</br>
However, when he saw the 20-meter-long Devil Worm, and the green blood labeled as highly acidic on the side of the showcase, his odd compulsive disorder suddenly started to take effect - feeling uncomfortable if he did not touch the specimen syndrome!</br>
</br>
However, when he went to see the staff at the summit and showed his identity, and then subtly hinted at the fact that he could help the summit by studying the specimen and offering some advice, the staff member brought him here with an eccentric look... and that's how he joined the protesters.</br>
</br>
"Professor, may I ask you for your name?" Seeing that the old man looked familiar, the BBC reporter quietly asked.</br>
</br>
"Martin Karplus!"</br>
</br>
The BBC reporter immediately showed his respect, but at the same time, disbelief grew in his eyes.</br>
</br>
As a reporter who has focused on technology interviews for many years, he was certainly familiar with this old man. Martin Karplus was the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The creation of multiscale models for complex chemical systems was a milestone for chemical technology!</br>
</br>
However, it was because of the shocking identity of the old man which made the reporter even more confused.</br>
</br>
A respected academic scholar like him normally did not accept invitations from normal companies! Now that Martin Karplus offered to help, Celestial Trade should not rejected the offer.</br>
</br>
However, the reporter soon saw a familiar face behind Martin Karplus.</br>
</br>
Michael Levitt!</br>
</br>
Like Martin Karplus, he was also one of the winners of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with dual citizenship in the UA and the United Kingdom. He graduated from Cambridge and was a professor of structural biology at Stanford University.</br>
</br>
He was awarded for the same reason as Martin Karplus, but his research direction was different. Professor Michael's research field was mainly bio-computing, and he was one of the first scientists to design DNA and protein molecular dynamics simulation! He ultimately started a new era of "structure to function" in the field of biophysics!</br>
</br>
In a simple sentence, these two were the "great magicians" in the scientific community.</br>
</br>
However, these "great magicians" were blocked from attending the summit?</br>
</br>
He then looked at the other people... Their fame and achievements were no inferior compared to the Nobel Prize winners, or perhaps even superior.</br>
</br>
The BBC reporter sensed a story and immediately asked the assistant to direct the camera. He walked forward with a smile, handed the microphone to them, and gave them an opportunity to express their dissatisfaction…</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1246: Made Headlines Again?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the same night.</br>
</br>
The BBC broadcasted an interview.</br>
</br>
In addition to the specimens being exhibited, the protests of more than 30 professors in front of the office were also broadcasted.</br>
</br>
Online.</br>
</br>
On Twitter.</br>
</br>
On Facebook.</br>
</br>
On the social media platform dominated by western crowds, the platforms were all enraged after they learned the news.</br>
</br>
"Even Martin Karplus has been rejected? What do Celestial Trade want to do?!"</br>
</br>
"And Michael Levitt, I know him, he is an outstanding alumnus of Cambridge!"</br>
</br>
"Although I don't recognize these names, why are they stopping us from participating in the research? Why?"</br>
</br>
"It feels like going back to the Cold War era, an iron curtain is falling from the Pacific Ocean..."</br>
</br>
"This is obstructing academic freedom!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The voices on social media were divided into two distinct sides, some expressed their understanding. After all, Celestial Trade collected the specimens. While the other side condemned Celestial Trade for the lack of social responsibility and the use of Cold War mentality to obstruct academic freedom.</br>
</br>
Of course, most people followed the event for the drama. After all, Heart of the Sea's venue allowed free entry and many tourists took photos and posted them on their social media account. Many were also able to satisfy their curiosity of the Mars creature.</br>
</br>
As for "academic freedom" and "Cold War mentality", only a few cared about these two schools of thought.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of most people, what was the fuss about being able to see a few specimens?</br>
</br>
These disputes on Facebook and Twitter were blocked outside an impenetrable firewall to the audience in Hua. However, many people still watched the BBC video that was uploaded and learned about the incident and expressed their thoughts.</br>
</br>
Not on Facebook and Twitter.</br>
</br>
On Weibo.</br>
</br>
On WeChat.</br>
</br>
And on Future 1.0.</br>
</br>
It was a completely contrary set of opinions.</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade is OP!"</br>
</br>
"Haha, so what if they're angry. They didn't bring us onto the ISS. They placed a blockade on high-precision CNC and technology for half a century. I didn't see them yelling about academic freedom and science without borders!"</br>
</br>
"They were asked to join Earth Defense Alliance and refused. As to why you are not allowed to participate, ask your leader."</br>
</br>
When there was a lot of discussion on social media, the traditional media also covered this matter.</br>
</br>
Finally, the committee of the Earth Defense Alliance held a press conference to specifically address this matter.</br>
</br>
Kelvin spoke in front of the media, "The Earth Defense Alliance has rights to selectively release research on extraterrestrial biology and civilization to the international community. This is mainly due to security considerations and the decision is jointly made by all member states. Please do not over-interpret the decision."</br>
</br>
</br>
However, how can this situation not be over-interpreted?</br>
</br>
For the behemoth known as the Earth Defense Alliance, any decision could be studied closely by major think tanks. In particular, the professors had already called out to their students to sign a petition. By now, the petition already exceeded 100,000 signatures which must be addressed by the government.</br>
</br>
However, while everyone was speculating what the UA would do, the Capitol's response was rather calm. It stated that the matter was being discussed with the Earth Defense Alliance member states but then there was no more follow-ups.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally or not, shortly after the exhibition began, an abandoned rocket launch site near B City restarted its operation under NASA and SpaceX. The new Falcon rocket collecting dust in the warehouse once again went up and began its preparations for launching.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In February, scientists from all over the world began to develop synergies with each other while Devil Worm's research started to enter the right track. The four newly built isolation rooms allowed for far more efficient research.</br>
</br>
After several meetings with the member states revolving around the issue of Mars and the soon-to-be-completed million-ton spaceship, Jiang Chen returned to the surface on the space elevator.</br>
</br>
Before coming home, Jiang Chen first went to Coconut Island, and sent a small freezer with sample cells sealed in the interdimensional transport device to Lin Lin's laboratory. Then he finally went home after half a month to continue the game he did not finish last time...</br>
</br>
Coro Island Mansion.</br>
</br>
In the night, a breeze blew and the coconut trees outside the window swayed its leaves to hide the intimate moonlight.</br>
</br>
"You made headlines again." Natasha's eyes rolled as she tried to change the subject.</br>
</br>
"You are on the man that made headlines."</br>
</br>
The topic ended.</br>
</br>
Natasha realized that she failed to divert Jiang Chen's attention, so she gritted her teeth and rolled her eyes again.</br>
</br>
"...you have a surprising number of fans. What do you think happened today? At noon today, the embassy's new translator, who is super-hot, asked me what kind of person you are while holding onto the cover of Moscow Times. She also asked whether or not she could meet you..."</br>
</br>
"Oh? What kind of person am I?"</br>
</br>
Natasha rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen, who was smirking, then gnashed her teeth while she shook her head to move her sweat-drenched hair aside. She was panting on top of the chestboard with an expression that looked like she was dying, "Are you even Asian? I suspect you are..."</br>
</br>
"I am?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"An alien."</br>
</br>
Natasha looked at Jiang Chen seriously as she adjusted her disordered breathing.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
They exchanged eye contact in silence for a minute.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slapped on the curvature with a smirk as Natasha responded with a high-pitched moan.</br>
</br>
"Don't even think about escaping this one, you still have 972 push-ups and 1,720 squats to do. Jean is counting for me."</br>
</br>
"Actually, it's 972 and 1727." The watch shimmered slightly, and Jean's unemotional electronic voice sounded from the bedside table.</br>
</br>
"Oh, God, kill me!" Natasha rolled her eyes back, "Just finish me."</br>
</br>
"Not possible, Miss. Agent," Jiang Chen said with a sly smile, "We decided. Whoever loses is going to be punished."</br>
</br>
As soon as she heard the word punishment, her expression changed to sadness and she looked like she was about to cry.</br>
</br>
She should not have played this game with him.</br>
</br>
This guy is ridiculous!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
A game is just a game after all. When one side can't last any longer, the fun to continue is no longer there.</br>
</br>
After Natasha finally got tired and seeked for mercy, Jiang Chen teased her a few times before he finally gained the upper hand in the game. After a high-pitched moan, he fell asleep with the weary and satisfied "blonde kitten."</br>
</br>
The next morning, when the first morning ray scattered in, Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
He lazily turned on the bed and saw Natasha was already getting dressed. He then said mockingly, "I can't believe you got out of bed earlier than me. I knew I shouldn't have trusted your expression."</br>
</br>
"You also know that I was a special agent," Natasha curved her charming lips and swayed her hair, she then combed them to the back of her head and said joyously, "You're just not as good as you think you are if you still fall for the same trick."</br>
</br>
"Don't even, I just let you have it. Or shall we try it once more tonight?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Today, you belong to Xia Shiyu," Her golden ponytail swayed as she left Jiang Chen, and left Jiang Chen with only the image of her back. Suddenly, she said, with a smirk, "You can express all your dissatisfaction with me on her."</br>
</br>
Natasha pleasingly walked to the door. Just as she opened the door, her knee suddenly gave out as she almost fell down.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, she made up her resilient appearance.</br>
</br>
When she looked back, she saw the grin in his eyes. She left him with a dirty look before she closed the door and walked away.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen silently gave her his blessing to not fall again. Then he got dressed before he left the bedroom.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Biotechnology Summit was still ongoing. The scientist who protested for three days to no avail already dispersed. They disappointedly left on planes and returned home.</br>
</br>
Devil Acid extracted from the Devil Worm had already seen industry applications based on research from by the Chemical Research Institute of Future Heavy Industries. Two large chemical plants were built in New Malaysia Special District. The acid would be used in Future Biology's pharmaceutical plants, Future Heavy Industries' factories and the shipyards in the synchronous orbit to replace the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid required in some parts of the original production process.</br>
</br>
The small change would yield an increase of 1-5% in efficiency for Future Heavy Industries in the next year.</br>
</br>
While the number appeared to be trivial, Future Heavy Industries' total industrial output was equivalent to the output of a developing country.</br>
</br>
Not only Devil Acid, but also some of the organic materials extracted from Devil Worm's shell were applied to the military to optimize the composite material on the kinetic skeleton. The optimized kinetic skeleton's weight would be reduced by 1-3% while its material strength would increase by 5%.</br>
</br>
The few percentages of improvements should not be underestimated. Originally, the M-Series assault rifles had a difficult time penetrating the kinetic skeleton armor at mid-range without special bullets. Now with the additional 5% armor buff, the assault rifles would be even less effective.</br>
</br>
</br>
As for the weight reduction.</br>
</br>
No one would ever complain about the equipment being too light, especially the infantry fighting among bullets.</br>
</br>
This technological advancement resulted from biological research previously obtained from Death Claws.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen vaguely remembered that Jiang Lin mentioned this to him a long time ago. Some of the materials on the early K1 kinetic skeleton were extracted from the shell on the head of Death Claws. And the Mother of Death Claw that he killed directly resulted in a 5% increase in defense for the new K1 kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
He did not think too much of the changes. Since at that time, his force in either world could be considered powerful.</br>
</br>
With Celestial Trade's current scale, the minor changes could exponentially increase the overall combat effectiveness of his forces...</br>
</br>
The research on the Devil Worm continued.</br>
</br>
Researchers from all over the world practically lived inside the lab. Like the treasure hunters in the labyrinth, they were searching for more amazing treasures on the specimens...</br>
</br>
At the same time, a battle report and a list of supplies floated from Mars tens of millions of kilometers away and into Jiang Chen's hands.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the past week, TS Expedition killed a total of five hundred Devil Worms, but only managed to recover 21 specimens. Most of the Devil Worms died in the flames of the incendiary bombs.</br>
</br>
"Two hundred rounds of earth-boring incendiary missiles, ten tons of small-caliber shells, fifty tons of vehicle-mounted shells, and even more weapon batteries… we're burning money too fast right?" It was the impression Jiang Chen received after reading through the list of supplies.</br>
</br>
"The consumption is indeed too high." Kelvin nodded in agreement.</br>
</br>
"I want to know now how much incendiary bombs we need to return our Mars colony back to normal." When Jiang Chen pointed to the list, he immediately identified the key of the problem.</br>
</br>
Without knowing the number of enemies left, regardless how many bugs Celestial Trade killed, it would serve no purpose.</br>
</br>
Kelvin also captured this point.</br>
</br>
However, he did not have a good explanation for it.</br>
</br>
"Devil Worm's activity range is five kilometers below the surface. This range is beyond the range of our life detection devices. We can only use seismic waves to analyze formation porosity, then determine the possible formation they are in, and then blindly send a shell in that direction. "Kelvin let out a sigh, "I also know that this is very inefficient, but it seems to be the most efficient way."</br>
</br>
This shouldn't even be considered a method?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
He watched the memory of the Gaia civilization, and Devil Worms 3.7 billion years ago could drill 50 kilometers deep and move on the mantle.</br>
</br>
The lower it went, the more likely for the oxygen-forming fungus to exist. The more number of hollow layers, and the more space for Devil Worms to live and reproduce. Earth-boring missiles would not be able to cover a five-kilometer depth, let alone expanding the number to 50 kilometers. The amount of missiles needed would be astronomical.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen remembered the scene that he had seen in the memory of Harmony Civilization.</br>
</br>
The Brahma that arrived at Gliese 581g alone established a colony in the new world. Eventually, due to the expansion of the colony and the expansion of living space, they angered the arthropods living underground. In the hundreds of years of war, they first took the upper hand, but in the end they were forced to retreat back to the orbit.</br>
</br>
History always repeated itself...</br>
</br>
The only difference was that the TS Expedition is backed by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
"I'm worried about one thing," Jiang Chen said as he was deep in thought.</br>
</br>
"What?" Kelvin looked to him.</br>
</br>
"If our behavior becomes part of natural selection to some extent, then it has contributed to their evolution..." Jiang Chen frowned slightly, he crossed his arm and thought, "Could it be that by the end, even the incendiary bombs will not be able to eliminate them."</br>
</br>
Devil Worms survived through the time line of 3.7 billion years. Time annihilated countless civilizations, razied mountains to the ground, turned forests into deserts, evaporated the oceans... but the uncivilized worms remained resilient.</br>
</br>
They were like cockroaches.</br>
</br>
Even more difficult to deal with than cockroaches.</br>
</br>
From a survival perspective, arthropods seemed to be more advantageous than mammals.</br>
</br>
"That can't be right..." Looking at Jiang Chen's serious expression, the previously determined Kelvin also became uncertain.</br>
</br>
In his cognition, no carbon-based organism could withstand the heat of the flame.</br>
</br>
It's true, but not exactly accurate.</br>
</br>
Is it really not possible?</br>
</br>
I certainly hope so.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1248: An Egg Specimen!</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Based on the ex-factory price of Future Military, the cost of a ground-seeking earth-boring missile capable of being launched from the synchronous orbit was about 5 million Xin New Dollars. When combined with the incendiary bomb, the cost totaled 5.5 million.</br>
</br>
Two hundred rounds of earth-boring missiles totaled 1.1 billion Xin New Dollars. Including the other bombs and batteries, the cost would total at least be one hundred million.</br>
</br>
Money was being burnt the moment they hit the launch button.</br>
</br>
Less than two weeks after TS Expedition departed, it reached out to the headquarters for a supply of more than a billion. Even with the behemoth empire Jiang Chen built, he was still shocked by how fast it burned through cash.</br>
</br>
In fact, not accounting for the expenditure costs related to the Expedition, so far, Celestial Trade and Future Group spent 20 billion on Mars. But in contrast, disregarding the values of the Gaia civilization, the value created by the Mars colony was less than half of the total bill.</br>
</br>
This was probably the most painful element of building a farm on another planet.</br>
</br>
Before the crops grew out, you don't even know what would grow out.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, the frontline didn't just send him bills, there were some other things.</br>
</br>
In mid-February, through a comprehensive analysis of formation information and vital signal volatility, researchers at the Mars colony concluded that there was an eighty percent chance a Devil Worm's nest was located in a granite-like cave located about one kilometer deep in the northern part of the colony.</br>
</br>
If the information was reliable, this may be the shallowest Devil Worm nest found so far in the Mars colony.</br>
</br>
With this information in mind, TS Expedition immediately sent a ground force to encircle the nest.</br>
</br>
By using a vehicle equipped with a large drill bit, it managed to create a 30-degree tunnel to the target formation. The drilling vehicle was often used on Earth to build undersea tunnels, so it was capable of completing work on the relatively loose rock formation on Mars.</br>
</br>
While they drilled down, the rear engineering vehicle built steel brackets on the tunnel wall, poured cement, and cast a concrete wall to prevent Devil Worms from destroying the tunnel.</br>
</br>
Who said humans can't drill holes?</br>
</br>
The Celestial Marines proved that humans could not only drill holes but could also build roads in the holes. Devil Worms could not destroy the tunnel despite all their efforts because of the concrete wall reinforced by Grade-A steel.</br>
</br>
When the drilling vehicle penetrated into the nest, the armored vehicles rushed in and immediately unleashed its firepower against the Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
A bloody massacre began.</br>
</br>
The shells accelerated to beyond the speed of sound rendered the shell of Devil Worms to be useless. But behind them were their eggs, which made it almost impossible for them to combat effectively against the enemies inside their nest.</br>
</br>
</br>
The hoarse screams echoed in the tunnel and were overwhelmed by the explosions.</br>
</br>
Green blood splashed everywhere, and in just ten minutes, at least fifty adult Devil Worms fell inside pools of blood. Except for a few Devil Worms that escaped after they recognized the situation, there were no Devil Worms alive in the pot-shaped cave.</br>
</br>
After the soldiers exterminated the biggest threat, soldiers in kinetic skeletons jumped out of the armored vehicles' rear cabin door. They carried wire mesh and rushed toward the eggs, then created a "safety belt" between the armored vehicles and eggs.</br>
</br>
This kind of wire mesh could not be recovered after deployment, and possessed high strength, especially to shear forces.</br>
</br>
After the soldiers completed these tasks, six soldiers spread out to form a defensive formation. They raised their rifles while they waited for the scientists on the vehicles to collect specimens.</br>
</br>
A Devil Worm suddenly attacked from below!</br>
</br>
However, after the mandibles broke the wire mesh, it could not bite through the wire and became stuck in the mesh. The medics immediately rushed out with stretchers and dragged the soldiers who had been attacked from below into the vehicle.</br>
</br>
The Devil Worm with its teeth stuck in the wire could only squirm its head madly. It desperately attempted to pull its mandibles out, but everything was futile.</br>
</br>
The Celestial Marines next to it immediately stepped forward and fired a dozen bombs at its head before it no longer irritated the crowd. Several researchers in heavy protective suits once again walked out and carefully dug out the half-person tall eggs, then stored them in a large freezer.</br>
</br>
New enemies continually rush out from below, but they all got stuck in the mesh.</br>
</br>
These Devil Worms who were not afraid of death brought a lot of difficulties to the sample collection process. Fortunately, except for the two soldiers who received minor injuries, there were no casualties.</br>
</br>
After the samples were collected, the soldiers began to evacuate from the tunnel, and left only pools of green sap and severed legs.</br>
</br>
All eggs were to be sent back to Celestial City for research.</br>
</br>
It was the first time Celestial Trade received such a complete egg. It marked this mission a huge success!</br>
</br>
And in addition to those eggs, a frontline scientist also found a unique red fungus in the cave.</br>
</br>
These fungi were extremely small and grew on coarse sandstone; it appeared to be part of the rock. If not examined under a magnifying glass, it could be mistaken for hematite.</br>
</br>
After an analysis was done by scientists from the TS Expedition, it was confirmed that the fungus may be the oxygen-forming fungus scientists speculated to be capable of surviving in an anaerobic environment. It was the provider of oxygen and food for underground Mars creatures such as the Devil Worm.</br>
</br>
The eggs and oxygen-forming fungi were loaded onto the rocket. After more than a week's flight, the freezer compartment was recovered at the Celestial City port.</br>
</br>
These samples once again completely astounded the scientists.</br>
</br>
As for how they have refreshed their understanding of biology and what new breakthroughs were made in biotechnology and chemical technology... Jiang Chen had lost interest in knowing about these astonishing breakthroughs.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was almost March.</br>
</br>
Xin was ready to vote for their president.</br>
</br>
Although he was not a candidate, as a behind-the-scenes ruler of Xin, he still had to pay attention to the election.</br>
</br>
In addition, at the end of the same month, the primaries of the UA was also set to take place. Future Group and the B City Consortium had invested a lot of chips on Joseph Kennedy.</br>
</br>
Hill's internal support rate in the party had fallen to a new low, and it was unlikely she would win the primaries. Only two candidates remained hopeful; Kerry backed by the Morgan Consortium, and Joseph Kennedy.</br>
</br>
The victor who would come out in the primaries to represent the Democrats in the battle in November still remained unknown.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen temporarily delegated the matters of the Mars colony and the related research to Kelvin as he began to shift his focus back to Earth.</br>
</br>
The first day of March was also the last day of the Mars exhibition.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen came to the outdoor venue next to the Heart of the Sea. In front of the cameras, he delivered the closing remarks to all the visitors and viewers around the globe.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1249"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1249: The Prelude of A Great Era</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"We are marching towards an incredible era."</br>
</br>
"Just like Columbus brought the attention of entire Europe to the Americas, our fleet brought the attention of the world to the planet tens of millions of kilometers away."</br>
</br>
"With the advancement of our engines, I believe this number will double or even grew exponentially in the next century!"</br>
</br>
"Now Mars is just a barren desert, full of radiation, sandstorms and all kinds of dangers, but apart from the distance itself, I don't think it will be worse than the Moon."</br>
</br>
"Mars is full of rich iron ore mines. Every grain of sand smells like rust. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter will become our future mines for titanium, rare earth minerals and helium-3. "</br>
</br>
"Our fleet is growing, and our colonists are departing in batches, transforming Mars into the largest industrial area in the solar system for human civilization. We will use it as a springboard to fly out of the boundaries of the solar system and redefine the frontier of civilization."</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade welcomes any company from around the world to participate in the development of Mars."</br>
</br>
"It is expected that around mid-year, the flight between Earth and Mars will be confirmed. At the latest, by the beginning of next year, the first flight to Mars will take off."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The passionate speech resonated in the venue.</br>
</br>
Inside the presidential suite at the Heart of the Sea, two men in suits sat by the window.</br>
</br>
There was a bottle of expensive red wine on the table; beautiful and well-dressed assistants stood behind them. Judging from their temperament, their suits, and their watches, they looked like businessmen visiting Xin to learn about the investment environment.</br>
</br>
From their point of view, everything happening in the venue was under their gaze.</br>
</br>
"Charles, I heard that you sold the diamond mine in South Africa?" The man with the hooked-nose said as he sipped the red wine.</br>
</br>
"Yes," the man that appeared to be Jewish nodded and said crisply, "After the collapse of the Rothschild Bank, I repurchased my company's debt at a low price. Now my decision is equal to our company's decision. "</br>
</br>
"No, no, I mean... why are you doing this?" The man with the hooked-nose man asked curiously. "I remember you were quite optimistic about the reserves of that diamond mine last year. Why did you change your mind this year?"</br>
</br>
"You haven't realized?" The Jewish man raised his chin as he stared down at the venue. "I can sense from the ambition of Future Group that at least in the next century, the traditional resource industry has no future. Look at the share price of Vale, even Wall Street is reducing their holding."</br>
</br>
"So you want to move downstream?" the hooked-nose man smiled. "I remember you were gloating that a factory may go bankrupt, but a mine will forever keep its value."</br>
</br>
"You know," the Jewish man shrugged, "That was last year."</br>
</br>
</br>
The same scene also happened in different places.</br>
</br>
Although the market did not respond at this moment, people's expectations for the mining industry completely faded.</br>
</br>
In the next few days, the iron, aluminum, and other metals futures market plunged. Only titanium and rare earth mineral managed to remain at a relatively stable level. These two minerals were widely used in spacecraft and had demands only second to steel.</br>
</br>
In contrast to the plunging prices of raw materials, new development opportunities emerged downstream. New factories had sprung up in Ange Island, New Malaysia Special District, and the newly built MLL Island Industrial Park. With the advantage of being close to the space elevators, they would be able to obtain cheap space minerals with lower shipping costs. Therefore, global capital flooded in.</br>
</br>
All these changes happened subtly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, on the podium of the venue, was describing the future of human civilization to the people around the world with his voice, but he did not think that far yet.</br>
</br>
He was playing the same role as Columbus.</br>
</br>
He had to depict the "new world" as a paradise full of gold, where he had led Celestial Trade's fleet to the first bucket of gold. The seed of civilization would naturally sail across the stars and turn the barren land into the paradise that only existed in people's imagination.</br>
</br>
In the applause, the passionate speech came to an end.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded to thank the audience for their applause, then he handed the microphone back to the host and left the stage.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the closing ceremony of the exhibition, rain started to drip down.</br>
</br>
Next to the parking lot, Ayesha ran to Jiang Chen's side, and caringly opened the umbrella for him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw the rain had dripped on her shoulder as he immediately grabbed her shoulder and took her into his arm.</br>
</br>
There were a few exclamations not far away. Several reporters immediately raised their cameras and pressed the shutter before Celestial Trade bodyguards dispersed them.</br>
</br>
"There were reporters watching." Jiang Chen's move caught Ayesha by surprise, then she quietly whispered.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry," Jiang Chen smiled. "There is nothing to hide."</br>
</br>
Even with no reporters watching, his romantic affairs were well known.</br>
</br>
Although some men and female rights activists often criticized him for being unruly and not respecting women...</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not agree.</br>
</br>
He never used his position to force anyone to do anything for himself. Nor did he cover up his private life under a glamorous surface. In this regard alone, he thought he was more righteous compared to the other people in the same class.</br>
</br>
If someone wished to make irresponsible remarks, he allowed them since he was never bothered by those comments. He never portrayed himself as a saint to participate in an election.</br>
</br>
Feeling the warmth from his muscular chest, Ayesha's cheeks turned red as she pressed her face against him, quietly enjoying the moment. However, her sight moved in the direction of the reporters and captured the annoying faces with the special contact lens of Ghost Agents.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen did not care, she considered it her duty to maintain his reputation and let those unscrupulous people shut up...</br>
</br>
On the extended Luer, the magnetic levitation engine launched and the scenery outside the window gradually moved down.</br>
</br>
He held onto Ayesha's hand as he watched the beautiful blue building outside, his thoughts drifted away.</br>
</br>
His watch vibrated.</br>
</br>
"Your phone," Ayesha said softly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
He gently squeezed her hand before letting it go.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the holographic screen of the watch and slid down.</br>
</br>
When the phone was connected, Kelvin's face appeared on the screen. As soon as he saw Jiang Chen, he reported.</br>
</br>
"We found several stowaways."</br>
</br>
"Stowaways?" Jiang Chen was surprised by the comment, he laughingly responded, "This needs to be reported to me?"</br>
</br>
"Mainly because... their identity and the location of the smuggling are a bit unique."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow. "What's unique about it?"</br>
</br>
"They sneaked onto Mars."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In the dark universe, a silver-white rocket slowly approached the red planet.</br>
</br>
There was a palm-sized star-spangled flag on the side of the rocket. The symbols of NASA and SpaceX were printed below the flag.</br>
</br>
"Here is Ares, we have entered the Mars sync orbit, over."</br>
</br>
Through the round glass pane, an astronaut in the spacecraft looked at the fiery red planet. He suppressed his excitement and reported to the mission control center with a trembled voice as he desperatedly tried to control his emotional state.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for about five minutes.</br>
</br>
For NASA that had yet to master the super-light-speed communication technology, the interval between each communication was approximately five minutes.</br>
</br>
"This is Mission Control. Congratulations, you are the pride of our country..."</br>
</br>
After more than a month of flight, they finally arrived.</br>
</br>
"Ares" with a total weight of more than 400 tons was propelled by four latest "Ares VI" propulsion engines. It crossed the distance of tens of millions of kilometers and penetrated the technology blockade of Celestial Trade to finally arrive at this red planet...</br>
</br>
The thought of this made the eight astronauts teary with emotions.</br>
</br>
"Is that the Seagull-class of Celestial Trade?" A blond, skinny man pointed out the window.</br>
</br>
Against the backdrop of the dark universe, a rectangular-shaped giant ship floated quietly in the darkness tens of thousands of kilometers away. Through the telescope, they could clearly see every inch of armor on the huge ship. The menacing cold steel formed a distinct contrast with the red planet, just like a hardened sword</br>
</br>
Even with the distance between them, they still felt insignificant...</br>
</br>
Bris shook his head hard and pushed the wrong thought out of his head.</br>
</br>
As the captain of the Mars expedition team, he was also the captain of Ares. They came to place the star-spangled flag on to Mars, not to envy Celestial Trade's achievements.</br>
</br>
"They are very powerful, but we can surpass them one day." A Jewish man walked over to him, put his hand on his shoulder, and said with certainty in his voice, "Order the landing."</br>
</br>
"Thank you, Zubac."</br>
</br>
Bris took a deep breath and gave an order to the entire crew of "Mission Ares" behind him.</br>
</br>
"All ship crew members, enter the buffer cabin. We'll at the new land!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
There were cheers and whistles.</br>
</br>
Under Bris' order, everyone entered the buffer cabin and prepared for shock resistance.</br>
</br>
In the slowdown phase, they needed to withstand around 7G of gravity, but it was simple for them. They already trained countless hours for this very moment.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"A UFO is detected in the synchronous orbit."</br>
</br>
"A UFO?" With his unfinished coffee, the captain of TS Expedition walked next to the radar observer, then looked on the screen. After he examined the situation, he ordered, "Open the optical observation system."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The observer's finger tapped on the trackpad a few times and quickly picked up the image of the flying object on the screen. After several magnifications and resolution corrections, a flying object with a length of about 25 meters and a diameter of about five meters appeared in the image.</br>
</br>
When the captain saw the star-spangled flag on the object, an odd expression appeared.</br>
</br>
He put down the cup of coffee, then looked at the correspondent located at the back.</br>
</br>
"Connect to the Space Command Center."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Kelvin was at the entrance to the express train of the Earth Defense Alliance headquarters in Celestial Trade City. He was ready to head back to the Space Department.</br>
</br>
His watch vibrated. When he opened the holographic screen, he discovered it was from the Ground Command Center.</br>
</br>
After he understood the situation, he immediately transferred the communication to TS Expedition and spoke to the captain on the screen with seriousness in his voice.</br>
</br>
"Explain the exact situation to me."</br>
</br>
The captain saluted and quickly reported.</br>
</br>
"We found the UA spacecraft near Mar's orbit; with NASA and SpaceX logos. According to the spacecraft scale analysis, it is initially determined to be a manned spacecraft."</br>
</br>
"A manned spacecraft?" Kelvin frowned as he said with a peculiar look, "What do they want to do?"</br>
</br>
They launched a rocket to Mars in complete silence?</br>
</br>
Although Celestial Trade did not rule out the idea and even received information from certain channels, Kelvin was still shocked when he confirmed the news in person.</br>
</br>
After all, the Biotechnology Summit ended not long ago and they already demonstrated the danger of Devil Worms. What did the Capitol decide to launch a manned mission to Mars even knowing this point?</br>
</br>
Or they thought the warning was a joke?</br>
</br>
"From the way its changing course, it should be intending to land on the surface of Mars. Our pilots are ready to take off at any time for an interception," The captain said in a strong and assertive tone.</br>
</br>
"How likely are we to be discovered?" Kelvin asked.</br>
</br>
"We can launch an EMP missile first to get rid of the communication modules exposed on the outside of the spacecraft, and then send a Stingray AI to take it down." The captain asserted, "Unless their spacecraft is equipped with an early warning radar, otherwise the probability of discovering our attack is zero."</br>
</br>
After a moment of thought, Kelvin said.</br>
</br>
"Can you calculate their landing site?"</br>
</br>
"We can approximately locate their landing site. The error margin is within ten kilometers." The captain sent a coordinate to the holographic screen in front of Kelvin.</br>
</br>
Looking at the coordinates on the screen, Kelvin quietly calculated in his mind.</br>
</br>
Even at the closest coordinates, these people would be hundreds of kilometers away from Mine 071. There was no need to be concerned about what they would discover.</br>
</br>
Moreover, the area where they landed seemed to be close to the active area of Devil Worms...</br>
</br>
"Order the pilots to be on standby on the carrier, but don't worry about them." In half a minute, Kelvin made the decision. "If they are so eager to die, let them be."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The captain saluted and ended the communication.</br>
</br>
Even if Celestial Trade did not do anything, they would not be able to survive for long. Kelvin was convinced knowing the terrifying nature of Devil Worms.</br>
</br>
After he ended the communication, Kelvin immediately called Jiang Chen and reported the matter.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Ares, which was already in the synchronous orbit, dropped the last four rockets and an orbiting satellite as a communication relay.</br>
</br>
Then, Ares, which had only one main cabin, ignited the last-stage engine and began to fall to the surface of Mars...</br>

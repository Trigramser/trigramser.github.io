</br>
Assassination was a skilled job, especially the assassination of a heavily protected dignitary, a head of state.</br>
</br>
Sometimes a bullet could solve a lot of problems. However, it would also bring about more problems that were no less than the problems it solved.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents would wear the optical invisibility gear. Then, fire a few bullets… Definitely wouldn't work.</br>
</br>
Not to mention the exposure of optical invisibility would cause the security departments of all countries to add infrared and acoustic wave sensing devices. Optical invisibility was just invisible to the naked eye and not a true-sense of disappearance. If the Ghost Agents really used brute force for this assassination under everyone's watch, Carmen would laugh even in his dreams.</br>
</br>
There was no need to investigate who mastered optical invisibility technology. Even if NATO didn't form a consensus in its organization, they would be forced to make a move.</br>
</br>
The trigger for the First World War was because of a bullet, at least that's how it was recognized in history.</br>
</br>
So what Monica needed to do was to make this assassination appear as an accident...</br>
</br>
On the evening of May 23rd, the Frankberg Prime Minister took off from the Stockholm International Airport in Sweden. When passing through Gotland, the left engine failed due to the wear and tear of the circuit, and the pilot tried to return to the airport. However, when the course was changed, the left engine completely turned off, causing the fuselage to lose power and roll over under turbulence. The plane eventually crashed into the ocean west of Gotland. After the rescue team arrived, there was no sign of life in the cabin, and the cause of the failure was confirmed from the recovered black box.</br>
</br>
Although some people speculate that it was a murder, there was no evidence to prove it.</br>
</br>
The black box couldn't talk, and there were no explosives on the fuselage or traces of the plane being hit by missiles. The left engine that was salvaged from the bottom of the sea indeed showed a worn-out circuit. The only doubt was whether the circuit really caused the engine to completely fail.</br>
</br>
But in any case, people were dead.</br>
</br>
From the news of the next day, Jiang Chen saw BBC's follow-up report on the crash.</br>
</br>
He was actually curious about how Monica did it to make it appear so perfect, but he did not call and ask her. He emphasized on ​​the result more than the process. Peter died in an accident, it was enough for him.</br>
</br>
Compared with Jiang Chen's calmness, Peter's death caused a storm in the world.</br>
</br>
Peter, who previously represented the right-wing force, was elected into the office on strong support. Many people photoshopped him into Hitler, thinking that he would bring the world into abyss.</br>
</br>
During the domestic revolution, the leader of the New Choice Party, Peter, died in the Baltic Sea. This loss was like poison that slowly spread through the extreme right-wing of Frankberg. Although deputy prime minister took over the position of prime minister, neither the prestige nor the experience of the new prime minister could compare with Peter.</br>
</br>
</br>
After he took office, he would give up the European Union integration initiative, punish the company involved in the "7th Institute Incident", appeal for the previously exiled political party, and then announce for re-election. Perhaps there would be a chance to turn this situation around...but this was obviously impossible.</br>
</br>
Already having chosen this path, they must continue regardless of the result, and there was no return. If the New Choice Party lost its ruling status, then there would be only one consequence left, rotting in prison.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the rebel forces' morale soared after the death of Peter. They regard Peter's death as the dawn of victory, and the size of the rebel army began growing. More and more aspiring young people join their forces. It was no longer just people from Bava, there were people from all over the nation.</br>
</br>
Once the countless confrontation with civilians began, a dangerous thought began to plague the army. At the most dangerous moment for the country, choosing to desert its side and instead side with the other deserters was no longer shameful, but glorious.</br>
</br>
At first, it was only one or two soldiers. Later, it became a tank. In the end, it even evolved into a whole company that turned to the rebels. Except for those in power, no one called them deserters. People called them "the people who made the right choice" and offered flowers and blessings.</br>
</br>
Just two days after Peter's death, another event shocked the world.</br>
</br>
The 10th Armored Division on mission turned themselves in to the rebels on the evening of May 25th.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Greek gatehouse on the west side of King's Square was illuminated by countless lights.</br>
</br>
Tanks and armored vehicles gathered into formations, just like a military parade. The soldiers were dressed in uniforms and holding their rifles in front of their chest. They were neatly lined up in the square, looking straight ahead.</br>
</br>
Curfew was imposed, but civilians gathered around the square.</br>
</br>
The crowd surrounded the square, and the people in the back even stood on top of car roofs.</br>
</br>
There were no stones, no fire, people just quietly watched the general on the gatehouse, suspicious, doubtful, excited, hopeful, or calm.</br>
</br>
In this square that witnessed history countless times, the 10th Armored Division commander, Kelford with a medal-filled chest, stood in front of media reporters from all over the world and in front of his people.</br>
</br>
He stood straight, not to prove the merits he had received, but to firmly believe that the choice he made was the right one, and worthy of the flag behind him.</br>
</br>
In a powerful tone, he announced to the world.</br>
</br>
"Chaos, poverty, corruption, ignorance, and now the war, see what Peter has brought upon us over the past two years? He has not fulfilled his campaign promise and he is splitting apart the country and bring us into the abyss!"</br>
</br>
"This can't continue any longer!"</br>
</br>
"Please allow me to refuse to use words such as surrender and betrayal. The soldiers of Frankberg have never betrayed our people. When they ordered us to shoot at the people, we refused, and then stood on the side of our people. We just made the most correct choice today, a choice any Frankberg person would make."</br>
</br>
"The 10th Armored Division will not join the rebels, but starting today, we will fight for the same cause."</br>
</br>
"After the victory of the revolution, I will resign. If I am guilty, judge me. But before that, I will take the country back in the right direction as a soldier!"</br>
</br>
Cheering erupted through the night sky, deafening the entire square.</br>
</br>
The soldiers marched forward and the tanks began to roll. No protesters formed a wall, and there were no Mokov cocktails. People consciously stepped back to form a path, watching their soldiers step on the right battlefield...</br>
</br>
Tonight, the world was shocked.</br>
</br>

</br>
Carmen hung up the phone call from Johnson</br>
</br>
He sunk into the chair, and his fingers pinched his eyebrows as he looked into the dark and long night.</br>
</br>
Just now, Johnson "convinced" the senate's speaker. The bill to amend the military service system could be drafted by the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. The next step was voting, which shouldn't receive too much resistance.</br>
</br>
As for Peter...</br>
</br>
Carmen admitted that the idiot dying at this juncture was a heavy blow to his strategic deployment in Europe.</br>
</br>
But if he could last till next month, there should be room to turn the table.</br>
</br>
Opening the desk drawer, Carmen took out a box of pills, poured two out and stuffed them into his mouth. His tired nerves gradually relaxed.</br>
</br>
In the eyes of outsiders, the Jewish consortium was glorious and prosperous. Making a fortune in the financial crisis, and letting the entire UA people foot the bills. At the time of the election, it donated money to both sides, manipulated politics, defended Israel, robbed the Third World, and as if the world is just a game. The Jewish consortium was winning in everything... but in fact, the situation couldn't get any worse.</br>
</br>
Especially now.</br>
</br>
It was an unprecedentedly bad situation</br>
</br>
Since the war with Future Group, they didn't seem to live a peaceful day. They had several opportunities to kill that man, but the opportunities slipped away from their hands again and again. Last time, Future Group and the WASP consortium almost took out Goldman Sachs.</br>
</br>
But he did not regret that he chose to be Future Group's enemy.</br>
</br>
In order to protect his own interest, the incumbent forces were bound to create conflict with emerging forces. Either be replaced or be swallowed by the enemy and digested into something of their own. From the day when Future Mining was founded, he had already foreseen the day when the two sides would meet in arms.</br>
</br>
Eighty percent of the world's ore trade was controlled by them. Fifty percent of the oil trade was directly or indirectly related to their assets. But since the series of "issues" such as the space elevator, asteroid mining, and oil crops emerged, their wealth was shrinking at an exponential rate.</br>
</br>
He firmly believed that if Jiang Chen chose financial markets and arms trade as an entry point, those UA-based consortia would not have any reservation at all.</br>
</br>
Hesitated for a moment, he picked up the phone and dialed a number.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"It's me."</br>
</br>
There was pleasant laughter on the other end.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Rothschild, how are you doing?"</br>
</br>
Without being bothered by the sarcasm from the other party, Carmen took a deep breath and sighed.</br>
</br>
"Stop with your disgraceful American humor, Daniel Morgan, I'm here to discuss business with you."</br>
</br>
"Oh? What business? Are you planning to merge the UA and Mexico?" Daniel Morgan acted surprised</br>
</br>
"Do you want to join forces?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"Join forces?" As if he heard a ridiculous joke, Daniel chuckled. "Man, did you forget something? We fought tooth to nail over the Goldman Sachs acquisition six months ago. Now you are planning to work with me?"</br>
</br>
"There are no eternal enemies, there are no eternal allies," Carmen said coldly. "You really think of yourself as good allies of Future Group? Then why are you watching them make a mess in Europe? Instead of doing the deed yourself?</br>
</br>
"Humiliating the poor is not a gentlemanly thing to do."</br>
</br>
"Don't kid yourself. You don't want to see them rise. Even if you were in the same trench together, you would never regard them as one of your own. Do you really want me to put it all out there for you to stop acting ignorant?" Carmen said blatantly.</br>
</br>
"Oh," Daniel Morgan smiled, changed the hand he held the phone with, and then put his feet on the desk, "Do you think we want to see you make a comeback? My dear Mr. Rothschild, is your brain influenced by that Golden Apple? If you are sitting in my seat, would you help me?"</br>
</br>
Although he had been watching without emotion, Morgan didn't keep his eyes closed. He understood very clearly what the 7th Institute studied, but just like Jiang Chen, he didn't take it to heart.</br>
</br>
Only a person with a malfunctioning brain would bet everything on an illusory possibility, at least in his opinion, Carmen's brain had already stopped functioning. Of course, the reason why he thought this was because he didn't know that the Rothschild family back then established contact with Remnants of the Void, and had benefited a lot from it...</br>
</br>
If he learned this secret, perhaps he would also be interested in the magical "apple."</br>
</br>
"You will regret your choice today," Carmen said sullenly.</br>
</br>
"On the contrary, I am extremely convinced that one day in the future I will be grateful for the choice I made today."</br>
</br>
The phone line was cut.</br>
</br>
Carmen, who was fuming in anger, threw the phone into the bookcase. He gritted his teeth while cursing out.</br>
</br>
"A bunch of idiots..."</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a knock on the door.</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath and suppressing his emotions, Carmen said slowly.</br>
</br>
"Come in."</br>
</br>
The door opened, and his secretary anxiously walked in.</br>
</br>
"What?" Carmen raised his head and tried to make his voice sound as calm as possible.</br>
</br>
"Bava..." The secretary, looking pale and fearful, ultimately didn't have the courage to finish his sentence.</br>
</br>
Looking at the secretary who was shaking, Carmen was growing impatient.</br>
</br>
"What happened to Bava? Just say it."</br>
</br>
The secretary who knew he couldn't escape decided to bite the bullet and report the bad news he received from Frankberg.</br>
</br>
The 10th Armored Division revolted. The Arrow's strongholds received catastrophic destruction and they were forced to retreat...</br>
</br>
In short, the situation in Frankberg was getting out of control, and the Rothschild family was losing their grasp on the nation.</br>
</br>
To the surprise of the secretary, after listening to the report, the boss's emotions were unexpectedly calm.</br>
</br>
"Go out, let me be alone."</br>
</br>
The relieved secretary left in quick steps.</br>
</br>
When the door closed, a burst of sick redness suddenly appeared on Carmen's face, and blood appeared in his hand after he coughed.</br>
</br>
So much regret!</br>
</br>
He was so close!</br>
</br>
He was so close to unifying Europe and completing the great work that Napoleon and Hitler never completed!</br>
</br>
His bloodshot pupils stared at the Golden Apple sitting quietly on the table. The bloodstained hand tightly held onto it.</br>
</br>
Until it disappeared in 1942, the direct blood of the Rothschild family could rely on this media to communicate with the sages who claimed to be the Remnants of the Void and acquire knowledge and gain wisdom beyond the times...</br>
</br>
However, after returning to his hands over more than half a century, he didn't hear the voice in his brain as recorded in the genealogy.</br>
</br>
He didn't understand why he was not chosen!</br>
</br>
Perhaps his "prayers" over the past few days was finally answered. At this moment, a devilish voice suddenly sounded from the depths of his mind.</br>
</br>
"You... need... help?"</br>

A faint blue holographic screen floated on Jiang Chen's right-hand side, and Lin Lin in the screen was debugging in front of a machine.</br>
</br>
On Jiang Chen's left-hand side was a weird-looking machine. The reason it looked weird was that the box-design didn't seem to consider the consumer's perception. Other than the countless wires that connected to an arm guard, the other side of the machine was connected to two discs stacked together.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the two discs was a hamster cage.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin called this device, Portal No. 1.</br>
</br>
As the name implied, it was a device used to transport things between the apocalypse and the modern world. Lin Lin designed machines with similar functions, and on a much larger scale, primarily used to help Jiang Chen transmit food and ore. But different from the previous device, this could be used to transport living things.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen jokingly referred to it as Hamster Killer No. 1.</br>
</br>
"Ready?"</br>
</br>
Putting on the arm guard, Jiang Chen took a deep breath, took a last glance at the suspicious machine, and then tightened his grip.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
"That's the beginning... the coordinates have been imported." Lin Lin tapped a few buttons on the touchpad, "Countdown...3, 2, 1, 0! Power on!"</br>
</br>
Blue arc flashed and merged into a vortex between the two discs. The instantaneous magnetic field surged and made all of Jiang Chen's hair jump up.</br>
</br>
"What the... is this thing really reliable?" Looking at the spherical arc growing in size, Jiang Chen grabbed his right arm and moved back a little as he protested.</br>
</br>
"No problem, no problem! The data is showing everything is fine, the channel is very stable...Though energy consumption is a bit fast, and the anti-matter that we took half a year to accumulate has almost been completely depleted, but those are all trivial things, you should concentrate on keeping the storage space open."</br>
</br>
The ferocious magnetic field and the secondary dimension field began interfering with the interdimensional communication chip in the watch, and the holographic screen began to appear unstable. The zealous Lin Lin furiously typed on the keyboard while not forgetting to keep Jiang Chen calm.</br>
</br>
However, her words did not give Jiang Chen any peace of mind, but rather, it made him more uneasy. If he didn't have unconditional trust in Lin Lin, he would have kicked the power long ago.</br>
</br>
After forcing the thought of escaping out of his mind, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and submerged his consciousness into the storage dimension. Inside the dark and eerie spherical universe, he saw a ball of light. He then reached out and covered the ball of light sparkling with electric rays with his consciousness and pulled it into the modern world...</br>
</br>
The deafening noise of static filled the room, then everything returned to calmness.</br>
</br>
"Success!"</br>
</br>
With Lin Lin cheering, the disordered magnetic field in the room disappeared instantly. When Jiang Chen opened his eyes, he saw on the cage of "Portal No. 1", a slow-looking hamster.</br>
</br>
</br>
All the pressure he felt disappeared and he let out a long sigh of relief. With a weary smile, he sunk into a chair.</br>
</br>
"Yeah, finally fu*king successful."</br>
</br>
"Hey, can you not swear?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not reply to Lin Lin as he took off the arm guard tied to his right arm. Then, he got up and walked to the other side of the machine.</br>
</br>
One foot stepping onto the power switch, Jiang Chen then went and lifted the iron cage up and put it in front of himself.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the current hurt its brain, but its black eyes stared straight at the human outside the cage. The small nostrils opened and closed, and it seemed to be traumatized. Jiang Chen thought about it, and he certainly understood its feeling. He would have been scared to death if he was in the arcs of a storm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the shaking hamster in the cage, then he smiled and opened the door of the cage, patted its head.</br>
</br>
"Lucky guy, at least a hundred predecessors died before you... Take this, your reward.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen handed the hamster a sunflower seed and then closed the cage.</br>
</br>
When the little guy saw it, it immediately reacted. The two small claws grabbed the seed in a hurry and used its small mouth to quickly peel open the seed. After it ate the seed, it looked to Jiang Chen again with its benevolent eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could not help but smile when he looked at the fat hamster acting cute. He grabbed a handful from the bag next to him and threw them into the cage. The hamster surrounded by happiness gathered all the seeds around him.</br>
</br>
"Hey, eat it. At least this is a good meal. There are still two sets of experiments waiting for you later."</br>
</br>
If the hamster understood him, maybe it would have dropped the seeds in fear.</br>
</br>
In short, Jiang Chen was extremely happy.</br>
</br>
Although the hamster was only 50 grams in size, after this breakthrough, transporting a human would not be so farfetched.</br>
</br>
He took out two crystals from the storage dimension. Jiang Chen pinched the crystal in his right hand and absorbed the energy. After looking at the lines on his wrist, he tossed the crystal that turned white onto the table.</br>
</br>
"Are you done resting? I'm ready to repeat the experiment here!" Lin Lin put her face close to the camera.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyed Lin Lin in the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"Why do I feel like a white lab rat?"</br>
</br>
"Not at all!"</br>
</br>
At this moment, the picture in the holographic screen suddenly blurred. Lin Lin, denied the accusation, moved at an extremely slow pace.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly frowned, raised his left arm and looked at the watch, but found no issues.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin also seemed to be aware of this strange phenomenon in the apocalypse . She had already left the table and was running to the other machine. From her frown, he seemed to notice something unusual.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tried to activate the interdimensional bracelet, but what surprised him was that he didn't manage to interdimensional travel, he was still sitting on the chair.</br>
</br>
Just as he was shocked at this moment, the blur on the holographic screen disappeared, and the interdimensional communication resumed as normal.</br>
</br>
Once again, he activated interdimensional travel. This time, there was not a single pause. In a blink of an eye, he had already appeared in the mansion.</br>
</br>
He walked quickly to the backyard, passed through the side door of the institute, and under the crowd of Lin Lin sisters' watch, he ran into Lin Lin's new laboratory.</br>
</br>
When he closed the door, he immediately asked Lin Lin, who was standing in front of the touchpad with a stern expression on her face.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know. Just now, the Klein particle signal suddenly received strong interference. It should not be the device's issue... Wait, could it be..." Lin Lin's expression suddenly changed, and she clicked on the touchpad that formed several ripples. There was sudden realization on her face when she read the data from the device's feedback.</br>
</br>
"What the hell is going on?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"The communication channel was crowded. When we talked, someone sent a Klein particle wave to this area. If I didn't guess wrong, you shouldn't be able to interdimensional travel at the time. Do you remember?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a second to think and his expression instantly changed.</br>
</br>
He recalled from a long time ago when he was in City K in Country F, the Kurofune used a special method that prevented him from interdimensional travel for a certain period of time. At that time, Lin Lin explained that the Harmony space colonization ship interfered through the resonance effect of the Klein particles by releasing a Klein particle wave.</br>
</br>
This was originally a means of communication, except that the strength of the wave exceeded a certain threshold.</br>
</br>
"Just then, that space colonization ship released Klein particle waves toward the solar system. You can understand that they used a 'radio' that can emit Klein particle signal and broadcast it to that area... But what is their purpose?" Lin Lin frowned.</br>
</br>
Yeah, what is their purpose? The Kurofune was destroyed...</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a terrifying thought came to Jiang Chen's mind.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked at Jiang Chen with confusion. "Isn't the Golden Apple in your hands?"</br>
</br>
"I... I gifted it to someone else." Rubbing the back of his head, Jiang Chen smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's eyes widened and said.</br>
</br>
"Gifted it? How can you do that?"</br>
</br>
"It's... It's a long story. Didn't you say that it can only be used to receive signals? Anyway, the Remnants of the Void have completely lost connections. I thought that it was useless, so..." Jiang Chen scratched his cheek apologetically.</br>
</br>
At that time, he exchanged the Golden Apple for the IAEA's acquiescence to the development of nuclear technology in Xin and won time for the development of Future Group.</br>
</br>
"Well, you can't just give it away!" Lin Lin was very angry and stomping her feet.</br>
</br>
"Can you locate the signal?" Jiang Chen interrupted Lin Lin's words.</br>
</br>
"I can... but the Golden Apple is just a receiver. If you can only accept the signal unilaterally, I can only track the direction of the signal source at most... Wait, how is this possible?" Lin Lin stared at the flashing green dot and the parameters next to it with an incomprehensible look.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Jiang Chen walked over, though he couldn't understand the graphics or numbers on the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
"Only half a minute ago, my Klein Particle Wave Tracker detected a feedback signal." Lin Lin looked at the screen, shocked. Muttering to herself, "how exactly did it do this? The Golden Apple? No... it's impossible to do it with just the Golden Apple. It must be something else."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand and interrupted Lin Lin's muttering.</br>
</br>
"I only have one question. Can you locate it now?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." After adjusting her thought, Lin Lin nodded, and the finger clicked on the touchpad a few times. Then the signal light on Jiang Chen's left wrist flashed. "I have sent the coordinates to you... This is incredible"</br>
</br>
Clicking on the holographic screen on his watch, Jiang Chen opened the mail.</br>
</br>
It was a map of the world; the focus was on Northern Europe. A striking red dot was marked on the map, and the marked position was –</br>
</br>
"Finland?"</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When Johnson returned to the Rothschild manor in Finland, Carmen was packing his luggage in the office.</br>
</br>
While he was packing up, other than a few books, there were only two things inside – the Golden Apple and a laptop. He didn't need to worry about clothes and necessities as the butler would naturally take care of it for him.</br>
</br>
What surprised Johnson was that the boss's mood seemed to be pleasant. Not only was the gloom in his eyes gone, he also looked less terrifying. Every time they changed their hideout, his mood had always been bad.</br>
</br>
Something should have happened when he was gone.</br>
</br>
"You're back?" Carmen stood up and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Johnson nodded and walked into the office, he glanced at the suitcase on the ground. "Are we ready to leave?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, in half an hour."</br>
</br>
"What is the destination?"</br>
</br>
Carmen laughed and pointed out the window.</br>
</br>
Johnson looked at the window but was confused. He did not see anything.</br>
</br>
The north?</br>
</br>
But they were already at the northernmost manor of the Rothschild's family. How north could they go?</br>
</br>
"My dear Mr. Johnson, tell me, where is the largest concentration camp in Northern Europe - no, the largest refugee camp?"</br>
</br>
"Near the Inari Lakes in northern Finland."</br>
</br>
"Bingo!" Carmen snapped his fingers. He opened his arms with a smile. "That is our destination."</br>
</br>
Johnson didn't understand why the boss suddenly wanted to visit the refugee camp, but since it was the boss's decision, he could only obey. However, before they leave, he still must inform the boss. Intuition told him that it may be better to say this when the boss is in a good mood.</br>
</br>
"I don't mean to disturb your good mood, just..." Hesitated for a moment, Johnson then continued, "The newly appointed Arrow Frankberg branch manager Bagley, was killed by the 10th Armored Division during the command of the battle by an artillery shell."</br>
</br>
"How many people do we have left in Frankberg?"</br>
</br>
"Only two thousand left..."</br>
</br>
No one expected the allies to suddenly turn their weapons. Arrow deployed five mechanized brigades in Bava, almost all of which were defeated on the night the 10th Armored Division turned.</br>
</br>
"Let them withdraw," Carmen said without a change in mood.</br>
</br>
Johnson, shocked, looked at his boss.</br>
</br>
It seemed like he expected the shocked reaction, Carmen smiled and said, "The Rothschild family, or the Freemasonry has lost Frankberg, I know this very clearly. Rest assured, I'm not the kind of person who can't take a loss, nor the kind of person who easily gives up. You can do as I say. In addition, get Sardes to come to the military base next to the refugee camp, I have a new assignment for him."</br>
</br>
Johnson bowed his head.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the boss regained his rationality.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, Johnson instinctively felt a little uneasy.</br>
</br>
If he wasn't mistaken, in the dark green pupils, there was a strong sense of zeal...</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Lake Inari, the largest freshwater lake in Finland and the northernmost lake. The Ivalo River flows into the lake from the southwest and is injected into the Arctic Ocean through the Patz River to the east. The lake has appeared many times in Norse mythology. More than 3,000 islands were scattered in the lake and divided the lake into a complex network of lakes and rivers.</br>
</br>
No other seasons existed here, only snow decorated the lake all year long.</br>
</br>
It was night. To the north of Lake Inari, a snow-camouflaged motorboat floated quietly onto the shore of the lake, looking far away, it looked like a floating piece of ice.</br>
</br>
Not far away, two patrol boats galloped across the lake without detecting the motorboat at all.</br>
</br>
After the patrol boat left, eight figures wearing polar camouflage slowly lifted their heads from the motorboat.</br>
</br>
"Keep going."</br>
</br>
Kutpov gestured to the person operating the motorboat, and the motorboat slowly started and quietly headed to their destination.</br>
</br>
Under the camouflaged beret, it was a face with as many scars as wrinkles. On the defined face, there were two pupils that only should exist on wolves. Just by making eye contact, one could feel the dangerous, murderous intent within him.</br>
</br>
Beside him were guys who are as dangerous as him.</br>
</br>
They were part of the Alpha Special Forces, among the most dangerous offshore special operations teams.</br>
</br>
There was nothing on them that could prove their identity. Participation in unauthorized overseas military operations, if discovered, could not be explained by diplomatic disputes. A bad fallout could spark a military conflict between two countries. From the moment they took off, they were prepared to die as stateless people.</br>
</br>
Of course, under normal circumstances, they all would go back alive.</br>
</br>
The motorboat was docked north of Lake Inari.</br>
</br>
Kutpov towed the motorboat ashore, hid behind the snowdrift, and then gestured to his comrades to maintain a fighting stance while moving toward the target position.</br>
</br>
The reason why they appeared in Finland was due to what happened a week ago.</br>
</br>
The Russian Security Agency received information from its allies that the military base next to the refugee camp on the north bank of Lake Inari in Finland was the largest training base of Arrow Company in Northern Europe. It delivered more than 5000 mercenaries to the war.</br>
</br>
Their task was very simple. Set up beacons in the ammunition depot, training grounds, and important facilities in the training base, and then destroy the base's air defense system and guide the PAK-DA stealth strategic bomber to "mistakenly" bomb the site.</br>
</br>
While it may be a "mistake", it was no different than an outright airstrike.</br>
</br>
This military base was close to the border. As long as the "correct" people die and they are not detected by the radar, the Finnish government is likely to keep an eye closed. The harsh environment in the refugee camps were criticized by human rights' organization to be the concentration camps of the 21st century. If report come out that the mercenary organization is forcing refugees to join its rank, it would be a heavy blow to the image and diplomatic reputation of Finland.</br>
</br>
Once the military base is destroyed, the mercenaries going to Ukraine in the next five months would be cut to one-third. It won't take five months, even if Celestial Trade dragged the war on, the war could end in a month.</br>
</br>
The return was worth the risk for Russia.</br>
</br>
Under the disguise of the night, the Alpha Team traversed through the snow and approached the high ground next to the military base in the pine forests.</br>
</br>
Passing through the dense pines, through the barbed wire covered with snow, they even saw the refugees gathered around a coal stove for heat. Just like the intelligence said, the European consortium "accommodated" these poor people, and then moved them here. They used their family members as hostage and used citizenship and salary as a temptation to force them to sell their lives to Arrow.</br>
</br>
According to the mark on the map, the first ammunition depot was just 500 meters away. These people did not seem to think that anyone could reach here. The patrol intensity was quite slack, and the sentinel on the sentry even lit a cigarette to kill time.</br>
</br>
However, Kutpov frowned and gestured for the soldiers next to him. Everyone stopped simultaneously and quietly pruned in the snow, as if they naturally belonged in the whiteness.</br>
</br>
The roar of the helicopter propeller gradually became clear. A black transport helicopter flew not far away from them and headed straight to the military base, landing on the tarmac near the gate. With the arrival of this helicopter, the entire base became excited.</br>
</br>
Kutpov noticed that the sentinel had thrown away the cigarette in his hand, and his back was straight, acting full of energy.</br>
</br>
An important person arrived.</br>
</br>
With the thought in his mind, Kutpov took out his binoculars and looked in the direction of the helicopter.</br>
</br>
A man in military uniform stood in front of the helicopter, welcoming the visitors.</br>
</br>
A team of mercenaries with exoskeletons swarmed out of the helicopter, followed by a Jewish man who jumped out from the helicopter. Adjusting the focal length and focusing on the man's face, Kutpov paused for a second as his pupils suddenly contracted.</br>
</br>
Carmen Rothschild!</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents' number one wanted target!</br>
</br>
But why was he here?</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1055: A Trip to Finland</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At 12 o'clock midnight, in the mountain ranges of Lapin maakunta in northern Finland.</br>
</br>
Except for the manor five kilometers away and the highway a few kilometers out, there were no signs of human existence.</br>
</br>
On this quiet night, a "meteor" crossed the night sky and landed in the frozen soil covered by pines.</br>
</br>
There was a loud and deep bang.</br>
</br>
The snow on the ground splattered and turned into mist under the high-temperature airflow.</br>
</br>
When the mist mixed with snow dissipated, a prismatic-shaped airdrop cabin appeared. With the sound of air leaking out, the door gradually opened. A figure stumbled out from inside and scared away a little fox peeking its head out at the foreign object.</br>
</br>
"Damn, this stuff is really not meant for humans."</br>
</br>
Holding the pine tree trunk next to him, Jiang Chen gagged, and then wiped his mouth with his arm.</br>
</br>
Compared to him, Ayesha seemed just fine. She stepped out of the airdrop cabin and walked next to him with a look of concern. She patted his back and said quietly.</br>
</br>
"Are you okay? How about... you wait for me here?"</br>
</br>
"Pshh, wait for you here? Then why did I come? Don't worry, I'm fine. My stomach just feels a bit agitated." Jiang Chen gritted his teeth and then straightened his back. He looked at Ayesha with a reassuring smile before heading back to the airdrop cabin and putting his hand on the cabin.</br>
</br>
With a blink, the entire airdrop cabin was tossed into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
When he received the coordinates from Lin Lin, Jiang Chen interdimensional traveled back to the modern world. He used the space elevator to head to Celestial City before landing directly in northern Finland through the airdrop cabin.</br>
</br>
Originally, he was planning to go alone, but he couldn't convince the stubborn Ayesha, so he took her along.</br>
</br>
This mission shouldn't be dangerous. Carmen with exposed coordinates was no different than a dead man. Even if he came himself, he was more than capable of finishing the task.</br>
</br>
If it was not for the fact that he had wanted to say farewell to his "old friend", he could have ordered Monica to finish the job.</br>
</br>
Putting on the K2 kinetic skeleton with the optical invisibility module, Jiang Chen checked his equipment and confirmed everything. Then, he called out a snowmobile from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The distance of five kilometers was still a bit far away, not to mention being in a mountainous range. If they walked, it would be late into the night before they arrived.</br>
</br>
After Ayesha hopped on, Jiang Chen started the snowmobile and galloped toward the manor located halfway up the mountain.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Rather than saying it was a manor, a castle was the better fitting description.</br>
</br>
The northernmost manor of the Rothschild family was built in the 17th century and belonged to a Swedish prince. After several transactions, it was bought by the Rothschild family and renovated into a habitable manor. Other than the walls, it looked nothing like its former appearance.</br>
</br>
</br>
The snowmobile was recalled into the storage dimension. The two hiked up along the mountain path. When they were halfway, Ayesha gestured to Jiang Chen and then started optical invisibility to move up alone.</br>
</br>
The security guard wearing a thick jacket stood at the gate of the manor and yawned at the empty and lonely path.</br>
</br>
A cold gust blew by which made him shiver. He scanned around and then cursed under his breath.</br>
</br>
"F*ck, is there really anyone that will come to this god forbidden place?"</br>
</br>
Just as he said this, he did not notice a nearly transparent figure walk beside him.</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, under the dim light, he suddenly saw a line of footprints that did not belong to his on the snow. This immediately alerted him. However, he didn't have time to react before the series of current noises took away the consciousness left in him.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who had already taken out two guards after him came back and tasered him.</br>
</br>
An ordinary person wouldn't be able to wake up in a day.</br>
</br>
She dragged the security guard across the ground and hid him in the bushes, Ayesha proudly shook the electric taser in her hand towards Jiang Chen, as if she was saying, "Look, it was the correct choice to bring me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen made a helpless expression, got up from behind the bushes, and walked up to the main gate without any defense left.</br>
</br>
His original plan was to rush in with a rifle. Since this place was far away from the city, he didn't need to worry about the Finnish police showing up. However, a low-key mission also had its advantage. At least they could avoid some trouble before retreating.</br>
</br>
Easily avoiding the patrols of more than a dozen security guards, Jiang Chen followed Ayesha and successfully passed through the atrium into the main building. After entering the building, all defense suddenly seemed to disappear as there was not even a single guard in the building.</br>
</br>
"This defense is too lax." Walking up the stairs, Jiang Chen frowned. He examined at the decorations in the manor. Medieval armors and shields with accents of history and the Rothschild emblem smeared with time, these should be fairly old.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to take a step, Ayesha suddenly grabbed him and pointed to the corner of the wall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped, squinted his eyes before finally detected the oddity.</br>
</br>
"Infrared alarm?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded. She tossed out a special powder, and soon the infrared rays that were staggered in the hallway were outlined. Even with optically invisible, they didn't completely disappear. If they trigger the alarm, they may trigger some hidden traps.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's only confusion was that if Carmen protected himself like painting in a museum, does he not need to go to the washroom at night?</br>
</br>
"Give me some time."</br>
</br>
The little girl pulled out some equipment and began to dismantle the alarm, but Jiang Chen stopped her.</br>
</br>
"Leave it to me," Jiang Chen smiled, with confidence and then took out an EMP grenade from his pocket. He pulled the fuse and rolled it on the floor into the middle of the hallway.</br>
</br>
The static and current noise filled the corridor and the infrared rays all disappeared. Even the alarm system was fried.</br>
</br>
Looking at the speechless Ayesha, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"Time to go."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen whispered into the communication channel as looked his rifle, and took the first step forward.</br>
</br>
About half a year ago, Monica had been here in the manor. But when she came, Carmen was not here. Although she returned without success, she still remembered the structure of this manor. Such as Carmen's office, and the bedroom he once lived in.</br>
</br>
Following the map, standing at the door of Carmen's bedroom, Jiang Chen cleared his throat and politely knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
What surprised him, however, was that the room was unexpectedly quiet, and there was not a single sound.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned, realizing something was not right and turned on the radio life detection device. To his surprise, there was no sign of life in this entire building. The security guards were concentrated in the atrium while the servants were sleeping in the annex...</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Ayesha walked next to Jiang Chen and looked to him.</br>
</br>
"Still a step late...?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha unlocked the door with the omnipotent key. After entering the room, Jiang Chen turned on his tactical flashlight and examined the bedroom. The bedding was new, and there was a book placed on the bedside table. From the details, the owner of the manor should have just left not long ago...</br>
</br>
He moved forward, picked up the book on the bedside table wrapped in cowhide.</br>
</br>
Using the flashlight, he identified the two lines of gilded words on the cover. It should be a biography.</br>
</br>
The author was someone that belonged in the Rothschild family. It should be the family history of the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
"We certainly won't go back empty-handed." Jiang Chen's lips curved up as he turned the pages of the book with interest. He scanned the contents of the book.</br>
</br>
Just then, Ayesha received a call from a Ghost Agent.</br>
</br>
After speaking to the agent, she walked up to Jiang Chen's side and softly said.</br>
</br>
"The Russian's have returned us with a favor."</br>
</br>
"Oh? What kind of favor?" Jiang Chen stopped reading and asked.</br>
</br>
"They saw Carmen at the Arrow military base next to the Inari Lake refugee camp."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1056: The Secret History of The Rothschild Family</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The day had yet to break; an off-road vehicle was traversing through the frozen soil in northern Finland and galloping northeast.</br>
</br>
The mountain was not far from Lake Inari, but there were no proper roads connecting the north of Lake Inari to here. Fortunately, Jiang Chen stored an off-road vehicle in his storage dimension, otherwise, he would have encountered some issues.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was still the driver.</br>
</br>
Sunk into the front passenger seat, Jiang Chen's finger slid on the holographic screen, reading through the information scanned from the book. He was quite intrigued with the content inside.</br>
</br>
"Interesting..."</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Ayesha looked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I just saw some secrets. I finally understand now what the so-called prophets mean." With a sigh, Jiang Chen told Ayesha briefly what he read from the book he found.</br>
</br>
The Rothschild family started with Mayer Rothschild, but it was not him that brought the family to the top, but his son Nathan Rothschild.</br>
</br>
On the eve of Napoleon's first exile in March 1814, Nathan predicted that the Vienna and London stock market were about to enter a bull market, thus buying Austrian stocks. However, in just one year, Napoleon fled to Elba Island and returned to Paris for "Hundred Days". Nathan, bull on Austrian stocks, lost almost everything...</br>
</br>
So far, everything recorded in this family history was the same as Jiang Chen saw in the world financial history.</br>
</br>
However, in April 1815, just a month's time, historical differences appeared.</br>
</br>
After Napoleon's restoration, Nathan regrouped. On the one hand, he hoarded gold in London. As recorded in history, he openly predicted that the British government would fight on the European continent, and claimed that this war would force the British Empire to be stuck in an extended war. On the other hand, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, he changed his previous position of being bearish on the British, and quietly swept all the British government bonds that had fallen to 7% of the original price.</br>
</br>
Everything else happened according to history. In June of the same year, even the Duke of Wellington himself did not expect the outcome. He actually led the British Prussian coalition and defeated the invincible Napoleon.</br>
</br>
The British Army sung the triumphant songs, and brought the news of victory back to London. During this national celebration, Rothschild, with a large amount of British government bonds, became the largest creditor of the British Empire and became the biggest winner in the war.</br>
</br>
At that time, controlling the pound was the same as controlling the world.</br>
</br>
Interestingly, according to Nathan's own description, as early as April, he predicted the occurrence of this battle and even foresaw the end of the war.</br>
</br>
Nathan did not describe in detail how he got in touch with the Remnants of the Void. He didn't even mention the word Golden Apple. He just used vague words to describe this glory in honor of "the gift of my Lord".</br>
</br>
</br>
According to Lin Lin's research, some people with a unique brain structure possessed a higher Klein particle density. They naturally could perceive the specific frequency of the Klein particle signal, through specific cases such as dreams or the illusion of drunkenness.</br>
</br>
"I thought that the timeline of the two worlds diverged in World War II. I didn't expect that it changed since the Napoleon time." Jiang Chen sighed and closed the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
No wonder when he asked Lin Lin whether she had heard of Rothschild's name before, Lin Lin looked at him dumbfoundedly.</br>
</br>
It turned out that this family had never existed on the timeline of the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
This includes the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
It was the reason why the World War II ended much earlier there than the modern world.</br>
</br>
"So, for the Rothschild family, the Golden Apple is more like an amplifier?" Ayesha asked, "their body can detect the Klein particles from the Remnants of the Void?"</br>
</br>
"You can say that. Because brain itself cannot accept too much data, so the Remnants of the Void gave them the manufacturing process of Golden Apple, used their hands to create the Golden Apple that later gave birth of the technology of the Third Reich. The only thing that the Rothschild family did not expect was that the Fuhrer kicked them out once he got his hands on the Golden Apple." Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head.</br>
</br>
However, history still returned to the right track. Even the technology that transcended times didn't change the ending for the Third Reich.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could understand the intention of the Remnants of the Void. Perhaps they wanted to create a unified and militarized regime by interfering with history before humans could destroy themselves. However, history always repeated itself. History did not develop in the direction they expected, and even bred a multi-polar world that was more divided than the world divided into three powers.</br>
</br>
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of the third world, and the Pan-Asia Cooperation that never formed...</br>
</br>
"But... since they don't need the Golden Apples to hear from the Remnants of the Void, why did they lose contact with them in the past half century?" Ayesha was confused.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps only the Remnants of the Void know." Jiang Chen shrugged. "If you let me guess, those who are in the void probably felt they couldn't help more, so they shut up."</br>
</br>
If the Remnants of the Void couldn't transfer technology through the Golden Apple, the only thing that they could do was to use their own advantages in being the prophet of history. However, history was already changed by them. In the apocalypse where the Soviet Union dominated till the end of the twenty-second century, actually ended in the twentieth century. Everything changed beyond their expectations.</br>
</br>
Of course, it may be another possibility. The Rothschild family was abandoned by them. The Remnants of the Void believed that they couldn't complete the great cause of establishing the "Earth Federation", so they gave up.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then suddenly realized a problem and couldn't stop laughing with one hand rubbing his chin.</br>
</br>
"So, am I the chosen one?"</br>
</br>
At the last minute, those in the void seemed to have put antimatter in his hands.</br>
</br>
What does this mean? Am I the chosen one? Am I destined to be the first "Earth Master?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha stared at Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Although she didn't know what he was thinking, she could feel that Jiang Chen was in a good mood and not frustrated because they missed the target.</br>
</br>
For this simple reason, a bright smile also formed on her face.</br>
</br>
The rising sun gilded a beautiful layer of golden mist on her beautiful smile, and in this misty white morning, the two drove into the distance.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1057: Paltamo Refugee Camp</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After he hesitated for a moment, Kutpov made the decision not to shoot.</br>
</br>
Carmen was the number one target of the Ghost Agents, but not the number one target of the Russian Security Services.</br>
</br>
His mission was to place beacons to guide air strikes instead of assassinating Freemasonry members. Compared to the Freemasonry, Arrow sending mercenaries to Ukraine gave them more of a headache.</br>
</br>
Less than five hundred meters away, he had 100% confidence that he could use the sniper rifle behind his back to kill him. But if he shot, the mission would fail, and the entire Alpha team would also be killed.</br>
</br>
He could only watch Carmen sit into the Hummer and entered the depths of the base.</br>
</br>
Two minutes later, he was thankful for his decision.</br>
</br>
The roar of the engine came not far away from them and homing noise even caused the snow to scatter down from treetops.</br>
</br>
A Russian soldier behind Kutpov put his face on the ground and listened quietly for half a minute, then he whispered.</br>
</br>
"One kilometer away, between 30 and 50 vehicles."</br>
</br>
"At least one brigade, maybe two, dammit... the intelligence is wrong."</br>
</br>
With a binocular in his hand, Kutpov observed the situation in the camp.</br>
</br>
Carmen arrived at the military base next to Lake Inari, and Arrow suddenly sent two brigades to the area, all of which exceeded the expectations of the intelligence. At this time, it was obviously not a wise choice to sneak in. It was better to withdraw first and look for a high ground in the vicinity to observe the situation in the base before making further plans.</br>
</br>
What's more, there were still a lot of valuable intelligence to be reported.</br>
</br>
Thinking of this, he made a decisive decision and made a gesture of retreat.</br>
</br>
"The mission is cancelled, retreat to observation point B..."</br>
</br>
The group of people silently moved back and just like when they came they left without a trace.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Paltamo refugee camp, as its name suggested, was located on the frozen soil next to the town of Paltamo in northern Finland.</br>
</br>
The employer of the refugee camp was the "Frankberg Humanitarian Foundation", and the actual manager was Arrow, which accommodated nearly 400,000 refugees in the past two years and the number of refugees grew by 10,000 per month up till a month ago. Not only Muslims were sent here, but also illegal immigrants who refused to be repatriated for reasons other than war.</br>
</br>
The entire refugee camp was semi-closed and aimed to provide refugees with a "New World" to guide them in reaching self-sufficiency through labor.</br>
</br>
In addition to distributing a small amount of living necessities, many lucky winners also received the honor to enter the factories and farms invested by the foundation to produce bullets or potatoes. They were called lucky winners, because having a job here was considered extremely good. It meant that the family didn't need to starve to survive.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although the salary was meager, it was better than nothing.</br>
</br>
In addition to working in factories or farms, another good option was to sign up to join the mercenary. If they could survive through the month of hellish training, they would become the humblest of Arrow mercenaries. Not only could they get rid of their refugee status, but their families could also leave the camp in the future.</br>
</br>
Of course, joining the mercenaries as refugees meant they were often sent to the most dangerous battlefields after the end of training, and performed missions with the highest mortality rates, but at least there was hope, the hope to return to the civilized society with normal people.</br>
</br>
However, job opportunities were limited, and only few stepped onto the battlefield. Most people relied on necessities.</br>
</br>
Unemployment and poverty had always been the breeding ground for crime since ancient times. Fighting, robbery, and theft constantly happen there. Arrow obviously had no intention of establishing order. They only distributed bread and mineral water by number. As for these supplies getting robbed, as long as it didn't happen in front of them, they didn't care.</br>
</br>
Many people missed their lives in Europe. Sleeping in a warm and comfortable welfare home, living the life provided by other people, and occasionally enjoying the pagans... Thinking back, those days were "heavenly."</br>
</br>
There were no fences and checkpoints at the entrance to the camp. Anyone could freely enter or leave.</br>
</br>
Refugees who live here occasionally headed to the nearby towns to buy some necessities with salaries. Arrow was not concerned about refugees escaping. Without a passport or visa, only two possibilities exist for those who escaped, freezing to death on the road down south, or being captured by the police and sent back.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen parked the off-road vehicle on the tundra outside the refugee camp, he persuaded Ayesha to wait for him, and then walked to the camp.</br>
</br>
As he stepped into the camp, he immediately noticed that at least a few pairs of eyes focused on him. Although he didn't know their intentions, he knew that one of their intentions was not friendliness.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not worried about being recognized. The button on his neck already used holographic imaging technology to "change" his face into a typical Central Asian. Other than his expression being too dull, there was almost no difference with a real face.</br>
</br>
This button-sized device was a gadget designed by Yao Yao. The little girl's hardware skill was not as superb as her expertise in software, but it was still excellent. Jiang Chen's first drone was created by her.</br>
</br>
He lowered the cap on his head. Pleased with his perfect camouflage, he stepped into the refugee camp.</br>
</br>
From the image returned by the satellite, his was very close to Arrow's military base. However, it would be too dumb to rush inside. Even a Gundam wouldn't be able to survive through countless RPGs. He must gain some information before entering.</br>
</br>
For example, how many people were there, how many tanks, and if an important person was paying a visit…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the unscrupulous gazes, before the refugees put "unfriendliness" into action, he turned into the side alley, released a drone and scanned the nearby map, and quickly walked into a house.</br>
</br>
From the corner of eyes, he noticed several brawny men in down jackets run towards him as soon as he started moving faster.</br>
</br>
"@#*!" The man with a red headscarf first ran to the alley and looked at the empty alleyway. "He ran away!"</br>
</br>
"What should we do? Should we report him?" The brawny man behind the man foolishly asked.</br>
</br>
"Are you a pig?" Harriet slapped his head in anger. "What did the boss tell us? Go and find him! If we can't find him... Just pretend his never happened! You hear me!"</br>
</br>
"Yes." The people gathered around nodded and quickly ran into the alley.</br>
</br>
Harriet hesitated as he watched the thugs go chasing in, he gritted, then quickly followed.</br>
</br>
However, when they went into the alley, Jiang Chen already made many turns.</br>
</br>
He easily left those people behind. After he confirmed with the drone that they couldn't catch up, Jiang Chen stepped into a backstreet.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to open the holographic screen to confirm the map, a voice speaking broken-English came from the corner.</br>
</br>
"Are you a reporter."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and looked for the source of the voice.</br>
</br>
A body with slightly dark skin was squatting over a ditch and washing his clothes. The large eyes were looking to him with curiosity and caution.</br>
</br>
As if he had heard something interesting, Jiang Chen looked at the boy and pointed to his own face, "Do I look like a reporter?"</br>
</br>
The little boy shrugged.</br>
</br>
"I don't know, but if you are a reporter, I advise you to be careful of those who wear gray down jackets. They are employees of Arrow. If they know a reporter has sneaked in, your best ending is getting your phone confiscated and then getting tossed into the nearest town after a beating."</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of people wearing grey down jackets. How can I distinguish them?"</br>
</br>
"Use your eyes. There will be an arrow-shaped sign on their arms. Also, you have to be careful around the Sami Gang."</br>
</br>
"Sami Gang?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
The boy did not speak, just blinked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and put his hand into his pocket. With the cover of the clothes, he took out two "Franklins" from his storage dimension and stuffed it into the boy's hand.</br>
</br>
"Your tip."</br>
</br>
When the boy saw the two hundred-dollar bills, his eyes almost bulged out, but soon he used his innocent acting to take the huge sum of money and stuff the bills into his shoes.</br>
</br>
"They are gangs in the refugee camp, because Sami is the head of the thugs, so they call themselves the Sami Gang. They were already gangs back in Syria and were sent here after being captured in Frankberg. Based on rumors, they are close with Arrow, so a few of Sami's important thugs avoided military service. In short, they are the most difficult people here to deal with. If you don't want to be miserable, it is better to stay away from those people."</br>
</br>
"I thought your boss was a person from Arrow." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Arrow mercenaries don't care about us. We are just bugs to them," Without any fluctuation his emotions, the boy spoke indifferently. "This refugee camp is like a prison. Arrow mercenaries are the prison guards, we are prisoners, and Sami Gangs are the thugs. As long as not too many people die here at once, the production of the factories is unaffected... If you have a camera on you, can you hide my face? If my face appears on a news report—"</br>
</br>
"Rest assured, I'm not a reporter." Jiang Chen smiled. He was prepared to leave. "Thank you for your information. If someone asks if you have seen me..."</br>
</br>
But he stopped mid-sentence.</br>
</br>
Just now, he suddenly thought of a brilliant idea.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to send a brigade to Finland nor did he need to create something shocking to kick away the "turtle shell" on Carmen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then looked back at the boy, and asked, "Do you know where to find that Sami?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1058"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1058: Slap People with Money</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"A reporter has sneaked in?" Sami sat on the sofa with his legs crossed as he looked at the thug trying to flatter him with a sneer. "Harriet certainly got braver. He learned to play tricks with me."</br>
</br>
Catching every journalist who sneaked in was the task that Arrow gave him. At the main entrances of the refugee camp, he arranged gang members to stay there day and night. They could easily distinguish the people from town with those from the refugee camp, or the outside.</br>
</br>
While he looked powerful now, if any photos or videos leaked out that were damaging to the camp's image, he would be the first one to receive consequences.</br>
</br>
"Get Harriet to come and see me. Make up a random reason and don't mention the reporter," Sami said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" The thug straightened his back and took the order.</br>
</br>
"There is still something else. We can't just leave the reporter out there roaming. Get our brothers to search for him. Remember, the reporters like to go to the dirtiest and messiest places." Sami then paused and smiled at the thug. "Order the brothers for me."</br>
</br>
The thug was overjoyed and immediately showed his loyalty to the boss before running downstairs.</br>
</br>
After the door closed, Sami leisurely leaned back on the sofa and picked up the glass filled with cheap alcohol from the table. While supplies were short in the camp, it was only for the honest people. As the "leader of a faction", there were always ways to get the good stuff.</br>
</br>
As to whether drinking was a conflict with the doctrine? Anyway, he never considered himself as a qualified believer.</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a faint sigh in the corner of the room.</br>
</br>
"Why are you so sure the foreigner is a reporter?"</br>
</br>
There was a strange voice in the room, and Sami was suddenly alerted. When he stood up from the sofa and reached behind him, it was already too late. His eyes met with a black hole and the eyes of a young man.</br>
</br>
Before Sami could point the pistol at him, the revolver in Jiang Chen's hand was already aimed at his head. From the shadows, Jiang Chen walked out. "I advise you to stop what you are doing. I can promise you that before you can take out your gun, I have enough time to aim at your head and then shoot your balls. "</br>
</br>
It was hard to identify the Sami Gang from the crowd, but it was easy to find Sami. There were not many decent buildings in the entire camp, and the Sami Gang was housed in one of them. Although the three-story apartment buildings were not luxurious, the building absolutely stood out in this refugee camp.</br>
</br>
These apartment buildings were built at the start of the refugee camp used as a poster image by Arrow. They hired a well-known photographer to take photos and videos of the "happy life of refugees" and uploaded them online to fool the netizens.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen followed the boy before he arrived at the Sami Gang's nest, and walked in under the disguise of optical invisibility.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Sami heard Jiang Chen's words, he slowly loosened the grip on the gun. With a stiff expression, he put his hands over his head.</br>
</br>
"Who are you, what do you want? Who sent you..."</br>
</br>
"No one sent me." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then you are here for money?" Money could be made again, but he only had one life. Therefore, Sami said in pain, "My money is in the safe on your left-hand side. The password is 5657. You can take the money, take it all. Just let me go."</br>
</br>
"Money?" Jiang Chen groaned and trying his hardest not to laugh, "How much can you have?"</br>
</br>
Sami heard the sarcasm in Jiang Chen's words, but he did not dare to show any anger as he said anxiously.</br>
</br>
"90,000... no, 100,000 euros."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was a little surprised. He originally thought that this guy has at most 30,000 in this condition, but he managed to beat his expectation. Certainly, a talent.</br>
</br>
"Money, let's talk about money," Jiang Chen lowered his gun slightly and smiled at him. "You have 100,000 euros in your safe, right? I'll offer you 200,000 euros, as long as you do something for me."</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's words, greed appeared in Sami's eyes but it instantly faded into a strong vigilance. The higher the reward, the more the money burned. 200,000 euros was already a huge sum for someone like him. But without his life, even two million was just a number.</br>
</br>
"What do you want me to do?" Swallowing, Sami asked calmly.</br>
</br>
"It's very simple," Jiang Chen said emotionlessly. "Rebel."</br>
</br>
"No way! Are you crazy?" Sami exclaimed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen inserted the revolver into his pocket and sat on the table next to the window sill.</br>
</br>
"Nothing is impossible. Let's be direct, are you willing to stay here forever? Just to be the emperor of a refugee camp? Your criminal genius can absolutely help you climb to a broader stage, such as... trampling the UA Law."</br>
</br>
Sami admitted that Jiang Chen's blueprint was tempting, but he was not foolish enough to believe what other people say. He could easily leave any moment, but the problem was that they can't survive in the outside world.</br>
</br>
However, the most important thing was that they can't win at all!</br>
</br>
"You can't succeed, they are an army! You want to use a group of unarmed refugees to attack an army? Stop joking!"</br>
</br>
"If you are not unarmed?" Jiang Chen smiled. "I can provide you with weapons."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused and emphasized, "A lot of weapons."</br>
</br>
"...Who are you?" Sami asked, staring at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, in fact... I'm an agent of a human rights organization. But it doesn't matter who I am. The important thing is that the refugees here are suffering." Jiang Chen made up an identity and changed into an impassioned tone, "You are a believer, you allow those infidels to treat your fellow believers like this? Where is the courage flowing in your blood? You should stand up, pick up some weapons and fight for your deserved rights!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt that these words were not convincing enough, so he added a sentence.</br>
</br>
"If you help us successfully get rid of the cancer of the human civilization, I can solve the problem of nationality for you. Believe me, no matter which country you want to go to, we can help you."</br>
</br>
Sami twitched.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to bother with nationality. If you can really get weapons… compared to an empty cheque, why don't we talk about money again."</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen made a "please" gesture.</br>
</br>
Undisguised greed once again filled his pupils, Sami made an outrageous offer, "One million dollars!"</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's attitude made Sami pause for a second before he added.</br>
</br>
"I want to see cash, who knows if you are—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen directly reached into his pocket and took out a bundle of cash and slapped it on his chest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the wide-eyed Sami, who was busy picking up the money, then he said in an nonchalant tone, "The 100,000 dollars is my deposit. Now, shall we can sit down and talk about how you can get the rest? "</br>
</br>
While saying this, Jiang Chen silently added a sentence in his mind—</br>
</br>
Dammit, how come I didn't try this before? It is so satisfying to slap people with money!</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1059: Boost Suppor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A problem that could be dealt with using money is not a problem at all. One million dollars was a huge sum for Sami, but was it for Jiang Chen?</br>
</br>
As for whether or not Sami would have other intentions, Jiang Chen was not worried at all. When Sami took the deposit, Jiang Chen pointed a gun at him and forced him to put on an electronic collar. Then, he threateningly said.</br>
</br>
"After the weapons are ready, someone will come to see you. As for the collar on your neck, I will deactivate it after the deed is done. But if you dare to play tricks with me, I promise you, your head will fly away like a football."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then jumped out of the window and activated the optical invisibility to hide his figure after landing. He swiftly came and swiftly went, and did not attract anyone's attention.</br>
</br>
Sami was astonished by Jiang Chen's moves. It was a three-story building. Any ordinary person would be crippled after that landing. But when he looked down, Jiang Chen had already disappeared.</br>
</br>
Cold sweat soon emerged on Sami's forehead.</br>
</br>
He was wondering why he didn't notice Jiang Chen when he arrived. With his skill, it was way too easy to take his life...</br>
</br>
While Sami was still astonished, Jiang Chen was already a street out. He turned into the alley and saw the boy waiting for him there.</br>
</br>
"Did you see Sami?" As Jiang Chen came back intact, the boy looked at him strangely.</br>
</br>
Without any injuries, when did the Sami gangsters behave so well?</br>
</br>
"I saw him... here, this is your tip." Jiang Chen took out a hundred dollar bill from his pocket and stuffed it into the boy's hand. With a smile, he said. "Now, help me do one more thing. I must tell you in advance, there are risks with this task, but the reward is very handsome."</br>
</br>
"Since you are telling me about it, then I should be able to do it." The boy hid the bill in his shoe and asked directly, "how much are you going to give me?"</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand dollars." Jiang Chen put up a finger. "I have 500,000 newspapers. I need all the refugees to see it within one day while avoiding Arrow."</br>
</br>
"Newspaper? Are you planning to sell newspapers in the slums? Don't bother, no one will buy that." The boy looked at Jiang Chen with peculiar eyes.</br>
</br>
"It's not for sale, it's free." Jiang Chen shook his head. "You don't have to worry about why I'm doing this, you just need to do what I say and give the newspaper to everyone, or put it in a place where it will attract attention. Then the ten thousand dollars is yours."</br>
</br>
The boy hesitated.</br>
</br>
"Can you prepay me five hundred dollars? I can't distribute out 500,000 copies in one day."</br>
</br>
"Are you going to hire someone to help you?" Jiang Chen looked at him, intrigued by his strategy. "Who are you going to hire? Are they reliable?"</br>
</br>
"They are also children. Rest assured, I can swear on my life they are all trustworthy people." The boy patted his chest.</br>
</br>
"Really? Okay, then go and prepare." Jiang Chen looked at the time on his watch. "At five o'clock this afternoon, come to the nearby town to pick up the newspapers."</br>
</br>
</br>
"How can I contact you? I don't have a mobile phone." Seeing Jiang Chen was preparing to leave, the boy hurriedly asked.</br>
</br>
"You don't need to contact me. When you walk into the town, someone will contact you." Jiang Chen waved his hand and disappeared at the end of the alley.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It is not enough to prepare for the war. It is also important to build momentum for the war. You can't expect refugees would be willing to fight for you simply because you gave them some weapons.</br>
</br>
However, if they can be convinced that they are being oppressed by the pagans. Fighting against Arrow would be for themselves and they could even go to "heaven" after death. Without the need for supervision, they could pick up weapons and fight.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time Jiang Chen has done this. He was very good at it.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came out of the campground, Ayesha who was anxiously waiting for him, immediately unlocked the door.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen got into the car, Ayesha started the engine while asking. "How is the situation?"</br>
</br>
"Arrow's military base is located on the other side of the logging farm, about four kilometers from the refugee camp. There are a large number of training facilities in the base, as well as a research institute located in an underground bunker. The permanent force is a 2,000-person motorized brigade. There are enough weapons and ammunition to arm a division. Although there are no tanks, there are ten 30-ton 'Puma' armored vehicles. According to the thugs in the camp, an important person has come to the military base."</br>
</br>
"Carmen?"</br>
</br>
"Definitely has to be him." Jiang Chen smiled. "Go to a nearby town. We'll rest there for the night."</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, Sami knew a lot of information. Even information such as "an important person came by helicopter", "arrived only last night". After gaining all this information, he couldn't help but exclaim that Carmen really bumped into him. The guy had just stepped out with his front foot and Jiang Chen had arrived moments later.</br>
</br>
If Carmen was late, there wouldn't be so much trouble.</br>
</br>
"A motorized brigade, we can't take them alone." Ayesha's eyebrows slightly furrowed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously. "We don't need to deal with them. Someone will deal with them for us."</br>
</br>
Back in the nearby town, based on Jiang Chen's orders, Ayesha immediately got in touch with Monica. After receiving news about Carmen's whereabouts, Monica immediately left for Finland. She was at the international airport in Helsinki, Finland.</br>
</br>
Unlike Jiang Chen and Ayesha, two illegal trespassers, Monica held a passport and possessed a relationship network in Finland. Compared to Jiang Chen, some things were easier for her to deal with.</br>
</br>
On the phone, Jiang Chen explained two things to her.</br>
</br>
The first was to rent a warehouse for him near the town of Paltamo. The second was to use the special channels of Ghost Agents in Europe to transport a batch of weapons to Europe, and the more the better.</br>
</br>
Just as Monica was on her way, Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse. He edited the human experiment of the 7th Institute and related reports with the refugees a few days ago. Then, he asked Lin Lin to print 500,000 copies for him.</br>
</br>
Putting these newspapers in any other place would be regarded as old news, but it would absolutely be breaking news in the refugee camp. This area is in the mountainous range of Finland. Of course, there was no network in the refugee camps located on the tundra.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen trusts that the contents of this newspaper would not only be interesting but would also be shocking.</br>
</br>
While the news may not be enough to start a resistance, but at least they would give them a reason to fight.</br>
</br>
Because only certain content could be printed, these 500,000 newspapers were only one page and two-sided; one box held tens of thousands of copies. But 500,000 copies still filled more than 40 large cartons.</br>
</br>
These cartons were shipped to the modern world by the evening.</br>
</br>
With a group of children from the refugee camp, the boy arrived in the town as promised. As for how they would transport the cartons and distribute the papers, Jiang Chen didn't plan to ask, nor was he interested. He only cared about results.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also certain that for money's sake, the efficiency of the boy would amaze him.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Three days passed since Jiang Chen arrived in Finland.</br>
</br>
During these three days, the fire of revolution had already spread throughout Frankberg.</br>
</br>
Before the coalition of the "People's Liberation Front" and the 10th Armored Division arrived in City B, the protesters had already occupied the capital and protested to the authorities by blocking police stations and military encampments. The special operations division stationed in City B's morale was low. It seemed that neither the soldiers nor the commanders wished to carry out this pointless war.</br>
</br>
The two sides were restraint to not use heavy weapons, and the situation seemed to be stuck in a deadlock. However, it could be foreseen that it was only a matter of time before New Choice Party must step down.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that Rothschild has lost control over Frankberg.</br>
</br>
On the Finnish side, Arrow's military base remained quiet and Carmen didn't come out since he stepped inside. Jiang Chen suspected that he was doing something inside, but since his satellite had locked the area, he did not believe that he could slip out under his eyes.</br>
</br>
As for the refugee camp, the 500,000 newspapers printed by Jiang Chen caused an uproar. Most people's understanding of human experiments stopped on anatomy. Whenever the refugees thought that their fellow people were taken away from the camp and placed on the surgery table and slaughtered, almost no one could sit still.</br>
</br>
Now every refugee looked at Arrow like beasts feasting on people. In particular, Arrow's force conscription in the refugee camp on several occasions almost escalated into conflicts.</br>
</br>
Arrow was puzzled about why these refugees suddenly became so fierce. They previous lacked control in the camp. Now that the only insider, Sami Gang, was controlled by Jiang Chen, they couldn't spot anything unusual within a short amount of time.</br>
</br>
Even if they did spot anything unusual, they wouldn't think more into it.</br>
</br>
Every time they transported the necessities, they stayed inside armored vehicles, and the soldiers were armed with bullets loaded. They encountered more than once where the refugees fought for supplies, but the violent rioters never succeeded once.</br>
</br>
It was too easy to abuse the refugees holding a steel pipe or a brick.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Next to the pine forest near the town of Paltamo, there was a long-abandoned warehouse next to the farmland scattered with weeds.</br>
</br>
The space inside the warehouse was spacious, more than thousands of square meters in size. But for some reasons, the farm was abandoned for a long time along with the warehouse. Monica only used 30,000 euros to buy the warehouse from the owner previously used to store farm equipment.</br>
</br>
Of course, it was now filled with tightly sealed containers...</br>
</br>
"G36? Oh my!" Sami opened the plastic box, then picked up a G36 automatic rifle from the box and aimed with it in excitement. "German equipment, how did you get it?"</br>
</br>
</br>
After the occupation of the rebel army in Bava, the local military factories fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Front. With the relationship between Celestial Trade and the government in exile, it was too easy to obtain light weapons. The reason for choosing G36s was mainly because of the bullet processing factory near the refugee camp produced the 5.56mm ammunition.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and didn't talk nonsense with him. Instead, he pointed to the equipment in the corner of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
"There are 5,000 guns here, 400 RPG-7s, more than 30 mortars, and plenty of ammunition. Now they are all yours. I have only one request; under my order, take your people, and do what you are good at."</br>
</br>
Sami gulped.</br>
</br>
With his eyes on the row of pristine rifles and RPG-7 launchers, his scalp felt numb. While stunned by the power of the young man in front of him, he couldn't help but to reflect on the choice to join on this man's ship.</br>
</br>
But in any case, he must go forward now.</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to help you move this in?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No, my people have a way..." Sami shook his head, then he hesitated. He looked at Jiang Chen and asked. "Have you thought about the problem after this? If the Finnish army is deployed—"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped his words. "You don't have to worry about it, you just do what I said."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the map outlined with the plan from the table and stuffed it into Sami's hand who was still full of doubts. After sending him away, Jiang Chen did not stop, and soon left the warehouse and locked the iron gate of the warehouse.</br>
</br>
There were only two keys, one in his hand and one in Sami's hand. A new batch of supplies would arrive in the refugee camp this afternoon. There would be two armored vehicles and one hundred mercenaries. The first step to resistance in the refugee camp was to takeout this escort team.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At eight o'clock in the evening, under the escort of the armored vehicles, trucks slowly entered the center of the refugee camp. The uniformed mercenaries jumped off the trucks and set up a blockade line as usual, separating the eagerly awaiting refugees from the vehicles.</br>
</br>
The necessities would be unloaded here and then distributed to the various supply stations. Each refugee had its own number, which was equivalent to their "identity card" living here. They could receive supplies at supply stations by number.</br>
</br>
"Get into a line, get the supplies in order... Sh*t, so many fu*king people." Ennis put down the microphone while he cursed, then lit a cigarette and watched his men shove the refugees over the yellow line away.</br>
</br>
He already forgot the number of times he had been here. But every time, he wished that the mission could end sooner. He didn't want to stay for a second here.</br>
</br>
Just then, his deputy Glick came over and asked him to borrow a lighter. He lit one for himself and cussed.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, I really don't know what the refugees think."</br>
</br>
"What's the mess?" Ennis narrowed his eyes and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Not any mess. You didn't see how they looked at us; they look like they want to tear us apart." Glick shook his head, and the contemptuous sight swept over the ragged men. "Do these people not know how to be grateful? If it weren't for us, they couldn't even be able to eat."</br>
</br>
"There is no point talking about grateful to these people," Ennis had a sight that seemed like he has read life, through the smoky smoke rings, he said. "Only civilized people will be grateful."</br>
</br>
"Maybe." Glick tossed away the cigarette in his hand and pointed to the direction of the supply station. "You take it easy, I will go there and see."</br>
</br>
"Go." Ennis waved his hand and grinned.</br>
</br>
After Glick left, the cigarette between his fingers almost burned out. Throwing the cigarette on the floor, Ennis was preparing to patrol the team to see if anyone is being lazy. However, there was a sudden commotion in the crowd.</br>
</br>
Ennis frowned slightly and looked in the direction of the commotion. But then, an exclamation from the top of the Hummer instantly froze his heartbeat.</br>
</br>
"RPG-!"</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
The violent explosion was followed by the screams of the crowd.</br>
</br>
The side was covered in flames. The "Puma" armored vehicle at the front was firing while desperately trying to retreat through the crowd into the alley. However, just as it was about the crash through a wall, four more RPGs flew out from the crowd.</br>
</br>
This time, there was no armor to block the RPGs. Ennis saw it with the corner of his eye that the armored vehicle turned into a ball of fire. The occupant cried out in pain while climbing out from the top. He desperately rolled in vain while trying to extinguish the fire that burned his whole body.</br>
</br>
There was fire everywhere.</br>
</br>
There was blood everywhere.</br>
</br>
And the flying bullets, and the disfigured corpses...</br>
</br>
The sudden attacks stunned the mercenaries, who had to fire back against covers.</br>
</br>
The blast of the explosion turned the Hummer in front of Ennis. He had no time to say something before his remaining consciousness was swallowed up by the steel fragments and the fire ball...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1061: Ragtag</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Here's the command center... What? There's a riot at the refugee camp. How's that possible?"</br>
</br>
"I repeat, the transport team was attacked! We need backup! Sh*t—"</br>
</br>
Following an explosion, the communication ended with static.</br>
</br>
At the military base, several communication officers stared at each other in shock while conveying the confusion and shock through their eyes. Fortunately, the head of the command center responded quickly as he immediately grabbed a radio and connected to the rapid response force at the base, then reported the news to the person in charge.</br>
</br>
In two minutes, two heavy transport helicopters and four Blackhawk helicopters took off and brought 32 heavily armed special forces. They wore "Lightning" exoskeletons and were armed with a special shell-less rifle newly developed by the Krupp Group. They were armed to their teeth.</br>
</br>
However, they still underestimated the scale of the riot. When the helicopters arrived on the scene, the narrow streets were filled with the wreckage of Hummers. More than half of the hundred mercenaries were killed, leaving the rest of the mercenaries struggling to fend off the siege from the refugees.</br>
</br>
Indeed, the enemy was a mob, but they clearly underestimated the numbers of the mob. The most important thing was that these refugees were very familiar with the layout of the refugee camps. Even if the mercenaries who lost communication with them were brave and courageous, they could only find cover under bullets coming from all directions.</br>
</br>
The eyebrows of the team captain, Bruno, twitched a few times as he examined the battlefield below. Then he picked up the intercom on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Well, guys, let's bring our brothers back. Hunter-1,2, descend in height, prepare to lower the rope, deploy defense lines at the evacuation point, and cover our brothers as they retreat. Hunters-3, 4 cover in the air, get ready to fire the Gatlin and don't worry about refugee casualties—fire at any refugee you see with guns!"</br>
</br>
"Hunter-1, roger. Deploying."</br>
</br>
"Hunter-2..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
More than half of the thirty-two special forces descended to the ground, and these warriors with mechanical exoskeletons were indeed not comparable to the average soldier. In the dark alleys, under the cover of the Gatlin machine guns, they managed to clear out a way through the chaos.</br>
</br>
Krupp certainly had a different perspective on weapon design. After discovering that "Lightning" was useless against EMP, it gave up on the lightweight design. The use of steel instead of functional plastics turned the exoskeleton into a power armor mold. The formed Faraday cage shielded them from electromagnetic pulses.</br>
</br>
In addition to the EMP protection enhancement, the armor's defense also improved drastically. Looking through a binocular on the battlefield, Jiang Chen discovered that the 5.56mm used by the refugees couldn't penetrate the steel plates in front of their chests.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, the cost of this type of improvement was exceptionally high—at least five times the cost of the previous version.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, war was a lubricant of a civilization. The problem they previously didn't understand could be resolved after taking two punches to the face. Perhaps they could give Freemasonry another decade, and they would find a "trivial method" to deal with the advanced technology of Celestial Trade. Just like how the US military managed to avoid roadside bombings in Iraq.</br>
</br>
"We can't wait any longer." Jiang Chen put the binoculars into his pocket and took out his PK2000 assault rifle, which was rusting in the storage dimension. "If I don't help them, the mob will collapse. At least I have to take out those two Blackhawks."</br>
</br>
There weren't many people who were directly killed by Gatling guns on the street, but the firepower exerted immense psychological pressure on the people taking cover.</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded and was preparing to go forward but was stopped by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hey, wait, what can you do if you go empty-handed? Can you dismantle a plane with your bare hands?" Jiang Chen dragged her back and confirmed no one was nearby. Then he took out two portable air defense missiles from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
"This is the 'Viper' Rocket Launcher air defense model—you should know how to use it. Inside the box is a replaceable warhead; bring two rounds. You can have two Blackhawks while I take the other four." Jiang Chen picked up a launcher from the ground and loaded the warhead into the tube. He turned around and raised an eyebrow. "Which two do you want?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked a little hesitant.</br>
</br>
"Can you leave them all to me? I'm worried about you..."</br>
</br>
"No worries; this isn't difficult at all. Well, since you aren't picking, the farthest two are up to you. I'm going to go now."</br>
</br>
After that, Jiang Chen jumped from the three-story building, rushing forward with the launcher.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen had already set off, Ayesha sighed. She shook her head and picked up the launcher and warheads from the ground then also jumped downstairs.</br>
</br>
On the other side, Bruno, sitting on the Blackhawk helicopter overlooking the battlefield, didn't realize that disaster was about to come. Rather, he felt somewhat relieved. The wounded and the mercenaries preparing to retreat gathered near the evacuation point, and the four Blackhawks ascended in height again. Now, four Gatlin guns hovered in the area. The situation was slowly turning in their favor.</br>
</br>
As long as they repelled the mob, the two heavy transport helicopters could land and take everyone away.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, his right eye twitched, and a strong uneasiness suddenly overwhelmed him.</br>
</br>
It was too late to understand the cause of this uneasiness. A rocket from the ground flew to him and smashed into the tail of the helicopter without warning. Bruno only heard an explosion that broke his eardrum, and the entire helicopter was sent into a tailspin.</br>
</br>
"Damnit! We were hit! Hunter-3 is calling command center. We're falling!"</br>
</br>
The first officer roared into the intercom, and the pilot clutched onto the stick, trying to control the rotating nose or at least adjust the helicopter to better prepare for a crash landing.</br>
</br>
"Get up! Sh*t—"</br>
</br>
The helicopter crashed into a residential building, and the flare was visible even two streets away.</br>
</br>
Looking at the smoke rising in the air, Jiang Chen put down the launcher. Under a reverent look from the refugees, he switched onto the second warhead. He aimed at the second helicopter then pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
The crash of the Hunter-3 shocked all the mercenaries. The tail flame was obviously not from some smuggled RPG—it could only have been a portable air defense missile.</br>
</br>
Why did the refugees have air defense missiles?!</br>
</br>
It was too late to think about this issue. The evacuation plan was temporarily canceled, and the remaining helicopters immediately ascended in height to avoid the range of the air defense missiles. However, from the moment they were targeted by Jiang Chen, their fates were already doomed.</br>
</br>
The second anti-aircraft missile hit its target, and another Blackhawk crashed to the ground. Under the horror of all the mercenaries, the explosion sparked a fire in all directions...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The team that escorted relief necessities were attacked at the refugee camp. The mob even forced the special forces to falter.</br>
</br>
After receiving the news, Sardes arrived at the headquarters immediately.</br>
</br>
"Not just the fleet, but eleven supply stations in the camps were also attacked. The medical staff and security guards have been taken hostage. The military factories outside the refugee camp are also occupied... These snakes." The brigade commander in charge of the military base slammed his fist against the map.</br>
</br>
"We should immediately seek help from the Finnish side. The situation is now out of control. It's only through mobilizing the army—" an advisor suggested.</br>
</br>
Just then, the door was pushed open and Carmen walked in.</br>
</br>
"Don't inform Finland—them taking over the issue will only make this simple suppression into a humanitarian crisis," Carmen said emotionlessly as he stood in front of the map with his hands behind him. "There's no doubt that Celestial Trade was behind all of this. Very good, very good, very good...."</br>
</br>
Carmen nodded and said three "very goods" in a row. Carmen grinned peculiarly and suddenly looked at the brigade commander in charge of the base.</br>
</br>
"How many new recruits are there at the base?"</br>
</br>
"A total of 4,000 people..." The brigade commander immediately reacted. "Are you worried that they will revolt and join the refugees? That's certainly a possibility, but..."</br>
</br>
"Take them to the underground research institute, and my guards will take care of them." Carmen turned around and ordered in an irrefutable tone: "Just say that there's a riot outside and they need to temporarily enter the underground bunker."</br>
</br>
The three men stared at each other in confusion while Carmen left the room.</br>
</br>
On a hill one kilometer away, Kutpov quietly observed the movements at Arrow base with his binoculars.</br>
</br>
For the past few days, he and his Alpha team lurked there, looking for opportunities to sneak into the base. With the arrival of Carmen, an entire brigade was added to the base's forces, but the patrol frequency more than doubled.</br>
</br>
It wasn't until today that they finally got their opportunity.</br>
</br>
First, there was black smoke in the direction of the refugee camp a few kilometers away. Then the special forces at the military base were dispatched urgently. Combined with the information about the mobilization of Celestial Trade weapons from the rear, it must be the Ghost Agents making a move.</br>
</br>
However, these agents were indeed ruthless. They stuffed more than 5,000 guns into the hands of "terrorist reserves". The security situation in Finland would be messy for a while...</br>
</br>
Kutpov grinned with the thought in mind, and the scars and wrinkles on his face mixed together.</br>
</br>
He gestured at the team behind him, then took out a hook lock and got up from the snow.</br>
</br>
"Get ready. Set off in two minutes."</br>
</br>
Just as the Alpha team started its operations, the battle at the refugee camp was over.</br>
</br>
</br>
All four Blackhawk helicopters were down, and one of the two heavy transport helicopters was also taken down while the other one escaped. With air support completely eliminated, the mercenaries who originally reinforced their defenses now lost the only advantage they had.</br>
</br>
The exoskeleton that covered the entire body in steel was indeed strong, but the strongest armor couldn't stop an attack from the refugees. Especially the guy who got a Molotov cocktail tossed onto his face—he turned into a ball of fire along with his armor. It was especially miserable since Jiang Chen didn't know if he died suffocating or burned alive. Neither of those possibilities sounded humanitarian. He just remembered that when the fire on the poor fellow was extinguished, the steel plate in front of his chest turned red…</br>
</br>
When the fierceness of these believers was ignited, their combat power was nothing to scoff at.</br>
</br>
After the end of the battle, the refugees unleashed their bullets into the air and yelled out to express their joy of victory. Ten bruised mercenaries were tied up by ropes and taken to the square of the refugee camp. They were pinned to the ground by more than 20 strong men.</br>
</br>
Sami, who was carrying a rifle, went to the center of the square. He pretended he was a hero who liberated his people from "slavery." He wasn't used to this change in identity, but the mercenaries who were kneeling on the ground were also in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Three days ago, Sami was just a hound for Arrow.</br>
</br>
"I was angry when I learned about the massacre that took place at the 7th Institute."</br>
</br>
In the center of the square, standing in front of the ten captives, Sami grinned cruelly and looked around the refugees.</br>
</br>
"A lot of people might be confused. Why do we have to stand up and resist? Because they killed a few of our people? Wrong! What really makes me angry isn't that they used a knife to dig out our livers but that they view as livestock. They're feeding us, and when they need us, they pull a group of us out to die. We have to lie on the operating table to help them with their human experiments. But we treat all of this as if it's normal!"</br>
</br>
"This isn't normal!"</br>
</br>
Sami lowered his voice and loaded the rifle. The mercenaries seemed to have guessed what he was going to do and looked at him in horror. They tried to shrink back but were held firmly by the people behind them. They could only make pig-like cries with their sealed mouths.</br>
</br>
"We aren't captive camels. We're wolves in the desert. We will use our claws and teeth to tear up the pagans who oppressed us!"</br>
</br>
His voice was impassioned, and Sami aimed at the mercenaries on the ground, gnashing his teeth.</br>
</br>
"Let them loose and we'll give them a chance to escape. Halal will decide their fate."</br>
</br>
The sound of the assault rifle echoed in the square. The injured captives with their hands and feet tied up simply couldn't escape, not to mention that there was a wall behind them.</br>
</br>
The blood painted the wall red, and the refugees cheered at their leader. Even the refugees who were still hesitating were now influenced by the "sacred war". They turned into fanatical war activists in the next second.</br>
</br>
"I told you, we didn't have to do it ourselves." He was standing on the roof of the building not far from the central square. When he saw that the "gunpowder barrel" was ignited, he smiled. "They're natural warriors. The genes of war are integrated into their bone marrow. They have everything that civilized people don't have, and they've hardly changed with the times."</br>
</br>
Not far away, the Sami gang...or now the Sami Army, the militants who used red headscarves as a symbol, had begun to distribute the supplies they captured to the refugees.</br>
</br>
Three days ago, the Sami gang suppressed the refugees and made a living by exploiting them, but now they became the heroes of the same group of people.</br>
</br>
It was quite ironic.</br>
</br>
"Boss, you're a genius." Seemingly disingenuous and without sparks in her eyes, Monica put her hands in front of her and admired Jiang Chen. At the same time, she eyed Ayesha beside Jiang Chen. "If it wasn't for the Instructor, I might not have stopped myself from falling for you."</br>
</br>
Ayesha glanced at her in confusion with a look that seemed to say: Why? I obviously don't mind.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen, who was aware she was joking, laughed aloud.</br>
</br>
"Stop trying to flatter me—I won't give you a raise. There's a military base waiting for us. We'll leave in half an hour, so go and get ready."</br>
</br>
"Whatever. How do you know I was flattering you? What if I really meant it?"</br>
</br>
With a smile, Monica turned around and disappeared into the darkness.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't answer but turned his eyes to gaze outside the refugee camp, in the direction of Arrow's military base.</br>
</br>
With a curvature on his lips, he tightened his fists.</br>
</br>
Finally, this was the moment.</br>
</br>
It was time to end the war...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1063: Bombardment Across the Border</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Even on the northern tundra, the Finnish authorities wouldn't be oblivious to a riot on its own soil, but they remained silent about the matter. Arrow brought trouble, and it happened on their "private territory". Since no Finns died and Arrow didn't seek help, why would they bother?</br>
</br>
The local police in the town of Paltamo sent several mounted police officers around the camp. However, these police officers didn't dare to rush in and decided to withdraw. Judging from the equipment in the hands of the refugees, it was no longer a problem they could handle.</br>
</br>
The police chief of Paltamo immediately decided to mobilize local militia groups to increase security in the town and do their utmost to ensure the town's safety.</br>
</br>
It turned out his choice was correct. In less than half an hour, documents were issued and the local police were urged to do their utmost to protect the security of Paltamo. At the same time, a special force was sent to support this effort.</br>
</br>
As for the refugee camp, it was to be taken over by the Finnish Defence Force hundreds of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Nominally.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen learned of the news through the intelligence of the Russian Security Services. The Finnish official's silence did indeed surprise him. He originally thought that Finland would send out forces to maintain stability, but he didn't expect their reaction to be so dull.</br>
</br>
Carmen was likely at the military base and there must be something that couldn't be exposed. Or perhaps he thought that the two brigades at the base would be more than enough to take care of the mess.</br>
</br>
Regardless of Carmen's reaction, Jiang Chen's plan was proceeding according to plan.</br>
</br>
Most of these refugees came from the Middle East. Many people had participated in militia training or had been recruited into the reserves. They had received basic military training. While they certainly couldn't drive a tank, they could fire a mortar, and at least they wouldn't direct a shell at their people.</br>
</br>
With the second batch of equipment entering the Paltamo region from the Finnish border, Sami formed a 10,000-man-strong guerrilla force from the camp along with his rapidly accumulating prestige. With his cause as "only believers can end the oppressive rule of the pagans", he mobilized the entire camp to pick up arms against Arrow.</br>
</br>
Boxes of ammunition were carried onto old vans and trucks. The workers took the electric welders from the factories and welded heavy machine guns onto pickup trucks. Needless to say, this mob didn't have any combat power at all. Under the same circumstances, there was almost no chance of defeating the mercenaries who have received training, but Jiang Chen was confident regarding the outcomes of the battle.</br>
</br>
The reason was simple.</br>
</br>
While they couldn't shoot properly, they could bombard!</br>
</br>
It was two o'clock in the morning, six hours after the start of the riot. Only 2,000 people were left to defend. The armed Sami Army was on the path to take down Arrow, to "rescue" his people from their misguided path.</br>
</br>
</br>
The mighty army went to the tundra two kilometers outside of Arrow's military base and surrounded the area. Under the command of several veterans, the Sami Army with shovels and hoes dug out simple artillery pits.</br>
</br>
Hundreds of mortars and dozens of artilleries were placed. After the launch of a signal flare, hundreds of mortars ignited the tundra, and clusters of explosions covered the entire military base, completely dazing the mercenaries in their defensive positions.</br>
</br>
Of course, the mercenaries stationed at the military base weren't just going to bend over. While they were bombarded, all the mercenaries rushed into bunkers. At the same time, the howitzers on the military base began launching a counter-attack against the refugees based on the coordinates of the scouts' feedback...</br>
</br>
However, these mortars were scattered, and shells from all directions exhausted the mercenaries at the military base. Although they were better, they were simply outnumbered.</br>
</br>
A mortar shell landed on the roof of the command center and created a hole in the reinforced concrete. Dust from the ceiling covered the face of the brigade commander, Arnold. He held the table to gain his footing while cursing out the window.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! Where did these bugs get so many mortars?!"</br>
</br>
The sudden artillery caught everyone off guard. They thought these gangsters would use rifles and rush to their machine guns; they didn't expect them to bombard the military base.</br>
</br>
"There's no doubt that Celestial Trade provided them with the weapons." Holding the table and returning to the map, Sardes looked around at everyone in the room. "Look, we can't just defend. No one knows how many shells they have because the man who supplied them with weapons is a complete b*stard. Arnold, take your people to finish them. Tell them that modern warfare isn't only won by sheer numbers alone."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Arnold saluted, took off his intercom, and began to order his troops.</br>
</br>
After the order was issued, the military gate opened and dozens of Hummers rushed out. Four "Puma" armored vehicles followed, rushing toward the refugees. Under Jiang Chen's orders, Sami decisively ordered a 2,000-guerrilla squadron to block the path with anti-armor weapons.</br>
</br>
The front line was located on the edge of the pine forest, and there were plenty of pines that were wider than the length of two people's arms.</br>
</br>
After encountering the refugees, the Arrow Hummer and armored vehicles immediately slowed down and used the heavy machine guns on the roof to shoot at the refugees. The mercenaries in the vehicles also jumped out and fired at the refugees taking cover.</br>
</br>
However, they apparently underestimated the anti-armor ability of the refugees.</br>
</br>
Just as the mercenaries fired the machine guns, various high-explosive, armor-piercing RPG warheads flew wildly in the pine forests. Although their accuracy was awful, the sheer number alone made up for it. The reaction armor on the armored vehicles was completely scrapped and only one managed to retreat intact.</br>
</br>
Of course, the warheads still weren't enough to take down the mercenaries. While the unexpected RPGs caught Arrow off guard, the refugees weren't equally-matched opponents, even without the armored vehicles...</br>
</br>
After fewer than ten minutes of fire was exchanged between the two sides, Sami already had more than 200 casualties. For Arrow, there were no more than 50 casualties. Seeing that the tide began to turn, Sami began to panic and quickly called Jiang Chen, seeking help.</br>
</br>
"Our troops are collapsing; their accuracy is too good! It's the first time many of our people are using guns. We can't beat them..."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, it will be alright."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words confused Sami.</br>
</br>
It will be alright? Alright?</br>
</br>
Just as he was digesting those words, the ground trembled like an earthquake and there was a loud explosion from afar. A shockwave swept through the pine forest, swept through the tundra, and even swept through his bangs.</br>
</br>
Sami didn't respond to what was going on; he only saw thick smoke rising from the military base. His mouth was wide open.</br>
</br>
Standing on the hill on the other side of the battlefield, Jiang Chen watched the gorgeous fireworks. He couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
The Alpha Special Forces succeeded.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Under the suppression of mortars, the military base was in chaos. No one noticed a special force team sneaking in.</br>
</br>
Without expending extra effort, Kutpov placed a beacon on the target then withdrew from the base with the team. After they safely arrived at the evacuation point, they called for an airstrike.</br>
</br>
Soon, the Russian stealth bomber whizzed through the clouds, and the four bombs landed precisely on the two ammunition depots and two fuel depots at the base. The shock wave of the explosion was sent through the entire base and collapsed the concrete buildings around the points of impact.</br>
</br>
The exploded ammunition and burning fireballs were sent scattering across the camp and caused a series of chain explosions. Flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. The guards stationed at the base suffered severe casualties, and the rest were injured.</br>
</br>
Medical soldiers with stretchers rushed inside the base. They searched for the wounded and immobilized. The engineer soldiers with heavy explosion-proof suits rushed into the flames to pull out any unexploded ammunition from the ruins. All the soldiers who could still move began to mobilize while they searched for their missing team members.</br>
</br>
Sardes looked at the fire outside the window, and despair gradually appeared in his blank pupils.</br>
</br>
Smoke covered the entire base. Flame stained the entire night sky red. The scene resembled doomsday.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t..." Sardes muttered to himself. He moved his heavy legs and slowly left the window.</br>
</br>
When he turned around, his eyes met his advisor's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Sir, what should we do?"</br>
</br>
The explosion finally stopped. There were no more chain reactions at the base. However, nobody could be calmed. The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew it was just the beginning of their nightmare.</br>
</br>
The previous explosion seemed to ignite a signal and signaled an attack from the Sami Army. Under the orders of Jiang Chen, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity. He jumped in front of everyone and brought all the remaining refugees to the frontlines.</br>
</br>
More than six thousand people charged into the tundra, into the burning pines.</br>
</br>
It was a spectacular scene.</br>
</br>
At the same time, looking at the smoke rising from behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines were panicking. Their previously-boosted morale dropped to rock-bottom in an instant. Even if they could defend their position, they were unwilling to fight.</br>
</br>
Without any suspense, Arrow's defense line was penetrated, and the uncooperative mercenaries collapsed in front of the Sami Army. Some of them fled back to the burning base, but most of them deserted and fled deep into the woods.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't need to remind them since even a pig would know what to do next.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched as Sami began to launch an attack on the military base then he put away his binoculars. He took out an off-road motorcycle from the storage dimension and patted Ayesha's back gently.</br>
</br>
</br>
"It's time, let's go."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she also hopped on behind him.</br>
</br>
The engine roared and the belt shattered the snow.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rushed down the hillside and turned to the side of the military base. He then parked the motorcycle on the side, took out a laser sword from the storage dimension, and stroked it in his hand. The barbed fence was shredded easily.</br>
</br>
The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and there were still explosions from mortars from time to time. All the mercenaries fought on the front line and fought with the refugees for control of the entrance. Except for a company guarding the command center, no one was in the rear.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen and Ayesha, it was no different than having no defense.</br>
</br>
A total of ten guards—two guards standing in the sentry tower, and the remaining eight were stationed at the entrance of the first and second floors. Ayesha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and quietly took down the two guards standing in the tower then used blind spots in their field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.</br>
</br>
When Ayesha took care of the guards, Jiang Chen took out a rifle and moved to the command center. Just as he passed the Hummer at the entrance, he just happened to bump into Sardes and his advisor fleeing.</br>
</br>
When their eyes met, both sides stopped.</br>
</br>
The advisor first responded and immediately pulled out his gun, but he didn't reach them in time before Ayesha pinned him down. Sardes was trying to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and his hands were pinned against the Hummer.</br>
</br>
"Sardes, male, 43. The general manager of Arrow and the highest commander. Am I right?"</br>
</br>
Although it was the first time they were meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet, which was connected to the Ghost Agent's database, stored photos and personal information related to Sardes. His information was projected onto the holographic screen.</br>
</br>
Sardes' face was pressed against the hood of the vehicle. He was certainly tough as he was reluctant to surrender. He gnashed his teeth.</br>
</br>
"I won't say anything. Just kill me..."</br>
</br>
"Kill you? I didn't ask anything yet."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned and smiled. He didn't care about Sardes' uncooperative attitude. Jiang Chen freed his right hand, pulled out a needle and injected it into Sardes' back.</br>
</br>
"AHHHH!"</br>
</br>
Sardes growled in resistance. His eyes began to look bloodshot, and soon, the light in his pupils faded. Jiang Chen simply let his hands go. No ordinary person could resist the truth-telling serum.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned Sardes around and asked one word at a time.</br>
</br>
"Where is Carmen?"</br>
</br>
"Underground research institute in the underground bunker..."</br>
</br>
"Where is the underground bunker?"</br>
</br>
"The entrance is in the middle of the base and can only be accessed through the elevator. There are two aprons next to the entrance."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen soon got the information he wanted.</br>
</br>
"Good, now your wish has been granted."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out a pistol and ended him then tossed his body aside.</br>
</br>
It was a quick way to die, but for the well-known Arrow general manager Mr. Sardes, death in this obscure form might be more painful than death itself... if the dead felt pain.</br>
</br>
"The underground bunker?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the center of the base, Jiang Chen sneered.</br>
</br>
No matter what Carmen was plotting, his good fortune should be over. The fate of the Rothschild family would end as it began, fame because of a war, obscurity because of a war...</br>
</br>
However, at that moment, there were fierce screams from the distance.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1065"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1065: Iblis</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The screams pierced the entire battlefield and even overshadowed the sound of bullets.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the intense exchange between the mercenaries and the refugees, a black shadow suddenly interrupted the battle.</br>
</br>
With the help of a flare, everyone saw the appearance of the monster.</br>
</br>
Bow-shaped legs, arms that looked like two lacquered black machetes, grain-sized fangs in its rectangular-shaped mouth, and two pairs of short wings on its back, just like a humanoid mantis.</br>
</br>
The exchange of fire briefly stopped for two seconds.</br>
</br>
Everyone was stunned by this scene.</br>
</br>
However, just when the exchange of fire stopped, the "mantis" moved.</br>
</br>
The bowed-shaped legs began to move, and the seven-foot-high figure took off like an explosion. The refugee who was closest to him didn't have any time to react before his head was cut off by the blades. Blood spurted out from his arteries as he collapsed.</br>
</br>
Pushing his prey to the ground, the monster's mouth severed his neck and penetrated the flesh. With a crunching sound, the monster drank the bone marrow and flesh of his prey.</br>
</br>
The ruthlessness was as cruel as a beast.</br>
</br>
Even the fanatical believers couldn't stop the nausea in their stomachs. Their legs began to tremble as they uncontrollably moved back.</br>
</br>
"Iblis..."</br>
</br>
It was the name of the devil, like Satan from the Bible.</br>
</br>
"Iblis!"</br>
</br>
Someone shouted the name out and there were screams, screeches, and shrieks.</br>
</br>
The refugees aimed with their G36 rifles and pulled their triggers at the monster. However, the mantis used its two blades and allowed the bullets to hit its armor. It did not worry about the 5.56mm bullets at all.</br>
</br>
The worst thing was that there wasn't just one of this monster!</br>
</br>
Dozens of black shadows jumped out from the entrance of the underground bunker, waving their double blades at the refugees. Once monsters were close to the refugees, the refugees' only fate was being slaughtered.</br>
</br>
Other than the mantises, there was also a worm-like creature that sprayed highly corrosive saliva. Even steel and cement couldn't withstand its high corrosiveness, not to mention human flesh.</br>
</br>
Against the fabled devil, the believers finally began to fear.</br>
</br>
The mob finally began to collapse.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the mercenaries were cheering.</br>
</br>
It was their allies!</br>
</br>
Although they looked disgusting.</br>
</br>
However, their cheers didn't last long, and soon, a similar nightmare engulfed them.</br>
</br>
Dense spores floated out of the underground bunker and slowly spread throughout the entire base, barely noticeable under the disguise of the night. People who came into contact with these spores began to have difficulty breathing, then the searing pain began to spread from their chests. They screamed and scratched their skin, letting their blood gush out.</br>
</br>
Soon, they lost all senses and became just like the walking dead.</br>
</br>
</br>
Except for those wrapped in exoskeletons, those who were on the battlefield, regardless of their side, were swallowed by the spores.</br>
</br>
In order to survive, the mercenaries and refugees turned their guns and began to fight a common enemy.</br>
</br>
However, from the beginning, they didn't have a chance of winning.</br>
</br>
"What the fu*k, what is this thing?!"</br>
</br>
A monster that resembled a Death Claws leaped at him. Jiang Chen kicked its chest while sweating profusely. He emptied his clip from the rifle, then took out a laser sword to chop down one arm of the monster.</br>
</br>
Green blood spurted out and the blood turned into mist by the burning laser sword.</br>
</br>
While the monster was screaming and moving back, Jiang Chen didn't chase it. His right hand, which was holding the sword, shook and a beautiful arc formed in the air. The rotating laser blade separated from the hilt and cut off half of the monster's face.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, he was still familiar with this move; otherwise, he would've really been caught off guard.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Ayesha set up a Ghost Sniper Rifle and calmly exploded the skulls of two mutants.</br>
</br>
"There are too many of them. We can't stay here anymore." Jiang Chen picked up the PK2000 on the ground and replaced a magazine. "Prepare to retreat."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded but didn't move.</br>
</br>
"I will secure our backs."</br>
</br>
"You first, hurry!" Jiang Chen pushed her shoulder then fired at a few zombies rushing toward them.</br>
</br>
That's right, they were zombies.</br>
</br>
But they looked different from the zombies in City K. These zombies didn't seem to be infected with viruses but were similar to zombies from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
[Warning: Unidentified pathogens are detected in the air. The filter unit is automatically activated. Please...]</br>
</br>
When he saw the two lines of words projected on his helmet screen, he suddenly understood what these things were.</br>
</br>
They were too similar.</br>
</br>
The things he had encountered in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
Without time to process what just happened, Jiang Chen didn't hesitate. He used his highest command authority in Celestial Trade, bypassing all decision-making layers, and directly connected to Stingray C-1 deployed in the synchronous orbit. He targeted the underground bunker in the center of the base and called for an airstrike.</br>
</br>
As for diplomatic issues, these would only matter after he dealt with the enemy of humanity!</br>
</br>
"This is Stingray C-1. The airstrike target has been confirmed. The tungsten rods have separated and are leaving the synchronous orbit. The airstrike is expected to arrive in ten minutes. Combatants, please evacuate from the target area..." Jiang Chen turned off the communication, emptied his rifle, and rushed toward the edge of the base.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who had already run outside the base, set up a sniper rifle and began to cover Jiang Chen's retreat. For some reason, these monsters seemed to be consciously chasing them as if they were controlled by some kind of consciousness.</br>
</br>
Before being surrounded by the army of zombies and mutants, Jiang Chen successfully dove out of the barbed wires. At the same time, he tossed a nuclear grenade behind him, then ran without turning back with Ayesha.</br>
</br>
The explosion blew up a group of mutants. After he confirmed that the zombies and mutants were not chasing them, Jiang Chen took out the off-road motorcycle from the storage dimension and whizzed to the nearby mountains.</br>
</br>
They headed not in the direction of the refugee camp, but the direction of the border.</br>
</br>
The motorcycle rushed onto the hill and he stopped. After he confirmed the time, he looked back at the military base. With the light from the sporadic fire, he barely recognized that there were no living humans in the entire military base.</br>
</br>
Just then, white light, like stars flickering, appeared in the night sky.</br>
</br>
With long and narrow tails, dozens of tungsten rods slammed into the center of the military base, and the dust from the explosions were elevated high into the air.</br>
</br>
"They should've died, right?" Jiang Chen muttered and took out binoculars from his pocket.</br>
</br>
When the dust dissipated, only a deep pit with a diameter several dozen meters wide was left in the center of the base, just like an abyss leading to hell.</br>
</br>
The mutants were crawling out of the deep pit...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Dawn was about to break. It was already six in the morning.</br>
</br>
The orange-red civilian helicopter hovered in the sky with the letters "YLE" printed on the side. When the black smoke rose after the ammunition depot exploded, Finnish Radio and Television sent their helicopter to the scene.</br>
</br>
They thought it was a forest fire, but when they arrived, they discovered it wasn't a forest fire at all. The fire was caused by Arrow's military base, which was widely criticized in Finland. A war seemed to have erupted there, even leaving a giant pit in the middle of the base.</br>
</br>
"This is Finnish Radio and Television. We are now here to broadcast the forest fire in the suburbs of Paltak... although it turns out that this was not a fire but a human-induced explosion? We are seeing a huge pit in the middle... wait, what is that?"</br>
</br>
The lens swayed violently, and the cameraman adjusted the focal length and zoomed in on the base.</br>
</br>
Inside the burning base, zombies were freely roaming and strange creatures were crawling out of the deep.</br>
</br>
"...we seem to have discovered something peculiar. It seems that reports of Arrow's experiments at its military base were true. What are these? Aliens? Zombies? Dear God..."</br>
</br>
Just as the helicopter was delivering first-hand information to the people of Finland and the world, Jiang Chen, standing on the mountain, was also worried about the situation at the base.</br>
</br>
Obviously, when building this underground bunker, Carmen made heavy investments. The tungsten bombs from heaven didn't destroy the underground bunker—it just collapsed the elevator.</br>
</br>
Spores continued to eject from the underground laboratories and began to spread outside of the base. Jiang Chen noticed that the terrifying bacteria not only caused mutations in the animals that accidentally entered its range but also the plants rooted there.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Ayesha turned her head. Her beautiful hazel hair drifted in the wind.</br>
</br>
"I think... we created a huge problem," Jiang Chen said with a bitter smile and put down the binoculars.</br>
</br>
At that moment, he suddenly felt alert. He and Ayesha almost turned at the same time and aimed at the intersection.</br>
</br>
"Come out; I'll count to three." Jiang Chen's finger opened the safety as he spoke emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
With his hands over his head, a hairy man in a polar camouflage uniform stood up and spoke in rather non-standard Chinese.</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous; I'm your ally."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put away the pistol and let out a sigh of relief upon seeing the scarred and wrinkled face. He signaled Ayesha to put down her weapon and grinned at him.</br>
</br>
"I almost shot."</br>
</br>
"I'm thankful you didn't." Kutpov lowered his raised hands and walked over to Jiang Chen. He lifted his chin in the direction of the military base under the mountain. "What's the situation there?"</br>
</br>
"Special circumstances; I can't explain it in a few words. Let's talk after we get back." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Well, do you want to go back together?" Kutpov pointed to the mountain. "If you don't plan to return to the refugee camp, you can go to the evacuation point with us. There are helicopters waiting for us."</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen couldn't return to the refugee camp. Not only did he direct an uprising in the territory of another country, but he also created a hole on their map. The Finnish government definitely wouldn't sit still now.</br>
</br>
Almost without hesitation, Jiang Chen and Ayesha hopped onto the helicopters of the Alpha Special Forces and returned to Russia with them.</br>
</br>
As if to confirm Jiang Chen's suspicions, right as he crossed the border, the Finnish Defence Forces was already mobilized to Paltamo.</br>
</br>
When their national security faced a serious challenge, the Finnish authorities did not take any humanitarian crises into account anymore. Tanks and armored vehicles entered the refugee camp, and the heavily armed soldiers took control of the ammunition factories and the warehouse at lightning speed. They confiscated all the weapons from the refugees.</br>
</br>
During the disarming process, the Finnish Defence Force didn't encounter any resistance.</br>
</br>
In other words, Sami didn't hesitate to take the lead and drop his weapon. He obediently walked into the vehicle and squatted in the corner. He recited the name of Iblis and sought forgiveness from Halah.</br>
</br>
And those who were lucky enough to survive had the same expression as him. When they were asked what happened last night, the most frequently mumbled words were: "Iblis," "Devil," "Monster," "Slaughter"...</br>
</br>
What surprised the commander was that the refugees who surrendered seemed to be terrified. They did everything they could to get into the prison and more than 1,000 people stated that they participated in the execution of the prisoners.</br>
</br>
However, in fact, only ten mercenaries were executed that night...</br>
</br>
"Iblis? What kind of thing is that?" Duvio threw the briefing on the table. He frowned while he examined the map. "What's the situation at the military base?"</br>
</br>
"Our helicopter has gone to investigate, but nothing can be seen. The entire military base is surrounded by a yellowish cloud that formed into a giant bubble. Because our pilots were afraid of the toxicity, they didn't get too close," Duvio's deputy replied.</br>
</br>
"Let the scouts go take a look. Remember to wear protective clothing."</br>
</br>
Duvio had just finished speaking when an officer entered the tent containing their temporary headquarters. After he saluted, he handed a letter to Duvio.</br>
</br>
"Sir, an order from the Ministry of Defense."</br>
</br>
With an eyebrow raised, Duvio opened the sealed letter.</br>
</br>
His brows gradually furrowed. After reading the letter, he massaged his sore temples and threw the letter aside.</br>
</br>
"The mission is canceled. Don't send the scouts."</br>
</br>
The deputy looked at the commander strangely and didn't understand what made him change his mind. Out of responsibility, he still reminded his chief: "If we don't confirm the situation at the base, we can't make a plan to initiate the rescue."</br>
</br>
"We don't need to make a plan to rescue. Thanks to those officials. the reporters were one step ahead of us. They already confirmed that there are no living people there." Duvio shook his head and put his fingers on the envelope. "This is an order from the Ministry of Defense. We must not be within one kilometer of the military base. Now, our only task is to remain stationed here, cooperate with the police to evacuate the town of Paltamo and the refugees to the two refugee camps on the Norwegian border."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Duvio looked out of the tent and cursed under his breath.</br>
</br>
"Let those officials negotiate with Russia if they think they can solve all problems with negotiations."</br>
</br>
While he complained, a plane had taken off from the international airport in Helsinki, Finland with the Finnish Ministry of Defence and Vice President to Murmansk, Russia, the largest city bordering the Arctic Ocean.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Russian Minister of Defense and the Director of the Security Services also rushed to the city. They were prepared to seek a solution with Finland...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1067: Only Celestial Trade Can Save You</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The trouble with Harmony civilization was that their understanding of biology was beyond the imagination of human civilization at its infancy. When countries around the world were still busy exporting ideologies, they had begun to spread something more dangerous - their evil genes.</br>
</br>
Their DNA code to biological creatures was just like a computer virus to a computer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't concerned about Carmen.</br>
</br>
Even if he was still alive, most of his life would've already been gone. Harmony would've at most provided him with nothing more than a few square kilometers. Just like the reserves the United States once promised to the Indigenous people. Dozens of indigenous people survived to serve as a "sample" of human civilization.</br>
</br>
The only thing Jiang Chen was grateful for was that the Freemasonry had begun its decline. If Carmen connected with Harmony in the heyday of its strength, half of Europe would've already become a breeding ground for mutants.</br>
</br>
But then again, if it wasn't for Future Group's constantly stranglehold on the Freemasonry, if it wasn't for the Golden Apple that turned useless, how would Carmen have gone down this path? Jiang Chen didn't believe he couldn't see the danger of Harmony. This civilization had aggressiveness written in its genes.</br>
</br>
Murmansk, Russia's largest strategic town near the Arctic Ocean, was less than 90 kilometers from the Russian-Finnish border. Aware of the seriousness of the problem, the Finnish Defence Minister immediately went to Russia with the Vice President while sending its national force to secure the site of the incident.</br>
</br>
The Finnish president was originally planning to go there in person, but the diplomatic process was too long, and he had to stabilize the country.</br>
</br>
Because the incident was very close to the Russian border, the evacuation of Murmansk might even be required if the situation deteriorated further. Russia also attached great importance to the accident. The Minister of National Defense, Sergei, and the Director of the Security Services, Barth, were in the town to meet with high-level officials from Finland.</br>
</br>
Other than high-level officials of the two countries, there was also a foreigner with a special identity who participated in the meeting...or the combat conference.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen briefly outlined the relevant contents of the secret experiment conducted by the Rothschild family collected by Celestial Trade, and he repeatedly stressed that this unauthorized military operation in northern Finland was for the safety of Finland and the world.</br>
</br>
This rhetoric easily won the applause of Russian officials. After all, it was already communicated between Jiang Chen and Barth before the meeting. However, officials in Finland weren't stupid, and the Finnish Vice President and the Defense Minister scoffed in return.</br>
</br>
Since he didn't achieve the expected results, Jiang Chen began to discuss the primary focus of the meeting.</br>
</br>
</br>
The danger of the X2 bacteria.</br>
</br>
"In the center of the military base, the source of infection is called the 'nest.' As the name implies, it can produce a special kind of bacteria with spore characteristics."</br>
</br>
"Our scientists named it the X2 bacteria. This bacteria is very aggressive in nature and can easily infect organisms without antibodies and turn them into a medium for their breeding. Infected organisms will behave more aggressively and their DNA will be modified specifically to the traits of the organism. For example, like Spiderman or the Hulk."</br>
</br>
"So you're saying it won't take long for the citizens of Finland to all become Spiderman?" the Finnish Vice President sneered.</br>
</br>
"Uhhh... We don't have to worry about that for the time being," Jiang Chen said, drawing a circle on the satellite map and using a marker to point at the circled forest. "Do you see those withered pines? Those mutated creatures—let's call them mutants—cannot leave the spores. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibilities that they're out hunting or that the spores are continuing to spread."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mention one thing. He was most worried about the possibility of the X2 virus mutating and turning into a X3 virus.</br>
</br>
After all, the best thing about creatures was evolution. The X2 bacteria lost because of his incendiary weapons. Now four years had passed, and Harmony, which already suffered losses, might have evolved into a more advanced state.</br>
</br>
"Only Celestial Trade can save you. You should leave this to the professionals," Russian Security Services Director, Barth, emphasized.</br>
</br>
"It's because of you that the situation ended up like this!" Finnish Defense Minister was agitated. He yelled while he knocked furiously on the table. "Now you're telling me only you can deal with this. What makes you think I can believe you?"</br>
</br>
The head of the Russian Security Services forced a smile and looked away awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also touched his nose awkwardly and coughed. "Let me correct you—it was definitely not me but Carmen who turned the situation into what we're seeing today. If you didn't let Arrow enter and rent out the tundra in the north to build a refugee camp, would today's situation have happened? You didn't even know that they were doing research on your land. Do you not have any responsibility?"</br>
</br>
"If we let you deal with this, what are you going to do?" The Finnish Vice President stared at Jiang Chen in the eyes as he asked seriously.</br>
</br>
"Send an Orbital Airborne Brigade," Jiang Chen said without hesitation.</br>
</br>
"Aren't your only two Orbital Airborne Brigades in Ukraine?" the Finnish Defense Minister questioned.</br>
</br>
"In fact, we still have a secret force and started training a long time ago." Jiang Chen coughed. "I didn't intend to reveal the force so early. But now that the situation is urgent, the circumstances are no longer important."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen said this, it seemed like he had made many concessions.</br>
</br>
The Finnish Vice President exchanged looks with the Defense Minister then looked at Jiang Chen and the Russian officials. He looked at the Russian Defense Minister Sergei.</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry but your integrity is doubtful. We think that NATO can deal with the current problem better. At least they will let us know when a bomber flies into our airspace. You violated the rules of the game first, so don't blame us for making this difficult choice."</br>
</br>
The issue of Finland's accession to NATO started since the beginning of the Cold War, but it remained undecided. The parliamentary election practically finalized the agenda for joining NATO, but the biggest resistance came from a final referendum, and Finnish citizens weren't willing to give up the status of their neutral country.</br>
</br>
However, if NATO solved Finland's crisis, resistance during their most difficult referendum would also disappear.</br>
</br>
Once Finland joined NATO, it would mean that on Russia's border, there would be a thousand additional kilometers of armed soldiers. Behind the line were strategically important cities like Petersburg and Murmansk. This worried Russia the most.</br>
</br>
"Russia cannot accept NATO troops entering Finland; you have better choices." Sergei immediately stood up and nervously said, "If you insist on the wrong decision, the situation will only be worse."</br>
</br>
"Is this a threat?" the Finnish Vice President sneered.</br>
</br>
"This is a suggestion," Barth said in a gentle tone.</br>
</br>
"The Finnish people are facing a threat, and how could things get worse than they are now? I thank you for your advice on behalf of the President. In fact, two hours ago, our President met with the NATO Secretary General in Helsinki. Goodbye!"</br>
</br>
The officials on the Finnish side stood up. Sergei wanted to continue talking, but in the end, he froze there.</br>
</br>
"Remember to use incendiary weapons to deal with those bugs—weapons bombs might be more effective than bullets and pesticides." Jiang Chen didn't care much about issues concerning Russia and NATO, but he kindly reminded: "And if you must ask NATO to help you resolve this problem. Remember to tell them not to use 5.56mm ammunition. Their armor is naturally resistant to small-caliber ammunition. Don't give the bugs more meat."</br>
</br>
"And, if you can't deal with it, remember to call me."</br>
</br>
The Finnish Vice President waved his hand to dismiss him, then he left with Defense Minister along with other senior officials.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The meeting room was quiet.</br>
</br>
They had only gone through half of the scheduled agenda, but the Finnish officials had already left early. Sergei, who stood up, didn't know if he should sit or not. He eyed the assistant behind him and the latter immediately walked up to help him clean up the things on the table.</br>
</br>
When the documents were sorted and chairs began to move, the Russian officials also began to pack up.</br>
</br>
Even half of the expectations weren't reached, yet the meeting was over.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who stood in front of the satellite map, put down the marker and walked toward the door. When he came, he only brought himself, so there was nothing to pack up. When he left, he called Ayesha and asked her to help arrange a dinner at the front desk.</br>
</br>
He just wanted to have a hot dinner now. The last time he properly ate something was already twenty-four hours ago.</br>
</br>
Last night, he was on the helicopter. After he arrived in Murmansk, the first thing he did was call Hilton to book a room. After he returned to the hotel, he didn't even take off his clothes before he slept until the afternoon. Then Russian Security Director Barth called him to remind him about the meeting.</br>
</br>
It was already 7 o'clock in the evening. Before the meeting, he only drank a fruit-flavored nutrient supply, and his stomach had begun to protest.</br>
</br>
Just as he left the government building, Barth waved at him. Barth walked to him hastily, patted him on the shoulder, and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to have a meal together? There's a very good restaurant nearby—I'll treat you."</br>
</br>
"I've already booked dinner at the Hilton Hotel, so let me treat you." Jiang Chen gave Ayesha a call and asked her to speak to the front desk to change the location to the private room at the restaurant and add another serving.</br>
</br>
"Well, then." Since Jiang Chen was already making arrangements, Barth didn't reject the offer. He took out a car key from his pocket. "My car?"</br>
</br>
"Please." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Unlike Defense Minister Sergei, Barth didn't have a driver and traveled by himself, perhaps because of a need for work. Jiang Chen didn't know the brand of his car; it must've been a local brand.</br>
</br>
Right after the car started, Barth's expression was bitter.</br>
</br>
"Man, you've caused us a big problem."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced at him, dissatisfied.</br>
</br>
"Why are you like the Finns, tossing everything onto my shoulders when something goes wrong? If your Alpha Special Forces killed Carmen, then there wouldn't be all this trouble! I heard there were 500 meters between them, and you could've shot him. But instead, you thought about blowing up the ammunition depot?"</br>
</br>
Barth frowned.</br>
</br>
"What can one person do?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sneered, leaned against the seat and closed his eyes. "You can give him a chance to evolve in the next ten years. Maybe he can turn Russia into that dead zone."</br>
</br>
"What now?" Bart asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Wait."</br>
</br>
"Wait?"</br>
</br>
"Once NATO encounters the same problem, they will naturally think of us." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Do you think NATO can't solve this problem? It's just a few bugs." Bart argued.</br>
</br>
In his view, NATO didn't need to deal with this, as even the Russian border guards could easily crush the little bugs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed after he heard such a naive point of view.</br>
</br>
"Just a few bugs?"</br>
</br>
Holding the steering wheel, Barth was silent for a while.</br>
</br>
Right as Jiang Chen was about to fall asleep, he said, "Allow me to be honest—why are you so sure? Don't misinterpret me; I don't mean anything else... I'm just curious as you seem to understand this situation? It was the case when the T-virus happened, and now it's the same case for the X2 bacteria."</br>
</br>
His intuition behind years of intelligence work told Barth that these seemingly irrelevant events were connected.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's left eye opened slightly and examined Barth in surprise.</br>
</br>
Just as he was just about to make an excuse, he suddenly thought of the Golden Apple that flowed from the factory controlled by Rothschild. It was also those Golden Apples that made him change his mind.</br>
</br>
Perhaps now was the time?</br>
</br>
After thinking for a moment, Jiang Chen suddenly smiled and said," "Yes, I do have knowledge. I also know how Carmen got these things. Want to know how?"</br>
</br>
"If it's convenient." Although the expression on his face was nonchalant, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that Barth's tone was very concerned.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk when we eat."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't answer and closed his eyes again to meditate.</br>
</br>
It was still a half-hour drive from the Hilton Hotel. Before he disclosed the secret, he had to think about how he should structure the conversation.</br>
</br>
Frankberg was in the middle of a revolution. It was definitely impossible to send troops to support their allies. The aircraft carrier was too far apart, and it didn't seem realistic to move a fleet from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea, and it would stimulate the fragile nerves of the Russians.</br>
</br>
It was the United Kingdom, who had already left the EU, who stepped up to help.</br>
</br>
However, the British apparently underestimated the danger of the "nest". The country only sent a mechanized brigade that deployed in northern Finland through heavy transport aircrafts.</br>
</br>
They might've kept Jiang Chen's suggestion in mind. The Finnish government sent engineers to chop trees along the "infected area" and dug out a 50-meter-wide zone. Immediately after, the British Army fired 20 white phosphorus munitions at the "nest." They were planning to physically sterilize the area before entering the infected area.</br>
</br>
However, the results were unexpected. The white phosphorus munition did burst into a splendid spark, but soon after, the flames seemed to be "frozen" and were extinguished in midair. The spores that had been burnt dropped to the ground, but the empty holes were soon filled by more spores from under the ground.</br>
</br>
Realizing that something was wrong, they extracted a part of the spore from the infected area and found that a single cell would quickly consume itself in a high-temperature environment, secreting a special high-temperature resistant liquid. The fire would be wrapped by the liquid and extinguished.</br>
</br>
A cell with a fire extinguisher!</br>
</br>
This incredible discovery shocked the biologists into disbelief. They were invited to test the spores in infected areas. Even with their decades of experience, they didn't understand what happened.</br>
</br>
It didn't surprise Jiang Chen at all.</br>
</br>
Bugs were going to evolve.</br>
</br>
If they were capable of interstellar navigation, how hard would putting out a fire be?</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1069"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1069: Leave it to the Professional</br>
</div></br>
</br>
White phosphorus munitions, petrol bombs—all options were tried to no avail. Even the flamethrower was useless.</br>
</br>
In addition to incendiary munitions, the British tried other things. For example, pesticides, strong acids, strong bases, or even chemical weapons. These weapons definitely wouldn't be considered humane normally speaking, but against insects, it was another story. Regrettably, those bugs weren't afraid of chemical weapons, and nothing changed with the spores.</br>
</br>
Also, the British considered launching larger incendiary munitions, which could, in theory, burn all the air in the infected area, but the Finnish government wasn't happy. If the incendiary munitions got any bigger, the 50-meter isolation belt certainly wouldn't be effective. If there was a forest fire, then the loss would be severe!</br>
</br>
They were in the Arctic Circle, and the ancient pine forest was in the tundra! Every tree was a living fossil! In order to release incendiary bombs, trees that were cut already agonized the Finns. What's more, the British couldn't guarantee that the bigger bombs wouldn't be "frozen" by the strange spores.</br>
</br>
Those evil things could even wrap up the atomized gasoline!</br>
</br>
It was fine if they didn't use it. It was a great chance to flex their muscles to their future younger brother, a chance to demonstrate the power of the big NATO family. The British Ministry of Defence made a decision, and the dispatched commander didn't take it seriously either. Two mechanized companies, a total of 40 "Ajax" armored vehicles, and more than 300 infantries wearing chemical protective suits followed.</br>
</br>
The combat plan was very simple: eliminate all the mutants in the infected area within ten minutes, suppress the entrance within 20 minutes, and send special forces into the underground bunker to remove the source of infection. The soldiers wearing chemical protective suits didn't realize the danger of the task. Instead, they joked in front of the media reporters during their interviews, saying that if the nest appeared in London, the firefighters alone could take care of the issue.</br>
</br>
The emergence of the nest attracted worldwide attention, and this interview was also broadcast live worldwide.</br>
</br>
Inside the same conference room, the satellite map on the big screen was replaced by a live broadcast of a Russian TV reporter interviewing British soldiers in the Paltamo region.</br>
</br>
Originally, Jiang Chen didn't want to watch the news with the Russians because he could already guess what the final result would be. However, the National Defense Minister Sergei personally invited him and it was difficult to reject his invitation, so he came.</br>
</br>
To be honest, a group of senior officials quietly watching news felt weird.</br>
</br>
"Are you sure they can't handle it?" Sergei looked at Jiang Chen and asked somewhat incredulously, "I don't mean to gloat, but it's very important for Russia's national defense strategy. If the British succeed, we will have a thousand more kilometers to defend."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Let's wait."</br>
</br>
Leaning in his chair, Jiang Chen glanced at the confident British soldier on the screen and grinned.</br>
</br>
London firefighters?</br>
</br>
Even if you sent Chinese city enforcement forces, Japanese high school students, and American hobos, they wouldn't do a damn thing! (1)</br>
</br>
With the departure of the army, the image on the TV moved. The reporter gave a close-up of the forty armored vehicles and quickly switched to coverage in the air. The helicopter followed the mechanized forces and watched them rushing into the infected area covered by the turbid spores.</br>
</br>
Because of his confidence behind this "de-bugging" plan, the British commander, under the guidance of the Ministry of National Defense, made an exception to open some insensitive combat communications to reporters to demonstrate the combat effectiveness of NATO. As for the combat video, it wasn't made public due to the sensitive information.</br>
</br>
"This is the 12th Company. We've reached the target area, and no abnormalities have been found."</br>
</br>
"Mutants spotted. Open safeties and fire freely."</br>
</br>
The intensive gunshots and the roars of mutants lasted for two minutes.</br>
</br>
The senior Russian officials sitting in front of the screen, especially the Russian National Defense Minister, gradually had expressions that looked more and more excited. They were all senior members of the military. Just by listening to the sounds, they knew that the situation wasn't pleasant.</br>
</br>
"...we're fighting the mutants! They have too many people, but our firepower is superior—"</br>
</br>
"SH*T! They're too fast! Fu*k! Infantry! RETREAT! I repeat, Infantry! RETREAT! Charis! Are you crazy, take your people and move back… buzz—"</br>
</br>
The communication was cut off. It was clear that the British commander realized that the contents were no longer suitable for broadcast to the media.</br>
</br>
Only the flashing sparks in the turbid fog could depict the tragedy on screen.</br>
</br>
The meeting room was silent, and the Russian military all stared at each other.</br>
</br>
No one expected this result. No one thought that a mechanized unit would lose to mutants... except for one person.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Since they neglected their anti-armor abilities because they were fighting bugs, he wasn't surprised that the British lost. The only thing he was curious about now was how many armored vehicles could retreat intact.</br>
</br>
As for the infantry, they were probably chewed down to the bone.</br>
</br>
"There was a little accident in the nest while clearing it up. The following is a story from..." On the screen, the reporter's expression was slightly awkward.</br>
</br>
At this point, the aerial coverage of the military base was gone.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen's watch shook.</br>
</br>
"Let me take a call," Jiang Chen quietly whispered to Sergei sitting next to him, got up and walked out of the meeting room.</br>
</br>
The call was from the Presidential Palace of Finland.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to guess the reason.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went to the window, opened the holographic screen, and pressed the button.</br>
</br>
The call was connected, and the other side didn't speak right away.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for two seconds, the atmosphere was a little subtle, and the other side finally began the conversation.</br>
</br>
"...Ummm, the British aren't doing it anymore."</br>
</br>
Just as he expected, a regular army wasn't a mercenary force, and every life in peacetime was very expensive. Two companies were lost in the infected area without even touching the underground bunker, and Great Britain was rattled now.</br>
</br>
"Oh."</br>
</br>
"The Americans said they need to observe for a while longer, but the area covered by spores is spreading. Now, the 50-meter-wide isolation zone has been covered."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the words of the President of Finland, it didn't come as a shock.</br>
</br>
The killed British soldiers were equivalent to providing the nest with easy-to-absorb organic matter. Animal bodies, including humans, were easier to breed spores compared to wood and insects. Only two companies were swallowed, yet the nest had already begun to diffuse more spores.</br>
</br>
From this point of view, the nest was similar to Carmen.</br>
</br>
With his speculations validated, Jiang Chen's confidence in resolving this problem increased. But then, he didn't rush to offer a solution. Obviously, the other side was asking for help. If he was too eager, that would be nice to them!</br>
</br>
At the start, I was going to resolve this issue for you for free, but you were unhappy. Now you're begging me?</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Adjusting his tone, Jiang Chen said nonchalantly, "Just be straightforward."</br>
</br>
"How about... you take care of it?" the Finnish President asked mildly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pretended to hesitate for a moment, then he slowly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Now the infected area has increased. Even the United Kingdom's mechanized brigade can't deal with it. I'm afraid it will be difficult. Do you want to try carpet bombing? Although the spores can stop flames, there's no way the spores can stop high-explosive bombs?"</br>
</br>
"We tried it earlier and it didn't work. The spores secreted at a much higher speed than the spores that were removed, and the bombs even blew the spores farther." The Finnish president smiled bitterly. "How about this, let's be straightforward. You're a businessman, so give me a price."</br>
</br>
With a smile, Jiang Chen pleasantly said, "300 million New Xin dollars."</br>
</br>
Hearing this number, the Finnish president's eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
"...can it be cheaper?"</br>
</br>
The exchange rate of Xin New dollars wasn't low. The euro had recently depreciated, and it was impossible unless he used the Finnish National Defense Force's annual procurement budget.</br>
</br>
"If you can't afford to pay, we can also consider another payment method. For example, Arrow's assets in Finland are packaged and sold to us. Of course, we can only offer 300 million Xin New dollars for their assets after what happened. Believe me—this is already a fair price, and it is definitely much higher than the valuation from the bank." Jiang Chen wickedly laughed in his mind.</br>
</br>
Although Arrow was his old rival, the mercenaries didn't have a grudge against him.</br>
</br>
After the incident, Arrow was bound to go bankrupt because of the high penalty issued by the Finnish government. If Arrow, which was registered in Finland, was acquired, more than 20,000 experienced veterans would become great assets to Celestial Trade. As long as they were trained and offered more benefits, these people would soon swear their allegiance to their new boss.</br>
</br>
The management could be completely disbanded. The grassroots soldiers would be reorganized after screening. The weapons and equipment could be packaged and sold to Africa. As for the remaining two refugee camps, they could be kept there for the time being. With appropriate methods, they could be used as bargaining chips to discuss conditions with the EU.</br>
</br>
As for the two military bases associated with the refugee camps, he also had great uses for them.</br>
</br>
The Finnish president reluctantly nodded.</br>
</br>
"Deal."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and nodded.</br>
</br>
"Great."</br>
</br>
"When will your people arrive? We might not be able to wait for long..."</br>
</br>
"It won't take so long," Jiang Chen looked at the time on the holographic screen. "Give me five hours. By the way, notify the British army for me. Tell them they can pack things up and go home. Let the professional deal with this."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The fracture dozens of meters in length located in the center of the military base was like a giant crater that appeared out of nowhere. Under the crater, 500 meters down, was the underground bunker designed by the Rothschild Group.</br>
</br>
There wasn't a sign of life in the underground bunker. It was completely covered by a suspicious blood-red flesh bubble, exuding an awful stench. Suppressing nausea, upon closer examination, there was dense, sesame-sized pus covering the surface of the meat bubble.</br>
</br>
Whenever the pus ruptured, spore gas was released. With the countless flesh bubbles, countless spores were born every moment. They drifted through the entrance to the surface, and contributed to the expansion of the nest.</br>
</br>
In the center of the underground research institute, there was a giant flesh pile that acted as the root. As the core of the nest, it was both the heart and the "central processing unit" of the nest. The tentacles that spread from top to bottom acted as the cable lines connecting the host and the subunits.</br>
</br>
In its abdomen, there was a coffin carved out of a resin material, or, more appropriately, a "culture chamber." Unlike the flesh-colored nest, this lacquered black cabin looked reinforced. Through the translucent film with palm-sized thickness, it was possible to see a person lying inside.</br>
</br>
His eyes were open and he gazed at a number on the semi-permeable membrane.</br>
</br>
[14731]</br>
</br>
Four thousand of them were refugee recruits he brought underground, and more than three thousand of them included researchers and his own guards. The other seven thousand came from the conflict between the mercenaries and refugees in the military base. Then the British also contributed about six or seven hundred people to him.</br>
</br>
Each person contributed two units of organic matter, and he already consumed half of the organic matter to fortify the nest and hatching mutants.</br>
</br>
"Not enough."</br>
</br>
Carmen, inside in the culture chamber, shook his head and began to reflect on whether he went overboard with showing off.</br>
</br>
If he didn't kill them all at once, perhaps he could give the British the illusion of winning, thus they would send more people to provide him with organic matter.</br>
</br>
However, now the British were more cautious.</br>
</br>
Other than constantly shelling this area, no one entered the area.</br>
</br>
Upgrading the nest required 500,000 units of organic matter.</br>
</br>
There were two sources to obtain organic matter—one was primitive photosynthesis and just required waiting. The other was also one of the quickest, simplest and most primitive methods, which was to eat constantly. It was growing by phagocytizing creatures and digesting their flesh and bodies.</br>
</br>
Carmen, of course, favored the latter. If organic matter was to be obtained by photosynthesis, it would take a few centuries for the nest to cover the entire world. But if he constantly devoured, he could complete the transformation in just a few days.</br>
</br>
</br>
With that thought in mind, Carmen looked aggrieved.</br>
</br>
The reason why he chose this location for the nest was because the refugee camp next to the military base had more than 500,000 refugees. If he swallowed the refugee camp and swallowed the town of Paltak, he would've completed the first stage evolution!</br>
</br>
The second-stage nest required an astounding amount of energy. Not only would the mutants' hunting range be expanded to 100 kilometers, but he would also unlock new "forces."</br>
</br>
For example, a monster named Roshan that could withstand tank shells with its fat.</br>
</br>
However, because of Jiang Chen, his plans all faltered.</br>
</br>
His teeth gnashed together and he made an unbearable grinding sound with the thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
Spores acted as his eyes and ears, and he could clearly sense everything that happened in the spore-covered area. He was positive that that night, he "saw" Jiang Chen at the military base, but it was a pity that he couldn't keep Jiang Chen there forever.</br>
</br>
[Reminder, the host is still far away from the organic matter reserves of 500,000. It is recommended to upgrade forces in the initial stage.]</br>
</br>
A thought entered his mind, which was a suggestion from the nest.</br>
</br>
There was no need to vocalize words; there was no barrier to language or expression. Communication was directly through consciousness and Carmen thought this was most convenient. It was one of the reasons why he sought biological civilization through the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Upgrade forces? What you said makes sense. Carmen replied. He closed his eyes, and connected his consciousness with the control center of the nest.</br>
</br>
A row of simplified upgrade lists emerged in front of him, and after careful screening, he distributed 5,000 organic matter to upgrade the wings of the "Blade Warrior".</br>
</br>
The name Blade Warrior was given to the mutants that resembled mantises. The upgraded Blade Warrior possessed longer and more powerful wings. They not only aided Blade Warrior's ability to bounce but allowed it to fly for short distances.</br>
</br>
As Carmen distributed the organic matter, a slurry flowed along the pipeline to the pile of larva in front of the nest. After the input of organic matter, the larva began to mutate, and the new "Blade Warriors" broke out from the larva.</br>
</br>
The larva was the hatching medium for mutants, and for him, it was similar to a "barrack".</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a violent tremor from the ceiling.</br>
</br>
Carmen sneered as he looked above.</br>
</br>
The soil above the bunker was reinforced by the nest. The roots of fibers woven into the soil created a layer of "body armor" 500 meters thick, which was comparable to reinforced concrete. The British army threw hundreds of shells on top of his head and only blow up the very top layer.</br>
</br>
The reason why space-based weapons blew up the entrance was simply that the nest had just formed, and he didn't have time to reinforce the entrance...</br>
</br>
Suddenly, his expression changed, and at the same time, the consciousness of the nest entered his mind.</br>
</br>
[Warning, the protective layer is damaged by external forces, and some of the structures are broken. Please use organic matter for repair. ]</br>
</br>
"Damn it! It's a space-based weapon from Celestial Trade!"</br>
</br>
Carmen cursed. He seemed to have still underestimated the power of space-based weapons. Originally, he thought that a few tungsten rods would remove a layer of skin from the outer layer of the nest at most. Now, the damage to the protective layer required him to repair it with organic matter. He was already lacking organic matter!</br>
</br>
The amount of organic matter was consumed at a speed visible to the naked eye. As Carmen anxiously moved organic matter into the gap, a series of fracturing sounds came from above.</br>
</br>
Realizing what was happening, Carmen's expression immediately changed; his facial muscles began to distort.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>

</br>
More than forty armored vehicles drove into the infected area, and when everyone thought it would be a military show put on by the UK, the situation took a dramatic turn in just a few minutes.</br>
</br>
No one knew how intense the crossfire in the infected area was, but almost the entire world witnessed the result of this exchange of fire. Five out of the forty armored vehicles returned intact, and all the infantry units were lost. The rifles and cannons lost against bugs. Colonel Moston, who commanded the battle, could not accept this ending.</br>
</br>
It was not only him, but the people all watching this event unfold also couldn't accept this truth.</br>
</br>
From City K to Yoto, the phrase "biohazard" repeatedly struck the fragile nerves of the global community. The concept that was originally thought to appear only in films and games turned into reality, and easily attracted global attention.</br>
</br>
And panic...</br>
</br>
On Facebook, Twitter, Weibo and other social platforms, the discussion about X2 bacteria intensified.</br>
</br>
"The last time was the T virus, this time is the X2 bacteria? God, are the capitalists crazy? Is there any good for them to research something like this? The state should legislate to ban these dangerous experiments!"</br>
</br>
"Unbelievable, it was really the British army that entered the zone. Are the British armored vehicles made out of paper? It's just a group of mutants, just run them over! Could their teeth really pierce through the armor?"</br>
</br>
"The Doomsday Survival Handbook, a decade-long doomsday enthusiast teaches you how to survive in the event of a doomsday. Quantity is limited, buy as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
"Send a peacekeeping force. This is not a national issue anymore. It's a issue for the entire world..."</br>
</br>
"I'm very curious now. Is there a research institute in every Arrow military base?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Colonel Moston couldn't see what was being debated on social media. He was worried about how to explain this disastrous defeat to the Parliament and the Ministry of Defense. Two companies were lost inside without causing a splash.</br>
</br>
God, the prime minister counted on him to deal with this with elegance and pull Finland into the family of NATO. Now, he was pale. He didn't have the courage to develop a battle plan and didn't want to send a single troop inside.</br>
</br>
A division of force may not even be enough!</br>
</br>
The Finnish government was anxious and even threatened that if they couldn't handle the nest, they would contact Celestial Trade for a solution.</br>
</br>
Moston sneered at the Finnish government's statement, because it was not a question of combat effectiveness at all. If the armored vehicle could be melted by the acid, was the kinetic skeleton of Celestial Trade really harder than the armored vehicles?</br>
</br>
The better plan was for scientists to study the X2 bacteria. Morton had a hunch that as long as scientists could develop something that could kill those spores, these mutants would vanish.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I admit that we underestimated the strength of the nest. It is the wrong choice to send troops to the infected area rashly." Standing in front of the media, Moston explained under pressure, "The research team from London is already studying the DNA structure of the spore. I believe it won't take long for a method to be developed to inactivate the X2 bacteria."</br>
</br>
The reporter asked, "Colonel Moston, does this mean the Britain will give up military aid to Finland?"</br>
</br>
"NATO will never give up on any friendly partners, but now this is not something that the British alone can solve."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
"God... look! What is it!"</br>
</br>
Just as Colonel Moston was busy explaining to the media, there was a sudden exclamation from the crowd next to him. A female reporter with a terrified expression, pointed at the infected area.</br>
</br>
A "fireball" descended from the sky.</br>
</br>
Even from a few kilometers away, the fireball breaking the sound barrier could still be clearly heard.</br>
</br>
The lens previously focused on Colonel Moston zoomed to the airspace. Almost at the same time, the tremor was felt underneath everyone. While it shocked everyone's eyes, it also shocked everyone's mind.</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, it was the first time Celestial Trade's space-based weapons appeared in front of the media.</br>
</br>
Moston was glad that the lens was not focused on him. He knew that at the time, he must have looked dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Far away in Murmansk, in the Presidential Suite Hotel, Jiang Chen sat on the sofa was his legs crossed, overlooking the battle through the holographic screen and remotely commanding the battle against the mutants.</br>
</br>
Space-based weapons dispersed the spores outside the military base for a short period of time. After a round of bombardment, Jiang Chen saw the ground shatter through the satellite map.</br>
</br>
"Hmmm? It didn't collapse?" Staring at the holographic screen, Jiang Chen grunted.</br>
</br>
In theory, even if the underground bunker was more than five hundred meters deep, it wouldn't be able to block the attack from the tungsten bomb. The tungsten fell from the geosynchronous orbit. Even if the five hundred meters were made of reinforced concrete, everything should have turned into dust by now.</br>
</br>
The nest was indeed weird.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyeballs moved around and issued an order to Ivan.</br>
</br>
"Continue to bombard! Bomb until he shows himself!"</br>
</br>
The mutants were resilient. Ordinary minor injuries only required a few seconds in the spore atmosphere before they could regenerate rapidly.</br>
</br>
Although the British army carried out several rounds of bombing at theary bases, it did not cause many casualties to the mutants. Broken arms and broken legs may be fatal to humans, but for the organized mutants, they could recover by simply lying in the nest.</br>
</br>
Even if the mutants were killed on spot, the body could be dragged back and turned into organic matter and re-hatched into new mutants.</br>
</br>
What's more, most of the aliens are hiding underground.</br>
</br>
The operational plan formulated by Jiang Chen was very simple and very direct, it was to fatigue the enemy. Launching space-based weapons constantly! As long as their defense could be broken, he would bombard until the nest is exposed!</br>
</br>
This tungsten bombs were not aimed at the mutants but aimed to destroy the underground bunker. All the attack points converged to a ten-meters radius. Even with the incredible regeneration of the nest, the space-based weapons' vertical penetration ability was not to be matched!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not know that his simple and direct plan made Carmen suffer.</br>
</br>
The first round, the second round... one round after another, the tungsten core bombs dropped down from the geosynchronous track. Jiang Chen burned money, and Carmen burned organic matter. Both sides were bleeding, but Carmen with limited resources, was more distressed.</br>
</br>
Soon, the nest wouldn't be able to repair itself.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could see it visibly from the satellite image.</br>
</br>
As the dust dissipated, the soil layer had completely been blown apart, exposing the staggered roots. Undoubtedly, the roots reinforced the underground bunker, and the soil reinforced the roots to create a concrete-like defense.</br>
</br>
The nest vainly released spore, attempting to cover up its weakness, but Jiang Chen did not miss this opportunity and ordered Ivan to take advantage of this opportunity.</br>
</br>
The bombardment from the orbit continued to strike down on Earth. When the Stingray C-1 deployed dropped the last tungsten rod, the tentacles covering the underground bunker also shattered. The nest without defense exposed the flesh bubbles hidden underground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew that the opportunity had come and immediately ordered Ivan to move.</br>
</br>
"The nest has been exposed, stop the bombardment. Order the Third Power Armor Brigade to airborne!"</br>
</br>
"Roger!" Ivan shouted with confidence.</br>
</br>
The constant striking stopped, 15 minutes already passed since the first tungsten rodlanded. The reporters, soldiers, and townspeople in Paltak were still dumbfounded. Their head looked up, staring at the clear airspace.</br>
</br>
Colonel Moston opened his mouth but couldn't say a word. The Finnish Defense Minister, who was standing next to him, was full of regrets. He wished that he asked Celestial Trade to do the deed from the start. As for the reporters, they were thinking what rhetoric they should use to narrate the destructive "air strike."</br>
</br>
Everyone was still immersed in a state of amazement.</br>
</br>
Just when everyone thought that everything was over, rows of flame trails soared down from the clear sky...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1072: Steel and Blood</br>
</div></br>
</br>
For the people who were in Paltamo, it was just a blink of an eye before the roar of collision between steel and earth came from a few kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The producer of Finnish Radio and Television quickly eyed the reporters. It didn't take long before the helicopter took off again and rushed toward the military base. Not only the media was interested in the Orbital Airborne Brigade of Celestial Trade, even the British and Finnish military sent two helicopters.</br>
</br>
Ceremonially, it was to provide support to Celestial Trade when necessary, but in fact, everyone understood their intention.</br>
</br>
Through the satellite, Jiang Chen saw the little tricks of Finland and the United Kingdom, but he didn't mind. Since he revealed the power armor, he did not intend to keep it a secret any longer.</br>
</br>
This "mini brigade" only consisted of 200 soldiers and was formed two years ago. The reason why he kept it a secret till now was on one hand, the enemy in his surrounding lacked combat capability. There wasn't any reason for him to flex his power. On the other hand, he was worried about causing a regional arms race and affecting his economic development plan.</br>
</br>
The reason why he revealed it now was because the two concerns no longer applied.</br>
</br>
As for why, it was a story after the end of the war.</br>
</br>
Fifty airdrop cabins dropped one by one. The explosion still lingered on the battlefield and two hundred fully armed T3 Power Armors rushed out from the airdrop cabins. They stepped into the spore-filled battlefield and began to converge on the fracture created by the space-based weapons.</br>
</br>
Sensing the invasion of uninvited guests, a screeching scream drifted out from the bottom of the deep pit.</br>
</br>
"Blade Warriors" shook its wings and leaped out from the abyss. When the bombardment landed, the mutants all hid underground. Now that they sensed living creatures, they could not control their bloodthirsty desire. They just wished to use their claws to tear apart the prey.</br>
</br>
However, they were destined to fail. Now they encountered opponents unmatched by the weaklings before.</br>
</br>
"ROAR!"</br>
</br>
With a piercing scream, a Blade Warrior moved.</br>
</br>
The bow-shaped legs moved, and the long wings instantly opened. The two scimitars formed into a pair of scissors and dove into the nearest power armor. If the scissors landed, even steel would be torn open!</br>
</br>
But just at that moment, a transparent shield unfolded from the left arm of the power armor. The Blade Warrior slammed into the shield. The power armor remained intact while the two blades faltered.</br>
</br>
The long mouth made out a tragic scream.</br>
</br>
The Blade Warrior used its arm to protect its head and moved back. However, without gaining any distance, the power armor slammed through it defense with the shield, and then used a tactical dagger the size an arm to penetrate the Blade Warrior's chest. The dagger slashed down and split the intestines into two halves.</br>
</br>
</br>
The fight took place in an instant.</br>
</br>
Carmen inside the chamber was stunned.</br>
</br>
He has never seen such an agile piece of metal. It reminded him of the rumor from a long time ago about Iron man on Coro Island. In fact, as early as the Los Santos Attack, there was a rumor that Celestial Trade created a "steel combat suit." There were even more unreasonable rumors that Jiang Chen himself was the "Iron man" in Coro City. His own image was too similar to the heir of a Stark industry.</br>
</br>
Cold sweat profusely appeared on Carmen's forehead.</br>
</br>
Although he sneered at the rumors, he never thought that Jiang Chen not only created a "steel combat suit" for himself, but also armed an army with something that clearly costed a lot!</br>
</br>
While he was shocked, he did not have the luxury of hesitating.</br>
</br>
While the size of the army is not big, they are the trump card of Celestial Trade, and hence trump cards must be limited! As long as he survived through the early stages of growth, the entire forest would be included in the nest's consciousness. In order to hurt Celestial Trade, even if it meant sacrificing all his bugs, he must destroy the trump cards here!</br>
</br>
Even if it meant he paid a heavy price.</br>
</br>
With that thought in mind, Carmen gritted his teeth and connected his consciousness with the nest. Almost instantaneously, the red blood vessels in the nest began to surge, and the flesh bubbles hidden under the shadows swelled. The sesame-sized pustules soared to the size of mung beans and then exploded to release spores containing frenzy nature.</br>
</br>
All the dark green eyes instantly turned crimson.</br>
</br>
"ROAR!"</br>
</br>
The roar was mixed with violence. All Blade Warriors went mad and dove onto the two hundred power armors. However, before they could get close, they were hit head on by a net weaved by bullets and shells.</br>
</br>
These batches of T3 Power Armors were shipped to the modern world and were functionally subdivided in order to adapt to the modern battlefield. The most obvious difference was that the right arm was no longer all mini guns, but designed with mountable accessories such as a grenade launcher, a shield, and a plasma cutting dagger.</br>
</br>
The power armors in the front squatted down and raised the shield in the front with eerie blue sparks. The power armors in the back stepped forward and raised the mini guns on the right arm to unleash bullets. Behind them, 72mm anti-vehicle cannons were set up. The power armors were anchored in place and used the destructive cannons to tear up the mutants.</br>
</br>
In terms of firepower alone, this two hundred power armored brigade more than doubled the firepower of nearly 1,000 British troops. Taking into account the comprehensive combat capabilities of maneuvering and protection, Jiang Chen could say without exaggeration that the two hundred soldiers could easily beat a NATO division without airstrike support.</br>
</br>
A Blade Warrior that rushed in front was shredded into pieces by the firepower, and the mutants who got close were also cut into two pieces by the dagger behind the shield. The mutant's armor worked great against bullets but was as fragile as tofu against high-energy plasma jets.</br>
</br>
Green blood splashed on the battlefield, mixed with the acid from the Spitters. Carmen was determined to take down Celestial Trade and never planned to retreat. The hatching and digestive ability of the nest was operating at its limit!</br>
</br>
At the juncture of life and death, he could no longer be conservative. He used all the organic matter and converted it into Blade Warriors and Spitters. Then, he sent them to the frontline.</br>
</br>
The only advantage of the swarm was that it didn't fear death. Under the influence of the nest's will, even if only one mutant remained, it would rush to the muzzle without hesitation. As the battle began to escalate, there was no distance separating the two sides. It turned into close-range combat.</br>
</br>
The power armor was strong but not invincible. Gradually, there were casualties. Carmen was ecstatic. Following this trend, Celestial Trade must be the first to retreat! He then made the decision to use all his organic matter.</br>
</br>
However, Carmen's emotion took a 180-degrees turn. The eager expression gradually turned into despair. Through the eyes of a Blade Warrior, he saw a series of flares descending from the air.</br>
</br>
The second round of airdrops arrived.</br>
</br>
They were not people, but drone hives.</br>
</br>
Before the start of the airdrop, the power armor in combat with mutants maintained their formation and retreated with order. This left enough space for the mutants to crawl out from the deep pit. When they almost retreated to the edge of the military base, drone hives landed behind the mutants.</br>
</br>
Thousands of drones swarmed out and swarmed into the fracture on the nest from the space-based weapons.</br>
</br>
When Carmen reacted, everything was too late. The mutants under ground were all sent out. Only mutants that just hatched remained. Although the number was still impressive, it was not enough to stop the drones from flooding in.</br>
</br>
Without fighting or even firing a single bullet at the mutants, the drones rushed to the hatching larva.</br>
</br>
Carmen's face turned green.</br>
</br>
"FU*K!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who was a hundred kilometers away, sat up straight from the sofa and slammed his fist against the coffee table.</br>
</br>
"EXPLODE!"</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1073: Just Give Him a Quick Way Ou</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The drones that rushed to the larva exploded, engulfing the surging larva into a ball of flame and exploding everything into pieces. The reddish-green plasmas that were fused together sputtered out from the flesh bubbles before turning into smoke under the high temperature.</br>
</br>
Some of these blood cells belonged to the nest, and some of them were from the mutants still in embryos.</br>
</br>
Carmen inside the cabin was drenched...if he could still feel coldness.</br>
</br>
Despair flooded him.</br>
</br>
This feeling was like he was killing all the enemy champions, but someone backdoored his base.</br>
</br>
[Warning, the hatchery is extensively damaged, please repair immediately.]</br>
</br>
The consciousness of the nest echoed in his mind, and Carmen quickly looked at the organic matter. However, when he saw the number in the hundreds, the last sign of life on his face faded.</br>
</br>
Just then, he distributed all the resources to the larva for hatching the Blade Warriors. However, the suicide attack of the drones damaged his organic matter.</br>
</br>
It was not impossible to digest the residue on the ground, but it required time to convert the residue to organic matter. In addition, it depended on the form of carbon present and the photosynthesis efficiency of the spores. Carmen didn't know how long it took, but a few hours for sure.</br>
</br>
But would Celestial Trade give him the time?</br>
</br>
The killing of soldiers stopped, and the mutants no longer had any stamina. The Power Armor Brigade that secured their position at the edge of the base began to launch a counterattack against the mutants showing signs of weakness.</br>
</br>
The Spitters were torn into pieces by the countless bullets. The Blade Warriors were penetrated by the plasma blade. The corrosive dark green blood splashed, and even faded the paint on the power armor.</br>
</br>
Thousands of different mutants were a large force, but in the absence of more back-up, it was only a matter time before they were annihilated.</br>
</br>
In the collision of flesh and blood, the first confrontation between the civilization of Harmony and the civilization of Natural was settled in dissipating smoke.</br>
</br>
The dust dissipated, and no more mutants climbed out of the deep pit.</br>
</br>
At the front of the team, the power armors kneeled down, retracted their shield and with one hand on the ground, they slowly stood up.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, is it over?"</br>
</br>
"It's all over..." Another soldier flicked his mucus-stained arm and snorted.</br>
</br>
At the end of the battle, no one lifted their mask to breathe.</br>
</br>
High-density spores were still floating outside. Even for those who injected genetic vaccines, it was a dangerous environment. Some soldiers stood in the same place waiting for orders, and some soldiers simply sat on the ground and did not care about whether or not the corpses of the mutants were disgusting.</br>
</br>
No cheers. They were only glad to be alive.</br>
</br>
A total of forty T3 Power Armors were scrapped in the battlefield, and more than 30 troops were killed on the spot. For the first battle of the Power Armor Brigade, it was a heavy casualty figure, but an undoubtedly epic result.</br>
</br>
</br>
Nearly 10,000 mutants died in their hands.</br>
</br>
Without exaggeration, even if a NATO division was sent in, it wouldn't achieve the same fruitful result. Perhaps maybe more enemies would appear.</br>
</br>
Going to the forefront of the team, the brigade commander of the Power Armor Brigade looked around his brethren.</br>
</br>
"Well, guys, the mission is not over yet, let's go end the bug for good. Let me see..." He clicked the touchpad on his arm and sent a drone down into the deep pit. Before the drone was culled, he saw the situation and said, "There are still about thirty mutants. Who has the strength to go with me?"</br>
</br>
A soldier stood up from the ground with the help of his rifle and raised his hand.</br>
</br>
"Count me in, I can still move."</br>
</br>
"Count me in."</br>
</br>
The brigade commander picked out eleven people from the team and took the team to the side of the deep pit. Then he opened the vortex engine and jumped down.</br>
</br>
Twelve power armors landed. The blade warriors crouching in the dark immediately leaped out, ready to make a dying struggle.</br>
</br>
The brigade commander raised his arms as usual, and easily strangled the neck of the mutant. The other hand pulled out a pistol and fired it at its head. He then threw the paralyzed body to the side. The remaining mutants were far away, and they were turned into sieves by the soldiers.</br>
</br>
Stepping over the mutants' body, the soldiers came to the core of the nest.</br>
</br>
Here they saw the eggs that were blown into a mess, and the green and red mud.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, this is really disgusting."</br>
</br>
"Let's finish this and go back up." The engineer soldier removed the blasting tool from the back and distributed several pieces of thermite. "The red head points inward. Remember to put it deep inside."</br>
</br>
Spores could extinguish fires, but the nest itself didn't have this function. As long as the burning thermite was completely inserted into the core of the nest, it could effectively prevent the spore gas from extinguishing the fire.</br>
</br>
Looking at everything Celestial Trade soldiers were doing, Carmen began panicking.</br>
</br>
When countless thermites were nailed to the nest, his eyes turned red.</br>
</br>
"NOOO!"</br>
</br>
The soldier closest to Carmen grinned at him under the mask. He waved at him with thermite in his hand, and then slammed it into the core of the nest.</br>
</br>
The gorgeous fire leaked out of the gaps, but more of it was sprayed on the inside. Under the high temperature, the core of the nest collapsed.</br>
</br>
Carmen's heart was bleeding as he stared at everything unfolding in front of him.</br>
</br>
He sacrificed the researchers of the entire institute, the guards loyal to him, and even his confidants to create the nest,. However, now, Celestial Trade destroyed everything in front of him.</br>
</br>
Resentment, anger, fear... countless negative emotions mixed together and distorted his face.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the brigade commander walked to his side, knocked on the resin chamber with his fingers, indicating for Carmen to look towards his side. Then he took out a Future phone from his waist and put it on the film of the cabin.</br>
</br>
"We meet again." Inside the presidential suite of Hilton, Jiang Chen looked at Carmen inside the chamber and smiled. "It is certainly satirical to meet this way."</br>
</br>
Carmen's pupils were bloodshot, filled with rage, as he stared at Jiang Chen. "Do you think I am a joke?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, and no." Jiang Chen shook his head and looked at Carmen who was without any of the elegance and calmness of an old aristocrat. There was pity in his tone. "I'm just a little curious, what has made my opponent look like this now."</br>
</br>
Carmen did not answer, and his brain was now controlled by hatred.</br>
</br>
Just then, Jiang Chen noticed the black ball on his head.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple?"</br>
</br>
With a frown, he vaguely recalled his knowledge of the family history of the Rothschild. Their family seemed to be innately susceptible to the influence of the Klein particle wave. They can receive signals without the help of foreign objects. It is the ability that even Tanaka didn't posses.</br>
</br>
The universe is filled with a lot of chaotic Klein particle waves, just like electromagnetic waves. Carmen was not sensitive to Klein particles innately, but was fixated on the idea of the Golden Apple. He even puts the "Klein Particle Wave Amplifier" on his bedside table.</br>
</br>
It was like putting a magnet on a TV, it won't take long for the color in the TV to be misaligned.</br>
</br>
To be straightforward, he was already crazy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly lost interest. He didn't want to talk to Carmen anymore.</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Jiang Chen turned off the communication channel and sent an order to the brigade commander.</br>
</br>
"Just give him a quick way out."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The muzzle was pressed against the film of the cabin as Carmen stared at the black hole on his head.</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
There wasn't even the chance to make a sound as his consciousness drifted into the abyss.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1074: Pentagon“s Concern</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was not just the British and Finns watching the battle on the scene. The UA across the Atlantic was also paying close attention. When Celestial Trade played its trump card, space-based weapons, everyone's expression became sullen.</br>
</br>
Then, from the Power Armor Brigade to the drone airdrop tactics, everything happened next made the atmosphere in the Military Headquarters conference room drop to freezing point.</br>
</br>
Although the pictures taken by the British were not clear, they still felt the horror brought on by the flood of mutants, and the immense power of the power armors that defended the attacks of the mutants.</br>
</br>
If the K1 kinetic skeleton was like a bicycle, then the power armor was undoubtedly a motorcycle. It not only provided the soldiers with highly maneuverable armor, but it also served as a firepower point, increasing the individual combat effectiveness of soldiers to the max.</br>
</br>
Although from a human's standpoint, the last thing the UA Secretary of Defense wanted to see was Celestial Trade ultimately winning the battle against mutants. The better ending would be UK and Xin both losing, and the UA Marine Corps saving the mankind.</br>
</br>
The Minister of Defense kept praying that the mutants could drown these two hundred "human armored vehicles", but the reality was different. When the drones rushed into the nest, the fate of the mutants was determined.</br>
</br>
When the last Blade Warrior was penetrated by the plasma blade and its head slashed off, the conference room went silent.</br>
</br>
"These hypocrites, they are lying! They said there are only two Orbital Airborne Brigades, how come there is one more now?" A senior UA Defense Department official broke the silence and cursed.</br>
</br>
Minister Ashton Carter glanced at the officer and shook his head.</br>
</br>
Did you really believe what they said? The UA Defense Advanced Research Projects Bureau didn't introduce many pieces of equipment. If you didn't know, you can only blame your lack of intelligence work.</br>
</br>
However, they didn't have a solution. The local anti-intelligence capability of Ghost Agents was too strong. From a long time ago, the CIB wanted to steal the technology of the space elevator by penetrating Celestial Trade. However, all the agents sent to Xin failed, and some agents who went over the line simply evaporated.</br>
</br>
Just then, Hill suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
"I'm more worried about their space-based weapons than the Orbital Airborne Brigade and power armor. If they can, at any time, send tungsten rods weighing dozens of tons above our heads, it will pose a serious threat to our national security."</br>
</br>
Everyone nodded.</br>
</br>
Although the 1966 Outer Space Treaty referred to the prohibition of the development of weapons and the militarization of space in outer space, in reality, vigorously developing military aerospace technology and space power, seizing absolute air superiority, and occupying the strategic commanding heights of safeguarding national security interests have long been the common strategic goal of major powers.</br>
</br>
</br>
If the treaty was strictly abided, all missiles should not exist. But was this possible?</br>
</br>
The CIB director coughed and spoke.</br>
</br>
"With regard to their space-based weapons, we obtained some tungsten rods from Ukraine. According to our scientists, the techonological content is not high. It's just an alloy tungsten rod. A gyroscope-like guidance component is installed in the middle."</br>
</br>
"It's easy to imitate their weapons," he then paused, with a hint of helplessness. "The key is how to get these tungsten rods into the orbit."</br>
</br>
If these tungsten rods couldn't be sent to the orbit at an appropriate cost, the development of space-based weapons would be completely meaningless.</br>
</br>
"That's right." The Capitol military adviser smiled bitterly. "If we use rockets to put these things on the synchronous orbit and throw them down, it's pointless. The danger of Celestial Trade is that there is no binding international convention that limits the size of private armed forces. If they continue to expand, we have no way to intervene."</br>
</br>
Hill tapped on the arm of the sofa and said, "If we push for an international convention now?"</br>
</br>
"Then we will be the biggest victims." Secretary of Defense Carter said. "You know, a large percentage of our annual defense budget is spent on military contractors. It's fair to say that they are already part of the UA Army."</br>
</br>
Including Hill, the Defense Department and the Capitol senior officials in the conference room were all silent.</br>
</br>
If the Capitol swung the blade at the private military contractors, Wall Street would be the first one to disagree. Cutting the military industry was equivalent to robbing the wallet of the Wall Street consortia. The infamous private military contractors like Blackwater International were all linked to Wall Street.</br>
</br>
It was the 2020 election next year. On the one hand, it was important to please the people, and on the other hand, it was important to not offend the consortium. Now that Goldman Sachs had fallen, the WASP consortiums such as Morgan Stanley and First B City dominated the entire North American financial industry. Itwas not the time to start a conflict with Wall Street.</br>
</br>
What can we do about it?</br>
</br>
Hill was troubled.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When the war ended, the Power Armor Brigade that destroyed the nest controlled the military base.</br>
</br>
Seeing the victor was decided, the brigade commander of the British Mechanized Brigade came to the military base and proposed to enter the military base. His reasons were well prepared, such as "collect the remains of fallen soldiers" and "remove the scrapped armored vehicles", but they were still rejected by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
The reason for the refusal was simple.</br>
</br>
There was no corpse at all. The mutants digested the flesh immediately and sent it back to the nest as nutrient for the spores. Celestial Trade promised that if it obtains any tags with soldiers' name, it would be returned to the British army.</br>
</br>
This reason obviously did not satisfy the British.</br>
</br>
Collect the remains was only second in priority. Anyone knew that even the bones were probably gone. They wished to see Celestial Trade's power armors at a close distance and collect as much information as possible about this new type of weapon.</br>
</br>
Of course, in addition to that, what they were most worried about was that X2 bacteria would be controlled by Celestial Trade</br>
</br>
It must be said that the ferocious mutants left too memorable of an impression. If someone used the bacteria for military purposes, the consequences would be simply unimaginable.</br>
</br>
The best way to overcome fear was to obtain a copy, just like nuclear weapons.</br>
</br>
Moston made up his mind. He won't withdraw his request to enter the military base. Since Celestial Trade didn't have the confidence to start a conflict with the British, then he would bring a research team from London and investigate the formation mechanism of the nest. Even if it was not used for military purposes, it should be backed up in case of an emergency.</br>
</br>
However, Celestial Trade did not plan to give them face. The entire military base was designated as a private territory.</br>
</br>
The Finnish officials came for mediation but to no avail. When their president asked Celestial Trade to send troops, they sold the assets owned by Arrow to Celestial Trade. Jurisprudentially, the treaty between Arrow and the Finnish government naturally transitioned to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The military base was now a private asset of Celestial Trade and protected by Finnish law.</br>
</br>
The brigade commander of the Power Armor Brigade did not plan to talk to Moston. The two soldiers at the gate stopped him.</br>
</br>
Even if Moston was reluctant to accept this, he could only return to the military camp next to Paltak. He reported the news to his superiors, the Ministry of Defense, for further discussion before a decision could be made.</br>

</br>
A night passed since the war ended, the next morning, there were snowflakes dancing in the sky.</br>
</br>
It was the end of May, close to summer for the Northern Hemisphere, but the concept of weather didn't apply to the tundra in northern Finland. Located in the Arctic Circle, if an Arctic Ocean monsoon crossed, snow was even possible till mid-June.</br>
</br>
At this moment, above the military base next to Paltamo, the flag was replaced with Celestial Trade's flag.</br>
</br>
After several rounds of bombing, there was not a single standing building inside the base. After negotiating with the Finns, Celestial Trade transported supplies to the base through Russia. The logistics and research teams from Murmansk arrived by plane and set up tents outside the military base.</br>
</br>
Unlike the bacteria Jiang Chen saw in the apocalypse before, these improved X2 bacteria were tenacious. Even without the nest, they could survive for a long time. Therefore, it would be too risky to not cleanse them completely.</br>
</br>
Without the injection of genetic vaccines, any organism that inhaled the spores over a certain threshold would exhibit "zombie" behavior. Especially for primates, the more developed the brain, the more susceptible to these toxic bacteria.</br>
</br>
After the arrival of a thousand-person logistics team, the first order Jiang Chen gave them was to kill the spores floating in the air and eradicate all sources of infection.</br>
</br>
Although no agents have been developed to kill these spores, not everything must be solved by technology.</br>
</br>
These spores could extinguish fires, but conversely, they extinguished fires by sacrificing themselves, and without a nest to reproduce more spores, these characteristics accelerated their demise. No special sterilization equipment was needed, and a flamethrower produced unexpected results.</br>
</br>
Now the entire military base was still covered by spores. Other than soldiers in power armor, only the logistics personnel wearing orange chemical protective suits remained on the scene. The mutants' corpses were piled up in an open space one kilometer away from the military base and incinerated with gasoline.</br>
</br>
The dark smoke that floated up into the sky yesterday was still visible the next morning. It was even visible from Paltamo.</br>
</br>
In the command post next to the military base, the brigade commander Kleinman took off his power armor. He was wearing heavy winter clothes, standing at the desk and, listening to reports from his subordinates.</br>
</br>
"... Columbia TV hopes to enter the military base to film the underground bunker and wreckage."</br>
</br>
"Tell them to get permission from Celestial Trade. We are soldiers, we don't have permission to decide such matters," Kleinman said impatiently.</br>
</br>
It was already the fifth media station that knocked on his door. Now, the world was focused on this military camp, and everyone was focused on one question – how would Celestial Trade deal with the aftermath?</br>
</br>
</br>
"In addition, the Finnish Presidential Palace officials contacted us this morning. The president hopes to have a conversation with us on in regards to the handling of the mutants' body. Instead of incinerating, they hope we can come up with a more environmentally-friendly solution."</br>
</br>
Kleinman raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Then tell him, either accept our plan or try to deal with the source of the infection. If they want, we can send the corpses to the warehouse in the nearby town, free of charge."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The officer saluted and left the room.</br>
</br>
Kleinman sat back in his chair and planned to rest for a moment.</br>
</br>
However, before the seat was even warm. A sergeant ran inside and woke him up from his half-asleep state.</br>
</br>
The content of the report was only a few words. But Kleinman, who was disturbed by his dream, did not show any temper.</br>
</br>
The sergeant saluted</br>
</br>
"Report! The boss is coming."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At noon, a helicopter flew from the other side of the mountain and landed steadily on the tarmac in the military base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, wearing a chemical protective suit and a gas mask, jumped off the helicopter. Although he didn't need to wear any protection, it was better to not shock the world again with the current concentration of spores.</br>
</br>
Behind him was the Russian Security Service Director Barth, in wearing a chemical protective suit. He was examining the chaotic base.</br>
</br>
Originally, Ayesha also planned to come along, but considering that they would not stay in Finland for too long, Jiang Chen asked her return to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
The brigade commander Kleinman saluted to Jiang Chen in his power armor.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded to him with approval.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your service."</br>
</br>
"My honor!" Kleinman grinned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen continued, "How is the situation underground?"</br>
</br>
Kleinman replied, "The nest is confirmed dead and there is no living residue. The logistics unit is still working on cleaning out the X2 bacteria and the research team from Coro Island is investigating the remains of the nest."</br>
</br>
"Take us down."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Kleinman saluted.</br>
</br>
Behind Kleinman, Jiang Chen and Barth walked to the crater in the center of the base. It used to be the entrance to the underground bunker. It collapsed due to the bombardment of Celestial Trade. In order to facilitate the cleaning personnel and the research team, the logistics team built a temporary lift.</br>
</br>
The three arrived at the entrance of the underground bunker 500 meters below.</br>
</br>
"This is the interior of the nest? The flesh bubbles are indeed disgusting." Barth glanced at the residue on the wall, revealing a disgusted look.</br>
</br>
"You can interpret that before the core was destroyed. The nest transformed the entire underground bunker into its own," Jiang Chen explained.</br>
</br>
Not far away, researchers were taking samples around the debris of the larva. DNA codes unheard of and contrary to the existence of biology completely changed the scholars' understanding of the subject. Everyone used all 200% of their energy and devoted their passion for science to collecting these precious samples.</br>
</br>
These were valuable materials for the entire human civilization.</br>
</br>
For Harmony, Jiang Chen just saw a glimpse from the distance. It was fair to say he knew nothing at all.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect to learn from the wreckage of the nest about the weakness of Harmony, but for now, it was the only means for the Earth civilization to learn about them.</br>
</br>
Because of the chemical protective suit, no one recognized Jiang Chen's identity along the way. The soldiers guarding saluted to Kleinman and let them in.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by Kleinman, the two arrived at the ruins of the core of the nest.</br>
</br>
Barth glanced at the resin-like "coffin" inside the choatic scene and saw a familiar face through the broken film.</br>
</br>
"Carmen Rothschild?"</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
"You really killed him," Bart said. "For me, the International Court is his best destination."</br>
</br>
"It would be a problem to keep him," Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
He did not know what Harmony revealed to him. If those worms told him his ability to travel through dimensions, it would be an issue.</br>
</br>
The Rothschild family had produced tens of thousands of Golden Apples and these Golden Apples were a hidden danger to him and to the human civilization.</br>
</br>
However, he was now there to get rid of this hidden danger!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to Kleinman standing next to him and then pointed to the head of the resin coffin. Kleinman understood and took out a dagger. He cut open the resin surface, put his steel fist inside, and pulled out the black sphere.</br>
</br>
When Barth saw the black sphere, the change in his expression was subtle.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple," accepting the black sphere from Kleinman, Jiang Chen weighed it in his hand. "We have always thought that it is a tool used to communicate with the future. In fact, this is not the case."</br>
</br>
"Communication is only its basic ability. Its true ability is brainwashing, infecting their holders in a subtle way, and turning them into their slaves. Whether Tanaka or Carmen, they were essentially the same type of people."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pretended to be disgusted by it and tossed the Golden Apple back to Kleinman, indicating for him to put it back.</br>
</br>
He couldn't see Barth's expression through the protective suit, but his years of experience of bluffing told him he achieved his purpose.</br>
</br>
The revolution in Frankberg was about to end in victory. Russia certainly obtained many Golden Apples from the rebels. If they referred to previous intelligence and experimented, they may learn some new things. Jiang Chen must warn them before they figure out how to use the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
They must feel fearful.</br>
</br>
"The most terrifying fact is that the biological civilization that communicates through the Golden Apple communicates not with the future."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Barth.</br>
</br>
"But with what is around us."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before the Frankberg Tragedy, Carmen used a series of means to consolidate the power of the Rothschild family into his hands. After he used Celestial Trade to kill his brother in Pilsner Synagogue, he dictated the family.</br>
</br>
For this very reason, his death meant the end of the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could foresee that once the revolution comes to an end, the New Choice Party would have to step down and the "crimes" committed by the Freemasonry would be punished. Rothschild and other families' assets would be auctioned by banks to repay for the high penalties.</br>
</br>
In the foreseeable future, even if Jiang Chen didn't do anything, the Rothschild family would still enter a decline fueled by an internal feud over asset division.</br>
</br>
They were filthy rich.</br>
</br>
However, they were at the same time, too weak.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not worried about their decline. The only thing that worried him was the Golden Apples originally controlled by the Rothschild. If they were controlled by Carmen, it would be fine. But now Carmen died, these Golden Apples would surely flow out.</br>
</br>
Not only Russia, but Jiang Chen knew that the UA, Britain, France, and even Hua would be interested. The countries would do anything to research the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
Harmony now controlled the communication channel of the Golden Apple. If the senior officials around the world fail to realize the danger, it would be difficult to predict where the next nest would be born.</br>
</br>
On the plane returning to Moscow, Barth was still contemplating about the conversation with Jiang Chen in the underground bunker and what he saw in the nest...</br>
</br>
"...you mean, this is the product of the extraterrestrial civilization you mentioned?" Barth still couldn't believe what Jiang Chen had explained to him. His eyebrows furrowed together as he looked at Carmen in the resin coffin. "And the Golden Apple is just a brainwashing tool?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Hard to believe."</br>
</br>
"I know, this sounds like an April Fool's joke, but that's the truth. On June 15th, we will hold the Outer Space Security Summit in Coro, where we will announce what we have collected on extraterrestrial civilization. I am being open and honest with you. As to whether you believe it or not, the choice is yours."</br>
</br>
Due to the excessive amount of information, Barth took a few moments to digest the information.</br>
</br>
Extraterrestrial civilization?</br>
</br>
Is this a joke!</br>
</br>
Barth still couldn't fathom the idea, even if Jiang Chen had subtly hinted it to him in Murmansk. The Golden Apple that the Russian Security Service finally got their hands on was actually a conspiracy of aliens to invade the Earth? He really thought that this kind of story only appeared in Hollywood, but now he enjoyed it firsthand.</br>
</br>
However, when he recalled the serious expression on Jiang Chen's face, he again began contemplating.</br>
</br>
If the Golden Apple was really a brainwashing tool and unconsciously turned its holder into slaves of an extraterrestrial civilization, then this item certainly would be dangerous. After all, no one could tell who is being brainwashed, and those who are brainwashed wouldn't identify themselves.</br>
</br>
</br>
If the brainwashed person created a nest in Russia...</br>
</br>
The idea alone gave him chills.</br>
</br>
After thinking about the details, the Golden Apple already passed through multiple hands from the Rebels to the Russian Security Service.</br>
</br>
Realizing the seriousness of the problem, Barth made up his mind.</br>
</br>
At least wait until June 15 to see what evidence Celestial Trade would provide. Prior to this, temporarily lock those Golden Apples away and prevent anyone from approaching them again. If what Jiang Chen said was true, then it wouldn't be too late to destroy them.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Through the lens of Finnish Radio and Television, the space-based weapons of Celestial Trade and the powerful power armors spread to every corner of the world. The people who were pessimistic about the mutants because of the defeat of the British army also rekindled hope because of the victory of two hundred against ten thousand.</br>
</br>
The ugly mutants, like demons, fell one after another in front of the steel armor. Their dark green blood gushed out under the orange-yellow trajectories. The close-range combat made everyone's blood boil with passion.</br>
</br>
"That thing is so cool, is that two hundred Gundams? Or two hundred Ironmen? I just want to ask if I have the opportunity to wear that when I join Celestial Trade? If so, I will go to their official website and register for the foreigners corps."</br>
</br>
"@Robert Downey Jr, what do you think?"</br>
</br>
"The model with the laser knife on the right arm is my favorite! One slice and the mutants are turned into halves. Unfortunately, the image was too blurry. If it was high quality, that would be superb."</br>
</br>
In addition to those messages on social media platforms, in some military forums, a discussion of the practicality of such weapons also formed. The military fans were divided into two factions. One group thought that power armor might change modern warfare. Another group thought that there was no need to make such a big fuss.</br>
</br>
"The individual armor reminds me of bulletproof armor in the World War I era, but with a machine gun on the arm? I don't think there is anything fuss about. It is just a layer of steel outside the mechanical exoskeleton. It is better to manufacture more tanks or armored vehicles than to develop something that wraps a person in steel."</br>
</br>
"Your thinking is too simple. How did the British military's armored vehicles do? Actual war is the only criterion for truth! The infantry with protection, mobility, support, and even anti-armor ability is the Rambo on the battlefield! And it is capable to be mass-produced! As for the comparison of welding steel plates around the body, I think you are talking about Krupp's 'Lightning' series? These two weapons are not comparable at all!"</br>
</br>
Of course, not all public opinion developed favorably of Celestial Trade. The threat of the second "Biohazard" was gone, and people began to ponder about another issue.</br>
</br>
If Celestial Trade could deploy a force comparable to a division's power anywhere in the world within a few hours, what would be the significance of the border?</br>
</br>
Under the provocation of people with other intentions, many pacifists spontaneously held protests and rallies in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles to protest against the use of outer space for military purposes.</br>
</br>
However, these protests did not form anything material. Even though the mainstream media that represent the interests of the elites were mostly consistent with the views of these protesters, the public opinion on the Internet was obviously biased towards Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen was busy discussing "remuneration" with the Finnish government, Jiang Chen didn't pay attention to the public opinion on the Internet. It was not until he was at the Moscow airport did he discover Celestial Trade's Power Armored Brigade had become popular.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't predict this would happen.</br>
</br>
Although he expected the power armor to cause widespread concern from governments, he did not expect to cause such a degree of publicity among the global community.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect it to create such a strong impact. However, he was certain that Finnish Radio and Television provided Celestrial Trade with a free recruitment advertisement and the results were superb...</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1077: Focus on Driving</br>
</div></br>
</br>
A few days passed since Celestrial Trade's military operation of clearing the nest, and the Military Department and Capitol had dozens of large and small meetings focused on Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
"...I don't care what method you use. Within three days, I need to see DARPA's research and development project for power armors, separated from the mechanical exoskeleton project. Don't worry about budget issues, I will discuss with the Congress. According to the Minister of Defense, the power armor will be positioned as the fire support point for the infantry. In addition to being able to load at least 50 kilograms of ammunition, it must have nuclear, biological and chemical protection functions, and it must also have absolute protection against ammunition below 12.7mm..."</br>
</br>
At this moment, Hill and the DARPA Director were meeting in a small meeting room in the Capitol.</br>
</br>
DARPA was the abbreviation of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was known as the real version of the SHIELD. In many defense and aerospace projects, DARPA's presence was visible, including the Faraday spray that counteracted EMP weapons. It was a product jointly designed by DARPA and Lockheed Martin.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trading was now ahead of UA in defense technology, and Hill must put her hope on DARPA.</br>
</br>
The DARPA director took notes of Hill's requests and spun his pen twice before he lightly tapped it on his notebook.</br>
</br>
"We'll begin the project as soon as possible. Lockheed Martin has made good progress in the mechanical exoskeleton. We have ready-made technical resources we can utilize. In addition, I suggest negotiating with Frankberg. Can we get information about the 'Lightning' exoskeleton improvement from the Krupp Group? They obviously have the prototype of power armor, but they are still slightly lacking in design."</br>
</br>
"I'll get Kerry on this matter," Hill said.</br>
</br>
After exchanging some opinions with the President in detail, the DARPA director closed the notebook and got up to leave.</br>
</br>
There were still several meetings waiting for him. He must prepare the plan within two days and get ready for the Congressional Budget Committee on the third day. This kind of research and development project, that involves hundreds of millions of dollars, was not a decision that only required a signature from himself.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about the open the door, the door of the conference room was pushed open, and her assistant walked in with a document.</br>
</br>
"President."</br>
</br>
Hill looked at the assistant and asked with seriousness.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
"The President of Xin sent us an invitation." He walked to Hill's side and put the document on the table. "It is an invitation for the Outer Space Security Summit on June 15."</br>
</br>
"Outer Space Security Summit?" Hill sneered, revealing the wrinkles on the corner of her eyes.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade thinks it is a good idea to host a security summit? Who is the one using space resources for weapon development?</br>
</br>
</br>
"Write a letter of rejection with euphemism. State that the UA regrets the violation of the Outer Space Treaty by Celestial Trade. We'll not participate in a bilateral relationship with Xin until Celestial Trade and Xin provide an explanation to their actions."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The assistant nodded and left.</br>
</br>
Leaning in her chair, Hill rubbed her weary eyes.</br>
</br>
There was another meeting ten minutes later, and when she was preparing to take a short nap, the corner of her eye suddenly caught the invitation letter.</br>
</br>
Hesitated for just a moment, she caved to her principles of diplomatic etiquette and reached out and took out the invitation.</br>
</br>
When she swept through the first two lines of words, Hill, who caught a certain keyword, suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
"Extraterrestrial civilization?"</br>
</br>
Hill's expression began to change as she read through the invitation,</br>
</br>
When she saw the last line of words, she threw the invitation onto the table. She immediately got up and quickly went out the door.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the early morning of June 1st, a Gulfstream plane landed at Coro airport.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by a group of bodyguards, Jiang Chen walked through the special passage, yawning, and came to his Luer sedan. After a bodyguard pulled the door open for him, he sat in the passenger seat. Ayesha started the car. When the vehicle reached the initial speed, with the press of the button, the magnetic levitation device activated and the vehicle entered flying mode.</br>
</br>
Now that the major roads in Coro have completed magnetic levitation modification, almost half of all private cars were floating in the air. The constant flow of cars and the neon on both sides of the street complimented each other. Under the high-rise buildings and luminous night, the whole city looked like a bright pearl, dreamy and beautiful.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine what this city looked like four years ago.</br>
</br>
In the car, Jiang Chen received a call from Warner Bros.</br>
</br>
Christopher Nolan, who had worked with him prior, called him. He stated that Warner Brothers was interested in bringing the battle between men and mutants onto the "bigger" screen. He wanted to know about Jiang Chen's opinion and see if Celestial Trade could provide some help.</br>
</br>
Taking into account the positive propaganda, Jiang Chen gladly accepted the proposal. He said that as long as Celestial Trade played a positive image in the film, Celestial Trade would be more than happy to provide assistance for free.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put away the holographic screen after he end the call. Then he made himself comfortable. After two flights, he was still jetlagged and felt dizzy.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at Jiang Chen and whispered.</br>
</br>
"How was Finland?"</br>
</br>
"Alright, just a bit busy."</br>
</br>
"Did you see Natasha?"</br>
</br>
"I saw her before I departed. She treated me to dinner." Jiang Chen turned and looked at Ayesha. He then placed the hand that was previously on top of his head, around her slender and fit waist. "Don't always ask questions about me, what about you? Did you miss me?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha's cheeks turned red as she whispered.</br>
</br>
"I missed you every day."</br>
</br>
Feeling the naughty hand, Ayesha twisted her body, but she didn't resist.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not worried about the tragic accident. Maglev driving was much safer than driving on the road. The traffic was managed by a smart program. After entering the highest cruising track, the car could drive hands free as the steering wheel is controlled by the smart program.</br>
</br>
At first, Jiang Chen was only holding her by the waist, but soon he wanted more.</br>
</br>
However, the little sheep was so gentle that the naughty hand went higher and higher...</br>
</br>
Gently biting her lower lip, she could no longer restrain her passion. The blushing Ayesha moved the car onto the cruising track, completely handing the car over to the smart driving system. She then moved over and sat on Jiang Chen's lap.</br>
</br>
Her arms were around his neck. She blinked with her pristine eyes and looked straight into his. Jiang Chen who was very active, now felt shy.</br>
</br>
"Hey, focus on driving—"</br>
</br>
Before he could finish, his lips were sealed by her petite and soft lips. The slippery tongue slipped in through his teeth and the cold but gentle hands moved down from his shoulders...</br>
</br>
Separated by the tinted glass, the lights soared beside the two.</br>
</br>
Everything was meant to happen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt that his fatigue was gradually disappearing with her warmth.</br>
</br>
In the luminous and brilliant night, a Need for Speed was unfolding...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was the third time Xia Shiyu looked at the clock on the wall. She let out a sigh and muttered to herself, "Why are they still not back? "</br>
</br>
Half an hour ago, Ayesha drove to the airport to pick up Jiang Chen, so she took a shower.</br>
</br>
It was summer, and the weather was hot. After the shower, Xia Shiyu did not immediately change. Instead, she wrapped her wet hair in a towel and sat on the sofa in the living room with her bath towel draped around her body.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu fantasized about the way Jiang Chen would look at her, blushing and breathing heavily; a smile formed on her face.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, she realized that she the naughty things playing out in her head and she blushed. With the heat on her face, she coughed and tightened her fists. She took a deep breath and adjusted herself before turning back to a fresh but quiet look.</br>
</br>
Only the eyes that couldn't stop searching for someone and the love inside her pupils exposed her anxiousness.</br>
</br>
The clock ticked and tocked; it was already one.</br>
</br>
As she looked at the clock on the wall one more time, Xia Shiyu was no longer calm and began to worry.</br>
</br>
"Could it be a traffic jam... Impossible, how is the maglev car stuck? Are they in an accident?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu couldn't sit still any longer. She quickly picked up the phone and called Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The phone rang for a while and no one answered.</br>
</br>
Then she called Ayesha but her phone was off.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu started to get nervous.</br>
</br>
Just as she got up and was going to change to take a look outside, she finally heard the sound of door opening. The light flickered and the familiar Luer entered the garage. Soon, the two walked in. Seeing that the two return safely, Xia Shiyu was relieved and walked forward. She pouted and protested to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Why are you back so late?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled embarrassedly. "Got stuck on the road for a while, why are you not asleep yet?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen with a suspicious look.</br>
</br>
No, if he is normal, then he will definitely have an unnatural reaction when he sees me wrapped in a bath towel. He is too calm now?</br>
</br>
She didn't know that Jiang Chen just shot four consecutive bursts and was in the Sage Mode (1) at this moment. Even if she was having a bubble bath with him, he wouldn't have any reaction!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't realize why Xia Shiyu felt strange. He felt somewhat uneasy being examined by her look of suspicion. He touched his face and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Is there something on my face?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu shook her head and then looked at Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Ayesha blushed, and dodged her eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly realized and thought.</br>
</br>
This is not good.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, Xia Shiyu immediately understood. With a grin, she walked to Jiang Chen and "gently" grabbed his arm.</br>
</br>
"There is something on your face, I'll help you."</br>
</br>
The fragrance of lilacs sneaked into Jiang Chen's nose, and he saw her wet hair was covered with a layer of fine mist. Looking down at the beautiful face, it was whiteness that led to a seductive deepness. Jiang Chen finally reacted both in happiness and pain.</br>
</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of things," carefully examining Jiang Chen's face, Xia Shiyu nodded. With a jealous look, Xia Shiyu stared at Ayesha, but the "wicked"smile did not change. "Let's go upstairs, let me help you carefully clean the stuff out~"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu grabbed the bath towel across her chest with one hand while she grabbed Jiang Chen arm's with the other and marched upstairs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know whether to cry or laugh, which made Ayesha somewhat distressed. However, the little girl silently mourned for him for just a second before running to the upstairs bathroom, hymning a tune.</br>
</br>
Coro's summer was very hot, and she felt sticky. She couldn't wait to take a shower and then have a great night of sleep.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't wake up until noon, rubbing his weary eyes.</br>
</br>
The beauty who hugged him last night had already got up and left.</br>
</br>
There was only the exhausted cattle, no ruined farmland. Last night, he tried all the moves he could perform and worked his emptied body, to finally making Xia Shiyu beg for mercy. He did not expect the dedicated female boss to get up and go to work the next day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled. Then, he got off the bed.</br>
</br>
Hearing sounds in the bedroom, the well-behaved Ayesha walked in with some clothes and gently helped Jiang Chen change. She whispered in his ear, "Is there any arrangements today?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's hair, "Spending time with you two."</br>
</br>
Enjoying his warmness, Ayesha smiled and softly said, "Spend more time with Sister Shiyu, she always waits for you at home. I occasionally can go travel with you. Although she seldom says it, I can feel that her love for you is not inferior to mine."</br>
</br>
Gazing into the pristine eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly felt he wronged her. He opened his mouth, but her soft finger stopped his words.</br>
</br>
"Don't say anything."</br>
</br>
Whispering softly, Ayesha tipped her toes and gently kissed him on his lips.</br>
</br>
Looking at him with a loving gaze, she reached out and fixed his collar.</br>
</br>
"Let's go eat lunch."</br>
</br>
Looking at the beauty inches from him, Jiang Chen's heart was pounding. He grabbed her waist and whispered into her ears.</br>
</br>
"Can I eat you first?"</br>
</br>
"No, you have to go to the company in the afternoon." Ayesha buried her head and gently touched Jiang Chen's chest with her forehead, then she said, "Get your priorities fixed, or Sister Shiyu will be jealous again."</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen was convinced that if he insists on it, Ayesha would certainly not resist. After he considered the harmony of the harem, he still listened to the girl's suggestion. The two had lunch together, and Jiang Chen drove to the company in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the elevator to the top floor and when he passed by Xia Shiyu's office, he went and said hello.</br>
</br>
Although there were no words, Jiang Chen clearly felt Xia Shiyu's joyous mood because he showed up in the afternoon.</br>
</br>
She didn't care if Jiang Chen treated his work seriously, she was used to dealing with the heavy workload for him. But she cared about if he was willing to spend more time with her. She didn't expect Jiang Chen's love for her to be more than his love for Ayesha who spent life and death with him, she just hoped that at least she is not far behind…</br>
</br>
Going into his office, Jiang Chen asked the beautiful assistant to help him make a cup of coffee. He then called Future Bank CEO David Smith from downstairs.</br>
</br>
Soon, Mr. Smith appeared in his office.</br>
</br>
Since it was work hours, Jiang Chen went straight to the subject.</br>
</br>
"Within three days, I need to see 150 billion Xin New dollars on the balance sheet of Future Bank. In addition, upload the research report of Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen Group to an email. Right, which companies in Frankberg are the leaders in the electric industry? Get me a list of that too."</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's words, the word shock was written all over Smith's face.</br>
</br>
As a senior financial practitioner, any little bit of capital-related news in the world can't escape his eyes. Without Jiang Chen's order, Future Bank was already preparing to scoop up the European economy. The liquidity was available and his team only needed to determine which options would bring in the highest return and the highest success rate.</br>
</br>
Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, the companies that possessed both technology and market, were naturally their first choice for investment. Except, these companies would not always be available. Even with double the premium, the government may not be willing to allow this transaction.</br>
</br>
Smith didn't expect that his boss would be so powerful. Even the pillars of the Frankberg auto industry, such as Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen could be acquired. Did the Frankberg government just allow their pillars to be swept away by foreign capital?</br>
</br>
"No problem." While shocked, Smith only nodded without any oppositions.</br>
</br>
"Then go."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
After Smith left, Jiang Chen grabbed a cup of mocha from his assistant and leaned back in his chair to enjoy it.</br>
</br>
The war has been fought, money has been spent, and blood has flowed.</br>
</br>
The Frankberg revolution was about to end in victory. Carmen died in Finland. The Freemasonry headed by the Rothschild family could not turn the tide. What happened next was the exciting part!</br>
</br>
It was time to divide the trophy!</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In City B, northwest of Frankberg, a Germanic man was rushing to pack his luggage. Perhaps because he was panicking too much, he accidentally knocked his phone to the ground. When he saw this, he hurriedly bent down to pick up his phone and stuff it back into his pocket, followed by a curse.</br>
</br>
"This damn Carmen, can't do anything right! How did I get on his boat... Damn!"</br>
</br>
As he cursed, he closed the packed suitcase and walked quickly toward the door.</br>
</br>
Calvert Krupp, a noble member of the Frankberg society, was once a famous name. However, now he lived like a street rat, he wore clothes worth 100 euros, lived in cheap hotels, and had to wear sunglasses and a baseball cap whenever he went out for fear that someone may recognize him.</br>
</br>
For some reason, he suddenly missed his brother, the man who strongly opposed the alliance with the Rothschild family. He was the backbone of the entire Krupp family. If he didn't get blinded by power and reminded his brother to be careful about Carmen that night, perhaps today's Krupp family would have another ending.</br>
</br>
In the elevator, he shook his head hard and drove away the unrealistic thoughts.</br>
</br>
Thinking about this didn't do anything except add more problems.</br>
</br>
He adjusted his mood and watched the number on the elevator gradually decrease, Calvert's heart began to ignite with a glimmer of hope.</br>
</br>
As long as he escaped to South America, he could hide there for a while and wait for the event to pass. Then he could operate through an offshore company and quietly move his money out from the Cayman Islands. He could still be a rich man in South America.</br>
</br>
One hundred million dollars, enough for the rest of his life if he doesn't splurge.</br>
</br>
As for the mess of the Krupp family, his two younger brothers and a younger sister, who cares!</br>
</br>
The elevator reached the first floor, and Calvert let out a breath of relief. He walked out the door with his suitcase. However, at this moment, four men in black suits also noticed him. They got up and surrounded him from all four directions of the hotel lobby.</br>
</br>
Calvert noticed this and a panic expression appeared on his face. He just wanted to turn around and escape, but soon found that he had nowhere to escape to.</br>
</br>
In a few seconds, he was surrounded by four men in black suits.</br>
</br>
The man in front of him took out a license and said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Hello, are you Mr. Calvert?"</br>
</br>
"I think you have the wrong person..." Calvert said nervously. "I am Francis Odd, the owner of a food processing company in South… South America. I just came to Germany on a business trip..."</br>
</br>
However, the man did not care about his rhetoric and continued.</br>
</br>
"We are agents of the Federal Constitutional Security Agency. Mr. Calvert, now you are facing at least 20 charges including treason. Please come with us."</br>
</br>
Calvert panicked. He slammed into the man next to him in an attempt to escape. However, the experienced man was not moved by Calvert's meager force. The man easily pinned his hands together.</br>
</br>
</br>
"No! I'm not going anywhere! I have to catch a plane! Help! There are people here..." While struggling, Calvert screamed and snorted miserably.</br>
</br>
The agent of the Federal Constitutional Defense Agency saw that Calvert did not cooperate. He didn't waste his words and gestured to the assistant.</br>
</br>
"Take him away."</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On June 3, the Frankberg People's Liberation Front marched into the capital city without blood, and the people welcomed them with open arms. The revolution that lasted for several months finally welcomed a victory.</br>
</br>
On June 5, the government in exile, Evelyn, returned from Russia to the official residence of the prime minister, ending his years of exile. As the leader, he was sworn in as the prime minister in front of the entire Frankberg people.</br>
</br>
On the afternoon of the same day, a total of 27 people of the New Choice Party were prosecuted for crimes such as war crimes and anti-federal constitutional crimes. They were given life imprisonment sentences and no parole.</br>
</br>
At the same time, a number of European companies, including Rothschild Bank and Krupp Group, suspected of providing huge political contributions to New Choice Party, were sued by the Frankberg government. The Supreme Court immediately froze their assets in the country and started the investigation process.</br>
</br>
If convicted, Rothschild Bank could be fined up to one trillion dollars.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that the current Rothschild family could not afford this bill, and Evelyn didn't plan to collect in cash. After the decision, the shares of companies held by Rothschild Bank would be nationalized and auctioned off by a number of banks.</br>
</br>
The proceeds from the auction would be taken back to the national treasury, used to revive the economy.</br>
</br>
According to the agreement, Jiang Chen purchased the shares of Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW from the government at a premium of 20%, replacing the European consortiums such as Rothschild as the top shareholder of the three European companies.</br>
</br>
EU integration was expected to go bankrupt and the euro continued to fall. The exchange rate of the euro against the Xin New dollar even fell to 3:1, 150 billion Xin New dollars converted into euros were sold in the foreign exchange market at a price of 400 billion euros.</br>
</br>
Among them, 200 billion euros were for a loan Future Bank provided to the Frankberg Central Bank, 100 billion euros were for acquiring 37% of Volkswagen, 41% Daimler, and 39% BMW, and 100 billion euros were investments Jiang Chen made in Siemens, Bosch, and another five electric companies.</br>
</br>
In this feast to divide the European consortium, Future Group became the biggest winner. The two pillar industries were printed with the label of Future Group. Jiang Chen also planned to acquire the Krupp Group, but Evelyn was much harder to convince.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that Krupp is the heart of the Frankberg industry. Even if selected the wrong team with the New Choice Party, the Supreme Court did not hand out excessive punishments. What's more, the Krupp Group was a traditional Prussian aristocracy. They were never part of the core group of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
After a new person leads the family, the Krupp Group will stand on the side of the winners. They would be separated from the Rothschild family and the Freemasonry. Evelyn did not intend to pursue this further and decided to flip the page.</br>
</br>
The process of EU integration did not take more than 100 days. And the farce ended with Carmen's death.</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1080: Another Possibility</br>
</div></br>
</br>
As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the Frankberg Revolution inspired the European people amid the turmoil.</br>
</br>
The collapse of the Rothschild Empire accelerated the move of European countries "to return left." People began to reflect on whether the choices made two years ago were correct, and whether those right-wing parties really took their country in a better direction.</br>
</br>
Contrary to the turbulent Europe, the Asian economy on the other side of the globe was steadily rising.</br>
</br>
Especially in the country situated in the vast western Pacific Ocean, GDP was rising as fast as the space elevator.</br>
</br>
On June 10th, the delegation of the Nippon government visited Coro City and brought the Central Power Company and the Yoto Power Company for an agreement to expand electricity imports. This would increase the total import power in the second half of the year by 31% to replace two nuclear power plants that were shut down.</br>
</br>
At present, the mining speed of tritium-3 in Lunar City was far greater than the consumption rate. The second nuclear fusion power station was also about to be completed with a considerable surplus in electricity generation. Jiang Chen welcomed these agreements with open arms.</br>
</br>
Not only Nippon, but the most prosperous market in Hua also loosened their grip on policies and sent many power companies to delegate. As the world's number one electricity consumer, Hua's electricity consumption was larger than the second place and third place combined.</br>
</br>
Even if Hua eliminated half of the thermal power, Celestial Trade would make more than a fortune.</br>
</br>
As of early June, the Global Grid Plan completed the most critical first step. Thanks to the efforts of many parties, the cables of Celestial Trade successfully covered 80% of Australia and Asia, and the output of electricity accounted for 88% of the total domestic electricity production.</br>
</br>
Benefiting from the dividends brought in by cheap electricity, according to the proportion of total electricity consumption in the country, the Global Grid Plan decreased industrial cost by the highest of 1.7% and the lowest of 0.3% for participating countries. The decrease of two percentage points, projected onto the trillion-dollar GDP, brought unimaginable savings!</br>
</br>
The benefits to the environment, the investment environment, the competitiveness of export products, the promotion of electrification, and the decrease in reliance on the energy market were not quantifiable. In short, the governments that tasted these benefits have also released positive signals and sent their own companies to negotiate with Xin on increasing electricity imports.</br>
</br>
The New York Times even claimed that Xin has become a country on the electricity pole. The Washington Post posted a satirical cartoon that illustrated countless dog chains sticking out from the Western Pacific, leashing the surrounding countries.</br>
</br>
Regardless of how the media reported it, the countries that bought tickets to board the train are already for the electrification process, and they had no intention to jump out. The series of grids not only generated Jiang Chen a continuous stream of cash but also allowed him to create diplomatic capital.</br>
</br>
</br>
The reason why the US dollar could rule the global market for more than half a century was any country's industrialization process depended on oil. The dollar also happened to be linked to oil. If the domestic production of crude could not meet demand, then a foreign exchange reserve would be needed to avoid fluctuations in the US dollar.</br>
</br>
The same was true now. Asian countries were increasing their holdings of the New Xin dollar.</br>
</br>
When the rise and fall of the New Xin dollar could affect the cost of electricity in many countries, even if Coro was not the world's financial center, the Xin Reserve could begin to challenge the dollar's hegemony.</br>
</br>
There was nothing to do with finance, just influence.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Five days before the Outer Space Security Summit, Jiang Chen sent invitations to ten major countries around the world. He implicitly mentioned in the invitation that the topics discussed would be related to an extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
So far, the ten countries that received the invitation letter have indicated that they planned to send senior foreign ministers to attend the meeting.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen, the evidence presented at the meeting was now his focus.</br>
</br>
At present, the space telescope he transported from the apocalypse was sent the synchronous orbit via the space elevator. Jiang Chen was unsure about the specific coordinates of that space colonization ship, but it was enough to know their origin and destination.</br>
</br>
Gliese 581, about 2 degrees north Libra-beta, 20.5 light-years from Earth. A week before the invitation was sent, the astronomical observation team of Celestial Trade Space Department conducted an observation and analysis of the star. They ultimately reached an astonishing message... but one that was expected by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The Gliese 581g planet's probability of life reached 90%.</br>
</br>
"Unbelievable..." With a stack of documents filled with astronomical data, Kelvin walked into Jiang Chen's office and said incredulously. "Your conjecture is correct. There is indeed the possibility of life there... However, I'm certain that even if there is life there, it is absolutely impossible to breed a civilization with technology beyond the Stone Age."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Oh? Why do you think that?"</br>
</br>
"The first is Tidal Locking. The only habitable part of the planet is around twilight zone, which determines their living space." Kelvin took a spectrum and placed it in front of Jiang Chen. "The next most important thing is that the elemental composition of this planet contains a lot of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, but it is extremely lacking in mineral elements such as iron and aluminum. Referring to the gravitational data we have observed, the most likely lives on the planet are arthropods along the twilight zone. There are no mammals!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen applauded and nodded.</br>
</br>
Although it was based on 22nd-century observation equipment, it was quite remarkable to be able to analyze so many valuable insights from limited information.</br>
</br>
"Then have you considered another possibility?"</br>
</br>
"Another possibility?" Kelvin frowned.</br>
</br>
"All along, we all believe that the development of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, from the Feudal Era to the Industrial Revolution, and finally to the future known as the Information Age."</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong with that?" Kelvin didn't think so.</br>
</br>
"The conclusions drawn from only one reference system cannot be universally applied. We cannot negate the possibility of the existence of other civilizations because the development of human civilization is linear," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"You mean a group of bugs may breed a civilization? Stop kidding, they..." Kelvin shook his head and just wanted to say that they didn't even have hands, but he suddenly stopped.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered Celestial Trade's military action on the tundra in northern Finland. Celestial Trade's most proud Power Armor Brigade encountered a bunch of mutants hatched from larval.</br>
</br>
Why did Jiang Chen instruct Celestial Trade Space Department to observe the Gliese galaxies? Why did Jiang Chen suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacterial incident broke out? Why was Jiang Chen so certain of the danger of the nest from the beginning...</br>
</br>
All the clues connected together in Kelvin's mind.</br>
</br>
He looked at Jiang Chen in shock and squeezed out a few words from his throat.</br>
</br>
"You mean..."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded and said seriously, "The X2 bacteria is not just a research accident as publicly stated. From the beginning, this is a conspiracy of an extraterrestrial civilization."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1081: Dysplasia?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After he left Jiang Chen's office, Kelvin repeated what the boss told him in his head.</br>
</br>
Five days later, the Outer Space Security Summit was going to take place. At the meeting, Celestial Trade would publicize the evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and demonstrate its aggressive intentions... In fact, the latter didn't need to be proved. Two civilizations with completely different values ​​never have the options to exist in harmony from the start.</br>
</br>
Since both sides were bugs in each other's eyes, only one option existed to prove who stood at the top of the food chain.</br>
</br>
War.</br>
</br>
Kelvin looked down at the documents in his hands again, recalling the task his boss gave him a minute ago. It was the first time in his life he felt the burden of the task on his shoulders.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After a long working session into the evening, Jiang Chen did not go home immediately. Instead, he took a boat and went to Coconut Island alone.</br>
</br>
The island was completely transformed into a transit point between the modern world and the apocalypse. Every month, a ship sailed to the island, unloaded food, daily necessities, and other materials, and occasionally transported tightly sealed containers.</br>
</br>
Some of these containers contained advanced industrial machine tools, some were T3 Power Armors produced in the Sixth Street, and some were other high-tech products.</br>
</br>
Although no soldiers were stationed on the island, a drone attack formation guarded the island. Foreign agents certainly thought about investigating the "mysterious island", but not one succeeded.</br>
</br>
On the small island, Jiang Chen stopped the boat at the dock. After the drone confirmed his identity, he went to the warehouse in the center of the island.</br>
</br>
In the corner of the warehouse sat a lonely machine Jiang Chen named Hamster Killer No. 1. The last time Lin Lin used this machine to transfer a hamster from the modern world to the apocalypse, and then back. They finally made the breakthrough in interdimensional travel from 0.1 to 1.</br>
</br>
Although there were still some ways to go before making interdimensional travel for humans a reality, it was definitely a good start.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not expect this device to come in handy so quickly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat beside the machine, took out a few test tubes filled with dark green liquid from his pocket, placed them in the center of the two discs, and then connected the lines to turn on the power. Looking at the electricity arcs jumping, he pressed the switch with a numbing sensation in his skull.</br>
</br>
It took a while and some effort before he sent the test tubes to the apocalypse. Jiang Chen then closed the machine and traveled to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
One of the test tubes contained the material extracted from the nest, and the other tubes contained spores and larva extracts. The cells in the test tubes were not killed. It was still possible to see the peristaltic movements of the unknown substance through the dark green culture solution.</br>
</br>
</br>
After she received these tubes from Jiang Chen, Lin Lin immediately locked herself in the lab.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not have to wait for long before the lab door opened again. Lin Lin waved her hand and called Jiang Chen in. Next to a special microscope, Jiang Chen saw the tubes he brought with him on the test tube rack and two familiar-looking tubes.</br>
</br>
From the labels attached to them, he recalled where the two tubes came from.</br>
</br>
"The samples you brought are obviously not the same as ones from Fallout Shelter 005 and the ones from the city center. But there is a lot of similarities in the DNA code. The nest you encountered is an upgraded version. But due to dysplasia, many functions were inhibited."</br>
</br>
After listening to Lin Lin, Jiang Chen's eyebrows suddenly twitched.</br>
</br>
"Dysplasia?"</br>
</br>
Hundreds of tungsten bombs and an entire Power Armor Brigade finally took care of this mess, and you are telling the ones I encountered has dysplasia? What do I do when there is a fully functioning one!</br>
</br>
Lin Lin nodded.</br>
</br>
"Yes, if you provide enough organic matter to it and give it plenty of time for photosynthesis, digesting and absorbing those organic matters into its own components, the nest will gradually develop into a complete form. Based on a simulation of its DNA code, it will become a terrifying existence that can't be eliminated."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin then paused and said with a stern expression. "At least with the existing means, I can't think of a way to kill it. Every spore cell has the ability to grow into a nest, and the number of splits is no longer limited. Unless we can kill every spore, then a nest may pop out from somewhere, someday."</br>
</br>
The evolutionary speed of the nest made sent chills down his spine.</br>
</br>
For they who completely abandoned it, Earth would be a completely strange planet. Whether the gravity or air composition or magnetic field environment, even if they understood it, it wouldn't mean they could 100% adapt to it. In a war, humans first occupied the home advantage.</br>
</br>
However, on this strange soil, each time they interacted with humans, their abilities would evolve at an incredible speed. If the nest infiltrated Earth a few more times, it would be hard to say how Harmony will fulfill their aggressions.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen realized the severity of the problem, he debated for a moment and immediately ordered.</br>
</br>
"Organize the information about the nest. Focus your analysis on the similarity of the X2 bacteria and the T series viruses in genotype. In addition, give me a separate paper file and an electronic file. It would be great if the electronic file can include images that are easy to understand."</br>
</br>
"Hey, I am not your assistant. This will be very tiring!" Lin Lin pouted and protested.</br>
</br>
"Ten boxes of mango pudding."</br>
</br>
"Hmm..." Lin Lin debated for a while, as if she was making a big concession, before saying, "Fifteen boxes of strawberry pudding,"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Is this difficult for me?</br>
</br>
"I will bring them to you next time. But wait, I thought you liked mango?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin stuck out her tongue and looked away. "I still have too much mango pudding. I haven't finished the ones you brought me the last time."</br>
</br>
The amount of work to sort out the data of the nest was not small, but it was not difficult for a digitalized human. After getting her promise of the pudding, Lin Lin promised Jiang Chen to complete the report in three days.</br>
</br>
From the research institute, Jiang Chen returned to the mansion through the back door.</br>
</br>
Before coming to the apocalypse, he had already told Ayesha that he would stay in the apocalypse for the next three days until Lin Lin completes the report. This information would play a valuable role in the Outer Space Security Summit.</br>
</br>
The attention of the global community completely depended on this information.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1082: Eyes on its Prey</br>
</div></br>
</br>
An informal Federal Reserve Shareholders Meeting was being held in the Morgan Stanley Building on Wall Street.</br>
</br>
The man who sat by the door was Daniel Morgan, the head of the Morgan family. Also sitting at the conference table with him was a member of the Rockefeller family, representing the Loki family of the B City consortium...</br>
</br>
Those who were qualified to sit around the conference table possessed influence no less than Franklin on the bill, and they could breathe. Any decision around the table could cause an earthquake in the financial market.</br>
</br>
To put things exaggeratedly, at least one-third of the world's capital was housed in this conference room.</br>
</br>
"First, let's toast to our victory." Daniel Morgan picked up the champagne and looked around. "Victory belongs to the 'WASP' and Wall Street belongs to the 'WASP'!"</br>
</br>
Old Rockefeller smiled and also raised his glass.</br>
</br>
Without an extraordinarily long introduction, twelve wine glasses were held high and celebrated the victory for the WASP consortium, led by Daniel.</br>
</br>
Twelve waiters stepped forward and handed each member a towel respectfully. They then took the towels and wine glasses away and proceeded to leave the room.</br>
</br>
Daniel tossed the towel into the waiter's tray then proudly looked at the members around the conference room. Among the influential individuals around the world, he was the youngest at forty years old and undoubtedly the most successful.</br>
</br>
After all the waiters left, Daniel clapped his hands and gestured everyone to look at him.</br>
</br>
"Just yesterday, Morgan completed the acquisition of Citibank shares under Rothschild Bank. So far, I'm honored to announce to you that we've completely kicked those Jews out."</br>
</br>
Courteous applause resounded, and even old Rockefeller clapped gently, but his murky eyes showed an intriguing brilliance.</br>
</br>
Daniel nodded slightly and humbly accepted the members' praise to him and his name.</br>
</br>
When it came to the control of the Rothschild family, the word "Fed" must be mentioned.</br>
</br>
As everyone knew, the Federal Reserve was equivalent to the central bank and possessed the power to regulate the macro "world banknote." An interest rate hike could mean that some factories in a weak economy just worked for free for a month, and a country's debt just became unpayable. Interest rates were equivalent to nuclear weapons in the financial sector.</br>
</br>
The most terrifying thing was that this nuclear weapon was controlled by private hands.</br>
</br>
Although the members of the Federal Reserve Board were nominated by the president and appointed by the senate, they strictly acted in the political sense. However, according to the Owen-Glass Act, the Federal Reserve were divided into 12 reserve areas, each of which established an independent regional reserve bank. The equity of each regional Federal Reserve was subscribed to by the member banks of each region according to the proportion of their assets.</br>
</br>
</br>
Take the New York Reserve as an example. According to the latest public data, the major shareholders were Citigroup with 15%, Chase Manhattan with 14%, Morgan Trust with 9%, Hanwha with 8%, Hanover with 7%, and these banks were often controlled by the financial families such as Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild.</br>
</br>
Goldman Sachs fell last year, and the Rothschild family was just kicked out. The shares of banks such as Citigroup and Hanover were divided by Rockefeller and Morgan.</br>
</br>
If Wall Street in 2018 was controlled by the Jewish and Anglo-Saxos and the button for nuclear weapons was in the hands of two people, then Wall Street in 2019 was dominated by the WASP consortium.</br>
</br>
Old Rockefeller coughed, pulling Daniel out of the intoxication of victory.</br>
</br>
"Celebrating victory can be left to the evening banquet. Gents, now we have more important things to discuss."</br>
</br>
"That's certainly true." Daniel smiled, no dissatisfaction apparent on his face.</br>
</br>
Old Rockefeller raised his hand over his shoulder and moved his finger. The secretary standing behind him understood the gesture and put a document on the conference table respectfully.</br>
</br>
Tilting his back forward slightly, the old Rockefeller put on his gold-gilded glasses and opened the file.</br>
</br>
"Yesterday, on June 11, the Central Power Company, the Yoto Power Company, and Celestial Trade reached an agreement to increase power imports. According to the electricity consumption data of Nippon last year, Celestial Trade successfully monopolized 20% of electricity in the country."</br>
</br>
Everyone in the room exchanged glances in shock; even Daniel showed a hint of surprise.</br>
</br>
"This news hasn't yet entered the disclosure process. You might not have received the news yet. My information came from a cabinet official." Old Rockefeller glanced at the audience. "I don't need to say more; you might have already felt it."</br>
</br>
"We're losing control of the situation in Asia."</br>
</br>
When the statement came out, the room was stunned.</br>
</br>
All of them were representatives of major consortia and were financial giants on Wall Street. With their IQ and senses, they obviously noticed this point. However, prior to this, everyone was focused on Europe. Everyone was trying to snag a piece of meat from Rothschild, so no one focused on the opposite side of the earth.</br>
</br>
"The dominance of the dollar is being shaken, and it might've been a wrong choice for the Freemasonry to fall so quickly."</br>
</br>
"What can we do then? Are we going to drag them out of the grave?"</br>
</br>
"Maybe we can help the Krupp consortium. As long as there are new rivals to contain Future Group–"</br>
</br>
"That's even more unrealistic." Daniel interrupted everyone's arguments and shook his head. He tapped his chin with his fingers. He was still immersed in the joy of victory, but he already noticed the looming crisis facing the WASP consortium. "We must curtail the influence of Celestial Trade from expanding. The bad signs have emerged, and if we allow their Global Grid Plan to progress, we will be at more and more of a disadvantage."</br>
</br>
"That's right." Rockefeller nodded and looked around the table. "I know everyone here is cooperating with Future Group in many fields, but if they shake the foundation of the dollar, I think everyone knows what that would mean."</br>
</br>
The financial empire of Wall Street was built on the dollar. Through the two levers of the exchange rate and market, Wall Street giants had plundered the world for nearly a century. Once the dollar lost the aura as the "world currency", central banks would decrease the dollar reserve, and every dollar bill issued by the Fed would become useless. The Wall Street financial empire built by bills would become worthless overnight.</br>
</br>
Two hours since the start of the meeting, everyone including Daniel was completely sober from the joy of victory. The Jewish consortium had fallen, but the jackals who killed them weren't satiated yet. They had already aimed across the Pacific.</br>
</br>
When the interests of all people present were threatened, it was clear the WASP consortium had never been as united as it was now. In the past two hours, they developed a plan to block the Global Grid Plan.</br>
</br>
After the meeting, representatives of the major consortiums got up and left in a hurry.</br>
</br>
Daniel Morgan, who was the moderator of the meeting, didn't get up. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
At that moment, he suddenly remembered his conversation with Carmen a month ago. At that time, the former Rothschild financial tyrant lowered his stance and asked him for help, but he refused Carmen with almost no hesitation.</br>
</br>
"...Just the opposite—I'm extremely convinced that one day in the future, I will be grateful for the choices made today...?" Fingers gently tapping on the table, Daniel muttered to himself the lines he once said, but his tone now carried a hint of hesitation and no longer carried the same certainty.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"...The negotiations between our South America delegation team and the Ecuadorian side have ended, and we made great progress. The President of Ecuador has agreed to connect their power grid with us and even welcomes us to register a power company locally to export electricity directly to them, as well as helping them invest in the construction of the national grid. Their only requirement is that we must bear the cost of construction and maintenance of the submarine cable." Through the interdimensional communication device, Xia Shiyu reported the progress of yesterday's work to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
South American countries were generally poor. Ecuador's finance couldn't support a submarine cable that spanned the ocean. It was basically impossible to recover their investment through the domestic electricity market. Therefore, the country simply outsourced the entire project to Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also didn't intend to recover his investment from Ecuador; his real goal was Brazil, which was behind Ecuador. As the largest economy in South America with the eighth largest electricity consumption in the world, Jiang Chen's ultimate goal was to export cheap electricity to Brazil and push his Global Grid Plan to South America.</br>
</br>
Ecuador's conditions matched Jiang Chen's expectations. As for the convenience of investing in the construction of the local power grid, it wasn't a problem of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
However, the Ecuadorian government certainly weren't guarded against Celestial Trade, as the government allowed a foreign company to operate their state grid.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and nodded at Xia Shiyu on the holographic screen, .</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"If you really want to thank me, come back sooner." Her index finger twirled a strand of hair beside her ear, and she rolled her eyes. Her seductiveness always tickled his heart.</br>
</br>
Generally speaking, work reports like this were typically done at night. However, because Jiang Chen had to stay in the apocalypse for a few days, Ayesha loaned her EP to her and he conducted interdimensional communication with the chip designed by Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
It was time to get off work and Xia Shiyu finished the work at hand. After they discussed the important matters, they began to chat.</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen talking about the apocalypse, Xia Shiyu made a request.</br>
</br>
"Can you show me what's outside the window? I've always been very curious about the apocalypse you talked about... What kind of world is it? Ah, of course, if it's not convenient, then that's okay." Xia Shiyu suddenly somewhat regretted her request.</br>
</br>
She was certainly curious. Since Jiang Chen confessed to her the secrets of this world, she had always been very curious. What kind of war, in just three years, had turned the jewels of the human civilization for 22nd centuries into ruins?</br>
</br>
However, she was hesitant because she wasn't certain if Jiang Chen could present everything in this world that only belonged to him. Although she wouldn't be disappointed by a rejection, she was very worried that Jiang Chen would overcomplicate the issue...</br>
</br>
</br>
Women in love often overcomplicated things. Jiang Chen didn't think too much about it at all, let alone the fact that there was nothing to hide.</br>
</br>
"There's nothing inconvenient about that, but there isn't much to be seen here." Jiang Chen pointed the camera on the watch outside the window. "The weather is nice today. You can see the blue sky and white clouds. Outside the wall of this mansion is Fishbone Base. Now that all the mutants and zombies in Wanghai have been cleared out, you can only see mutants in Jia City. If you're interested, I'll bring you some video footage back if I get an opportunity."</br>
</br>
"Fishbone Base? That's a real strange name." Xia Shiyu snorted and giggled, covering her mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also laughed. "It's from a canned food brand. It gives me feelings of nostalgia." The experience of using sandpaper to grind the outer packaging was certainly nostalgic.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen looked out the window and remembered the "hard times", softness embraced the back of his head. Two arms hugged him from behind.</br>
</br>
"What are you doing?" Sun Jiao's voice rang beside his ears and she looked at the holographic screen with interest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was just about to say that he was on the phone. But then he felt a murderous gaze which locked on him across the dimension.</br>
</br>
He involuntarily shuddered and suddenly realized that it wasn't Ayesha who was on the phone with him...</br>
</br>
"Hello," Sun Jiao said hello with a smirk. Her eyes scanned across Xia Shiyu's chest, and her smirk became even more obvious.</br>
</br>
This move naturally didn't escape Xia Shiyu's eyes. When she looked at Sun Jiao's 36D then thought of her body only bigger than Ayesha, her self-esteem was critically damaged.</br>
</br>
Even if Jiang Chen had confessed to her that he had a "family" in this world not smaller than in the modern world, she still felt jealous and her vinegar jar (1) tipped when she saw another woman embracing him.</br>
</br>
"She... is Sun Jiao, the woman I mentioned before." Jiang Chen introduced her to Xia Shiyu, feeling numb, but he couldn't think of things to say.</br>
</br>
Looking at the awkward expression on Jiang Chen's face, Sun Jiao suddenly understood. With the same smirk, she moved her face closer to him and embraced him. "Dear, why are you so nervous?"</br>
</br>
The cold and elegant beauty was getting colder and colder.</br>
</br>
"I'll ask you when you come back! Hmph!"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head and turned off the holographic screen. He looked at Sun Jiao, who sat down on the sofa making an innocent expression, and sighed.</br>
</br>
"You've created a big problem for me."</br>
</br>
"You have to kneel on the washboard (2)?" Sun Jiao mocked.</br>
</br>
"Not that bad... Where did you learn this? There's no such thing as a washboard here."</br>
</br>
"From some novels; don't worry about these details." Sun Jiao leaned back on the sofa and crossed her legs leisurely. "Let's put the non-substantial things aside and focus on business. I've done everything you asked me to do. The Aerospace Science and Technology Research Institute has already established the 'T3 Power Armor Gravity-free Environment Automation Production Project'. Based on the space station specifications you provided, the production link is expected to be divided into five modules, completed by five different space stations with different functions."</br>
</br>
"How long will it take to produce results?" Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao smiled. "It won't be long; the technology is available. There are a few experts in Camp 027 who worked on outer space production modules before the war. Jiang Lin said the prototype will be available at the end of the month at the latest."</br>
</br>
(1) Vinegar Jar – Describing women who easily feel jealous.</br>
</br>
(2) Kneel on the washboard – A washboard is a tool to wash clothes before the invention of the washing machine. A washboard has a rough surface. Therefore, when the husband makes a mistake, the wife may force the husband to kneel on the washboard as a punishment.</br>

</br>
As the outer space development market gradually heated up, the industrial capacity of Celestial City also increased to an astounding level. Especially in the heavy industry sector as asteroid mining provided the heavy industry sector with raw materials. Wireless power transmission almost reduced the cost of electricity to the minimum. Other than the high cost of the space station itself, there would be no other place on Earth more suitable for the development of the heavy industry sector.</br>
</br>
In less than a year, Celestial's production capacity already caught onto the New Malaysia Special District and the Ange Island Industrial Park. It was expected to surpass the combined production capacity of the two industrial parks in the next six months.</br>
</br>
Just half a month ago, Future Mining successfully achieved smelting and production of multiple types of steel in the space environment, such as Grade A, B, and C. At the same time, Future Heavy Industries also completed the integration of the technology provided by Jiang Chen and made breakthroughs in the two technical difficulties of "molybdenum neural connection device" and "power armor core chip", taking it from theory to production.</br>
</br>
It was now possible to build a production line of T3 Power Armor in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Backed by the resources of the modern world, the production and assembly technology of the apocalypse, the factors that restricted the production of power armors would no longer exist. When power armors stepped down from the assembly line, Jiang Chen could already see terrified and shocked faces.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen returned to the modern world, he planned to start a large-scale expansion plan. The proposed expansion would turn the Power Armor Brigade into two Power Armor Divisions and two Mechanized Infantry Divisions! The focus of research and development of power armor would also be shifted from land to outer space, to Gauss Rifles which were more suitable for low-gravity environments, and to replace the existing aerodynamic engine with an ion propulsion engine.</br>
</br>
Days passed one by one, and soon, it was June 13.</br>
</br>
With the Outer Space Security Summit held by Celestial Trade approaching its start date, the top ten foreign ministers of the UA, Hua, Russia, Britain, France, Frankberg, Nippon, Arabia all arrived in Coro City. The president of Xin and the foreign minister held a grand welcoming ceremony at the airport.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade and the Xin government invested a lot of effort to make this meeting between the ten countries happen. The drones and the police were dispatched together, and the patrol frequency doubled to strengthen the security of Coro City, which was already extremely safe. Celestial Trade even mobilized a special combat brigade from the New Moon Island military base and temporarily deployed it in downtown Coro to ensure the safety of representatives.</br>
</br>
The venue of the conference was set in the new parliament building in Coro, and the hotel where the representatives were staying was the Hilton next to the parliament building. The wealthy Celestial Trade directly booked out the entire building for a week. Foreign ministers and senior officials lived on the top floors, and soldiers with kinetic skeletons filled the rest of the hotel.</br>
</br>
</br>
Everything was meant to show one thing:</br>
</br>
The importance Celestial Trade placed on this summit.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the emphasis on the topic to be discussed or the countries participating in the summit.</br>
</br>
A week before the summit, there was gossip and rumors about the topic of the summit. Some people claimed on social networking sites that the Outer Space Security Summit was likely related to the recent X2 bacteria in Finland. There were even people with more wild imaginations who linked the X2 bacteria with aliens, Area 51, the moon landing conspiracy theory, and Celestial Trade's Mars Colonization Project together to describe X2 bacteria as Martians' plan to fight back.</br>
</br>
Driven by public opinion, this summit naturally attracted media attention.</br>
</br>
However, the major media were resentful to discover that the content of the summit discussion wouldn't be made public. Whether the content would be made available was also a topic surrounding the summit.</br>
</br>
Everyone wanted to get first-hand information about the summit. Everyone wanted to be in the storm eye of the controversy and win the envy of their global peers. However, the voices from governments was rarely consistent, and the media couldn't obtain any information.</br>
</br>
What kind of issue made Celestial Trade so cautious?</br>
</br>
Not only the reporters outside the Hilton, but all those who were interested in this meeting all shared the same speculations.</br>
</br>
Two days before the summit, Jiang Chen took Lin Lin's report on X2 bacteria and finally returned to the modern world. Originally, he planned to return yesterday, but a small delay in Lin Lin's research forced him to delay his return by one day.</br>
</br>
Returning to Coro Island by boat, Jiang Chen didn't go home but went to the Presidential Palace.</br>
</br>
When he arrived at the Presidential Palace, Zhang Yaping was enjoying the presence of the Frankberg foreign minister as the two joked and laughed. Jiang Chen didn't disturb the pair. Instead, he followed President Zhang's secretary and sat down in the lounge. He slowly sipped on his coffee while he waited for the end of the informal diplomatic conference between the two countries.</br>
</br>
He didn't have to wait for long. Soon, he heard footsteps.</br>
</br>
"You finally stepped outside." Zhang Yaping sat down on the sofa opposite Jiang Chen. With a weary expression, he asked his secretary: "Pour me a cup of water. No tea, just hot water."</br>
</br>
The senior foreign ministers of ten countries visited and Zhang Yaping didn't have time for a break this week. What made it worse was that the Outer Space Security Summit would start soon, but Jiang Chen suddenly started to play hide and seek with him.</br>
</br>
Although it wasn't the first time he disappeared, it was the first time before such a major event.</br>
</br>
"There have been some recent developments." Jiang Chen smiled and ambiguously skipped the question. "You did a great job."</br>
</br>
"That depends on how you interpret the word 'great'." Zhang Yaping shook his head helplessly. He took the water from the secretary, whispered a thank you, then signaled her to leave. He then looked to Jiang Chen. "Every country's foreign minister is asking me one thing. Guess what is it?"</br>
</br>
"Extraterrestrial civilization?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Zhang Yaping sipped the water and soothed his throat. In a half-joking tone, he said, "Everyone wants to know what tricks you're playing, whether extraterrestrial civilization is indeed a thing or whether it's just a smoke bomb. Of course, the foreign ministers are most concerned about the steps you've taken in the study of extraterrestrial civilizations. Kerry also threatened me with a warning, saying that anything about unilaterally liaising with extraterrestrial civilizations without the consent of the United Nations would be regarded as a provocation of war by the UA... what a joke."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping shook his head and put the cup aside.</br>
</br>
"Aliens? He's seen too many Hollywood blockbusters."</br>
</br>
Although Zhang Yaping had already seen the agenda of the Outer Space Security Summit, he didn't take extraterrestrial civilizations seriously. It was to be expected since Jiang Chen never disclosed the details of Celestial Trade's space activities to him.</br>
</br>
Looking at Zhang Yaping, Jiang Chen had a strange expression.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping noticed Jiang Chen's strange look. He stopped and asked, "What's wrong? Was it something I said?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing, it's my bad."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment and looked at the confused Zhang Yaping. "What if I told you that the extraterrestrial civilization we mentioned in the invitation... is not a joke?"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
At six o'clock in the evening, a black car was parked downstairs at the Hilton.</br>
</br>
The reporters who sensed blood all focused on the vehicle that rolled in. After they confirmed the license plate number, they immediately surrounded the vehicle.</br>
</br>
The security guards waiting at the entrance of the hotel were prepared, and they formed a wall to block the reporters as well as passers-by and tourists curious about the commotion.</br>
</br>
Frankberg Foreign Minister Stein, who had just finished his visit from Xin's presidential palace, got out of the car and walked to the main entrance of the hotel. The reporters desperately tried to stuff microphones below the guards' armpits and above the guards' shoulders, in an attempt to reach Stein to obtain some more information about the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit in two days.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Stein, did you just go to Xin's presidential palace?"</br>
</br>
"Will Frankberg and Xin strengthen their cooperation in space?"</br>
</br>
"Are informal diplomatic talks with Xin at this point related to the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit?"</br>
</br>
"Are the rumors about extraterrestrial civilization true? People have the right to know the truth..."</br>
</br>
Stein was growing impatient. He raised his hand and gestured to the reporters in front of him to form a path.</br>
</br>
"Before the summit, we aren't very familiar with the specific details of the discussion. The Frankberg government will disclose the details of the Outer Space Security Summit at the first available point in time if the outcome of the discussion can be disclosed."</br>
</br>
After a short explanation, Stein whispered a few words to his assistant.</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded and the six bodyguards surrounding Stein formed a human shield in front of him. Under complaints from reporters, the security guards of the hotel formed a path in the crowd and escorted the foreign minster inside.</br>
</br>
Arriving by elevator to the floor where the Frankberg delegation was staying, Stein went straight to his presidential suite.</br>
</br>
"If there are no big issues, don't come in and bother me. I'll will eat dinner at about seven o'clock. Request a hotel's waiter to send it up." At the door, he stopped and instructed his assistant behind him.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The assistant nodded.</br>
</br>
Stein closed the door and hung his suit on the hanger. He went to the sofa in the living room and sat down. He took out a satellite phone from his pocket. After pressing a few numbers, he called the Frankberg Presidential Palace.</br>
</br>
"How's the meeting with the Xin President?"</br>
</br>
Stein sighed when he heard Evelyn's question.</br>
</br>
"I didn't get any useful information; I could feel they're also confused. I even have a feeling that President Zhang has learned less than we learned."</br>
</br>
"He's a puppet after all?" Evelyn smiled.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Stein leaned on the sofa. "Celestial Trade completely excluded him from the core. Rather than acting as a president, he is more like a butler who takes care of the man's backyard. I tried to contact Celestial Trade's Space Department CEO, Kelvin, but he has no intention of holding informal talks with us before the summit."</br>
</br>
</br>
"And then he pushed you onto Zhang Yaping?" Evelyn smiled.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Stein nodded.</br>
</br>
"What about other countries?"</br>
</br>
"It should be the same." Stein shrugged. "Of all the countries that are participating in the summit, our bilateral relationship with Xin should be the best. They have no reason to treat us differently."</br>
</br>
Evelyn couldn't help but ask: "In your experience, why do you think they are so mysterious?"</br>
</br>
"If they're not faking this, then it must be some really astonishing information."</br>
</br>
"What do you think will be?" Evelyn asked.</br>
</br>
"Extraterrestrial civilization. It was written on the invitation letter." Stein laughed.</br>
</br>
"Be more specific."</br>
</br>
"More specific..." Stein sighed with a headache. After some contemplating, he shook his head. "I can't guess; I don't dare to guess. The only thing I'm certain about is that it isn't something good."</br>
</br>
For the exploration of extraterrestrial civilizations, almost all countries indicated at least publicly that they would share all "important information", but almost everyone knew this was impossible.</br>
</br>
For two cultures without any similarities, often the first impression determined everything.</br>
</br>
Stein asked himself if Frankberg was the first to get in touch with the extraterrestrial civilization, the first thing they would think would be to not disclose the news to other countries or even tell their allies. They would liaise with the extraterrestrial civilization alone. They would make the other party recognize their own values, recognize that Frankberg was the representative of Earth's civilization, and try their best to monopolize all channels of communication with the extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
The abnormal behavior of Celestial Trade only meant one thing.</br>
</br>
They encountered an issue that they couldn't resolve alone.</br>
</br>
After leaving the Presidential Palace, Jiang Chen went straight to the parked Luer.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly remembered Zhang Yaping's sullen face and burst into laughter.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at him curiously when she heard the inexplicable laughter.</br>
</br>
"Did something good happen?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing; I just suddenly wanted to laugh." Jiang Chen coughed and changed the subject.</br>
</br>
He was the president, after all. It wouldn't be nice to laugh at him like this, especially since it was his negligence for not disclosing the information to Zhang Yaping. It was understandable to not be able to digest such a large amount of information.</br>
</br>
It took half an hour before Jiang Chen barely made X2 bacteria and extraterrestrial civilizations clear to him. As for how much Zhang Yaping took in or what he felt afterward, Jiang Chen wasn't sure</br>
</br>
The car drove onto the highway. This time, Jiang Chen didn't do anything scandalous in the car and enjoyed the beautiful night. But then, the little girl who drove suddenly smiled and spoke softly.</br>
</br>
"After you go back, you better woo Sister Shiyu. She's still bothered by what happened the day before yesterday."</br>
</br>
"...you really gave me a problem." Jiang Chen's pleasant expression suddenly turned sour. If Ayesha hadn't mentioned this, he would've almost forgotten about it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen got a headache when he thought about the cold tone from the last call.</br>
</br>
"Is it difficult?" Ayesha said softly, "In fact, Sister Shiyu is easy to woo. If you use some sweet talk, she will soon forget any unpleasantness. While she always looks cold, she's actually more eager than anyone else..."</br>
</br>
Ayesha's beautiful lips curved up again.</br>
</br>
She knew Jiang Chen could guess what she didn't say.</br>
</br>
"Where did you learn these things from?" Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha, surprised.</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head and carefully thought for a moment, but it was a specious answer.</br>
</br>
"Feelings?"</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1086: Outer Space Security Summi</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In order to leave time for Jiang Chen, Ayesha used the excuse of parking to not go inside with him.</br>
</br>
The lights in the living room were off, but under the pristine moonlight, he could still see clearly. After he took off his shoes, Jiang Chen had just entered before a chilling sight immediately locked onto him from the sofa in the living room.</br>
</br>
He could smell the strong vinegar.</br>
</br>
He selectively ignored the coldness and sat next to Xia Shiyu with a grin. He reached and grabbed her around the waist. Xia Shiyu threw a temper and moved her waist, but she didn't escape from his embrace.</br>
</br>
In fact, Ayesha's reminder wasn't needed at all. Jiang Chen discovered long ago that behind the cold mask was just a girl's clumsy protective color. When she fell in love with a person, what was buried behind the cold mask were emotions more passionate than anyone.</br>
</br>
In a few minutes, the tipped vinegar jar fell for his sweet talk. Xia Shiyu's pouting mouth gradually turned into a curvature before she finally giggled.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, women must be wooed.</br>
</br>
Seeing that smile, Jiang Chen was finally relieved.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu leaned her face against his chest and enjoyed this quiet moment.</br>
</br>
Her breathing gradually became calmer. Just when Jiang Chen thought Xia Shiyu was asleep, her muttering came from his chest.</br>
</br>
"Umm..." Biting her lower lip, Xia Shiyu embarrassedly whispered, "Is her chest real?"</br>
</br>
"What?" Jiang Chen tried to process that for a second.</br>
</br>
"I mean, isn't there a lot of advanced technology in the future? For example, genetic modification... Did her chest become so big in any special way?" Xia Shiyu blushed, embarrassed by her wild imagination.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, women loved to compare. Although she accepted that Jiang Chen had a woman in that world, she cared about that woman's 36D considering that Xia Shiyu just had a B.</br>
</br>
Regretfully, Jiang Chen told her with certainty that the 36D was real, but this certainly wasn't the answer Xia Shiyu wanted to hear.</br>
</br>
After a moment of indulging, Jiang Chen made a serious face and said, "To be honest, considering race restrictions, it wouldn't be so big naturally. But..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen dragged out his tone.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu caught the bait.</br>
</br>
She hesitated for a moment, slightly furrowing her brows, confused. "But?"</br>
</br>
"There are still secrets."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyes lit up and she sat up.</br>
</br>
"What secrets?!"</br>
</br>
"That, of course, is ... a special massage technique."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought that Xia Shiyu would blush, spit out "pervert" and walk away.</br>
</br>
However, he guessed the beginning correctly, not the end. Xia Shiyu looked away with her face even redder, but she didn't get up and leave. The silence lasted for a long time between the duo. Through the moonlight, Jiang Chen saw her hand trembling before finally pressing on her own chest.</br>
</br>
Looking down, Xia Shiyu whispered.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then, then please..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
This palm-sized country once again caught the world's attention with the upcoming Outer Space Security Summit. Every day, countless reporters gathered around Future Building, the parliament building, the Hilton and formed a scene unique to Xin.</br>
</br>
Just as the community debated the summit topic, it was finally the day of the summit.</br>
</br>
On the morning of June 15, CBS, CCA, V, Reuters, Asahi News, French TV and thousands of media outlets from all over the world and tens of thousands of reporters stood outside the yellow line and gathered around the parliament building, the crowd even spilled onto the road.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Coro City's magnetic levitation road prevented a traffic jam. The crowd even made people question if the representatives could squeeze in.</br>
</br>
The media set up their cameras. Just as they were ready to report news first-hand, Celestial Trade's move made them completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Ten heavy-duty helicopters soared from the above, and they stopped at the open space inside the yellow line. The soldiers in kinetic skeletons rushed out from the helicopters and blocked the yellow line.</br>
</br>
It was around half a brigade of forces which immediately made the reporters wishing to break the rules reconsider their choices.</br>
</br>
After the forces were deployed, the heavy helicopters left in series. Eight small helicopters landed. When they saw the people coming out of the helicopter, the reporters were once again dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Stein waved at the reporters, fixed his collar, and walked into the parliament building with his delegation.</br>
</br>
Eight helicopters continued to take off and flew to the roof of the Hilton. They appeared to be transporting representatives of other countries. The representatives didn't plan to squeeze through the crowd and decided to go directly from the air.</br>
</br>
Stein extended his right hand as he walked to Jiang Chen with enthusiasm. They shook hands.</br>
</br>
"It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen. It's been really difficult to see you."</br>
</br>
"Just in the past few days, I've had a busy schedule. To make your trip worthwhile, I haven't rested for a day." Jiang Chen shook Stein's hand.</br>
</br>
"Haha, now I feel better after your explanation." Stein smiled heartily and shook his watch. "Half an hour before we start, could you satisfy our curiosity in advance?"</br>
</br>
"Regarding the details of this summit, we've compiled two versions—one paper document and one electronic file which are now on the table. If you want to know as soon as possible, you better go in quickly." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
With a surprised expression, Stein raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Yes? Then I really have to hurry."</br>
</br>
"Please." Jiang Chen made a gesture and handed the Frankberg delegation to the conference officer waiting on the side.</br>
</br>
After he that the contents of the summit discussion were all sorted out in the documents, Stein didn't have the mind to engage in small talk with Jiang Chen anymore. Under the guidance of the conference officer, he quickly entered the venue with his delegation.</br>
</br>
In fifteen minutes, all the delegations of the ten countries were seated, and the gate of the parliament building was closed. Countless curious eyes were also closed off from the building. With the remaining fifteen minutes of free time, representatives quickly scanned the documents in their hands.</br>
</br>
Fifteen minutes later, the lights in the venue were slightly dimmed. On the holographic screen in the center, Future Group and Celestial Trade's logo appeared. Shocked, surprised, and dismissive, the representatives put away the documents and turned their focus on Jiang Chen in front of the screen.</br>
</br>
As the organizer of the summit and the representative of Xin, the summit that was comprised of the most senior diplomats officially kicked off.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1087: What do you mean by only?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It wasn't the first time Jiang Chen had spoke in front of an audience, but it was his first time in front of such a high-profile audience.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath, and cleared his mind. With all eyes gathered on him, he slowly said, "There may be doubts in the minds of everyone here, whether it's regarding the topic to be discussed or the summit itself."</br>
</br>
"I don't have much to say here. Taking the literal meaning, the theme of this summit is security."</br>
</br>
"It's not security between countries and not related to any territorial disputes, sovereignty disputes, or politics. Don't show impatience; I'm not joking. Everyone, I'm not an alarmist, but we're on a fine line between life and death."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that when he said this, there were whispers. From the closest representatives, he was able to clearly see their disbelief.</br>
</br>
It was just like he said something ridiculous.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen completely expected this reaction. Although evidence about the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and acts of aggression were summarized in the documents, the audience wasn't the director of NASA or ESA but senior foreign minister of each country, after all.</br>
</br>
They weren't experts in the area. They wouldn't take everything Jiang Chen said for truth. It would take time to verify.</br>
</br>
After a moment's pause, Jiang Chen went on.</br>
</br>
"Just a month ago, Celestial Trade Space Department discovered an interesting phenomenon when observing extraterrestrial planets and exploring extraterrestrial civilizations."</br>
</br>
The image on the holographic screen turned into a star map, and in the center of the star map was the Gliese 581 galaxy, 2 degrees north of the Libra-β.</br>
</br>
"Gliese 581g. According to our researchers, the planet has a 90% chance of life."</br>
</br>
The UA delegation couldn't sit still. The man sitting next to Secretary of State Kerry pressed the button next to the microphone and requested to speak.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mind that his speech was interrupted and gestured for him to continue.</br>
</br>
The man stood up and fixed his microphone, then he put his hands on the table and looked at Jiang Chen with his eyebrows furrowed. He kept an oppressive posture and said, "NASA long ago conducted a detail observation on the Gliese 581 galaxy fifteen years ago and reached the conclusion that this blue-green pattern may contain life."</br>
</br>
Benjamin stood up straight, shrugged and said with a mocking tone, "But your researcher apparently didn't pay attention to the journal 'Science.' Even as a layman, I know that four years ago, a paper published by the University of Pennsylvania researchers in Science pointed out that the planet didn't actually exist and it was a color ray error caused by the stellar magnetic field burst of the 581d."</br>
</br>
"If you want to divert the attention of the international community to your ignorance in outer space, you may wish to utilize a more realistic excuse and not blame aliens."</br>
</br>
</br>
When Benjamin said this, the venue became rattled.</br>
</br>
Although the aerospace technology of Celestial Trade was indeed powerful, the UA was also an established aerospace power. While they might be slightly inferior in terms of hardware, their soft power couldn't be underestimated.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade just said that there was life on Gliese 581g, yet the representative of UA immediately stood up and slapped his face. If the UA proved that the planet didn't exist four years ago, then why did they come here for a meeting? To listen to nonsense from Celestial Trade?!</br>
</br>
Anger was boiling among the representatives.</br>
</br>
After his speech ended, Benjamin didn't sit down immediately. Kerry, next to him, crossed his arms and looked at Jiang Chen. He wanted to see how he defended himself in irritation.</br>
</br>
Stein raised an eyebrow and put his ballpoint pen on the table. He was very curious about how Jiang Chen, who was exposed on the spot, would defend himself.</br>
</br>
The Hua Foreign Minister sat in silence, the Russian Foreign Minister and his deputy exchanged looks. The French Representative began to check his watch impatiently...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's calm reaction surprised Secretary of State Kerry. It was too calm that almost made what just happened boring.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded at the diplomat. He cleared his throat and swept his eyes across Kerry. He turned to the entire venue and raised his hand to indicate for the representatives to be settled.</br>
</br>
After the venue once again become silent, he raised one finger and slowly said to the UA delegation, "First of all, let me correct a mistake you made. Gliese 581g is green, and there is no blue-green pattern at all. As for why, I'll talk about that later."</br>
</br>
"Does this have anything to do with it?" Benjamin requested to speak after he heard Jiang Chen's argument. This time, he didn't wait for Jiang Chen's acknowledgment. He stood up and sneered in disdain. "No matter what color it is, it doesn't exist—"</br>
</br>
"Furthermore-" Jiang Chen interrupted him and raised a second finger. It was the middle finger next to the index finger. This time, his tone carried a hint of indifference. "Do we need to pay attention to what papers you've written?"</br>
</br>
Kerry suddenly looked agitated. Delegations from other countries also focused on this side with more or less an eagerness to watch the scene unfold.</br>
</br>
Yes, with Celestial Trade's technology which could colonize Mars, was it necessary to worry about who published a paper on the planet in 'Science'? It was like a person soon graduating from high school needing to consult with what someone wrote in an elementary school essay?</br>
</br>
However, this unadorned statement made it impossible for the UA delegates to sit still. Jiang Chen's statement wasn't euphemistic at all. It raised a giant middle finger to the UA aerospace practitioners by saying: "Everyone here is rubbish".</br>
</br>
Benjamin opened his mouth without a show of expression, but anyone could guess the embarrassment on his mind.</br>
</br>
"I just mentioned that Gliese 581g is green, and now I will prove it to you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knocked twice on the touchpad of the podium, and soon, the image on the holographic screen behind him was cut onto an enlarged star map.</br>
</br>
The center of the star map was locked on the galaxy 2 degrees north of the Libra­-β. The white box locked the orange-red star then continued to zoom. The lens focused on that star until the red star filled half the screen.</br>
</br>
Stein narrowed his eyes as the light was too bright. However, this discomfort didn't last long, and soon, the star on the screen was dimmed as if some kind of filter was added.</br>
</br>
The light continued to decay until there were several black spots visible to the naked eye around the star.</br>
</br>
Benjamin's eyes almost popped out as he stared at the image in front of him</br>
</br>
He already knew what Jiang Chen was doing, but it was impossible!</br>
</br>
Even if he was a layman, he knew it was absolutely impossible to directly capture a planet image 20.5 light-years away. Only stars could be directly observed by telescopes. Most of the planets outside the solar system required various techniques such as spectroscopy to measure the planetary data, and then computers would be used to draw a rough concept map.</br>
</br>
To put it into perspective, it was easy for someone to see a light bulb hundreds of meters away, but it was impossible to see mosquitoes on the light bulb, no matter how powerful the telescope was. Even with a filter to dim the light, it was impossible to change the fact that the planet itself shouldn't shine!</br>
</br>
Are you kidding!</br>
</br>
Using computer animation to fool people?!</br>
</br>
Eyes locked onto the black dots with Gliese 581 as the background, Benjamin snarled in his heart.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen's nonchalant words shattered his fantasies.</br>
</br>
"It's almost at the limit. The optical observation resolution of Celestial City Astronomy Telescope can only observe up till this point. It might not be visible to the naked eye, but I can tell you with certainty that those pixels are indeed green."</br>
</br>
Only!</br>
</br>
What do you mean by only?</br>
</br>
As soon as this statement came out, the audience was astounded.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1088"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1088: Not Just Bugs</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Do we need to pay attention to what papers you've written?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's nonchalant words were a slap to the aggressive Benjamin. The image that appeared next on the holographic screen was a slap to the aerospace science community.</br>
</br>
Even Secretary of State Kerry couldn't sit still anymore.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, at this time, Nippon requested to speak and questioned Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
"Even if you could prove that there's life on Gliese 581g, it only shows that we aren't alone in the universe. From your tone, you seem to be certain that the extraterrestrial creature on Gliese 581g will be a threat? Can you prove this? According to our point of view, it's possible that those unintelligent creatures might not have even formed a civilization yet, let alone cross the distance of 20 light years."</br>
</br>
The question from the Nippon representative was the concern of most of the representatives. Based on the analysis Celestial Trade provided, the solar wind of Gliese 581 was several times stronger than the solar wind on Earth, and Gliese 581 has no magnetic field protection, which meant that the entire Gliese 581g planet was being constantly bombarded by EMP. Even if those arthropods could breed a civilization, they could only develop into a society similar to ants and bees at most.</br>
</br>
They were just bugs.</br>
</br>
"The United Kingdom agrees with the argument put forward by the Nippon representative. Even if we might have a war with them someday in the future, it's definitely a colonial war on their territory." British diplomats got up and snarled, "Are you that worried?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed when he heard the two representatives' opinions.</br>
</br>
"It's a pity that X2 bacteria didn't seem to teach you a lesson."</br>
</br>
The British diplomat's face suddenly turned red.</br>
</br>
The fiasco in Finnish tundra became a stain that the British army couldn't erase. Although the nest was eradicated with the help of Celestial Trade's space-based weapons and Power Amor Brigade and the British finally regained some dignity, the brigade commander sent to Finland was still dismissed due to improper calculations of enemy strength. Even the British Prime Minister was almost impeached because of the high casualty figures.</br>
</br>
As a result, the X2 bacteria had forever become a pain in the hearts of the British.</br>
</br>
"As for proof... the last few pages of the documents in your hands record the comparative analysis of the X2 bacterial DNA intercepted fragments and partial fragments of the T-virus RNA. I believe that anyone with some biology background will find the comparison to be unusual. This is very easy to verify; I believe that you all obtained samples of the nest."</br>
</br>
"You mean that X2 bacteria and T virus are works of an extraterrestrial civilization?" Kerry frowned. "How did they do it?"</br>
</br>
"This is another focus of this meeting." Jiang Chen scanned around the delegates in the room, then he pulled out a black sphere and gently placed it beside the microphone. "Have you ever heard of the Golden Apple of the Rothschild family?"</br>
</br>
</br>
When they saw the black sphere placed on the podium, the accompanying diplomats except for the foreign ministers were confused. They didn't understand why Jiang Chen suddenly placed a "golf ball" on the podium and were more confused about why he suddenly mentioned the word "Golden Apple."</br>
</br>
Obviously, all countries adopted a confidential stance toward the Golden Apple; only the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Secretary of State would have this information. Otherwise, there would be no chance to learn more about the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
That was also very understandable. After all, the source of the Golden Apple wasn't the clearest; it came from the notorious 7th Institute. Any country with a strong human rights code must avoid having a stain on their image. While they certainly did experiments, they must be done in secrecy!</br>
</br>
What's more was that the item was the key to communicating with the future, and its impact on society was still unknown. For various reasons, countries all chose to remain confidential and hide the Golden Apple from public view.</br>
</br>
Many people knew Rothschild Bank was suspected of supporting human experiments, but they knew nothing about what the 7th Institute experimented on.</br>
</br>
"The Golden Apple is my next focus." Jiang Chen scanned all the foreign ministers. Word by word, he said, "This has never been used as a time machine and this has never been used to communicate with the future, or else, the Freemasonry would never have lost."</br>
</br>
"As for what it is?" Jiang Chen picked up the Golden Apple and played with it in his hand. He grinned. "Think about it. What did Carmen bring before he died? Why did the nest appear in Finland, not Frankberg?"</br>
</br>
The audience was rattled again once again. This time, it wasn't because of shock but because of panic. It seemed like Jiang Chen was not holding the Golden Apple, but holding an atomic bomb in his hand.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen wasn't explicit, no one was too stupid to not understand the connections. Everyone knew what he suggested.</br>
</br>
Golden Apple was the culprit of the birth of the nest!</br>
</br>
And now, it us in the hands of a madman!</br>
</br>
And he is playing with it?</br>
</br>
Kerry, Stein, and other foreign ministers were sweating profusely. When they thought that the Golden Apples that were smuggled into their own countries were being played with by the group of researchers unfearful of death, their hearts pounded. They couldn't wait to make phone calls back home.</br>
</br>
The world witnessed the terrifying power of the nest. Fortunately, the last time the nest appeared in the tundra in northern Finland. If it appeared near a major metropolis, the consequences would be simply unimaginable!</br>
</br>
Among the people present, the most nervous was the foreign minister of Hua.</br>
</br>
With the population density of the country, it would be a disaster.</br>
</br>
Even if this matter was still inconclusive, at least the research site must be moved to the desert to prevent the worst from happening. As for how the Golden Apple caused the X2 bacterial incident, it could be a subject for future study.</br>
</br>
Studying the expressions of the representatives, Jiang Chen already knew that he fulfilled half of the goals he set.</br>
</br>
He trusted that the information he provided was daunting enough. The next step was to wait for the foreign ministers to bring back the news of the summit and discuss it domestically. Then the heads of states would sit together to finalize what was accepted by all.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen admitted that he didn't have the aura to make everyone swear allegiance to him. He also never expected to rely on a summit to make a strong impression so that the heads of state would bow to worship him. They would form the Earth Alliance, and all human beings would be united...</br>
</br>
Throughout the history of the world, there had never been a unity without blood.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen was already prepared for war. He was busy preparing for the T3 Power Armor production line at Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
Of course, if they could reach a consensus peacefully, that would be the best.</br>
</br>
Now, he still had one last card in his hand. Seeing that the representatives couldn't sit still, Jiang Chen was also debating if he should play the card now.</br>
</br>
"We can set an example in destroying Golden Apples. In addition, I have a report here." Jiang Chen shook the papers in his hand. "You can study it after your return."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The meeting lasted for three full hours, and the summit's agenda today finally came to an end.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen announced the conclusion of the summit, the foreign ministers left the venue at the fastest speed after they received the documents from Celestial Trade. For them, the most important task on-hand now was to communicate with their leaders and pass back the information they received.</br>
</br>
The reporters waiting outside the parliament building were bound to be disappointed. The foreign ministers didn't give them any opportunity to interview. They stepped into the helicopters and immediately departed.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the summit's agenda wasn't to be disclosed to the public.</br>
</br>
At least not today.</br>
</br>
The reporters outside the parliament building put away their cameras and left the scene one after another. Although there were reluctant, they now accepted the fact that they waited for nothing.</br>
</br>
However, many reporters still noticed an unusual expression from the foreign ministers.</br>
</br>
Their expressions were all serious and somber.</br>
</br>
Or anxious?</br>
</br>
The reporters who noticed this were contemplating the reason. They were trying to dig out valuable information to get back to their bosses.</br>
</br>
What made the foreign ministers so anxious?</br>
</br>
Instincts told them that there was a lot of information hidden, but they wouldn't ever know that it was because of the document Jiang Chen gave the ministers in the end.</br>
</br>
It was an astronomical observation report.</br>
</br>
After confirming signs of life on Gliese 581g, Kelvin took the astronomical observation team to conduct a carpet search on the space outside the Gliese 581 galaxy. Based on Jiang Chen's opinion, they focused on the observations of the asteroid belts outside the stellar system.</br>
</br>
Soon, they found something that became scary after facts were obtained from those asteroid belts.</br>
</br>
Among the asteroid belts between the Earth and Gliese 581g, they observed an unnaturally formed vacuum...</br>
</br>
Two days passed since the first round of consultation and it had been two days since the document was sent to the UA.</br>
</br>
On June 17th, in the conference room of NASA's headquarters, a bunch of bureaucrats who rarely visited gathered there. Even the President and the Minister of Defense made a visit which surprised NASA.</br>
</br>
Even though NASA had recently gained some attention because of the popularity of aerospace projects, rarely did the top officials all visit together. This scene was only possible during an era of an arms race.</br>
</br>
"Do you need a cup of coffee?"</br>
</br>
"No." Hill shook her head with a sullen face, and the aides sitting next to her no longer spoke.</br>
</br>
It was the day of the results. Although they could've waited in their office, after they heard such shocking facts, how could they sit still?</br>
</br>
Just then, the door of the conference room was pushed open and Bolden hurried in.</br>
</br>
</br>
A dozen eyes gathered on him. Bolden took a deep breath and threw the documents in his arms on the conference table, working up the courage to disclose the results.</br>
</br>
"The observation results are out."</br>
</br>
"What are the results?" Hill immediately asked while constantly praying in her heart that the outcome with a possibility of one in ten thousand wasn't a reality. However, she knew that would just be self-deception. The bitter smile on Bolden's face already explained many problems.</br>
</br>
"The data mostly matched with the data provided by Celestial Trade," Bolden said.</br>
</br>
Hill was silent, and the entire conference room was silent.</br>
</br>
They were previously optimistic. After all, with the existing astronomical observation means, it was impossible to carry out such detailed mapping. Many people even wondered if this was false information fabricated by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
However, while eyes could lie, the data couldn't.</br>
</br>
What's more, the other party even provided the detailed astronomical coordinates of the asteroid belt in the file and gave each country the opportunity for verification.</br>
</br>
The NASA researchers took the information and immediately used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the coordinate area. Although they couldn't create a star map as detailed, based on multiple sets of data obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA obtained the same result three times.</br>
</br>
A vacuum was observed in many asteroid belts between the Earth and Gliese 581g. It was obviously impractical to attribute this to nature's ingenuity, and there was only one possibility to explain this phenomenon.</br>
</br>
Something must've traveled through the belts.</br>
</br>
And the size and speed of that thing weren't small.</br>
</br>
"What do you think is the most likely explanation for the vacuum belt?" Hill gulped.</br>
</br>
"They're footprints," Bolden said with an ugly expression. "The footprints of a beast passing through snow."</br>
</br>
"I have the same opinion as you." Looked grimly, Carter felt the sweat in his palms.</br>
</br>
He admitted that he was a Star Wars fan when he was young, and his bedroom was filled with posters of Independence Day. He even imagined that he could be a pilot who drove a fighter jet into an alien spaceship. But he never thought that he would really become enemies with the aliens.</br>
</br>
As the Minister of Defense.</br>
</br>
"What do you think our odds are?" Hill looked at Carter.</br>
</br>
Carter didn't answer this question directly, but said with a forced smile, "What do you think about Iraq's chance of defeating us?"</br>
</br>
Hill also forced a smile.</br>
</br>
Nowadays, the aircraft carrier of the extraterrestrial civilization already set off. They couldn't even create a ship to "set sail". As for the battle on their home front? After witnessing the horror of the nest, who could work up the courage to face a swarm of mutants?</br>
</br>
"Compared to defeating them, I'm afraid it would be more practical to build a spaceship to escape." Bolden shook his head and ridiculed himself, but he didn't see that all eyes were focused on him again.</br>
</br>
"That's indeed an idea."</br>
</br>
"Yes, at least the President can be kept alive, just like Air Force One."</br>
</br>
"And we can bring some people to preserve seeds for the UA and even human civilization."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Seeing that everyone reacted to his own words and his colleagues had begun to discuss how to escape, Bolden was sweating as he quickly said, "Do you think Congress will approve this budget? Using the taxpayer's money to allow the president to run away? Those Congress members aren't crazy yet."</br>
</br>
"That's not necessary." Hill, who didn't speak until now, suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
Compared to Bolden who rose to his position as an astronaut, Hill's political sense was undoubtedly more sensitive. She knew who the Capital really served, and she knew who she should really please.</br>
</br>
"Congress Members don't want to die. The wealthy people on Wall Street don't want to die. We don't even have to raise money from Congress." Hill's Chief of Staff also followed.</br>
</br>
With a glimpse of hope appearing in their pupils, Hill and her own Chief of Staff continued: "We only need to set up a Noah's Ark Fund and promise investors a ticket."</br>
</br>
Everyone's eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
Yes!</br>
</br>
As long as they could convince those rich people to board the ship, how difficult would it be to raise funds?</br>
</br>
However, the door was pushed open, and Hill assistant ran inside.</br>
</br>
"What's so urgent?" While she wasn't pleased, Hill maintained a president's demeanor as she asked.</br>
</br>
"People-people are holding a demonstration in front of the Capitol. I'm hoping you can explain," the assistant said with sweat droplets all over his forehead.</br>
</br>
"Explain what?" Hill frowned.</br>
</br>
The assistant didn't answer. He opened the news page and handed the phone to Hill.</br>
</br>
When Hill took the phone, she already felt something wasn't right. But the instant she saw the headlines, her mood suddenly plunged to the bottom. Her wrinkles were even more visible because of anger. She was ready to curse out any second.</br>
</br>
"Despicable!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1090: Asserting Pressure</br>
</div></br>
</br>
[According to informed sources, Celestial City Space Department successfully observed extraterrestrial civilization on Gliese 581g, initially determined to be an arthropod carbon-based life. The civilization is capable of interplanetary navigation...]</br>
</br>
[On June 15th, the senior foreign ministers of ten countries gathered in Coro City to discuss countermeasures against aggression by extraterrestrial civilizations.]</br>
</br>
[According to the diplomat who didn't want to disclose his name and nationality, the foreign ministers at the summit voted on the resolution of 'Evacuation from the Solar System'. Although the resolution wasn't passed, it received a very high number of votes at the meeting...]</br>
</br>
[X2 bacteria in Finland were made by extraterrestrial civilization, and the nest was an alien aggression outpost?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen proposed to keep the meeting confidential, but he also leaked the news with mixed lies and truths.</br>
</br>
The reason was simple.</br>
</br>
He knew that once governments realized that it was impossible to defend against aggression, escapism would prevail among the elites.</br>
</br>
There was no need to analyze the reasons at all; the history of the apocalypse was a lesson in itself. Once these elites found themselves "with no chance of winning", presented with a seemingly "better" choice, it would be impossible to expect them to fight to the death.</br>
</br>
If they fought, it would be difficult to win.</br>
</br>
If they escaped, the probability of survival would be quite high.</br>
</br>
After all, it would still be a long time before Harmony's space colonization ship arrived. The elites ultimately decided what the GDP favored. There would be two separate technology trees depending on if a "battleship" or "escape ship" was favored.</br>
</br>
The most likely outcome was building a battleship while preparing for their escape path, and more effort would probably be spent on escape.</br>
</br>
It was the simplest decision to make. The elites must think for the elites. Despite the difference in culture, the principle was universal. Take the UA as an example. Even if the senior officials of the current Democratic Party, such as Hill, wouldn't live to see the day Harmony arrived, they still must have considerations for their own political career.</br>
</br>
The Wall Street consortiums that controlled the politics of the country also manipulated the military. Would they be happy to learn that their days were numbered? What would be the significance of the wealth they accumulated since the colonial era?</br>
</br>
If Hill dared to stop them from building a ship to escape, her scandals would make the headlines on the Washington Post the next day, followed by impeachment from the Congress up till the eventual re-election.</br>
</br>
Not only the UA, but also countries such as Hua and Russia all held the same view. The only difference between them was the level of formality.</br>
</br>
If they couldn't reach an agreement on the most fundamental issues, then this war against all mankind would be lost from the beginning.</br>
</br>
</br>
With public opinion stirred in a certain direction, the controversy continued to escalate. Not just Washington, London, Paris, but even Coro City saw protests. People held slogans and stepped out onto the streets to ask the government to disclose details of the Outer Space Security Summit.</br>
</br>
The focus of public opinion was nothing but two points.</br>
</br>
One was related to whether the T virus and the X2 bacteria were related to the aggression of the extraterrestrial civilization. The other was whether the representatives really discussed the construction of a Noah's Ark.</br>
</br>
Under pressure from public opinion, Secretary of State Kerry was the first to clarify.</br>
</br>
In front of the media, he repeatedly reiterated that the topic of extraterrestrial civilization was indeed discussed at the summit, but the resolution on an "escape from Solar System" wasn't discussed. Even if was discussed, the UA would never vote in favor of such a selfish resolution.</br>
</br>
However, simple clarification was obviously not enough to dispel the public's concerns. Everyone knew that politicians were the unruliest. They used a set of rhetoric in front of the public while another kind of rhetoric behind closed doors.</br>
</br>
After several organized protests, the people in demonstrations unanimously demanded that the next summit must be public to the world. The media had the right to exercise supervision. The people had the indisputable right to know...</br>
</br>
The situation in all countries was similar. Even demonstrations didn't happen in a few countries, the heated discussions online already told the same story.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't too concerned about the demonstration that happened in Coro City.</br>
</br>
The next meeting was scheduled for mid-July, when controversial issues such as the formation of the Earth Federation and the fight against extraterrestrial civilization would be discussed. Jiang Chen gave the governments enough time to digest the information they learned from the last meeting to then make a choice.</br>
</br>
On the second Saturday after the meeting, Jiang Chen took the space elevator to Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Since the beginning of May, Celestial Trade's space-related industries began to migrate to Celestial City. The ground command center in the northern part of the equator finally ended its historical mission. The personnel and equipment were all moved to Celestial City, occupying a separate external space station adjacent to the shipyard of Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
In the vicinity of this area, an aerospace industrial park was built. Not only assets of Future Group were located there, but factories invested by other countries were also located there. The factories mainly produced small and medium-sized spacecraft or aerospace equipment and accessories, directly or indirectly providing 27,000 jobs for Celestial City.</br>
</br>
After getting off the elevator at the terminal, Jiang Chen took the express to the Space Department.</br>
</br>
Kelvin was already waiting at the door. When he saw Jiang Chen, he immediately greeted him and welcomed him into the Space Department.</br>
</br>
Because of Gliese 581g and the invasion of the extraterrestrial civilization, Kelvin's hair almost turned white. His subordinates didn't see their boss's smile for a long time. But today, he wasn't only smiling but ecstatic.</br>
</br>
If you asked why, it was an important day today.</br>
</br>
Just an hour ago, the colonization ship that flew to Mars successfully reached the orbit of Mars and hovered directly above the landing point. The first colonial chamber could land on Mars with Jiang Chen's orders and take the first step of mankind to the stars.</br>
</br>
While walking on the way to the command center, Jiang Chen learned about the colonization ship from Kelvin.</br>
</br>
"What's the situation with the colonists?"</br>
</br>
"All the colonists have successfully woken up from the hibernation chamber. They're in good health. The colonial chamber function is normal and entered the final deployment stage." Kelvin was overjoyed.</br>
</br>
"What are we waiting for?" Jiang Chen pushed open the door of the command center. He looked up at the big screen in the center at the red-stained land.</br>
</br>
This moment finally arrived.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a deep breath and calmed down his mind. He placed the order for this historic mission in the command center with great excitement: "SS Heavenly Temple, initiate landing sequence!"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Wang Qiang took a deep breath; he calmed the excitement and anxiousness pumping in his chest. He peaked outside the window at the red-stained land.</br>
</br>
The plan was to spend the rest of his life on this new planet.</br>
</br>
"Stop gasping or we'll be out of oxygen soon." The man sitting across from him joked.</br>
</br>
There was a friendly laugh in the chamber, and the nervous atmosphere dissipated.</br>
</br>
More than 80 million kilometers away, the blue planet was no longer visible here. Although the moment they set foot on the colonization ship, they were ready to dedicate this life to the aerospace industry. But when they recalled life on Earth, the twenty colonists couldn't stop reminiscing about life on the homeland.</br>
</br>
No one knew what would be waiting for them.</br>
</br>
They weren't only the pioneers to colonize Mars, but they were also the first to set foot on this land. No matter how many space agencies conducted observations on this planet before, no one dared to declare they knew 100% of the planet before a human set his footprint on this foreign land.</br>
</br>
However, the thought of colonizing new land for human civilization brought them some comfort.</br>
</br>
The colonization ship entered the synchronous orbit and stopped directly above the landing point. The captain could order landing sequence with an order from the command center.</br>
</br>
Wang Qian relaxed and sank into the cushion of the seat. He closed his eyes and planned to take a nap.</br>
</br>
However, an hour passed after he opened his eyes again.</br>
</br>
"All personnel, the command center has issued a landing order, and the colonial chamber will be separated from the colonization ship in ten seconds. Enter the landing stage. Countdown, 10, 9, 8..."</br>
</br>
"So fast."</br>
</br>
When Wang Qiang opened his eyes, he heard the countdown. Without being mentally prepared, he felt anxious. But the colonization ship didn't give him a chance to be flustered as the countdown quickly reached to zero.</br>
</br>
With a slight jitter, the SS Heavenly Temple was divided into two, and the 200-meter-long chamber began to separate from the hull.</br>
</br>
Looking from far away, the entire colonial chamber resembled a flat cuboid. Under the traction of six ion engines, it fell toward the red-stained land.</br>
</br>
Mars's orbit was only 17,000 kilometers in distance, while its gravity was only four-ninth of that on Earth. The density of the atmosphere was thin. The landing difficulty was slightly higher than on the Moon, but it was much easier than the Earth.</br>
</br>
While the chamber maintained a downward sloping posture, the moment it came in contact with the atmosphere, six engines ignited with powerful propulsion rays. They dragged the chamber and stopped the acceleration of the fall.</br>
</br>
The high-temperature ions surrounded the chamber tightly. From a distance, it looked like a blue meteor.</br>
</br>
In the air, there was an arc. The two-hundred-meter-long flat cuboid, like a giant foot, descended from the sky and made an imprint on the land.</br>
</br>
</br>
BOOM!</br>
</br>
With a muffled sound, the red sand was send into the air by the collision.</br>
</br>
The thick thigh-sized steel needle popped from the bottom of the chamber and nailed into the red sand directly into the rock formation tens of meters deep. They firmly pinned the chamber onto the desert and acted as the "foundation".</br>
</br>
After deployment on land was completed, deployment still continued.</br>
</br>
The colonization ship with its chamber detached was still orbiting in the synchronous orbit. In the next ten years, it would serve as a satellite to provide communication, meteorological observation and crisis warning for the colony.</br>
</br>
At this point, the chamber deployment process was finally completed.</br>
</br>
The vibration outside stopped, and the lights in the cabin lit up.</br>
</br>
When light returned to his field of vision, Wang Qiang frantically looked around and breathlessly looked at the captain sitting on the left-hand side across from him. He was thrilled.</br>
</br>
"Did we succeed?"</br>
</br>
The expression on the captain's face was the same. Even if he wasn't an animated person, he was moved by the excitement and sense of glory from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
Not just the captain, but all twenty colonists felt the same glory.</br>
</br>
They received training for nearly a year, and they practiced day and night for this very day.</br>
</br>
"Yes, we succeeded!" With a deep breath, the captain controlled his overflowing excitement and ordered in his trembling voice, "All personnel pay attention. Release the security lock. Sacro, go check the oxygen system. Lu Yang, go to the power room and turn on our nuclear fusion generator; we don't have much energy in the battery."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
"Understood!"</br>
</br>
After the two men unlocked the safety lock, they leaped down from their seats and walked quickly outside the room.</br>
</br>
The security lock was also unlocked. The captain stood in the middle of the buffer cabin and moved his sore arms. He looked at the colonists who had already lined up and ordered: "Yang Yuhan, deploy the exploration drone and conduct a detailed investigation of the geological conditions within a ten-mile radius. Liu Rui, Wang Qiang, prepare for patrol. Chris, you and I will go to the main control room. The rest of the personnel, immediately enter your positions. Time is tight and it is necessary to complete deployment of the planting unit within four hours. This is critical to address our food problem!"</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
The colonists shouted in unison and acted immediately.</br>
</br>
After all the orders were executed, the captain didn't leave the buffer cabin immediately. Instead, he reached out to the holographic screen and switched the communication channel to Earth tens of millions of kilometers away. With his fingers trembling, he sent back news of success to his previous home.</br>
</br>
"Calling the ground command center, we succeeded!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"...we succeeded!"</br>
</br>
When the voice was transmitted back to Celestial City more than 80 million kilometers away, the entire command center erupted in cheers, celebrating the moment in joy. People whistled, threw their arms in the air, hugged together, and celebrated this great moment.</br>
</br>
Looking at the colony in the center of the screen, Jiang Chen was more excited than anyone.</br>
</br>
If the Moon was an energy base, then Mars was the arsenal of the future "Earth Federation." Mars was a large iron ore and the endless desert wasn't silica on Earth but iron oxide!</br>
</br>
To be more direct, if they took a shovel to any place on Mars and tossed the sand in a blast furnace, a pound of steel could be produced.</br>
</br>
If they wanted to build a galactic ship larger than SS Seagull, they would need a million tons of steel. The minerals on Earth and asteroids would just barely be enough. But if they wanted to build an "invincible fleet", it wouldn't be impossible with the Mars colony for steel production.</br>
</br>
As an important part of Jiang Chen's space program, the future "Mars Industrial Park" would bear more than 80% of the shipbuilding capacity of the Earth Federation.</br>
</br>
The Earth would finally gain a fighting chance against the imminent invasion.</br>
</br>
In order to celebrate this historic moment, Jiang Chen announced in the heat of the moment: "All employees involved in the Mars Colonization Program will be rewarded 500,000 Xin New dollars per person regardless of their position! This money will come out of my pocket!"</br>
</br>
The big red envelope pushed the cheering in the command center to a new peak...</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1092"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1092: Mars Plan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The colonial chamber was like a building lying on its side. As the center of the entire colony, it was where the colonists lived, worked, socialized and entertained in an array of facilities.</br>
</br>
Around the colonial chamber, there were also four spherical buildings made out of graphene material, connected to the colonial chamber by giant pipes. The four spherical buildings were the lifeline of the entire colony.</br>
</br>
Mars was a planet covered by desert and volcanic ash which gives off an impression of being extremely dry.</br>
</br>
However, the opposite was true. As early as a few years ago, the "Curiosity" rover sent back data that suggested the planet was actually rich in water resources! However, most of the water was brine and buried underground or mixed with the sand so it could not be directly consumed.</br>
</br>
But for Celestial Trade, it was not a problem. As long as there was water, there must be a way to turn it into drinkable water. The four spherical buildings served as the water pumps that filtered the water.</br>
</br>
The location of the colony was chosen on an ancient lake bed. There were definitely no shortages of water. The four spherical water pumps first pumped the underground brine into spherical storage tanks, filtered the water, and finally pump the water through the pipeline into the colony.</br>
</br>
Water was the source of life. Achieving self-sufficiency in drinking water was the key to achieving self-sufficiency for the colony.</br>
</br>
After the water, oxygen was next.</br>
</br>
The oxygen content of Mars was extremely low. Through the billions of years, the oxygen either escaped or reacted with the iron to form iron oxide. Fortunately, there was still an atmosphere on the planet. There was no oxygen but a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide. Therefore, it would be easier to create oxygen here than on the Moon because it does not need to use energy extensive electrolysis. Since there was no helium-3 on the planet, energy generation remained quite expensive.</br>
</br>
Oxygen could also be created with food.</br>
</br>
The main components of the Martian atmosphere was carbon dioxide; nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor were almost negligible. For animals, it was hell, but for plants, it was paradise!</br>
</br>
Of course, it was not to say that plants can be grown on Mars. The surface of Mars was extremely cold, and plants experienced "Photosynthetic acclimation" by being exposed to a pure carbon dioxide environment, which would ultimately hinder crop growth.</br>
</br>
However, as long as the carbon dioxide concentration of the plantation was controlled by nitrogen, it is easy to keep the crops in the plantation with the optimal carbon dioxide concentration. With a controlled water supply and ultraviolet light, the growth rate of crops will be impeccable!</br>
</br>
The only shortcoming is that early investment is extremely high. For the ration of 20 people, the cost of the facility exceeded 100 million Xin New dollars. On Earth, the same equivalent dollar amount is enough to create a few hundred thousand acres of fertile land.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still planned to position the Mars colony as an industrial base. Once the shipbuilding yard of Future Heavy Industries moved to Mars, Celestial Trade could build a few more SS Seagull classes to transport food. It would be a waste of resources to build a farm in the desert.</br>
</br>
Lunar city offered the advantage of low electricity costs, and it was understandable to plant some food to ease supply pressure. Without helium-3 and pure water on Mars though, food production would be extremely expensive.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen considered transforming Mars into a terrestrial planet before. Or not just him, someone had proposed a plan to transform Mars long ago.</br>
</br>
The most famous of the proposals was from SpaceX Elon Musk, who has been obsessed with Mars. The man was certainly a genius as he once proposed a shocking method by launching nuclear bombs at the poles of Mars. Nuclear explosion would melt the dry ice, thicken the atmosphere, cause the greenhouse effect, melt more dry ice, and continue to thicken the atmosphere... The key to this idea was to use the nuclear bombs to start the greenhouse effect. While it did sound unrealistic, it made sense in theory; a simple and yet effective solution.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not take long to give up the idea.</br>
</br>
The method was simply too slow. While it was easy to start the greenhouse effect, it was not possible to achieve the end result without the process taking thousands of years. More importantly, the uncertainty of the plan was too high. Mars was the most important part of Celestial Trade's plan to build its "Invincible Fleet" in the future. If something unexpected happens, then there was no going back and reloading the save.</br>
</br>
Of course, although Jiang Chen gave up the idea to change the Mars landscape in the short term, this did not mean he has completely abandoned the plan to transform Mars into a terrestrial planet.</br>
</br>
North of the colonial chamber was the plantation. Except for the main chamber, it is the largest building in the entire colony. It is connected by pipelines to the water storage tanks.</br>
</br>
In the plantation with an area of ​​about two acres, there was also a small biological laboratory. Two of the twenty colonists were biologists, and Jiang Chen gave them a difficult but honorable task.</br>
</br>
To develop a bacterium that could survive in the Mars environment.</br>
</br>
This kind of bacteria must be anaerobic, must adapt to a low-gravity environment, can resist low temperatures, and be capable of generating heat, but also be able to withstand the continuous exposure of ultraviolet light... This super bacterium sounds like a fantasy, but Jiang Chen who witnessed the history of Harmony is optimist about the future of biological engineering.</br>
</br>
However, there was be a high chance he won't be able to live to the day when Mars will be covered in grass. This would be a millennium project. He would only start the project and leave it to the future generations to complete the work.</br>
</br>
Before recreating the clear and blue sky of Mars 4.3 billion years ago, he must build factories in this desert, and use steel and blood to create peace for the next generation.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After leaving the command center, Jiang Chen received a call from the Presidential Palace. Just half an hour ago, the Capitol called the Presidential Palace and expressed its willingness to start the second round of negotiations. However, they proposed an additional condition that appeared reasonable.</br>
</br>
Since it was a matter of the fate of Earth, it should not be a closed-door discussion of several countries but discussed by everyone. All countries should discuss and formulate strategies against the extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
In short, the meeting should be done at the United Nations.</br>
</br>
The Capitol just called, and then the United Kingdom and France also expressed the same intention. They also added, the condition is the premise of the next round of negotiations. The implication is that if this matter is not discussed at the United Nations, then we will not participate!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sneered at the news.</br>
</br>
He knew exactly what these people were planning.</br>
</br>
The Capitol held a firm grasp on the United Nations.</br>
</br>
Out of the five permanent members, two of the members shared the same opinion as the UA.</br>
</br>
Discussions at the United Nations seemed fair, but it was actually a trap.</br>
</br>
Without the need to think, once this issue is discussed at the United Nations, it is absolutely impossible to come up with any results. First of all, Xin does not have equal power with the UA. Then, Celestial Trade is not even qualified to appear in the United Nations.</br>
</br>
Without the company that discovered the extraterrestrial civilization, what's the propose to meet with a bunch of small countries without any understanding of aerospace?</br>
</br>
If the United Nations really possessed any power, North Korea would have long given up nuclear weapons!</br>
</br>
I made the space elevator, I created the Moon Colony, I generated the trillion-dollar aerospace industry in Celestial Trade, I even offered to mine asteroids together. Now I have to go to your place to discuss how to use the stuff at my place? Let you be the boss?</br>
</br>
Do you really think NASA is still the NASA from the Nixon era?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, without any hesitation, immediately made a decision.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1093"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1093: Stingray“s Return</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Go to the United Nations for a meeting? No problem. Just get our ambassador to go meet with them."</br>
</br>
When Zhang Yaping heard Jiang Chen's words, he immediately understood the implication. If he was a innocent man three years ago, he had long become a qualified politician.</br>
</br>
It was the UN General Assembly, and it was a discussion of an important matter. While the president didn't have to make a visit, at least a senior official should attend the meeting. Based on Jiang Chen's decision, an ambassador at the consulate should go. It meant that the ambassador wouldn't even have the right to represent the country to speak.</br>
</br>
He simply meant "You can do whatever you want and I don't care"!</br>
</br>
But Zhang Yaping quickly made sense of the reason, even if he went there, he would not have a say. In this case, what would be the difference between sending someone else?</br>
</br>
However, it wasn't just that, Jiang Chen was not done.</br>
</br>
"What is the date of the UN General Assembly?"</br>
</br>
"July 2nd."</br>
</br>
"How about this, at the end of June, visit Hua, Russia, and Frankberg to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Bring a group of entrepreneurs from Xin and throw out the bait of the magnetic levitating highway. I don't need you to do anything when you visit, just try to subtly hint their leaders..."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping, who still had doubts in his mind, immediately understood the implication. His eyes brightened and the doubt in his eyes disappeared. After Jiang Chen finished, he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll get that prepared as soon as possible."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, thank you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes and sneered after he hung up.</br>
</br>
Since you want to play tricks with me, then I'll play with you. Without the UA, Britain, and France, this summit will still continue. Just don't regret it then!</br>
</br>
Once he was no longer emotional, Jiang Chen frowned, and suddenly began to feel doubt.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he was not surprised that the UA used their allies to put pressure on Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
He just didn't understand that if the Capitol knew his personality and knew that he won't compromise, why would they add this premise to the second round of negotiations?</br>
</br>
From this perspective, it was something intriguing.</br>
</br>
They clearly didn't want to talk...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The news of Celestial Trade's colonization ship successfully arriving on Mars, and that 20 colonists successfully settling on Mars spread to every corner of the world in just a few hours.</br>
</br>
When the Mars Colonization Program was first announced, many people were eager to see Celestial Trade fail. Without the first step of "landing on Mars", they began to think about building a colony?</br>
</br>
However, the facts disappointed the doubters.</br>
</br>
With Mars being full of iron oxide, iron ores were as worthless as sand and countless peopled drooled over the Mars colony.</br>
</br>
However, they could only drool.</br>
</br>
</br>
With the same method they advertised the Moon Colony, Celestial Trade placed a journalist among the 20 colonists to capture the life of the colonists. The photographs and videos were edited by the marketing department and placed on Celestial Trade's official website.</br>
</br>
These videos and photos immediately accumulated tens of millions of views in less than a day, and were forwarded to all major social media sites. They caused a sensation on the internet and even overtook the popularity of the Outer Space Security Summit.</br>
</br>
"Even Mars has been colonized. What can stop Celestial Trade from going further?" Some people exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"Damn, we didn't even get to go on the Moon yet and they have already claimed Mars. The good places are being robbed by them, this is not okay!" Someone cursed.</br>
</br>
"Sigh, when Celestial Trade recruited space volunteers, I applied for it. But when I saw the Mars Colonization Program, I gave up the idea. Now life on Mars doesn't look as bad as I imagined…" Some people admired.</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Not just on videos, Celestial Trade made the photos available on their official website for anyone to retransmit.</br>
</br>
Intentional or not, amongst the photos, there was a photo that was particularly intriguing. In the photo, several colonists wearing spacesuits stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in a row, posing in front of the camera for a group photo.</br>
</br>
The pose of the colonists in the photo itself was completely fine, but the problem was the background, the rover behind them.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was "Curiosity" launched in 2011.</br>
</br>
Compared with the astronauts who posed in front of it, it looked like a large toy.</br>
</br>
Clumsy, bloated, and unappealing...</br>
</br>
The meaning of the photo was of course positive, symbolizing the "friendship" between the countries. No matter from which point of view, it was just a good photo. However, the UA media chose to remain silent and selectively ignored this photo. Controversy only appeared among the netizens.</br>
</br>
This photo full of malicious intention was a demand from Jiang Chen</br>
</br>
As to why?</br>
</br>
I am pitiful!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
These days, Jiang Chen stayed in Celestial City. He would either go to the command center and observe the Mars colony or take a stroll in Celestial Trade to take in the beauty of the city full of technology.</br>
</br>
They were approaching the end of the month. With the first exploration site built in the Mars colony, the Stingray A-1 sent to the UFO for investigation, ended its journey of nearly three months. In a suspense-filled moment, the deceleration was completed before the fuel was exhausted as it barely entered the orbit.</br>
</br>
Because of the top-secret nature of the flight and the major events that happened recently, Celestial Trade couldn't hold a grand welcoming ceremony for this hero. He could only be sneaked into the port of Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen was never the kind of person who would make his subordinates feel aggrieved. In recognition of the brave performance of the pilot, Jiang Chen personally awarded him the Golden Eagle Medal.</br>
</br>
It was almost the highest glory of the Celestial Trade Air Force. With such a medal, his career progression will be smooth sailing. As long as he didn't make too many mistakes, he could be a captain before the age of forty.</br>
</br>
In addition to the medal, a bonus of one million Xin New dollars was awarded to him in the form of a year-end bonus. On the one hand, his behavior was indeed worthy of praise, but on the other hand, it was a fee to keep the information confidential.</br>
</br>
The one hundred kilograms sphere finally arrived in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen already couldn't wait to see what it was.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1094: A Surprising Finding</br>
</div></br>
</br>
[June 27, 2019]</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang wrote the date at the top of his journal. He sniffed and looked outside the window. The sky was blocked by a sandstorm.</br>
</br>
The days on Mars were only 37 minutes longer than Earth. Based on twenty-four-hour time, it should be around three in the afternoon, but it was dusk here.</br>
</br>
After the initial excitement, the excitement of landing of Mars already faded.</br>
</br>
Life on Mars was boring, communication resources were precious, and of course it was impossible to use the Internet. Before the completion of the large-scale communication base station, each person only had10 minutes of telephone time per day to call their relatives and friends on Earth. It was the only way for them to obtain information.</br>
</br>
Without the Internet, it was torture for modern day people.</br>
</br>
It meant that he couldn't use Twitter, nor could he wear a phantom helmet to dive into the virtual world. Almost half of all entertainment methods were crossed off for him.</br>
</br>
For Wang Qiang, his daily entertainment was listening to pop music. Lying in bed and reading webnovels, the rhythm of life seemed to slow down. It was the same for most others. They would find something they like to do in their spare time.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, one of the twenty colonists in the colony was a chef who specialized in four cuisine types. The reserves in the colonial chamber were quite rich, and they could cook any type of meals every day. Ever since, eating became one of their few entertainments.</br>
</br>
In order to boost the morale of the colonists, the captain assured them that he would request to the command center at the end of this month to bring more chefs in the next group of colonists. On the one hand, they had to balance the diet of people from different cultures, on the other hand, they could not eat the same thing forever.</br>
</br>
The dust storm outside the window was growing stronger, but Wang Qiang was not bothered and continued to write things down. It was a habit that he developed after he came to Mars, mainly to pass time.</br>
</br>
As for why he was so calm, he knew that as long as it was not a level 13 typhoon, the sandstorm just couldn't move his anchored vehicle. The sandstorms on Mars, since they started to be tracked, were only as powerful as level 12 typhoon equivalent .</br>
</br>
Before being sent to Mars, he was a geological worker for Future Mining. And of course, now too. The only one mission assigned to him by the command center was to survey the geological information of Mars, find minerals, and assess the reserves of groundwater.</br>
</br>
While it was possible to produce steel with any shovel of sand, the heavy industrial industry required more than just steel. Elements such as aluminum, manganese, chromium, cobalt and nickel were all covered by a layer of iron oxide.</br>
</br>
The colonization ship orbiting on the synchronous orbit scanned the geological information of the area. Based to the topographical features on the topographic map, he identified several locations where deposits and groundwater enrichment areas may exist. And his task for the next month was to inspect these mines on the mars rover and complete the final works on geological information mapping.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although he did not imagine this to be an easy job, the hardships of the planet's conditions still exceeded his expectations.</br>
</br>
The entirety of Mars was a desert with no obstructions at all. It was the fifth time he encountered a sandstorm today. If the colonization ship above his head didn't continuously monitoring weather data, he didn't have the courage to get off the rover.</br>
</br>
Mars climate was volatile and sandstorms came fast but also went fast.</br>
</br>
When the wind indicator returned to a safe level, the dim sky finally reappeared.</br>
</br>
Due to the thin atmosphere, dust particles were larger. Because of the Mie Scattering Effect, the dust scattered red light of the same wavelength. The sky was red in the direction without the Sun, and the sky was blue in the direction of the Sun.</br>
</br>
Such a magnificent view could only be seen on Mars.</br>
</br>
However, watching the same view every day turned out to be dull and boring. Wang Qiang began to miss Coro Island, the pleasant island where the sea breeze mixed with the scent of seafood, and the pristine sky.</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, Wang Qiang put away his journal and also his nostalgia.</br>
</br>
He opened the door, geared up his space suit, and jumped into the sand with the equipment box. In order to prevent the sudden arrival of a sandstorm, he already opened the anchoring device of the rover and attached himself with a safety rope behind his back.</br>
</br>
While he never witnessed it before, before he came, he heard that the sandstorm could reach a strength equivalent to a level 12 typhoon on Earth. He could be easily sent into the air with his build.</br>
</br>
"A lake bed sedimentary phase? This is almost weathered. There should be water underneath, just don't know how much..."</br>
</br>
He collapsed the holographic image and held onto the device as big as a suitcase, Wang Qiang found a relatively flat position on the ground, and then fixed the device to the ground.</br>
</br>
It was not a sophisticated piece of equipment, but a practical one. There was a striker at the bottom of the device, which simulated the seismic wave by high-speed impact on the surface. According to the different propagation speed of the wave in different media, the lithology of different depths was determined, and also groundwater was determined along with its depth.</br>
</br>
He removed the tablet in front of his chest and connected it to the equipment before exporting the seismic wave.</br>
</br>
"Imported, let me see..."</br>
</br>
Looking down at the waveform, Wang Qiang already gained an understanding of the formation. However, when he saw the positioned about two kilometers underground, he suddenly frowned.</br>
</br>
"...is it wrong?"</br>
</br>
At the position of two kilometers underground, the three red, blue and green waves were distorted and even intertwined. In his more than ten years of experience, it was the first time he witnessed this kind of a graph.</br>
</br>
The seismic wave was backed up, Wang Qiang restarted the device. After waiting for three minutes, he measured another set of data.</br>
</br>
However, the result this time was still the same.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries was known for its durability. However, if the possibility of equipment failure was ruled out, then there was only one possible explanation. The geological information of the target area was extremely complex.</br>
</br>
More than one hundred meters of the formation, there was iron, aluminum, titanium... and something he had never seen before.</br>
</br>
It was impossible for this to be formed naturally.</br>
</br>
But if wasis not formed naturally, what could it be?</br>
</br>
A thought suddenly emerged in Wang Qiang's mind, his heart started pounding faster.</br>
</br>
"... Damn, is this a treasure?"</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Wang Qiang restrained his excitement and didn't bother collecting another set of data. He put the tablet back onto his chest, reached out and pressed on the helmet of the spacesuit, connecting the command center of the colonial chamber through the radio on the rover.</br>
</br>
"This is Prospector 01, calling the command center. I have a situation here... not a security situation, I found something interesting."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1095: Strong Interaction Material</br>
</div></br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen didn't see it with his own eyes, if he didn't touch it with his gloves, he would have never believed that the black sphere, the size of a golf ball, would really weigh 100 kilograms.</br>
</br>
He examined it closely, the surface of the black ball exuded a faint metallic luster, but its physical properties were completely different from a metal. The smooth texture of the surface didn't resemble a metal, but a form of glass.</br>
</br>
After storing the black sphere in Celestial City's lab, Jiang Chen immediately gathered more than 20 experts from Future Group's Material Science Lab to carry out experiments.</br>
</br>
However, unfortunately, even the most talented team was still clueless about the composition of this ball.</br>
</br>
When the team leader of the research project came up next to Jiang Chen, he shook his head in embarrassment and sighed. "With our current technology, we can't even determine its elemental composition. The only thing we can confirm now is that the black sphere has high material strength and the surface is very smooth..."</br>
</br>
His team carried all forms of experimental methods. But despite their effort, they couldn't even make a single dent. Even the most penetrative gamma ray couldn't pass through the sphere which made him feel helpless.</br>
</br>
The only thing he could determine is that the black sphere pose no threat and can be in contact with skin.</br>
</br>
"What do you think this might be?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
The team leader hesitated for a moment and said, "I don't know. If I have to take a guess, I think there should be a gravitational generating device inside this ball that can compress more than one hundred kilograms of material into the size of a golf ball." Or rather, this is the fabled strong interaction material. It is directly composed of countless hadrons and even quarks... but this would be out of realm of our imagination."</br>
</br>
As he spoke, the scientist shook his head and denied himself immediately.</br>
</br>
It was once speculated that there was a strong interaction material, but in theory it didn't make sense... At least using existing theories, it is unreasonable. But if this sphere is really composed of strong interaction material, then the civilization that created it is really lightyears ahead.</br>
</br>
To put it in simple terms, while one was still wondering how to cultivate, the other has already became an immortal...</br>
</br>
"I propose to transfer the sphere from Celestial City to Coro Island's Material Science Lab. There is more sophisticated equipment there we can use to conduct experiments," The team leader suggested.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head. "No, let's pause for now. The way we think may have flaws, I'll think about other methods,"</br>
</br>
The team leader looked confused, but he didn't insist further.</br>
</br>
For three days, he and his team wandered around the sphere. But they couldn't even advance one step further in their research! The boss' euphemistic speech was already saving his face.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Just like this, the Coro Island researchers returned home.</br>
</br>
After the researchers left with the equipment, Jiang Chen orders dozens of soldiers from the military, locked down the lab with the black sphere, and gave out strict order. Except for himself, no one was allowed to enter the lab.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen took the black sphere and tossed it into the storage dimension. When he returned to the ground, he spoke with Ayesha before heading to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After returning to the apocalypse Jiang Chen immediately handed the black sphere to Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
After the integration of knowledge between the 2,000 sisters, the research institute consisting of clones and digitalized humans became the most technologically advanced research institute in the NAC. Different from Fallout Shelter 027 with a focus on applied technology, the Lin Research Institute focused on theory and cutting-edge technology.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was the perfect candidate to study the mystery of this black ball.</br>
</br>
Although she said she was not pleased with the assignment, when she saw the black sphere, she stopped her work on the portal and immediately dedicated herself to the mysterious object from the extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was used to the displeased Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
He knew that while she didn't look pleasant on the surface, she was more enthusiastic than anyone else, she was just too shy to show this side of her. He rubbed Lin Lin's head, and in her "grumpy" protest, he left the research institute.</br>
</br>
Over the next few days, he planned to stay in the apocalypse until the end of the month. Then he would return to the modern world to oversee the situation.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's research speed exceeded Jiang Chen's expectations, at least much faster than he expected.</br>
</br>
At noon on the third day, Jiang Chen was sitting on the sofa and chatting with Xiaorou in the living room while waiting for Yao Yao to announce it was time for lunch. Then, a tired Lin Lin pushed open the door and strolled in before plunging down right next to him.</br>
</br>
"I have the results. Like my previous conjecture, the sphere is indeed made out of strong interaction material, referred to as hadron material."</br>
</br>
Also in three days, the research team of Future Group did not even know how to start. However, Lin Lin already made some progress which even shocked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Strong interaction material?" Sun Xiaorou titled her head and looked at the two in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Ummm, it's hard to explain," Lin Lin said, putting her hand on her forehead, and sighed. "The strong interaction force overcame the strong repulsive force generated by the electromagnetic force, and the particles in the material are bonded together by strong interaction force. In short, this small sphere is composed entirely of protons and neutrons, and naturally is not made out of the traditional element sense."</br>
</br>
"So, this thing is like a giant atom?" Jiang Chen had a strange expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"Well, although you are not right, it is very commendable that you can understand this with your superficial physics knowledge- OUCH!" Before she finished, she covered her forehead, and glanced at Jiang Chen with a grieved expression, "Why did you do that, I'm not wrong! "</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Lin Lin's grievances.</br>
</br>
"Don't interrupt. What do you think it is? A battery? Or a weapon? Or a detector..."</br>
</br>
"None of those." Lin Lin shook her head and grabbed her hair in distress, "Or all of them. The issue is that it is hadron material. It is impossible to analyze its internal structure with the existing technical means, no device can even penetrate this..."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's eyes suddenly lit up and she muttered to herself, "Wait, it's not impossible."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou looked at the two, still confused about what they were muttering.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After lunch, Lin Lin returned to the institute with Jiang Chen. Out of curiosity, Sun Xiaorou also followed the two.</br>
</br>
This small sphere may be a secret in the modern world, but it was nothing special in the apocalypse. Therefore, Jiang Chen did not hide anything from Xiaorou. He narrated the origin of the sphere through a story to her.</br>
</br>
"Extraterrestrial civilization? Do they really exist?"</br>
</br>
In the corridor of the institute, Sun Xiaorou slanted her head, and her soft, luscious hair draped across her shoulder. Her nose pointed upwards due to confusion, making her look more and more like her sister.</br>
</br>
"Who knows? Although we haven't met it yet, but who knows. Not to mention, if it is not an extraterrestrial civilization, how can we explain the sphere made out of hadron material?" Jiang Chen smiled, "it doesn't look like something that can be formed in nature at all."</br>
</br>
"Use the result to derive the cause?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"How can you explain your ability to interdimensional travel?" Sun Xiaorou grinned.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought about it, then shook his head.</br>
</br>
For the time being, he didn't want to think about this.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin took the two people to the elevator and arrived at the lab deep underground.</br>
</br>
Although the Lin Research Institute did not research weapons, the particle cannon was an exception. Studying how to use magnetic confinement technology to wrap larger, high-temperature particles or even anti-matter, was one of the research topics Jiang Chen gave the institute. And this lab was designed to test this particle cannon.</br>
</br>
The explosion-proof and earthquake-resistance of this lab was ranked among the top in the NAC.</br>
</br>
In the middle of the lab, Jiang Chen saw the black sphere.</br>
</br>
From the new graphene protective wall, it was clear that Lin Lin already tested the particle cannon on the black sphere. She was very close to use antimatter with power equivalent to nuclear weapons as her last resot, but she still couldn't break the sphere.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought that if the particle cannon did not even dent the sphere, perhaps only anti-matter could damage it.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen debated about this possibility, Lin Lin took a deep breath and whispered, "I'll leave it up to you," and then a ray of crimson light formed in her eye.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen silently put away the electronic products on him into the storage dimension, and also took Xiaorou's EP away.</br>
</br>
Most of the equipment used in this laboratory were large-scale optoelectronic components. The "parts" on Lin Lin's body were the jewels of pre-war technology, they were all resistant to the strong EMP effect generated when the Klein particles collapse to the third dimension. But it was not the case for Jiang Chen's electronics, for example, the watch Yao Yao gifted him. It could certainly resist an EMP grenade, but Lin Lin's EMP could melt the electronic components inside it into a paste.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's solution was simple.</br>
</br>
Klein particles.</br>
</br>
Since it is a particle that exists in the fourth dimension, it shound't be too difficult to break through the hadron material. After all, the two are not on one dimension at all. As long as she can prove that the Klein particles can pass through the hadron material, then the next step is easy. Design a Klein particle wave detector to learn about the internal structure of the sphere. This step should not be a problem.</br>
</br>
"How do you plan to treat Tingting," Sun Xiaorou with a wicked smile held onto Jiang Chen's arm. She gently whispered in his ear. "I heard from my sister the story between you and her in the virtual reality realm of Fallout Shelter 005."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen selectively ignored this question.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he didn't know how to respond to Tingting's feelings. He wasn't even sure if her feelings are the same as the "like" experienced by humans.</br>
</br>
Inside the graphene protective wall, Lin Lin... No, Tingting, formed a red ray in her eyes. The unstable red rays were the sign that the Klein particles collapsing from the fourth dimension to the third dimension.</br>
</br>
She aimed at the center of the room, and the ray suddenly burst out and directly hit the black sphere.</br>
</br>
However, something unexpected occurred.</br>
</br>
The moment the ray collided with the black sphere, the ray was deflected and redirected into the graphene protective wall. The ray formed a large hole on the protective wall.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes almost popped out.</br>
</br>
Although he did not expect the Klein particle beam to penetrate the sphere, it was his first time seeing something that could deflect Klein particles.</br>
</br>
The crimson dissipated from her pupils, and the energy-depleted Tingting entered hibernation. Lin Lin stared at the big hole on the wall and paused for a moment. Then she quickly walked to the instrument on her left hand and called out the Klein particle distribution map in the room.</br>
</br>
On that image, it was obvious that a thick and bright red ray shot into the middle of the room, and then there was a forty-five degrees turn. The action made sense since Lin Lin did not expect the Klein particle beam to penetrate the black sphere.</br>
</br>
However, what shocked her was...</br>
</br>
At the position of the black sphere, not only the Klein particles that collapsed into the three-dimensional in the form of energy were deflected, even the Klein particles that have not yet decayed from the fourth dimension were also deflected.</br>
</br>
Hadron material, was still a three-dimensional material after all, but it even interfered with the particles in the fourth dimension?</br>
</br>
It was like a particle in the fourth dimension was blocked by the wall in the third-dimension?</br>
</br>
How could this be!</br>
</br>
Although Lin Lin couldn't believe this, she knew it was not an experimental error.</br>
</br>
The Klein particle monitor next to her was designed by her and her sisters. In this three hundred square meters lab, the monitoring of the density of the Klein particles can even be accurate to the millimeter level! Even if this instrument was compared to technology before the war, the top academicians would applaud over the accuracy of this device.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou walked over to the graphene protective wall and touched the terrifying fracture. She was stunned.</br>
</br>
Unwillingly to accept the result, Lin Lin still wanted to try once more, but Tingting no longer had any energy. She had to give up.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation?" Although he had an idea from the expression on her face, he still asked.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, Lin Lin shook her head and grabbed her hair in frustration. She muttered in a depressed mood.</br>
</br>
"Even the Klein particles can't penetrate this, I don't understand, it doesn't make sense..."</br>
</br>
"You mean, the hadron material is completely protected against Klein particles?"</br>
</br>
"It seems to be the case... maybe it's a principle we still don't understand? I don't understand."</br>
</br>
While Lin Lin was frustrated, Jiang Chen's eyes gradually lit up.</br>
</br>
This is amazing!</br>
</br>
He was worried about how he would defend against the Klein particle beam known as the electronics killer if he encounters the space colonization ship from Harmony. However, now, the solution has appeared in front of him and he only needs to figure out how to gild a layer of the hadron material on the battleship...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Under Jiang Chen's eager gaze, Lin Linshivered, and her tone quieted down.</br>
</br>
"What, what do you want?"</br>
</br>
"Is there any way to replicate this kind of hadron material?" Jiang Chen asked eagerly.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin thought, and then she shook her head furiously.</br>
</br>
"It's very difficult, almost impossible."</br>
</br>
"Is it more difficult than antimatter?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Antimatter has a theoretical basis since the last century. The theory has matured since the middle of the century and it's even possible to start large-scale preparation. It is because of the lack of breakthrough in magnetic confinement technology and the restrictions from the Science Ethics Committee that prevented the breakthrough of the last critical step."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head with a bitter smile. "But before the war, the so-called hadron material was still something that only existed in science fiction, let alone the theoretical foundation. We don't understand anything about it."</br>
</br>
"Not possible?" Jiang Chen asked reluctantly.</br>
</br>
"It's not that it is impossible..." Lin Lin touched her chin and looked at the black sphere in the middle of the lab. "I can give it a try, but I can't guarantee I'll succeed. Why are you suddenly interested in this?" Even if we can barely make some hadron material, without large-scale production, it won't be useful."</br>
</br>
"Can't achieve large-scale production?" Jiang Chen sighed. "We can't even understand its production conditions?"</br>
</br>
This time Lin Lin was confused.</br>
</br>
Then, she looked at Jiang Chen with skepticism. "Do you want to use hadron material to build a warship?"</br>
</br>
"That's not a good idea?"</br>
</br>
When she heard Jiang Chen's "naive" question, Lin Lin sighed.</br>
</br>
"Think about it carefully. How did the pilot you sent enter the UFO and take the sphere out of it?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows furrowed, recalling the pilot named Liu Qingpeng and what he described.</br>
</br>
"There was a fracture on the outer shell of the UFO that resembled the collision of a meteorite. He is from..."</br>
</br>
Halfway through the sentence, Jiang Chen already realized as his expression turned awkward.</br>
</br>
Right, since the meteorite cracked the outer shell of the UFO, then without a doubt the UFO was definitely not made out of hadron material.</br>
</br>
Even the "higher civilization" that have mastered the hadron material for many years couldn't achieve mass production of such material. How could Earth that didn't even understand the theory achieve the impossible?</br>
</br>
As soon as he heard that there was no way for mass production, Jiang Chen's interest immediately decreased. He sighed.</br>
</br>
"Do your best. Your research direction should still be on antimatter and portals."</br>
</br>
Although very reluctant, Jiang Chen rationally knew that if this hadron material took too much of NAC's energy, it would not be worth it.</br>
</br>
As for the black sphere, he planned to leave it here. He thought that even if he brought it back to the modern world, the scientists would be clueless about what to do and ultimately eat dust in the lab. Perhaps Lin Lin and her sisters could come up with a theory with leaving the sphere leaving it here.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"You don't have to be so pessimistic. Perhaps there are more secrets in this black sphere compared to the hadron material. After all, this is a relic of higher civilization. A civilization much more advanced than Harmony. An item made with hadron material shouldn't just be an ornament..."</br>
</br>
With a rare comforting tone, Lin Lin comforted Jiang Chen. Then she took a tablet and clicked on it. Soon, the platform in which the black sphere was placed on slowly sank and was taken into the lab warehouse.</br>
</br>
"Stop looking, let's go."</br>
</br>
She patted Jiang Chen's back and then walked to the elevator...</br>
</br>
Seventy kilometers east of the Mars colony, a rover was parked on this endless sand dune.</br>
</br>
The weather was surprisingly nice, and the surface temperature was also above zero.</br>
</br>
In a heavy spacesuit, Wang Qiang took the captain and the engineer to Mine 071, the place where he found something intriguing last time. In front of the captian, Wang Qiang once again measured the three sets of waveforms to prove his discovery.</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang said seriously as he pointed at the image on the tablet.</br>
</br>
"The depth of about five kilometers, the thickness of about 100 meters of the formation, I dare to conclude that there must be something buried inside."</br>
</br>
"Iron ore?" Taking a glance at the waveforms on the tablet, Askim frowned.</br>
</br>
As the colony's engineer, his responsibility involved equipment maintenance and colony expansion. It is fair to say he knew nothing about mining. The few staggering waveforms didn't look odd to him.</br>
</br>
However, Hong Zewei standing next to him realized the unusual nature. As the captain of the colonial ship and the interim executive of the colony, it is fair to say he is the most knowledgeable person in the entire colony. Because of work needs, he understood a little bit of all aspects. Even if he is not a master of everything, he must at least understand.</br>
</br>
He is a layman, but he learned how to interpret seismic data. When he saw the waveforms that were distorted by incredible magnitude, his expression changed drastically.</br>
</br>
"It can't be an iron ore. It can't be any rock formation or deposit." Wang Qiang shook his head and explained to Askim.</br>
</br>
Askim started to grin.</br>
</br>
"Not any deposit? What could it be? An alien grave?"</br>
</br>
Wang Qiang closed his mouth and did not speak.</br>
</br>
Captain Hong Zewei spoke up.</br>
</br>
"Maybe... it's really the Alien's Mausoleum."</br>
</br>
Askim looked at the captain as if he saw a ghost. His expression looked extremely strange.</br>
</br>
"Alien? Hong, are you sure you are not kidding?"</br>
</br>
When these colonists set off, the X2 bacterial incident had not happened yet, and the Outer Space Security Summit did not even exist. Aliens were still strange or whimsical to them.</br>
</br>
Of course, if Mars could access the Internet, they perhaps won't be surprised by the word alien. Now, countries were all having a difficult time dealing with the concept of extraterrestrial civilization. The governments were busy calming public opinion and discussing countermeasures as they also have not received any news from Mars.</br>
</br>
"Joking. Maybe it is not a mausoleum, but the city of the aliens," Hong Zewei glanced at him and joked. "Have you seen Starship Troopers? Maybe those bugs live underneath us and are going to crawl out to bite us now."</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Don't scare me." Askim shivered and looked underneath his feet.</br>
</br>
"How do you feel about drilling a hole? Can you do it?" Wang Qiang asked Askim.</br>
</br>
"Aha, you must be asking if it is possible to make a hole five kilometers deep? I have to tell you regretfully that there is no such equipment in the colony. Even if there is, don't even think about it!" Askim shook his head rapidly, using a warning tone, "Listen, I don't want to die with you! Unless the command center sends soldiers to ensure our safety, don't expect me to do this stupid thing for you."</br>
</br>
"You shouldn't have scared him him." Wang Qiang looked at Hong Zewei and forced a smile.</br>
</br>
"Who knew he would take it seriously?" The captain made a helpless expression. "Not to mention what he said is justified. There are no decent weapons in the colony. If the danger is below, we can't even resist."</br>
</br>
Originally Hong Zewei was only joking, but this time he has began to think about his own statement. In case the creatures are hiding under the ground, no one can guarantee that there is no such possibility! Mars is more like the Earth than Earth four billion years ago.</br>
</br>
When Columbus first set foot on the American continent, he didn't think there were people on the continent until they met the indigenous people with feathers on their heads.</br>
</br>
After all, twenty lives are in his hands.</br>
</br>
"What do we do now?" Wang Qiang looked at the captain and asked, "Just leave it here?"</br>
</br>
"Let's go back to the colonial chamber. I will pass the message to the command center and request drilling equipment on the next colonization ship, and then ask if we can request a few soldiers. Fu*k, I scared myself too."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1098: Chaotic</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Alien.</br>
</br>
Extraterrestrial civilization.</br>
</br>
These two terms were quite strange to most people a month ago. However, just in a month's time, these two terms had created fear by most people.</br>
</br>
More than a week ago, rumors about extraterrestrial civilization swept across the entire Internet, and debate was ignited with the intentionally stirring of Celestial Trade and Future Group.</br>
</br>
The T virus and the X2 bacteria had already plagued the nerves of modern people. Under the current circumstance with news of extraterrestrial civilization spreading prolifically, this immediately caused shock around the world.</br>
</br>
Interestingly, it was obvious to those who were aware that the messages were disclosed in an "ordered" fashion.</br>
</br>
At the beginning, only "informed people" revealed that the Outer Space Security Summit was a defensive nature summit against extraterrestrial civilizations.</br>
</br>
Then, a country's official who asked not to be named stated that the spacecraft of extraterrestrial civilization is on the way to Earth and has crossed the distance of several light years. The government was discussing the use of 5% of GDP for the construction of a space colonization ship.</br>
</br>
The signs of escapism ignited panic in those who were concerned. Peasants were not stupid, no matter how big the colonization ship was, they certainly would not have a chance to obtain a ticket.</br>
</br>
Either everyone would live together, or we would go down together.</br>
</br>
Such arguments seemed to be contrary to universal values, but most people living at the bottom were well aware that this was their only hope of living. Maybe they wouldn't see the day, but they must consider the future of their offspring.</br>
</br>
There were protests at unprecedented scale worldwide. The defiance against class was at a level unseen before. Even Xin faced the same issue.</br>
</br>
Take the UA as an example.</br>
</br>
After the disclosure of extraterrestrial civilization, the Capitol was busy extinguishing the fire, and the Wall Street tycoons completely tore off the disguise on their faces.</br>
</br>
The Morgan Foundation and the Rockefeller consortium jointly established a number of non-public funds named Noah's Ark and Columbus and set a minimum buy-in amount of ten million dollars.</br>
</br>
The fund would be used to build an space colonization ship capable of leaving the solar system. Each share of the fund corresponded to a "ticket", and each ten-share corresponds to a VIP ticket.</br>
</br>
However, there was no impenetrable wall in this world.</br>
</br>
Once the fund was disclosed, it caused an uproar.</br>
</br>
A congressman condemned the fund in the Congress and proposed legislation to ban the existence of such a fund, but the next day he was kicked out of his party. On the third day, he turned into a hero for the civilians, as he stood on the streets to protest, and surrounded the Capitol.</br>
</br>
Then on the fifth day, the brave member was found to have "suicided" in his home.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the sixth day, his portrait appeared in the parade that occupied Wall Street. The demonstrators clashed with the anti-riot police, the explosion-proof shield and tear gas made the scene extremely chaotic...</br>
</br>
In addition to the controversial Noah's Ark fund, Silicon Valley also created a number of terrestrial planetary exploration companies that seek investor funding by searching for terrestrial planets in hundreds of millions of galaxies and developing colonization programs.</br>
</br>
In addition to the dispute between escapism and anti-escapism, many strange rhetorics were also born.</br>
</br>
Such as capitulation.</br>
</br>
Just as everyone was frightened by the space colonization ship of the extraterrestrial civilization, Greenpeace made a statement. This organization, which flaunts love and peace, declared that extraterrestrial civilization may be coming for peaceful purposes, and that their purpose of aggression is only arrogance and prejudice of humans.</br>
</br>
They also claimed that rashly taking military action would only provoke a war between two civilizations and warn "some people" not to make the wrong choice.</br>
</br>
The organization also used its global influence and organized two large-scale demonstrations in Xin. Both demonstrations were suppressed by police drones. They were not convinced as they turned their attention to the space elevator and created the movement to occupy the space elevator.</br>
</br>
Soon, they paid the price for their stupidity.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade was not as nice as the Xin government. The Special Operations Brigade stationed at the base station directly captured all the demonstrators, and the courts completed the trial at lightning speed. They were not given an opportunity to appeal and tossed into prison immediately.</br>
</br>
The thunderous reaction of Celestial Trade finally cooled some people's irrational brains down and learned who was the true owner of the country.</br>
</br>
However, the intensive measures are not without side effects. In the past two weeks, the situation in Xin was unsettled, and it even forced the presidential palace to issue documents and tighten the issuance of tourist visas.</br>
</br>
Of course, for the colonists on Mars, these things that happened on Earth have nothing to do with them. Perhaps when they call their loved ones, they could reveal snippets of the demonstration, but now, alien was still a strange term to them.</br>
</br>
Or, a disturbing term.</br>
</br>
After returning to the colony, in just one day, Askim's big mouth immediately let everyone know about the abnormality discovered at Mine 071. Now the entire colony knew that there may be buried Martians under their feet, and the atmosphere in the colonial chamber suddenly became strange.</br>
</br>
Just as Hong Zewei, the captain of the colony, had a headache about how to write this report, the Xin president Zhang Yaping had already ended his visit to Hua and departed for Russia.</br>
</br>
Negotiations in Hua were not smooth sailing, but driven by common threats and visible benefits, the two sides reached agreement on the core issues and established the basic framework for the Outer Space Defense Alliance.</br>
</br>
Russian President Putin personally greeted him at the Moscow International Airport. With the escort of the Russian Security Service, the convoy of the two presidents headed to Kremlin.</br>
</br>
Sitting across from Putin, Zhang Yaping watched the streets of Moscow, and his eyes swept over an armored vehicle.</br>
</br>
"Did something happen recently?"</br>
</br>
"A lot of things have happened. It depends on what you mean," Putin smiled and replied in English.</br>
</br>
"Things that need to be fixed by armored vehicles?" Zhang Yaping asked in a nonchalant tone.</br>
</br>
Putin grinned and then looked expressionless out the window. Zhang Yaping followed his line of sight. It was a temporary post built on the street. The soldiers on duty were looking at the convoy and saluting.</br>
</br>
"Just three days ago, some people tried to persuade me to leave a path for the Slavs."</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping raised an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
Before he came, he did some homework and learned about the financial oligarchy and ruthless politicians in Russia.</br>
</br>
It was also his biggest concern. If the Russian elites preferred escapism, then the negotiation was destined to fail.</br>
</br>
"Oh? How did you answer?"</br>
</br>
Until the soldier disappeared from his field of vision, Putin looked to Zhang Yapin and answered without much emotion.</br>
</br>
"I told them whether it was Napoleon, Hitler, or Aliens."</br>
</br>
"The Kremlin is in Moscow, and the Slavs won't go anywhere."</br>
</br>
"In the past, now, and in the future too."</br>

</br>
"It's already July'."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen held onto Yao Yao's little hand as they strolled around the streets of the Sixth Street, the bustling market gave him a sense of pride and accomplishment.</br>
</br>
Resources were becoming plentiful, people no longer looked impoverished, and the clothes on them were no longer made out of mutant fur or rags. Penniless people also no longer have to sell themselves as slaves. NAC's subsistence allowance didn't allow these people to live a comfortable life, but they could feed themselves.</br>
</br>
The neatly built concrete houses once again stood on top of the ruins, replacing the shacks that used to be made out of iron and wooden supports. The landscape that was originally only seen in the Inner Circle now was common in the Outer Circle, benefiting every survivor in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Order in the market no longer needed to be maintained by hanging human heads and bodies treated with formalin. The word law for the first time regained its meaning on this soil. If someone dared to destroy the order, NAC's fierce garrisons would be the first to let them know their own stupidity.</br>
</br>
Almost every month, Jiang Chen took a trip with his guards to the NAC area; sometimes in the Sixth Street, sometimes in Jia City, Hang City, or Hongcheng. Except for Yizhou Island, due to the distance, he visited all the settlements with more than 10,000 people.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street was undoubtedly the most prosperous among all settlements.</br>
</br>
The tours served the purpose of observing the people's living conditions but were mostly used to strengthen his own rule while maintaining his presence among the survivors. If he didn't appear enough, people wouldn't remember what he looked like.</br>
</br>
The guards in kinetic skeletons surrounded him while the power armors guarded them further away. They left enough space for Jiang Chen and Yao Yao while protecting them in the middle.</br>
</br>
No matter where they went, the sight of soldiers, traders, and civilians was always in awe and worship. Some people even stopped and took off their hats to pay tribute.</br>
</br>
As the General of the NAC, he was not only the ruler here but also the spiritual leader of the survivors.</br>
</br>
Other than the people who admired him, many women worshipped him as a hero and all looked at him keenly, directly revealing their desire. Because of their excellent genes, other than those who were too "skinny", most of them were stunning.</br>
</br>
As for the little girl he was holding, they selectively ignored her. It was not uncommon for polygamy to exist on the wasteland. It was the privilege of the strong and the obligation of the strong to enjoy more spouses.</br>
</br>
Even the "civilized people" who only awakened not long after, after they accepted the reality that the civilization they've known has disappeared, most remained silent about natural selection, and some even were proactive in seeking stronger spouses. In order to live a life where they didn't have to survive on nutrient supply, those who passed through the "struggling period" chose to approach powerful men and ignore their many spouses.</br>
</br>
</br>
The sight of those women made Yao Yao very uncomfortable. The instinctive sense of danger made the little loli fearful, so she tightened her grip on Jiang Chen's arm.</br>
</br>
Before coming out, Sister Sun Jiao cautioned her to look after Brother Jiang Chen, or else there may be more and more sisters at home. She knows exactly what these women want through their gazes, but she couldn't do anything about them.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao pouted with some frustration as she thought about her own body.</br>
</br>
Only if my chest is a little bigger...</br>
</br>
Yao Yao sighed.</br>
</br>
Although Brother Jiang Chen occasionally kissed her and occasionally did some weird things, all the moves stopped before the final base. She was no longer a child. Even with the inhibitors stunting her growth, she was already twenty years old.</br>
</br>
However, Brother Jiang Chen always viewed her as a child. However, she could do the stuff that Sister Sun Jiao and Xiaorou do.</br>
</br>
If you don't try it, how do you know it's not good?</br>
</br>
"Do you not like summer?" Looking at the loli's puffed mouth, Jiang Chen misunderstood her mind and rubbed her fluffy hair. "This good weather is hard to come by."</br>
</br>
"I like it, but once summer is over, Brother Jiang Chen will rarely come back..." She moved closer to Jiang Chen and used her little hand to gently grab his sleeve as she muttered in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"How come? Yao Yao's hot pot is so delicious, I am looking forward to the winter." Holding onto Yao Yao's small hand again, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
It would be great if they could fix the Holy Shield System before winter arrives.</br>
</br>
The apocalypse already entered the Small Ice Age. For the next while, the weather would only get colder and colder. Wanghai City is located in the south and the effects of the storm would be bearable. Jiang Chen heard that at the beginning of the year, in the area north of Shangjing, the entire settlement was frozen into a dead city, and people who could survive turned into cannibals.</br>
</br>
How could the those deeper in the north survive? It was not a problem that can be solved with one or two bottles of vodka.</br>
</br>
No one would be spared from this global disaster.</br>
</br>
Taking Yao Yao's small hand, Jiang Chen took his guards to tour a few prosperous areas in the Outer Circle and finally ended this month's routine inspection.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was sent on the returning helicopter. Jiang Chen did not go back together with her. Instead, he went to the Inner Circle to see Chu Nan, who had just finished a scheduled meeting.</br>
</br>
Just half a month ago, when Jiang Chen came back last time, he hired a battleship from the Beluga Observation Station and transported a 50-person investigation unit across the Pacific Ocean to the North American continent.</br>
</br>
He had been curious for a long time. Asia was basically in shambles, so what would North America look like?</br>
</br>
Although both CCCP and PAC were unable to land in North America, nuclear weapons certainly made frequent visits.</br>
</br>
Similarly, Jiang Chen was also curious about Africa. While the whole world was showered by nuclear bombs, Africa surprisingly didn't get hit due to its poor economic status. They only got secondhand smoke from the monsoon crossing and fought themselves to death.</br>
</br>
However, he couldn't expand to Africa yet due to the distance. It was rumored that monstrous sea beasts over hundreds of meters long roamed in the Indian Ocean. It would be difficult to get to the continent. While many epic mutants dwelled in the Pacific Ocean, the risk was much lower taking the Bering Strait.</br>
</br>
After seeing Chu Nan, Jiang Chen got straight to the point.</br>
</br>
"Is there any news from North America?"</br>
</br>
"According to your request, our people have established an outpost on the West Coast."</br>
</br>
Although Chu Nan did not understand why the General was interested in North America, he sent a reconnaissance unit. A simple post was built on the ruins of the West Coast, and a radio communication base station was set up to contact the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and nodded with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then tell me about it. What is it like there?"</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"The West Coast has formed a separate force, mainly concentrated in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The battleship of the Beluga Inspection Station anchored on the shores of Los Angeles has sent boats to carry our people onto the continent."</br>
</br>
"After they arrived, our people set up a post on the West Coast and sent soldiers to explore Los Angeles. On the outskirts of Los Angeles, we encountered a kind of mutant similar to the mutant lizards we see here. They live in groups and act aggressively, but fortunately, our people first discovered them. After taking care of those lizards, our people successfully arrived in Los Angeles."</br>
</br>
"The entirety of Los Angeles is in ruins. It's similar to the situation in Wanghai, but the population there is much smaller. Based on what the local people said, there are large and small survivors' settlements on the West Coast, including the National Guards, the militia "Minutemen", the cannibal tribe 'Blood Hounds', and the mutated humans tribe 'Destruction'."</br>
</br>
"They have a developed animal husbandry industry. Our people have found large-scale Double-headed Cows on the edge of the desert in California. Their Double-headed Cows are larger in size because of the consumption of a fern that reduces radiation. The radiation of these cattle is low, and the meat quality is relatively delicious. The survivors mainly use crystals and mutant skins as the currency for trade. Also, there is something else that's interesting..."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan took out something from his pocket and gently dropped it on the table.</br>
</br>
"...We found this from the Beluga Station and brought it back."</br>
</br>
"This is... a bottle cap?" Jiang Chen was confused as he examined the bottle cap that was spinning on the table.</br>
</br>
"More precisely, it's a limited-edition bottle cap created by the Coca-Cola Company after 2168. It is equipped with Coca-Cola's nickel-plated anti-counterfeit logo. Each bottle of Coke has a specific number stored in the database of the Coke Plant in California." Chu Nan grinned. "The factory is now controlled by the California National Guard as their money printing machine."</br>
</br>
"Using bottle caps as currency?" Jiang Chen revealed a strange expression.</br>
</br>
"That's right. This is hard to forge. Every factory bottle cap is automatically recorded into the database. The entire West Coast and even some inland states are using this as currency. However, this bottle cap seems to experience high inflation. A good quality rifle requires 10,000 caps, an adult Double-headed Cow is worth 100,000 caps. A National Guard Power Armor requires an astronomical figure, close to ten million I think."</br>
</br>
"Where did they get so much nickel?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Although nickel was not a rare earth material, it was more scarce than rare earth materials on the wasteland, let alone North America which was already scarce of nickel. It was due to the already high demand for nickel. From power armor to tanks, every product depended on this particular metal. The amount recycled from wastes was not enough, and Jiang Chen relied on the modern world to solve NAC's nickel crisis.</br>
</br>
</br>
In order to smuggle a bit of nickel from the NAC, the Northern Alliance District tried all different kinds of means, but the survivors on the West Coast actually used nickel to produce bottle caps?</br>
</br>
"They certainly don't have that much nickel." Chu Nan shrugged, then laughed. "So when our people proposed a trade with the California National Guard, the first thing they asked about was, 'Do you have nickel? '."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen already understood. For the survivors on the West Coast, nickel served the same purpose as gold. Nickel standard instead of gold standard? Or the "security code" standard?</br>
</br>
In addition, Jiang Chen gained some other information from Chu Nan. For example, since the survivors used nickel to "cast coins," presumably their industrial level shouldn't be high. At most, they would be comparable to the Sixth Street four years ago, building rifles to power armors by hand.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan looked at Jiang Chen and already guessed what his boss was thinking, so he asked, "What is your plan?"</br>
</br>
He was worried about the boss suddenly making a rash decision and sending thousands of soldiers to California to liberate North America. Even though he believed that NAC's force could easily dominate the rest of the world, it served no purpose.</br>
</br>
Now NAC's sphere of influence was between Wanghai and the Wu City region. They could easily expand to the southern provinces rich in resources. It served as an advantage to control the West Coast all the way across to the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen certainly understood the drawbacks.</br>
</br>
"The West Coast post is to be maintained at its current size. It will likely alarm the local forces if we expand."</br>
</br>
"Don't let our people just be idle. Get them to investigate what specialty products are worth bringing back, and then research what the local survivors lack in addition to metal resources. In three days, I need you to provide me with all this information in a report."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan smiled confidently. "No problem, maybe it won't even take three days."</br>
</br>
"Right, there is still one more thing I need your input in."</br>
</br>
"Please go ahead," Chu Nan said respectfully.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to build a navy. What do you think?" Although he said it was an issue he wanted to discuss, his tone revealed his certainty. He has thought about forming a NAC Navy since a long time ago.</br>
</br>
It used to be unnecessary, but with the expansion of the NAC, its own market was far from enough to feed the booming industry. NAC's expansion must be built on trade routes and the role of the ocean played a bigger and bigger role.</br>
</br>
However, the ocean was controlled by the Beluga Observation Station.</br>
</br>
Previously hiring Beluga Station to escort NAC was due to NAC's lack of energy to expand to the ocean, while also being worried that these guys with guns and rifles will end up becoming pirates. As for the sonar to repel away small marine mutants, Camp 027 already created a prototype, ready to be put into action at a moment's notice.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan was thrilled to hear the news.</br>
</br>
"General is wise!"</br>
</br>
"No need to flatter me, I asked you for your opinion." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"NAC should have had its own navy long ago! If you have to ask me, this is my only opinion." Chu Nan ​​laughed and slapped his thigh, then after recollecting himself, he looked at Jiang Chen with seriousness, "I share the same opinion as you. NAC's ocean must be maintained by NAC itself. The only trouble now is what will the Beluga Station think of this."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned when he heard the concern.</br>
</br>
The opinion of the Beluga Inspection Station was indeed a problem. Now the oceans in the entire Pan-Asia region were almost monopolized in their hands. Any fleet that wished to conduct offshore trade must sign a protection agreement with them.</br>
</br>
If NAC started to develop a navy, it would indeed affect their interest.</br>
</br>
Unless he could find a suitable entry point...</br>
</br>
Carefully weighing the pros and cons, Jiang Chen's sight unconsciously landed on the Pan Asia map on the wall. When his eyes moved to the sea near Wanghai, a brilliant idea suddenly came to his mind.</br>
</br>
A suitable reason, or an excuse.</br>
</br>
Even if the Beluga Station was displeased, he would have the perfect excuse.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

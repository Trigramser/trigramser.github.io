<div class="caption">Chapter 1027: Mars Colonization Plan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Even the closest calculated distance from Mars to Earth was hundreds of times the distance between Earth and Moon. A distance that would even take light three minutes to travel. Under the current technical conditions, it was unrealistic to establish a supply line to and from the Mars colony and Celestial City.</br>
</br>
At present, the research plan developed by the Aerospace Research Institute in the apocalypse was to design an engine capable of making return trips between Mars and Earth. The engine must accelerate a million-ton transport ship to escape velocity 60,000 kilometers per hour, so the duration of the trip would be between a week to half a month. Although the technical barriers were overcome long before the war, no engine drawings were available for reference. So the engine must be redesigned based on the technologies of their predecessors.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt this was the greatest misfortune.</br>
</br>
The Zhenghe Space Colonization Ship could accelerate to one-tenth of the speed of light. However, the researchers involved in the design of the engine were invaluably talented and definitely didn't stay on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Since establishing a supply line was impossible for the time being, it meant that the colony on Mars must be self-sufficient. It must have a higher resource utilization efficiency than the lunar base, and the production cost of its equipment reflected the challenge.</br>
</br>
At the end of the tour, Kelvin gave Jiang Chen a number.</br>
</br>
The cost of the entire facility totalled 25 billion XND, and 90% of the structure must be manufactured through industrial 3D printers. It only took 20 people to burn off the market value of his public company which made even Jiang Chen feel the pain.</br>
</br>
On the first Friday after his return to Xin, it was time to launch the Mars Colonization Plan.</br>
</br>
On top of the offshore platform of Celestial City, Jiang Chen sent twenty colonists to the space elevator. After shaking hands with them, they were personally presented with commemorative medals in recognition of their contributions and sacrifices for the space industry.</br>
</br>
Upon arrival in Celestial City, they would receive a week of training. At the end of the training, they would board the ship and sail to Mars tens of millions of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
For now, it was a one-way ticket. In the next few years or even a dozen years, they would spend their lives on the barren Mars. At least until return flights were possible, they wouldn't be able to see their loved ones even once.</br>
</br>
The scenes of parting were touching. All the people present were in tears, witnessing the families of the heroes and heroes saying goodbye. Media from all over the world recorded this historic moment and spread the news to every corner of the global community.</br>
</br>
The responses from NASA and SpaceX were quite calm after Celestial Trade beat them to a completely manned mission to Mars. They had fully prepared for this day since the completion of the space elevator.</br>
</br>
</br>
SpaceX silently canceled their Mars mission originally scheduled to start in 2020 and focused on adjusting its business focus to the development of asteroid resources.</br>
</br>
However, all this had nothing to do with Jiang Chen. Regardless of whether SpaceX adjusted its business strategy, he never considered them a competitor in the space race.</br>
</br>
As for the reactions of the UA and Hua, he also hadn't considered them too much.</br>
</br>
After end of the ceremony, Jiang Chen cleared all of his plans and spent his weekend leisurely. He woke up naturally in the morning, spent the afternoon surfing or just lay on the private beach sunbathing. As for the evenings, even if he didn't want to, he would be dragged into the gentleness of his girls.</br>
</br>
Occasionally, only occasionally, when Xia Shiyu couldn't handle his embrace, she would seek help from Ayesha who happened to be peeking. It was only when she woke up the next day when she would feel ashamed of everything that happened last night.</br>
</br>
Good times always flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was May.</br>
</br>
With Celestial Trade joining the regional conflict, the Ukraine war situation welcomed a historic turning point. Following Jiang Chen's orders, Celestial Trade soldiers who helped to advance the front line to the east bank of the Dnieper River stopped all attacks. They began to take a defensive stance. Other than maintaining air support, most of the ground forces had withdrawn from the front lines.</br>
</br>
It wasn't the time to win.</br>
</br>
NATO wouldn't allow Ukraine to fall to the east, and Jiang Chen didn't like the idea of satisfying the polar bear at once. However, he couldn't be too obvious with his reluctance. After all, his employer paid money. Fortunately, Arrow sent 20,000 mercenaries to Ukraine and launched mobile warfare against the militants in the northern towns. This also gave an opportunity for Celestial Trade to maintain the stalemate.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Celestial Trade's reluctance gave the Arrow commander an illusion of "winning". At the end of April, the two divisions of the Ukraine Army launched a new round of attack.</br>
</br>
A total of 120 tanks, 327 armored vehicles, 27 armed helicopters and 10 fighters participated in the war. Steel shambles and tarred black smoke spread throughout every inch of the eastern suburbs of Dnepropetrovsk.</br>
</br>
If it wasn't for the two Celestial Trade brigades' timely rescue, they would've almost done it. Both sides suffered a lot of casualties with Ukraine ending up in defeat. The two divisions returned to the west bank of the Dnieper River.</br>
</br>
Because of the tragic defeat of the Ukraine Army on the east bank, the Ukraine president was almost forced to step down. However, with NATO support, he managed to stay in office.</br>
</br>
The two sides were deadlocked on both sides of the Dnieper River, and no one could gain an inch. The situation finally eased.</br>
</br>
In addition to carrying out the airstrike mission, Aurora-20s occasionally snuck into the airspace of Poland, Frankberg, and even France. Following Jiang Chen's orders, they cooperated with Ghost Agents to search for Carmen's whereabouts.</br>
</br>
Carmen was certainly devious. Since the assassination at Pilsner, he seemed to have disappeared. All the events in which he must appear in public were given to his spokesperson or professional manager. He completely hid behind the scenes. Occasionally, he resurfaced only to quickly disappear again.</br>
</br>
Even with the help of high-tech investigative means, it was difficult to pin a person's whereabouts in massive Europe. What's more, with the strong grasp of Freemasonry inside its home base, the organization's power integrated and was entrenched into every aspect of the continent. If Carmen didn't want to reveal himself, the possibility of catching him was almost zero.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents operating in Europe previously captured traces of Carmen's activities in Switzerland and Finland, but when they arrived, he had long escaped.</br>
</br>
But it wasn't like they gained nothing.</br>
</br>
On the morning of May 4th, Monica Geller, who returned from Europe to Coro Island, brought two interesting pieces of news to Jiang Chen...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1028: The Destination of the Secret Fligh</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Earth time, May 4th.</br>
</br>
In the vast space tens of millions of kilometers away from Earth, a spacecraft travelled at a constant speed.</br>
</br>
In this spacecraft without any apparent trace of life, a young man lay inside. He wore a respirator and lay quietly in the hibernation chamber. His bodily functions seemed to have completely stopped. The entire hibernation chamber was attached to the cockpit. The inside of the glass was scattered with ice shards that just looked like an ice coffin.</br>
</br>
The blue signal light flashed dim, accompanied by a quiet noise. The mist slowly floated out from the gaps on both sides of the hibernation chamber and was removed by the fan located inside. The top glass cover slowly opened, and the entire hibernation chamber was split into four steel shells that began to retract to the back.</br>
</br>
"Hibernation has now ended..."</br>
</br>
An electronic voice without any emotion rang in his ears. Liu Qingpeng opened his eyes, then moved his stiff limbs. Taking off the respirator, his stomach twitched abruptly. He bowed down and tried to vomit, but nothing came out except for his stomach acid.</br>
</br>
In order to prevent the food in his stomach from damaging the internal stability of his body due to decay, he only ate nutrient supply for three days before the flight.</br>
</br>
Holding the control in his hands, the feeling of coldness gradually faded. After a while, Liu Qingpeng recovered from the state of discomfort.</br>
</br>
"I... am here?"</br>
</br>
"I am connecting the navigator for you... please wait." The electronic voice spoke again after it had confirmed the pilot's heartbeat, and the green signal light flashed. Soon, a burst of static noise entered his ears and began to become more clear.</br>
</br>
"This is the command center. Please respond after hearing this message."</br>
</br>
Liu Qingpeng adjusted his breathing. He pressed on the helmet and turned on the microphone. "Stingray A-1, received."</br>
</br>
Navigator: "I am very happy to hear your voice again. It seems that you are still alive... static..."</br>
</br>
Liu Qingpeng smiled and moved his sore neck. "Can I take this as your blessing?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
From the ground command center to his current position, even electromagnetic waves must take four to five minutes. However, with quantum entanglement communication technology, the distance of tens of millions of kilometers was eliminated. Although there was noise mixed in the communication, it was fairly clear.</br>
</br>
Following the instructions of the navigator, he re-corrected the route and the Stingray began to slow down.</br>
</br>
In his current position, he could observe unnatural black spots with optical instruments.</br>
</br>
This discovery made him both excited and anxious. He was excited by his luck; no accidents had occurred on this flight of death. He was anxious because even the navigator couldn't tell him what was waiting for him out there.</br>
</br>
He glanced at the Gauss Rifle plugged on the right side of the cockpit. However, the rifle which cost one million XND didn't give him an increased sense of security. He was even wondering if he encountered an alien with a laser gun, would this expensive "toy" come in handy?</br>
</br>
</br>
"Move close to the UFO. If the other side attacks... static..."</br>
</br>
The communication from the ground command center was abruptly interrupted. Liu Qingpeng frowned and restarted the communication device, but he still couldn't receive any signal.</br>
</br>
"Communication shielded?" he murmured while rubbing the safety in his hand. He examined the unnatural blackness of dozens of kilometers through the optical sight.</br>
</br>
There was no extra energy for him to change course, fly out of the communication-shielded area, and obtain new instructions. With only one chance for contact, only twenty-four hours were left for him to investigate the target.</br>
</br>
Traveling a distance dozens of kilometers took the Stingray A-1 a few hours. When the dark UFO was close to a distance that could be observed by the naked eye, the Stingray finally ended its deceleration phase and reached a relatively static state.</br>
</br>
All communications were blocked; even the drone showed no images after being released.</br>
</br>
Looking at the darkness a few hundred meters out, Liu Qingpeng hesitated for a moment. He then gritted his teeth and pulled out the Gauss rifle from his right leg. He buckled the gun to his spacesuit then manually opened the cockpit before jumping into the darkness.</br>
</br>
In the boundless space, the fear programmed in his genes instinctively overwhelmed him.</br>
</br>
After taking a few deep breaths, he finally overcame his biological fear. His arms bent backward, controlling the small nozzles with his joints, and drifted out to the UFO.</br>
</br>
When he approached the ten-meter mark, the oddity disappeared abruptly. In front of his flashlight, a silver-white ball about 10 meters in diameter suddenly appeared in his vision. At this moment, he could only conclude that this was definitely not a natural phenomenon.</br>
</br>
Liu Qingpeng raised the Gauss Rifle, controlled the nozzle to adjust his speed, flew around the ball, and found a twisted fracture on the back of the ball. On the steel-like frame in the fracture, fragments of meteorites could be seen.</br>
</br>
"It was hit by a meteorite? What a coincidence..." Liu Qingpeng whispered aloud, but he was secretly relieved.</br>
</br>
The energy of the flying object was obviously exhausted and couldn't dodge an incoming meteorite. In fact, when he came in, he still had some concerns. If the flying object suddenly flew away, he really wouldn't be able to get back.</br>
</br>
The spherical flying object was three levels in size and the middle level was the widest. On this flying object, he didn't find any traces of aliens nor any traces of hibernation chambers or even a cockpit.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was unmanned itself, or perhaps he was unable to understand the way in which the higher beings operated the flying object.</br>
</br>
"It seems that this toy isn't useful after all." Liu Qingpeng barely forced out a smile and lowered the muzzle. He walked back and forth in front of the ball and carefully checked every corner while collecting evidence.</br>
</br>
This aircraft should've belonged to a certain civilization, and in all likelihood, it was a civilization that had disappeared in the passage of time.</br>
</br>
Nature erased everything that existed in it, leaving behind only the wreckage floating in boundless space.</br>
</br>
It took about 30 minutes. Liu Qingpeng captured every corner of the flying object. After collecting one gigabyte of data, his mission was completed.</br>
</br>
This should be the case.</br>
</br>
However, just as he returned to the middle layer, he stood next to the platform that he had first examined. He used the flashlight to unintentionally find a dent on the flat table.</br>
</br>
The dent was very special, as if only the light at a certain angle could make it appear.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Frowning, he reached out and touched the dent. At the same time, a prism of light illuminated from the platform. A rounded sphere slowly rose from the other side of the platform, separated from the platform, and floated above the platform.</br>
</br>
This lost civilization seemed to be fond of spheres.</br>
</br>
Looking at the fluorescent ball, Liu Qingpeng, unable to control his curiosity, reached out...</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1029: A Historic Discovery</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was easy to grab the ball. The imagined scenario of him being bounced back didn't happen.</br>
</br>
However, when he tried to move the ball, the unnatural resistance made him stop.</br>
</br>
There was no gravity in the universe, but the inertia of matter itself made it resist any changes in motion. Liu Qingpeng looked at the small ball, thinking it was peculiar. His right hand, which touched the ball, did not feel like it was touching a small ball, but a massive meteorite.</br>
</br>
"What the hell is this stuff, and how is it so heavy?"</br>
</br>
Liu Qingpeng cursed as he took out a mass analyzer that resembled a spatula. He knocked on the ball with force.</br>
</br>
A muffled "bang" passed through the spacesuit into his ears. The ball just moved slightly and slowly drifted to the other side of the flying object. At this moment, the mass analyzer recorded the reaction force and the time, as well the micro-velocity change of the ball's velocity. Based on all the parameters, it calculated the mass of the ball.</br>
</br>
When Liu Qingpeng saw the data sent to his helmet, his eyeballs almost popped out.</br>
</br>
"One hundred kilograms? How's that possible? What's the density of this thing? Even osmium doesn't have this density."</br>
</br>
Osmium, which has a relative atomic mass of 190, was currently known as the heaviest metal that existed in nature. He immediately realized that he might've made a significant discovery. If possible, he wanted to report his findings to the ground command center immediately, but he was unable to do this because of the breakdown in communication.</br>
</br>
Controlling his propulsion, Liu Qingpeng slowly floated over and held the ball in his arms. As he approached the edge of the flying object, he kicked against the wall and flew out of the fracture with the ball.</br>
</br>
Carefully avoiding the sharp metal frames, he returned to the empty space. He opened the markers in his helmet and locked on the Stingray. Then he adjusted the output power of the nozzles to the maximum and pushed forward the ball weighing more than 100 kilograms.</br>
</br>
With an extra one hundred kilograms hanging on his body, he was afraid that the nitrogen in his spacesuit wouldn't be enough to "brake", so Liu Qingpeng flew slowly. His previous trip that only took him fifteen minutes now took him over an hour to complete.</br>
</br>
The ball was placed in the cockpit of the Stingray and he carefully fixed it in the compartment behind the seat. He immediately opened the navigator and established the return trip according to the data previously calculated by the quantum computer.</br>
</br>
However, at that moment, the red signal light flashed on the operation interface.</br>
</br>
"Warning, mass parameters are changed. Insufficient energy to enter return orbit. Please reduce the load inside the spaceship and restart the navigation system."</br>
</br>
Liu Qingpeng's heart sank to the bottom. He almost forgot the immense mass of the ball. One hundred kilograms was already equivalent to the mass of one adult.</br>
</br>
</br>
He heistated for a moment. He bit the bullet and reached out to the platform on the right side of the seat. He opened the safety and yanked out a ring.</br>
</br>
With a slight tremor, the two laser cannons located below the Stingray A-1 were separated from the fuselage, and the attack module worth tens of millions of XND was abandoned. He could only leave the economic analysis to his superior to determine if he made the right decision.</br>
</br>
The signal light was still flashing red, and the cold electronic voice was still so impersonal.</br>
</br>
"Please reduce the load on the spacecraft."</br>
</br>
Looking at the remaining five kilograms of load exceeding the value, Liu Qingpeng was sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, I already tossed the attack module. It still wasn't enough? Wait, there's still the magazine..."</br>
</br>
Since the laser cannons already drifted away, he didn't feel too bad when he ejected the magazine. Two box-shaped power supply modules were left behind. When he watched the value returning to neutral, he was finally relieved. If he still needed to reduce the load, other than unloading himself, he didn't even know what else he could throw out.</br>
</br>
After restarting the navigator and setting the route, he waited for the Stingray to leave the communication shielded area, then he immediately restarted the communication module on the spacecraft.</br>
</br>
"This is Stingray A-1. Command center, please reply..."</br>
</br>
"...This is the command center. Navigator 01 continues to serve you."</br>
</br>
The command center, which was originally in a state of gloom due to losing Stingray A-1, erupted in a cheer after communication resumed. Not long ago, several space experts were still arguing whether his failure was due to a communication failure or because of the UFO attacks.</br>
</br>
And now it seemed that these arguments were unnecessary.</br>
</br>
The quantum computer calculated the returning orbit at the fastest speed. The navigator immediately sent the latest orbital data to the hero who was tens of millions of kilometers away, guiding him on his journey home.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the one gigabyte of captured pictures was sent back to the ground command center with the restored communication channel. This valuable information happened to prove Kelvin's previous hypothesis that the UFO was indeed a masterpiece of a foreign civilization.</br>
</br>
This historic discovery was no inferior to the geographical discoveries centuries ago. The century-long debate could finally be settled—they weren't alone.</br>
</br>
It was almost foreseeable that if these photos were made public in the international community, that would undoubtedly create an unprecedented earthquake in every field. However, Celestial Trade would never disclose these photos and all data would be treated as top secret for at least 50 years.</br>
</br>
"Minister, please take a look at this."</br>
</br>
Kelvin's assistant walked next to him and handed a printed photo to him.</br>
</br>
"This?" As Kelvin examined the photo, the frown grew more apparent on his eyebrows. He picked up the photo and examined it more carefully.</br>
</br>
It was a picture of a small ball with its size, mass and other information marked next to it. When he saw the data in the mass column, he paused to process it for a moment. Then he turned to his assistant with a peculiar expression and knocked on the photo with his knuckles.</br>
</br>
"Is this unit wrong? One hundred kilograms? How is this possible?"</br>
</br>
"There's no mistake in the data... Although I thought he was wrong at first, he insisted that he hadn't made a mistake."</br>
</br>
"How did he start acceleration?" Kelvin looked at the assistant and asked in disbelief. "If I remember correctly, the Stingray X-1 series aircraft has a weight limit except for the C-1 freight type."</br>
</br>
"He ejected the two laser cannons under the spacecraft and a power supply module used as the magazine." The assistant swallowed and said seriously, "If this wasn't a trick by aliens, we might've discovered a new element that we've never seen or imagined before."</br>
</br>
"Look after the situation for me. I have to make a call."</br>
</br>
Kelvin clearly also realized this. He gave the command to his assistant, then walked to the door hastily.</br>
</br>
While walking, he clicked twice on his wrist. The call was to Jiang Chen's office.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1030: A Not Interesting Piece of News</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On the morning of May 4th, Jiang Chen met Ms. Monica at the top floor office of Future Building. Although she was also in a black long skirt, compared to their last meeting, she was so much thinner that her high cheek bones were even more visible.</br>
</br>
It was evident that she had been under high stress which took a toll on her physically and emotionally.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked the assistant to change the coffee into hot cocoa.</br>
</br>
Monica smiled and nodded to show her appreciation for the boss' kindness.</br>
</br>
Holding the hot cocoa in her hand, she cleared her thoughts and began to report on her work.</br>
</br>
"Carmen is still missing. We've tracked evidence of his whereabouts in the estates of Switzerland, Finland and other places, but we didn't encounter him. However, when tracing his whereabouts, we intercepted a letter to the Krupp headquarters, which revealed very interesting information."</br>
</br>
"It's this letter? There are still people who don't know how to use e-mail in the 21st century." Picking up the envelope that was already open on the desk, Jiang Chen grinned. "What do these numbers mean?"</br>
</br>
"A special password." Monica nodded. "After deciphering it, we found out that this is a cargo transfer document."</br>
</br>
"What cargo?"</br>
</br>
"The wreckage of the K1 kinetic skeleton, a small portion from Country F, mostly from Ukraine."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
The thing he worried about the most had still happened.</br>
</br>
No war could end unscathed. Even with the most advanced technology, the Orbital Airborne Brigades of Celestial Trade still suffered more than 20 casualties.</br>
</br>
As the most violent process between two civilizations, war was a method of learning and influencing both sides. The most direct method was the tools used to kill. Before the Spaniards landed in the Americas, the indigenous people still used bows and spears, but in just over a decade, the tribes learned how to use the weapons of civilized people.</br>
</br>
That was one of the reasons why Jiang Chen always used power armor and the Tiger II tank as secret weapons, and he never directly entered a battle.</br>
</br>
"Did they make any progress?" Jiang Chen asked thoughtfully.</br>
</br>
"They reversed engineered the K1 kinetic skeleton to a certain degree and created an exoskeleton code named 'Lightning'. But neither the load capacity nor the defensive capability is comparable to our model; it's more bulky and heavy."</br>
</br>
"But these fakes have been able to defend against light weapons and improve the survivability of soldiers on the battlefield. Am I right?" Jiang Chen looked at Monica, who was hesitant, as he smiled nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"That's the case." Monica nodded. "The parts of the 'Lightning' exoskeleton produced by the Krupp Group have been delivered to Arrow and shipped to Ukraine for field testing."</br>
</br>
In fact, the military exoskeleton had been around for a decade, but it hadn't been applied in the real world. With the introduction of Lightning, Jiang Chen could only sigh. Even without the wreckage of the K1 kinetic skeleton, they would sooner or later be able to design exoskeleton equipment suitable for modern warfare. Celestial Trade only accelerated the timeline.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, the product was ultimately a fake, and the gap couldn't be closed in a short time.</br>
</br>
They couldn't copy neural connection technology and material science research was difficult to reverse engineer. Even knowing the molecular configuration of the K1 kinetic skeleton polyethylene shell, that didn't mean they could replicate the design. The core technology was still controlled by Celestial Trade. As for the mechanical mechanism and functional design, they could freely copy it if they wished.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's fingers gently tapped on the table. After thinking for a moment, Jiang Chen told her. "After a few days, when you go back to Europe, see if you can get the design of the 'Lightning'. It'd be best to get the weapon test report. We must know their progress at least. As for Carmen... Keep an eye on his whereabouts, but don't let him take all of our attention away."</br>
</br>
"A very challenging task, but I think I can try." Monica smiled.</br>
</br>
It was easier to steal information from Krupp Group than to chase an invisible person.</br>
</br>
"I heard you had two things to report. The other thing is?" Jiang Chen then asked.</br>
</br>
"When we traced Carmen Rothschild, we discovered an underground factory by coincidence. From their products, we found this thing." Then Monica took out a black ball from her jacket and gently placed it on Jiang Chen's desk. "They call it the Golden Apple, although it has nothing to do gold. It's said to be related to the legacy of the Third Reich in World War II, but we haven't determined any connections."</br>
</br>
"That's to be expected, because they don't even know themselves."</br>
</br>
Looking at the Golden Apple, Jiang Chen's expression was strange. He didn't expect that after Carmen got the Golden Apple from him, he started to produce it at "scale." The Remnants of the Void told him personally that their connection with this timeline had been cut off.</br>
</br>
Even if they produced more "radios", the station had already closed down.</br>
</br>
"I'm very curious... How did they produce this stuff?" Jiang Chen picked up the black ball and examined it carefully</br>
</br>
Monica put down the hot cocoa in her hand and answered: "It's believed that they used embryonic stem cell differentiation technology which contains extracts of primate brain tissue."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and put the Golden Apple aside.</br>
</br>
"Just leave this here with me for now. You can stop the investigation of the Golden Apple for now. It doesn't have any purpose."</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
Monica's expression was hesitant. She felt that there might be some big hidden secret. It would be a pity if she missed any valuable information. However, Jiang Chen knew it was a bottomless pit without any return.</br>
</br>
"Do as I say," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Monica bowed her head.</br>
</br>
After knocking on the door, the assistant walked in and took away the coffee cup. When she asked if Monica would like another hot cocoa, Monica declined. She had reported all her work and she still need to report to her boss, Ayesha, on New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen entered deep thought as he watched Monica leave.</br>
</br>
The EU integration movement was in full swing, and Carmen's whereabouts were still unknown. He couldn't think of an idea that could track a person's coordinates, even in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Just then, Kelvin's call interrupted his thoughts again.</br>
</br>
After picking up, a smile finally formed on his face.</br>
</br>
After listening to one piece of bad news and one not-so-bad news, one piece of good news had finally arrived.</br>
</br>
The Stingray A-1 sent to the UFO a month ago successfully entered return orbit. Just like they had previously hypothesized, the UFO did come from an unknown higher civilization.</br>
</br>
It was good news because, according to the astronauts who performed the mission, the UFO turned out to be wreckage or relic abandoned for many years.</br>
</br>
And the most exciting thing was that he also brought back something interesting from that flying object.</br>

</br>
"Let me guess, you are Lin Yi?"</br>
</br>
The girl shook her head. Her big, curious eyes blinked with innocence as she looked straight at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
If she dyed her long luscious black hair silver and then put on some red contact lenses, then she would be no different than Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Well... then you are?"</br>
</br>
"No. 1004," The girl quickly replied.</br>
</br>
Not even a name? That's simple.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a bitter smile. He rubbed her head to comfort her.</br>
</br>
The girl felt the sympathy in his eyes, but she showed a confused expression to his sympathy. Clearly, she did not understand the reason for his sympathy, or that she did not think that being nameless was worthy of sympathy.</br>
</br>
"Do you want a name?" Jiang Chen looked into her eyes.</br>
</br>
The girl shook her head and then suddenly raised her head, as if she had received some kind of signal, and ran away.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the direction No.1004 ran to, then he stood up straight and looked at the newly built research institute in his backyard</br>
</br>
Ten days ago, the institute was completed, and Lin Lin's sisters had already moved in. Because she was very pleased with the design of the institute, Lin Lin took the largest laboratory as her own and then moved the experimental equipment piled up in her room there.</br>
</br>
She finally made space in her bedroom.</br>
</br>
To make it easier for Lin Lin, the construction party created a small door that could access the research institute from the mansion based on the request of Jiang Chen. Other than Lin Lin who used the door every day, her sisters occasionally slipped into the backyard of the mansion to stare at the flowers and plants.</br>
</br>
As for why Jiang Chen was standing there, the story began two days ago.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The clock turned back to two days ago, May 4th.</br>
</br>
Kelvin called from the ground command centre and reported some good news to him. The Stingray A-1 tasked with the UFO investigation successfully returned. It did not find signs of life on the flying object and brought back a sample.</br>
</br>
Although the sample had not been delivered, the relevant data was transmitted to the ground command centre. However, many experts and scientists were puzzled by the fact that the density of the sample reached an astounding 2,985 grams per cubic centimeter.</br>
</br>
Intuition told Jiang Chen that it was something incredible.</br>
</br>
In fact, it was not even intuition. Hawking, who participated in the research project of extraterrestrial civilization, directly told him that this discovery was likely to completely change the perception of matter in modern physics. There was no single element that could form a substance with such high density while still being stable.</br>
</br>
Since modern science could not explain it, Jiang Chen immediately sought help from the future.</br>
</br>
After Kelvin organized all the data, Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse. He tossed the USB stored with the highest class confidential information to Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
</br>
After receiving the data, Lin Lin completely locked herself in her lab for two straight days. Seeing her serious attitude, Jiang Chen did not bother her. He decided to stay in the apocalypse during those two days and had been taking morning and evening walks in the backyard.</br>
</br>
Just then, he saw Lin Lin at the door.</br>
</br>
The little girl didn't seem to have slept at all. She was yawning while walking toward him.</br>
</br>
"I'm finally done... Wait, did you do something to my sister?" Lin Lin, who was still tired, suddenly woke up as if someone had just shocked her. She suspiciously looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What could I have done? Am I a pervert..." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin answered this question with her eyes and said with vigilance, "I warn you, No.1004's research is related to space theory. She is my assistant in transporting living things into interdimensional travel. You can't give her strange thoughts."</br>
</br>
"Whatever. Don't accuse me the moment you see me… So, did you figure out what the ball was?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shook her head and sighed.</br>
</br>
"2,985 grams per cubic centimeter, the density is 2,985 times that of water at room temperature. It's far denser than the densest base metal, Osmium, with a density of 22.6 gram per cubic centimeter. Do you know what this means?"</br>
</br>
"What does it mean?" Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"59 grams per cubic centimeter, which is the density of the red dwarf closest to the solar system, is not even close to the small ball you gave me. This means that the force between the particles in the ball is even more terrifying than the red dwarf's own gravity. This force has transcended the scope of Van der Waals forces. If I am not mistaken, there is only one possibility left."</br>
</br>
"What possibility?" Jiang Chen was in a state of shock.</br>
</br>
"Strong interaction force. That small ball is composed of countless hadrons and even quarks..." When she raised this hypothesis, Lin Lin revealed a strange expression. It looked like she was doubting her own hypothesis while being extremely convinced.</br>
</br>
"Strong interaction force material? Is there any technology in the field before the war?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin looked at him like an idiot and glared at Jiang Chen. "How could there be such a thing. Until the war, there was a lot of controversy about the existence of strong interaction force materials. Did you really just ask if this technology existed?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had long been used to Lin Lin's ridicule, and he didn't want to argue with her, so he opened his hands and shrugged. With thick skin, he said, "I don't understand this. That's why I asked you. The smart Miss Lin Lin. Can you explain it to me? If the ball is a material made by strong interaction force, how advanced is it compared to pre-war technology?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin had no resistance to flattery. Her chin rose up proudly and she patiently explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The so-called strong interaction force refers to the force acting between hadrons. The strong interaction force holds the most ordinary matter together because it confines quarks into hadron particles such as the proton and neutron. As the strongest force in the four fundamental interactions, its range of action is only at the range of 10 to the minus 15 meters. Exceeding this range, the strong interaction force will decay exponentially."</br>
</br>
"If the particles in the material are composed of strong interaction forces, it means that the spacing between the particles must be within 10 to the minus 15 square meters unless the atoms are forcibly removed and all electrons are discarded. However, this creates another problem. A strong interaction material that completely discards electrons will carry a very large positive charge, attracting a large number of electrons, which in turn destroys its particle structure."</br>
</br>
From the perspective of modern physics, this material shouldn't exist.</br>
</br>
As for the future.</br>
</br>
Who knows about the future?</br>
</br>
The development of science itself was a process of constant imagination, constant application, and constant self-denial.</br>
</br>
As for the civilization that has mastered the strong interaction force material, Lin Lin couldn't answer as to how advanced they were. It was not something that could be judged by time.</br>
</br>
However, Lin Lin was sure about one point. That is, from the understanding of particle physics alone, the gap between the two civilizations was insurmountable.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1032: Seagull Class</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know how to react when Lin Lin used the word insurmountable to describe the gap between the two civilizations.</br>
</br>
Fortunate? Of course, there was no sign of life activity on the flying object, and it had clearly already been abandoned by its owner for a long time. At least he didn't need to worry about some higher civilization knocking on his door. A colonization ship from 20.5 lightyears away was already giving him a headache. If another unfriendly neighbor dropped by, he wouldn't be able to play this game anymore.</br>
</br>
Confused? Perhaps a little. He didn't understand why the flying object was abandoned. If they could create strong interaction force materials, there shouldn't be anything that could threaten them in this universe, at least in his view.</br>
</br>
"Don't get any crazy ideas. Wait for the one hundred kilograms ball to arrive, and remember to bring it to me." Lin Lin patted Jiang Chen's shoulders, but her hand was slapped away by Jiang Chen and she also received an eye roll.</br>
</br>
"Arrive? Do you think this is a courier service? We'll see."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen poked Lin Lin on the forehead and contently looked at the cocky Lin Lin who squatted down covering her forehead. Jiang Chen ignored her dissatisfied gaze and turned to the mansion...</br>
</br>
It took a month for them to arrive at the destination. The return trip would take two month's time.</br>
</br>
Before the ball was brought back, any discussion about it was meaningless. Jiang Chen temporarily set it aside. After the ball was brought back, he would think of a suitable reason to bring it back to the apocalypse for Lin Lin to study.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't understand one point. Since he could discover that unknown flying object, then there was no reason the government or institution wouldn't be able to identify it. It would be reasonable to say that the discovery of extraterrestrial civilization would shock the world. However, he did not ever hear any news about it in the history of the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin gave him an explanation.</br>
</br>
"If you discovered this, would you brag about it?"</br>
</br>
After hearing Lin Lin's rebuttal, Jiang Chen suddenly understood.</br>
</br>
If it were him, after gaining the knowledge of an extraterrestrial civilization, he would pretend nothing happened and research in secrecy. Even if he couldn't discover anything, he would not disclose this information to scientific research institutions in other countries, let alone the public.</br>
</br>
Without the need to think, If the UA learned about the UFO, it would definitely state that the opportunity to communicate with extraterrestrial civilizations should belong to the whole world. Then they would ask Celestial Trade to send the ball to Area 51. By then, even Xin's friendly partners Hua and Russia, would certainly euphemistically agree, except for the last point.</br>
</br>
There is no real friendship between the countries. When it is necessary, even enemies can become brothers, and brothers may turn into enemies. History has proven this countless times.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't stay in the apocalypse for long. He only stayed for three days before making his return.</br>
</br>
However, he didn't come back empty-handed. He brought the Red River X1 engine from the Aerospace Science and Technology Research Institute in his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
This engine was similar to the Sea Dragon 07 transport spacecraft engine designed by East Asia Heavy Industries for the Pan Asia Space Group. Jiang Chen bought the engine from White Beluga Station for 20,000 credits. As for how similar the engines were, it would be left to the imagination.</br>
</br>
Since no intellectual property rights existed in the apocalypse, he used it to his advantage.</br>
</br>
The Red River X1 engine would be installed on the newly developed Celestial Trade transport spacecraft as the first large-scale "transportation" spacecraft operating between the Earth and the Moon. It would also technically be the first spaceship.</br>
</br>
In theory, the performance of the Red River X1 already reached the capability required to sail to Mars, but the technical difficulty of the transport spaceship was not just the engine. The overall design was hindered by the other internal shortcomings. The spaceship was designed a year ago, now this spaceship about to set sail could only be used to carry out missions between the Earth and the Moon.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade still lacked experience in "shipbuilding", they needed to learn through trial and error.</br>
</br>
Even scientists from the apocalypse wouldn't be able to help them. The scientists from Aerospace Science and Technology Research Institutes primarily focused on engine design. Designing an entire spaceship was not something that could be completed by one research institute, especially given the lack of drawings for reference.</br>
</br>
Located in the gravity-free dock of Celestial City, a spaceship about 600 meters was quietly docked under dozens of robotic arms. Under the command of the engineer, the Red River X1 engine was attached to the empty slot at the end of the spaceship, completing the final step before "entering the water."</br>
</br>
Since it was designed according to the specifications of this spaceship, it was a smooth process without any accidents.</br>
</br>
"Perfect design... Where did you get this engine?" Looking at the new engine being attached to the spaceship, Kelvin exclaimed in amazement.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not answer his question. He only smiled.</br>
</br>
The new spaceship was designed as a transport ship but could be converted for military use. The orbital airborne brigade that required ten small transport ships to deploy would only require one large transport ship.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen avoid the question, Kelvin knew he shouldn't pursue further and changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, our new ship doesn't have a name yet, do you have any good suggestions?"</br>
</br>
"What is the tonnage of this ship?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Fifty thousand tons."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes as he pondered for a moment. Then he said.</br>
</br>
"Fifty thousand tons? Let's call it Seagull."</br>
</br>
"Seagull? Fine... as long as you like it."</br>
</br>
Kelvin was speechless about Jiang Chen's naming capability. He gave a spaceship with a defining significance to the world such a common name without any significance; a name that'll likely end up making history in itself.</br>
</br>
However, with the boss' pleased expression, he couldn't raise his opinion and defaulted to the name.</br>
</br>
With the completion of the Seagull, the capacity of Celestial Trade's freight capacity increased to more than 500,000 tons between the Earth and the Moon. The increase in capacity brought a monumental change to Celestial Trade's space resources development capability.</br>
</br>
The most intuitive example would be the lunar colony. Five hundred new colonists arrived on the surface of the Moon along with the new habitat unit on the Seagull. With the arrival of new colonists, the outpost of the Celestial Trade colony already exceeded one thousand.</br>
</br>
To celebrate this historic moment, Celestial Trade held a press conference to share this good news with the rest of the world.</br>
</br>
At the same time, through this rare opportunity, they made two announcements.</br>
</br>
The Moon colony will be renamed to Lunar City, now deserving of this name.</br>
</br>
As for the second, Lunar City will be open to individuals or institutions around the world for investment.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1033: Lunar City</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Outside of Future Building, media from all over the world gathered. The first-floor conference center was jampacked with people and the reporters all rushed into the venue. With staff's guidance, the reporters were seated and the photographers continued to hold their cameras of different sizes. All the lenses were focused on the podium in front of the venue, waiting for the press conference to begin.</br>
</br>
They didn't wait long. The hour hand had just passed nine o'clock and a soft light lit up from behind the podium, Jiang Chen in a black suit went to the podium, calmly picked up the microphone, and smiled at the cameras.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for coming to the press conference of Celestial Trade. I am representing Celestial Trade's Board of Directors and I warmly welcome you."</br>
</br>
"I believe that everyone is aware of the content of the press conference from the materials in your hand. According to our discussions with Xin Space Agency, the Xin Lunar Colony will be officially renamed Lunar City. The city will also exist as a Xin municipality similar to Penglai. Xin will have judication and sovereignty right to Lunar City and Celestial Trade will enjoy autonomy as a Xin enterprise in the city."</br>
</br>
When these words came out, there was a wave of discussion. Although these reporters from all over the world already learned Celestial Trade's decision to change the name of the lunar colony, the material didn't mention sovereignty over Lunar City!</br>
</br>
The right to establish sovereignty on the Moon? What a joke!</br>
</br>
Many journalists, especially Western journalists, raised their hand high. However, Jiang Chen just glanced at them and gestured for the journalists to wait.</br>
</br>
It is not the Q\u0026A stage yet, keep your question to yourself.</br>
</br>
"At two o'clock yesterday morning, the Seagull-class transport ship carrying 500 colonists arrived at the Moon. The population of Lunar City has now exceeded 1,000. Considering that the production units have been fully developed, from tomorrow on, Celestial City will open a travel route to Lunar City for all Xin citizens and foreign tourists holding passports!"</br>
</br>
The venue was quite quiet, and the reporters who were eager to ask questions stared dumbfoundedly at the podium. It took them a full ten seconds to digest this explosive piece of information. Someone began to applaud, then it quickly turned into thunderous applause that deafened the venue.</br>
</br>
And those netizens watching the live broadcast from their computers already began to cheer. They quickly typed on the keyboard while venting their excitement through countless comments and shares.</br>
</br>
[Damn, this is amazing!]</br>
</br>
[It's shameful, our manned Moon mission is still in the research stage, and they have already built a city on the moon. Maybe by the time we go up, playgrounds and cinemas would be everywhere.]</br>
</br>
[Stupid, why do we need to research. A ticket is enough to go, why bother researching? I think all those in aerospace research should be laid off. The funding can be used to build more schools and help the poor.]</br>
</br>
</br>
[What did the aerospace research do... It's not like we have not been putting in all our effort, it's just that the competition is too spectacular. What do you want us to do?]</br>
</br>
[I don't care about anything else. Does this mean I can travel to the moon? I already have a tourist visa, who can tell me what I need to do next?]</br>
</br>
The discussion on the Internet began to heat up, and the press conference continued.</br>
</br>
After a brief overview, it was the Q\u0026A period. The reporters were eager to raise their hand. It was finally their home court. They did their best to ask the trickiest and toughest questions.</br>
</br>
"You mentioned that Xin will have the sovereign right to Lunar City. I want to ask if you learned about the United Nations 'Outer Space Treaty' signed in 1967. The second article clearly stipulates that 'outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.'" The Colombian Television reporter immediately raised a sharp question.</br>
</br>
From the eyes of the reporters in the front row of the venue, Jiang Chen saw similar questions. Obviously, all the reporters questioned the legitimacy of Celestial Trade's sovereign declaration.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen adjusted the microphone and answered the question.</br>
</br>
"The Outer Space Treaty was signed half a century ago. Until a year and a half ago, in the past half a century, only a total of twelve people successfully stepped onto the Moon... Yes, until a year and a half ago. Obviously, the United Nations "Outer Space Treaty" signed in 1967 is no longer applicable to the modern aerospace industry that has expanded at lightning speed."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then paused, and his voice grew louder and more powerful.</br>
</br>
"We have the technology that can send more people to the Moon and even other celestial bodies to expand the territory for human civilization. Why do we still use ancient treaties to imprison our footprints? You think that we are declaring sovereignty on something that doesn't belong to us, right? Wrong! Absolutely wrong! We are just guaranteeing our legitimate rights and interests, proving that the wealth we create belongs to us. I remember that you are a UA citizen, and you declared the rights to America. At least we declared on no man's land, but your claim it at the expense of the Indians."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's rightful and just speech turned the Colombian Television reporter speechless.</br>
</br>
To be precise, the reporter actually had more to say, such as "this is totally two different things", "Indians are also an inseparable part of our society, please do not make statements that are harmful to the unity of society and people." However, according to the rules of the press conference, a reporter could only speak once unless in special circumstances. Jiang Chen indicated that he could sit down, so he could only swallow his rebuttal.</br>
</br>
The second reporter stood up and was a reporter from a Xin TV station. He naturally could not question the sovereign right of his own country. His concern was related to economics.</br>
</br>
"In your speech, I noticed that you mentioned that Celestial Trade will open up Lunar City to the public. Does this mean that ordinary investors can also participate in the development of Moon resources? If so, in which areas is Celestial Trade more inclined for cooperation."</br>
</br>
After listening to the reporter's question, Jiang Chen smiled and replied cheerfully.</br>
</br>
"As a city, Lunar City naturally has no reason to be isolated from the world. We have never intended to monopolize the resources of the Moon. Like Penglai, we welcome every visitor, immigrant, and investor."</br>
</br>
"As for the specific areas of cooperation, there are too many. Rare earth resources, tourism, entertainment, metallurgical industry, power export, these five industries will be the economic pillars. Other than power export that involves confidential and sensitive technology for cooperation, investors have their choice to join us."</br>
</br>
"The premise is to recognize the sovereignty of the city."</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1034: Diverging Opinions</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was not only the reporters present or the netizens watching the live broadcast that were focused on the press conference, but top government officials around world also kept a close eye on the progress.</br>
</br>
Not many developed countries in the world welcomed immigrants; the number was even smaller for developed countries that welcomed Hua immigrants, and Xin was one of them. The top officials of Hua did not expect that the palm-sized country would have replaced the UA in just four years, becoming the first choice of destination for immigrants.</br>
</br>
The most unbelievable thing was that although they have raised the threshold of immigration several times, the number of Hua immigrants in Xin increased every year. In the past four years, the average number of immigration out of Hua reached 1.25 million, an increase of nearly one million compared with the previous four years. Of the 1.25 million people, 80% of immigrants chose Xin as their second home.</br>
</br>
What was even more incredible was Xin's government and Celestial Trade's attitude toward immigrants. They didn't seem to care about the security and economic problems that may arise from the influx of immigrants. They seemed to always find ways to digest these fast-growing populations. So far, Xin economy did not show any sign of weakness but was thriving with prosperity.</br>
</br>
As for security, it was even more remarkable. No criminals and terrorists exist there. Occasionally, a few robbers would smuggle into the country but were quickly tracked down by law enforcement drones, waiting to ambush them in the darkness of streets and teach them a lesson on how to properly behave.</br>
</br>
Needless to say, the name of Lunar City also gained the support of many Han. Not only because of the intimate feeling brought by its name, but also the cultural identity that is stronger than a blood connection. However, not everyone was pleased with the status quo.</br>
</br>
"Humph! Lunar City? This time it is Lunar City. What is it next time? If they are not restricted, they will create a Heaven City?"</br>
</br>
In a quaint tea room, a man with a square face said with a gloomy expression on his face.</br>
</br>
At this moment, the head of the top ten families has gathered here. Even the Wang family, who fell from the position of power, sat in front of the long table. Although none of them were still in power, all of them were inextricably linked to the center of power. Although their opinions didn't represent the opinions of the Republic, they could at least represent the opinions of some important people...</br>
</br>
For example, the man with a square face was Zhao Youyong, the head of the Zhao family. The two giants, Hua Aluminum and Hua Telecom, were controlled by the Zhao family. The former was a leading enterprise in the production of rare earths, and the latter was a large state-owned communication giant, demonstrating the family's wide influence.</br>
</br>
The reason why he held a prejudice against Xin was because the rare earth produced from the Moon impacted the rare earth market in Hua. Under the banner of Hua Aluminum, the Zhao family constantly smuggled rare earth metal and profited for foreign companies. However, because of Future Mining's rare earth deposits in the ocean and on the Moon, it squeezed into the market and further reduced the export price of rare earths. This resulted in at least billions of losses for the Zhao family every year.</br>
</br>
</br>
Zhao Youyong's speech received support from some people, but only some people.</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo put the teacup down and began to act as the mediator,</br>
</br>
"If they like the name, we can't stop them, right? Since the people like it, let them call it that. Anyway, we won't lose anything."</br>
</br>
It's not the Liu family that lost.</br>
</br>
Although Zhao Youyang thought this, he only sneered and didn't answer. If other people said this, he could rebuttal, but not against Liu Xiangguo. The Zhao family didn't have the cleanest record, so he didn't need to offend people over commentary.</br>
</br>
Future Mining's entry into Hua's rare earth market indeed harmed the interests of the country, but objectively speaking, the damage was actually limited. Although monopolizing the global market for rare earth exports, Hua never gained the pricing power of rare earth materials. The cost for sustainable mining and the cost for one-time excavation was night and day. The rare earth materials sold at a large discount naturally didn't come from sustainable sources. This became a tool for some people to fill their own pockets and resulted in a loss of more than ten billion US Dollars a year for the country.</br>
</br>
However, everything has two sides. Originally, it was a way to earn foreign exchange and join the WTO, so the country didn't control the export volume of rare earths. Now the country became the second largest economy, Hua didn't need the money anymore, but the rare earth materials problem couldn't be effectively managed.</br>
</br>
"I feel that we need to introduce a stricter visa review bill, especially for travelers to Xin. There are more and more people immigrating to Xin, and most of these people are highly educated talents. I am worried that it will have an impact on our economic environment." Another elder raised a very practical problem.</br>
</br>
"I agree," Zhao Youyong said immediately. "It is one thing thing to strengthen the cultural ties between the two countries. But there should be a certain limit for everything. Now that this is going to be more harmful than beneficial, it is necessary to begin managing this issue!"</br>
</br>
"What's the problem? We have a lot of people." Ye Qinghua sipped his tea and smiled. "When the British people ran to the Americas, no one stopped them from going out, right? We can't control everything and let the West make fun of us."</br>
</br>
Zhao Youyong glanced at Ye Qinghua with a gloomy expression. The Zhao family never had a friendly relationship with the Ye family. Now Ye Qinghua's open disagreement made him quite dissatisfied.</br>
</br>
However, Elder Ye did not care about his attitude. After he finished speaking, he started to enjoy his tea again.</br>
</br>
With the help of Celestial, Hua Aerospace Group achieved rapid growth and development. As a representative that obtained the rights for asteroid mining, the Ye family naturally rose in importance. Ye Qinghua didn't have a problem with Jiang Chen at all. The only regret was his granddaughter and Jiang Chen did not become a couple.</br>
</br>
"Okay, there is no point for us to discuss this here. We are just chatting and let's not hurt any relationships because of this." Seeing it was about time, Liu Xiangguo started to mediate and comfort Zhao Youyong.</br>
</br>
From the start of the tea party to now, they have been discussing Celestial Trade for almost half an hour, but they didn't reach any conclusions. This situation was quite rare. But for Liu Xiangguo, it was already the best result he could anticipate.</br>
</br>
Then, someone asked a very practical question.</br>
</br>
"If the United Nations wants to vote on the legitimacy of the Xin's sovereign right of the city, how should we vote?"</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man, who was sitting at the head of the table that didn't speak a word, spoke slowly.</br>
</br>
"Abstain."</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo was stilling smiling while drinking his tea as if he had already expected this. Ye Qinghua secretly let out a sigh of relief. Neutrality is always the most conservative choice. Zhao Youyong's expression was still dark, making it difficult for people to read him.</br>
</br>
With their own thoughts, this tea party continued.</br>
</br>
The same discussion, in different forms, happened all over the world. The UA Capitol was in a fierce debate at the start of the press conference. They even held a cabinet meeting to discuss how to deal with Celestial Trade's aggressive expansion on the Moon.</br>
</br>
But regardless of their conclusion, Celestial Trade would not make any changes.</br>
</br>
In a round of sincere or fake applauses, Celestial Trade's press conference came to an end.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1035"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1035: Ticket Price Going to the Moon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Moon belongs to all of mankind, who represents all of mankind?</br>
</br>
In 1967, the Outer Space Treaty was signed. In 1969, Neil Armstrong placed the Star-Spangled flag on the surface of the Moon.</br>
</br>
The so-called United Nations resolution was just a piece of paper, just like the United Nations itself. The Moon belonging to all of mankind was also nonsense, it would belong to the people capable of landing there.</br>
</br>
On the surface, Jiang Chen was open for investment of Moon resources to investors in other countries. But in reality, he just wanted to tie the international capitals with him to develop the Moon for him.</br>
</br>
No matter how much money the investors invest in the Moon, it would be on the basis that they recognize the legitimacy of Lunar City. Any expansion would be within the boundary of Lunar City and not New New York or New Moscow.</br>
</br>
Taking a thousand steps back, if someone dared to declare independence, Jiang Chen would shut down their water, electricity and air. The controllable nuclear fusion power generation technology was the threshold of interstellar colonization. After several decades when other countries make a breakthrough in power generation, the moon would already be covered in Celestial Trade factories.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the flight from Lunar City and Celestial Trade was established, Celestial Trade opened the ticket sales channel on its official website and issued 500 tickets per day for a price of 100,000 XND.</br>
</br>
A journey 400,000-kilometer in distance, the maximum flight speed was close to 10 kilometers per second. It would take half a day to arrive at the Moon's orbit. The 100,000 XND may be an unaffordable price for most people, but the world never lacked rich people.</br>
</br>
For those wealthy people without a place to spend their money, no matter if the Moon was worth it to go, it was a prestigious opportunity for a visit. At least at some high-level gatherings in the future, they could bloat about their trip when they meet their business friends. "Hey, look at the Moon in the sky, I have been up there. It is probably the most beautiful place I have seen in my life. I highly recommend you to go take a look…"</br>
</br>
With only one Seagull-class transportation ship (TS Seagull), the transportation capacity from Celestial City to Lunar City was quite valuable. In addition to people, TS Seagull also transported goods from the Earth. The most important restraint was that Lunar City could only accept 10,000 tourists and it was not the right time to develop the mass public market.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen still underestimated the attraction of Moon tourism to the billionaires and millionaires. On the first day of ticket sales, the tickets for the seven flights within one week were sold out in almost one second. If it were not the for the fact the ticket only sold seven days in advance, most likely the entire month's tickets would be wiped clean in a few seconds.</br>
</br>
The boss of a real estate company had foreseen the frenzy, so he ordered his assistant with foresight and tasked more than one hundred employees to purchase a ticket for him. Just when he thought victory was within his grasp, the few milliseconds of defeat snatched the ticket from the jaws of victory. He stared at the anxious assistant in front of him and slapped the table.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Fools! You guys play with your phone all day long. Now you can't even buy a ticket for me!"</br>
</br>
The assistant sobbed. "Boss, you can't blame us. This is not a flight or train ticket. There are only hundreds of tickets around the world. And I suspect, someone is definitely using a software!"</br>
</br>
When the boss heard his, he was even more furious. "Other people can use software, why can't you use it. I asked you to find people to buy the ticket for me, did you find a bunch of construction workers? I could have done this myself!"</br>
</br>
"But, but we don't have the software..."</br>
</br>
"With so many programmers in the company, why didn't you just get a few people to write one! I asked you to find people, but you need to use your brain!"</br>
</br>
The secretary stopped speaking. He knew that the boss was angry and just wanted to vent his anger at someone. It was better to keep his head down rather than defend himself.</br>
</br>
Just then, the company manager rushed in,</br>
</br>
"Boss! The ticket is being sold on the black market."</br>
</br>
The boss heard the news and immediately asked, "How much is it?"</br>
</br>
"For the ticket three days from now, one million...USD."</br>
</br>
The boss cursed in his mind when he heard this as it was the price of a house. But then when he thought about it and how he developed real estate himself, he changed his mindset and said in pain.</br>
</br>
"Hurry and place an order, buy... buy ten for me!"</br>
</br>
Originally, he only intended to buy three to take his wife and son to see. But when he thought how the fare may go up even higher, he would make his money back by selling it at a higher price.</br>
</br>
As a result, with the thirsty market and the pump of a large group of people with other intentions, the ticket sold on the black market sold at more than ten times the price with the highest ticket priced at more than 10 million USD.</br>
</br>
Another interesting phenomenon was that the tickets that had seats closest to the front of the ship were sold at a higher price. This was especially true for the earlier flights. An example would be seat 001 on the first flight. It was bought by a Middle-Eastern billionaire at a price of 15 million USD.</br>
</br>
Although 1,012 people have already stepped onto the Moon, everyone wanted to be the 1,013th. Even if history wouldn't remember the name of the 1,013th person who landed on the Moon, it would still be worth the fame. Jiang Chen admitted that he had underestimated wealthy people's desire for exclusivity. The pumped up ticket price had seriously affected the normal operation of Seagull flight.</br>
</br>
As a result, while all previous sales didn't change. From the second day on, the sales of the tickets began to be linked to the buyer's identification information. The ticket holder must hold the same visa and passport as the ticket purchaser to board the ship. The measure immediately crushed the scalpers who got a taste of the sweet profit.</br>
</br>
At the ground command center, looking at the green spot on the radar that marked the Seagull, Kelvin expressed his opinion.</br>
</br>
"I think we sold our tickets too cheap. The black market is selling them at 10 million USD. We can totally price a ticket at 200,000 XND. At this price, we can at least make 50 million per flight."</br>
</br>
The Seagull used a nuclear fusion generator for its power, and the total value of the helium 3 battery and the bismuth metal consumed by the flight was less than one million XND. Even adding the ship's maintenance costs and labor costs, the cost of a trip would only be two million XND.</br>
</br>
With the current fare, the flight would make so much money!</br>
</br>
The Lunar Colony that burned money for a whole year finally achieved breakeven through electricity sales and rare earth mining. It finally achieved profitability through tourism! Two days before the first flight, the excited Kelvin was in tears. Now he was complaining that the fare was set too low.</br>
</br>
A quite fast change in attitude.</br>
</br>
"The fare will come down sooner or later. The tourists' enthusiasm can't just be supported by the rich. What's more, we have a golden mountain behind us, would you still care about the coins in the workers' pockets?" Jiang Chen teased him.</br>
</br>
"Isn't there a proverb? Mosquito meat is still meat." Kelvin shook his head.</br>
</br>
"There is another proverb, the one that can be successful doesn't care about the small profits."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted Kelvin's shoulder and left the confused Kelvin alone.</br>
</br>
Standing beside the route map for a long time, Kelvin's eyebrows locked together, thinking about the words Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
After a long time, he finally squeezed out a sentence with a serious expression on his face.</br>
</br>
"...How come I remember that the proverb as, the one that can be successful doesn't care about the details?"</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1036: Air Show at Celestial City</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Under Jiang Chen's order, Future Heavy Industries integrated its twenty industrial space stations in Celestial City and assembled a technical team involved in the design of the Seagull-class to establish a subsidiary called Xin First Shipyard. It had begun the production of a second Seagull-class.</br>
</br>
The order of the second transport ship was still made by the aerospace department of Celestial Trade, but the new ship would not include a passenger cabin, but only cargo with low technical requirements. At present, Lunar City could only host a certain number of tourists, increasing the number of flights would only make it more difficult.</br>
</br>
The mission of this transport ship was to transport rare earth materials. The rare earth-rich Moon soil would be sent to Celestial City for processing, and then Future Mining would send the processed ore to Earth and access the international market.</br>
</br>
By the time the new 500,000-tonne transport ship was built, the "boats" that were previously used to transport rare earth mines could be retired. The capacity of five Stingray C-1s making two trips combined was less than the capacity of a single trip of the Seagull, and they weren't faster.</br>
</br>
The Stingray C-1 retired from the transportation route would be sent back to the shipyard on Celestial Trade. After the mining module was replaced by the transport module, the Stingray would be sold at a discount to Future Mining and join the asteroid mining fleet.</br>
</br>
There was another story with the newly built transport ship.</br>
</br>
After Kelvin learned of Jiang Chen's poor naming ability, he didn't ask Jiang Chen to name the ship again. Or rather, he never mentioned this to Jiang Chen and discussed with the technical team. They came to the decision of simply printing the name "Sea Dragon" onto the body of the ship and sending it as a report to Jiang Chen's desk.</br>
</br>
The name didn't matter since Jiang Chen thought it was troublesome to give something a name. He also never considered putting his own name on a transport ship. He thought that a ship worthy of his name would at least by a carrier-class ship more than ten million in tonnage. He would rather let the future generation name it for him.</br>
</br>
Just after learning about the name of the transport ship, Jiang Chen was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
History is always strikingly similar. The prototype of the Red River engine was the Flying Dragon 07 engine of the Pan-Asia Cooperation, and the engine scavenged by Beluga Inspection Station happened to come from the PAC Sea Dragon.</br>
</br>
Now the new ship not only inherited the engine of the Pan-Asia Cooperation but also inherited the name of the ship that had crashed in the future.</br>
</br>
Even Jiang Chen, who never believed in gods, was amazed by this coincidence.</br>
</br>
Perhaps, it was meant to be.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Shortly after the flight from Celestial City to Lunar City became available, SpaceX and other aerospace companies participated in the design of the Apollo X1. After being dismantled into pieces and packed into dozens of containers, they were sent to Ange Island port by freight. After it arrived at the SpaceX's leased warehouse in Celestial City, Apollo X1 was assembled.</br>
</br>
</br>
According to the agreement between SpaceX and Celestial Trade, the newly reborn Apollo would participate in the transportation route between Celestial City and Lunar City after it passed the safety qualification check. The rare earth materials were transported to Celestial City while crops and daily necessities on earth were brought to Lunar City.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was a tribute to a certain movie, the main structure of the Apollo X1 was designed to be semi-spherical. Compared with the long strip design of Russia's Oleg, the design offered more agile control and higher safety factor. The drawbacks were mainly due to the maintenance cost of the engines and the cost of the spacecraft itself.</br>
</br>
In addition to the Apollo X1, Jiang Chen also saw the Oleg in Moscow. The design of the 200,000-ton class was a size larger than the Apollo X1, and the capacity was also greater. However, compared with the 500,000-ton Seagull, both of them were miniature.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the UA or Russia, the two traditional aerospace powers did not currently have the capability to produce a 500,000-ton spacecraft. While they possessed the design capability, the technical barriers of the engine and power source were something that they couldn't easily get around.</br>
</br>
Perhaps they possessed more experience in aerospace manufacturing, but these problems were not solved by experience.</br>
</br>
In addition to the two traditional superpowers, the Ever Spring independently developed by Hua Aerospace Science and Technology Group also participated in the transportation route. The transport ship used the RM-320 engine purchased from Future Heavy Industries at a high price and all the other parts were design by the Hua Academy of Sciences. In appearance, the ship reflected an Oriental design.</br>
</br>
The mining speed of iron, aluminum, titanium ore and rare earth resources in Lunar City already far exceeded the transportation capacity between Lunar City and Celestial City. For Jiang Chen, he welcomed anyone willing to participate, otherwise the ores would be useless without a buyer.</br>
</br>
According to Jiang Chen's estimate, at least 50 ships with 100,000-tonage were needed to fulfill the ores' transportation demand.</br>
</br>
However, it was not something that could be rushed. Apart from Xin, there were only three countries capable of producing large transport ships.</br>
</br>
Although Nippon, ranked fourth in space technology, participated in the design of the Apollo X1's observing system and navigation system, the country didn't have the capability to independently manufacture a 100,000-ton spacecraft. The fifth-ranked India was ambitiously preparing to design a 500,000-ton "spaceship" that stood shoulder to shoulder with the Seagull. However, they didn't figure out how to make it move after completing the ship design.</br>
</br>
It was soon mid-May, and Celestial Trade held the first Aerospace Science and Technology Expo in Celestial City.</br>
</br>
If Xia Shiyu didn't remind him, Jiang Chen almost forgot. Future Heavy Industries' tweleve products would appear in the expo, of which seven were export products. The remaining five were only for exhibition, not to be sold.</br>
</br>
For example, the Stingray series aircraft that made countless people astonished. The P-1 mining type and the C-1 transportation type that had been eliminated from the fleet would be displayed.</br>
</br>
The expo would be held every year beginning from 2019. The significance of holding events was mainly to support other aerospace companies and help them find buyers. If Celestial Trade discovered something novel, they could also use this opportunity to procure it.</br>
</br>
To be honest, Jiang Chen did see a lot of interesting things at the air show, but he did not intervene in the procurement. He gave full responsibilities to the aerospace department, only they knew what they really needed in space.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu accompanied Jiang Chen to the expo. When they appeared in front of the public, they became the focus of the air show. From the beginning of the expo, a large group of people surrounded them. People handed him their business cards and after a short while, his hands were full of business cards of different languages.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was surprised by the fact that he stole the show from the Stingray X1.</br>
</br>
It was like putting the cart before the horse.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1037"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1037: A “Traitor“ From Far Away</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the lounge outside the air show, Xia Shiyu stuffed the business cards into a drawer before letting out a long sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
"I still don't understand. If we can produce ourselves, why do we give other people our order?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and did not answer.</br>
</br>
From the position of CEO, Xia Shiyu naturally wished for fewer competitors, but it was not something he wished to see. His identity was not just the shareholder of Future Group, but he also held many other positions.</br>
</br>
Whether Future Group or Celestial Trade all became leading giants with millions of employees worldwide, directly or indirectly providing jobs for tens of millions of people, all depended on him.</br>
</br>
To some extent, the Icarus effect already became evident on Future Group and Celestial Trade. That is, when the company was large enough and forms a monopoly in the market, the company's innovation would naturally be suppressed. The more conservative option would be to replace innovation and it would become the first consideration in managers' decision-making process.</br>
</br>
If Future Group and Celestial Trade only absorbed technology from the apocalypse like a sponge, in the short term, there would be no problem as they could easily form a monopoly. But what would happen after the monopoly?</br>
</br>
With only the technology of the apocalypse, there would be no chance of winning against the invasion of Harmony. Without competition, there would never be innovation. Jiang Chen dared to assert that if he did not open the space elevator to the international community and encouraged the development of other private aerospace companies, it would not be an exaggeration that Celestial Trade would use the same Seagull for the next century.</br>
</br>
Sometimes giving others some breathing room was also for his own benefit.</br>
</br>
"The space elevator has been built for so long yet I have rarely used it." Jiang Chen smiled and changed the topic as he gazed at the blue planet outside the window.</br>
</br>
From this angle, the Earth's pristine white clouds resembled an eggshell, under the distant sunlight, it reflected a faint glow. If the people on Celestial City didn't constantly stare in this direction, they would even have the illusion that Earth was just a mural on their windows.</br>
</br>
"It is also my first time being up here." Xia Shiyu pressed her face against the window. Her eyes gazing at the Earth glowed with fascination. She whispered softly, "Did you know? When I was young, I dreamed of being an astronaut."</br>
</br>
"It's normal. I wanted to be a scientist when I was a child." Jiang Chen smiled. "It turns out that the dreams of a child were not reliable after all. Let's not mention being a scientist, I gave most of the stuff I learned from university back to the professors already."</br>
</br>
"But you became the boss of scientists." Xia Shiyu joked.</br>
</br>
"And you also become the CEO of astronauts?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Just then, he received a call.</br>
</br>
</br>
When he opened the holographic screen and heard the voice from the other side, he couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
"I see." After a simple reply, Jiang Chen hung up the phone, used his fingers to slash the holographic screen into digital fragments, then sat up from the chair. He then told Xia Shiyu, who was standing next to him, "I need to head out for a moment."</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong at the air show?" Xia Shiyu asked.</br>
</br>
"No, it's just some work." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Affected by the policy and the deterioration of bilateral relations between Xin and the EU, only a few companies from the EU member states participated in this expo. However, policies were never absolute. Xin's counter-sanction against European companies were mostly aimed at the financial and commodity sectors. There were still many European companies that used the UK to partner with Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
For example, an aerospace company from Brussels, Belgium, participated in the first Celestial Trade Aerospace Science and Technology Expo, and also brought some very interesting information.</br>
</br>
"Is the information reliable?"</br>
</br>
Walking quickly in the hallway, Jiang Chen confirmed again.</br>
</br>
Tightly following Jiang Chen, Ayesha nodded.</br>
</br>
"Monica has verified the company in Belgium. Its main business is the production of high-precision gyroscopes and infrared Earth sensors. It is one of SpaceX's overseas suppliers and was registered in 1995. Its chairman, Alec Bruly, is a supporter of the Belgian opposition party. He opposed Belgian ruling party's political stance on the EU integration decision. He is demanding re-election..."</br>
</br>
"It's just that it is not passed by the parliament?"</br>
</br>
"Exactly." Ayesha nodded.</br>
</br>
"Interesting."</br>
</br>
An intrigued smile formed on Jiang Chen's face. He stopped at a door near the end of the corridor, walked into the door, and entered the room.</br>
</br>
When they saw Jiang Chen, the two Europeans sitting on the sofa immediately stood up. The middle-aged man with red hair stepped forward and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen, please allow me to introduce myself first. Alec Bruly. This is..."</br>
</br>
"Steven Radneck is my name," said the thin-looking man. Looking at Jiang Chen in excitement, he incoherently said, "Listen, you must stop him, the devil will ruin Europe! No, he will ruin the world."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Ayesha looked at each other, and Alec quickly pulled him aside and gave him a wink.</br>
</br>
"Calm down, man-"</br>
</br>
"I am a researcher from the Golden Apple Project." Once again interrupting Alec's words, Steven calmly confessed.</br>
</br>
Alec stopped, Ayesha's expression did not change, and Jiang Chen examined him a few more times.</br>
</br>
Although he admired his courage, after hearing his identity, Jiang Chen was still slightly disappointed, but he did not show it on his face. Instead, he whispered, "We don't care about the Golden Apple."</br>
</br>
Steven sneered.</br>
</br>
"That's because you don't know what experiments they are doing."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
However, Steven did not immediately continue, but subconsciously looked at his old friend Alec who stood next to him.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, he began. "Sorry, my friend, I can't drag you into this... You know, you are different from me. Hearing these things may put you in danger..."</br>
</br>
"One hour later I have meeting with a representative of the Russian Aerospace Industry Group."</br>
</br>
Alec immediately understood his friend's intention and left the office.</br>
</br>
There were only three people left in the office.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen invited him to take a seat.</br>
</br>
"Please feel free to sit."</br>
</br>
"Thank you..." Steven courteously waited for Jiang Chen and Ayesha to sit down before sitting across from the two.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen clicked on the holographic screen of the watch. Soon a robot dressed as a maid walked into the room and poured coffee for the three of them.</br>
</br>
Through the rising white mist, Jiang Chen looked at Steven, who was uneasy, and began the conversation.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Steven, no matter whether your intelligence is valuable to us or not, we will provide you with political asylum. Xin and EU member states have no extradition treaty. The Freemasonry also can't reach their hands into my backyard. You can be assured about this."</br>
</br>
"So now, can you talk about what exciting news you know?"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1038"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1038: Turning Poin</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Steven sorted out his thoughts and slowly began to narrate.</br>
</br>
"First of all, from the Golden Apple Project, you may feel what you hear next is obscure, but it is true. The experiment on Golden Apple can be traced back to the Freemasonry's discovery of extraterrestrial civilization during World War II…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped him. "You don't have to tell me the background of the Golden Apple Project. We know what the Golden Apple is for. It is used to communicate with an extraterrestrial civilization, right? But as far as I know, your research has not progressed."</br>
</br>
"We really have no progress with extraterrestrial civilizations," Steven stressed. "But it does not mean we have no progress in other areas."</br>
</br>
"Such as?"</br>
</br>
"For example, I found this in the research institute." As he made up his mind, Steven took a deep breath and slowly took out a box of cigars from his pocket. "This is a research report."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched him take out and slowly unfold a piece of paper rolled into a cigar.</br>
</br>
Looking at the crumpled paper, Jiang Chen moved closer. Although he could not understand academic reports, from the first few lines, he understood the abstract of the report.</br>
</br>
And his nonchalant attitude turned more serious.</br>
</br>
"The interference of the brain wave resonance effect on the nervous system?"</br>
</br>
Steven nodded and patiently explained to Jiang Chen the contents of this report.</br>
</br>
"In short, it's brainwashing. You know, we've accidentally discovered a very interesting phenomenon when we used the embryonic stem cell-induced differentiation technology to find a more efficient production method for Golden Apples... First, I have to clarify that I'm not involved in the follow-up experiment—"</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry, keep going." Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped his statement, indicating for him to focus on the topic at hand.</br>
</br>
Steven took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"We studied brain extract and found that if the brain extract is exposed to gamma rays, the cells will differentiate into a special substance while rapidly decaying and attenuating."</br>
</br>
"A special substance? What kind of special substance?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"It's similar to what we're looking for in the brain extract, but there are a few differences." A terrified expression appeared on Steven's face. "We were close to the results. If these substances can be modified slightly, the cost of producing Golden Apples will be reduced by several factors. However, a hypothesis was proposed that this special substance may be related to the mechanism of excitement..."</br>
</br>
"Be more specific." Jiang Chen reminded him.</br>
</br>
"The point is the hypothesis suggested by that person. The administration approved the sub-topic research and provided us with human subjects for the experiment. After the experiment, most of the subjects died because of brain death or excessive excitement induced in the brain, but a small number of people survived. And among those who survived, we summed up the results and reached a conclusion."</br>
</br>
</br>
"When a certain dose of radioactive material is used to stimulate a specific area of ​​the brain, it can interfere with cognition. For example, we succeeded in getting a certain subject to believe that he is a goat..."</br>
</br>
"I'll take this report." Realizing the seriousness of the problem, Jiang Chen picked up the report and immediately stood up. "Please stay here for a while, I will get someone to bring you a card. There is 10 million XND in the account."</br>
</br>
Steven stopped, then argued, "I am not doing this for the money—"</br>
</br>
"I know, but no one can have too much money, right? And your account in Europe is probably already frozen." Jiang Chen patted him on his shoulder and smiled, "This money is yours to keep."</br>
</br>
Steven stayed in the lounge alone, and Jiang Chen took Ayesha into the hallway.</br>
</br>
"Do we need to spread the news out?" Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"No, this is a serious matter. If it is done well, it may be a good opportunity for us to reverse the situation in Europe. Before we start, we have to discuss with our allies, we need their cooperation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then called Natasha.</br>
</br>
Although Natasha already withdrew from the Russian intelligence system, she would certainly be able to find the right person to take this matter over.</br>
</br>
Without spending anytime to flirt, Jiang Chen was direct.</br>
</br>
"If Frankberg knows that their chancellor is actually controlled by the Rothschild family, what do you think will happen?"</br>
</br>
Natasha sighed slightly, and soon realized what he meant; she whistled and joked, "This is a great question. Eighty percent of UA citizens know that the Capitol's shareholders are Wall Street, but can they do anything about it?"</br>
</br>
It was not that the Russian Federal Security Agency did not consider making the role of the Freemasonry in the integration of the European Union public, but the truth was drowned in countless conspiracy theories. In the eyes of most people, Rothschild Bank was only a second-tier bank. They thought that multiple European right-wing parties were manipulated by the Freemasonry was only a joke.</br>
</br>
The really clever trick was not to put a patch on the history or truth but to confuse the audience with a lot of false rumors. Not to mention the fact the Russian Federal Security Agency couldn't find any key evidence. Even with evidence, what could they do?</br>
</br>
"These are two topics, one is just to exert influence behind the scenes, but the other is related to crime against humanity, that is, interference at the cognitive level."</br>
</br>
"Brain? Crime against humanity? Wait, can you elaborate?" Natasha couldn't keep up with Jiang Chen's thought process and confirmed again.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen retold his conversation with Steven. He emphasized that the research institutions of the Freemasonry used the missing population as experimental subjects and studied brainwashing.</br>
</br>
Natasha then was aware of the seriousness of the problem. However, she did not immediately believe it but cautiously asked.</br>
</br>
"Can you determine the authenticity of that report? And the identity of the researcher?"</br>
</br>
"He is under our control. Our people will verify the authenticity of the intelligence in Europe."</br>
</br>
Having said that, Jiang Chen paused for a moment and emphasized again.</br>
</br>
"This is an opportunity. If we seize it, it may become a breakthrough. What the truth is, is not important. What is important is to guide people to believe what is the truth. Even if the Freemasonry does not brainwash the political parties in its sphere of influence, as long as we can reveal that they are suspicious in this regard, we can create a revolution in Europe.</br>
</br>
Natasha took a deep breath to calm her pumping heart.</br>
</br>
"I need to make a call, ten minutes... No, five minutes is enough. I will give you a reply in five minutes."</br>
</br>
"Hurry."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1039"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1039: Controversies</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen said, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</br>
</br>
Ghost Agents already helped the Russian Security Service transport weapons and equipment to the opposition party in Frankberg for over a year, but until now they didn't find a suitable opportunity to use these weapons. Both the insurgents and the Russian intelligence personnel were waiting for an opportunity, an opportunity to crush the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
Now, the opportunity emerged.</br>
</br>
"Researcher at the Institute of Rothschild Bank broke the news, illegal research on brainwashing human subjects"</br>
</br>
"Frankberg Prime Minister is controlled by a mysterious organization? Demystifying the story of the Freemasonry and European integration"</br>
</br>
"The European media is collectively silent, the poor people are living in lies"</br>
</br>
"This is bullsh*t! When did the New York Times start to report on these inconspicuous reports."</br>
</br>
Carmen slammed the newspaper on the table and rubbed his hand on his chin. Through the haze in his pupils, it was evident that he was not in the most pleasant mood.</br>
</br>
The research institute was indeed researching brainwashing technology, but he could swear to God that he did not use brainwashing technology on those politicians. Of course, if the brain specialists under his command could achieve a 100% success rate, he would not mind doing so. But without certainty, it would be a headache to just explain where the missing public figures went.</br>
</br>
Standing in front of Carmen's desk, his assistant hesitated for a moment, then finally reported.</br>
</br>
"The news was uploaded from the news channel of Future 1.0. At first, the news spread only on the Internet before being reprinted by newspapers. Not only the New York Times, but the global media are now reporting this research report. Now the entrance to our institute has been surrounded by protesters, demanding the research institute reveal the truth. Radical protesters even threw bricks and are burning flasks inside. Research work has completely stalled..."</br>
</br>
"Send some people with our newest equipment. I need the security there to be the best possible," Carmen looked at Johnson. " Your only task is to protect that institute, and if someone dares to enter our private property, shoot them!"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Johnson saluted.</br>
</br>
"Allow me to be blunt, this is not the best choice..." The assistant intended to add something, but Carmen stopped him with his eyes. He took two steps back and shrugged. "Okay."</br>
</br>
The assistant bowed his head and left the office.</br>
</br>
The office was quiet once again. After a long silence, Carmen again turned his eyes to Johnson.</br>
</br>
"Is the identity of the traitor determined?"</br>
</br>
"The researcher of the 7th Research Institute of the Golden Apple Mass Production Project, Steven Radneck." Standing next to the desk, Johnson reported.</br>
</br>
"Where is he now?" Carmen said with a sullen expression.</br>
</br>
"In Xin."</br>
</br>
</br>
"What about his family?"</br>
</br>
"Before he left the country, they already entered Russia. It is estimated that they already reunited with him in Xin."</br>
</br>
Sinking into the chair, Carmen was silent.</br>
</br>
The power of the Freemasonry in Xin was almost non-existent. It was not impossible to kill an individual there, but the risk and return would not be proportional. Even if he killed Steven, nothing would change about the current scandal. Instead, it may be used as ammunition.</br>
</br>
Just then, the phone on the table began to vibrate.</br>
</br>
After the phone vibrated for three seconds, Carmen reached for the phone and put it beside his ear. He didn't need to see the caller to know it was Peter.</br>
</br>
"God... What did you do? What is this human experiment? You didn't say any of this to me..."</br>
</br>
"It's all refugees, and refugees without registered citizenship. That's enough, enough of your false sympathy Mr. Peter. Now it's better to calm down with me and think about what we should do to deal with this scandal."</br>
</br>
"Wait, buddy, that news article says you are doing brainwashing experiments..."</br>
</br>
"Why, Mr. Peter, do you want to be a volunteer in the lab?" Carmen laughed sullenly which made Peter immediately shut his mouth.</br>
</br>
"Don't ask what you don't need to ask. It's best to think with your brain before you ask. If I really intended to brainwash you, would you still be able to call me with this tone?"</br>
</br>
After finishing this sentence, Carmen hung up and tossed the phone back on the table.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the mountains of southern Bava, Frankberg, this was the border between Frankberg and Austria. In the depths of the uninhabited woods, a cabin long-abandoned was full of people.</br>
</br>
The smell of tobacco hid the moldy smell of the woods, a pile of polished automatic rifles and ammunition were stacked up in the corners and tables. There were two maps placed on the table that had already begun to grow mushrooms. A traffic map and a blueprint for the research institute.</br>
</br>
"The plan is this." The Germanic head, holding the marker, placed symbols, lines, and arrows to indicate the course of action. "There will be a sniper that will support us, but after we enter the facility, we have to rely on ourselves."</br>
</br>
"What about the security system? If they locked the door of the institute internally, we can't carry enough explosives to blast the wall," said a bearded man.</br>
</br>
"Use this," the Germanic leader took out a USB flash drive from his pocket. "There will be a hacker who will help us remotely. As long as we plug it into a computer in the guardhouse, their security system is ours."</br>
</br>
"They can't give me some decent drones? For example, the ones that appeared in Ukraine with machine guns on the bottom." Playing with the beta-3 drone in his hand, an insurgent soldier complained.</br>
</br>
Among all the drone export models from Future Heavy Industries, only the beta-3 drone had the widest export range. However, since it was a non-military drone, it was necessary to make modifications before being used for military purposes.</br>
</br>
"Be content, this is our country. You can't expect others to finish all of our obligations."</br>
</br>
After that, the leader slapped the map on the table, looked at the soldiers around him, and sternly said.</br>
</br>
"Brothers, we have been waiting for this day for almost a year."</br>
</br>
"Tomorrow we will be on the battlefield. I hope that you have not forgotten the training you have received abroad."</br>
</br>
"I don't want to say anything more, tomorrow we will fire the first shot of this war. Some people will be hurt, some will be sacrificed, we have to fight with our own people. But no matter what happens, I hope that you will always remember, always remember our mission."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1040: Gunshots in Bava</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Central Bava, a small town on the Isle River.</br>
</br>
This small town with barely any foreigners throughout the year had people from Europe and around the world gathered here. They came from different countries and from different backgrounds. But at this moment they were wearing uniform T-shirts and holding slogans with the same central idea and surrounding a research institute shouting in different languages.</br>
</br>
"Open the Institute!"</br>
</br>
"Stop the inhuman experiment immediately!"</br>
</br>
"Release all human subjects! Release experimental details!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
To maintain order, the state government had to pull police from elsewhere to support the local police and put up yellow warning tape around the institute. The color seal reminded the angry protestors that it was private property.</br>
</br>
However, the protestors did not buy the idea at all. The uncooperative attitude of the institute made them feel more and more suspicious. The police's partiality made them sense the oddity in this situation more. They set up tents on the road outside the institute and broadcasted their protests with their mobile phones.</br>
</br>
More and more social justice warriors gathered there to join the protest.</br>
</br>
As the protest intensified, the director of the institute couldn't remain calm anymore.</br>
</br>
In order to calm people's anger, he risked his life, used a speaker, and began to speak to the crowd behind the wall.</br>
</br>
"...all of our research is within the framework of the law, and any rumors about the Institute researching brainwashing on human experiments are foolish and absurd...Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
However, before he could finish, a large brick the size of a fist flew out from the crowd. A young man with a baseball cap gave him a middle finger. Within two seconds, the young man was arrested by a group of police swarming him and pushed him to a police car.</br>
</br>
When the young man was detained, the police and the crowd clashed. The shouting and pushing made the scene extremely chaotic and the peaceful demonstration evolved into a violent conflict. Garbage and bricks were thrown over the wall and some landed on police and police cars.</br>
</br>
Carefully avoiding the bricks, the director of the institute evacuated behind the explosion-proof shield.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k! Are these people crazy?"</br>
</br>
Once back in the institute, the director named Carol cursed and slammed the speaker on the ground.</br>
</br>
In his heart, he already cursed Steven countless times. Because of that nobody's betrayal, the entire 7th Institute was pulled into the center of a massive scandal.</br>
</br>
"You should be glad that bricks are flying. I just found burning flask in the crowd. Although the guy hesitated and didn't ignite it. I encountered this weapon in Iraq. If even a little bit touches you, you will turn into a piece of charcoal." A mercenary joked as he put the explosion-proof shield aside.</br>
</br>
Carol eyed the mercenary and grunted while fixing his messy collar.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Look after your position, if you let the violent protesters in, you know what will happen. "</br>
</br>
"They can't get in," the mercenary shrugged and patted the pistol at his waist. "If they cross that door, we will shoot."</br>
</br>
Just as Carol walked into the institute, several vans were parked at a closed restaurant two blocks away. More than a dozen men wearing thick coats stepped out. They carried guitar cases or suitcases and hurried into the restaurant.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same time, on a hillside one kilometer away, a canvas bag was thrown into a patch of tall grass filled with weeds. A young woman took off her sunglasses and removed the parts from the bag.</br>
</br>
Within a minute, the chilling Ghost Sniper Rifle appeared in her hands.</br>
</br>
Kneeling on the ground, she released the stand, adjusted the scope, and tapped on her earlobe.</br>
</br>
"The Ghost is in place. Ready to start."</br>
</br>
In the restaurant one kilometer away, a dozen rebel soldiers were already covered in black masks.</br>
</br>
The leader of the rebel army loaded the clip, pulled the bolt of the rifle, and a blazing fire ignited in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Now."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
As the police were pushing the young man toward the police car, the young man suddenly lowered his head and collapsed onto the ground. The riot police beside him didn't have time to react. As he was about to pull him up, an intensive round of gunshots came from the crowd and hit them.</br>
</br>
The crowd screamed and fled, and the previously chaotic scene became completely uncontrollable.</br>
</br>
Hit by several bullets, the police uniform was soaked in blood. The sheriff who led the team leaned against the car and aimed at the crowd. However, because he couldn't spot the militants, he spat out blood and fired a few bullets into the air before cursing.</br>
</br>
"These damn bastards..."</br>
</br>
The mercenaries inside the wall rushed to the nearest cover immediately and took over the automatic weapons thrown from their comrades behind them. There were exoskeletons in the institute, but no one wanted to wear something that heavy. Now they could only fight behind cover against these rioters to delay time while waiting for support to arrive.</br>
</br>
It shouldn't be difficult, if it was just a group of ordinary rioters.</br>
</br>
The automatic rifles in their hands were no different than sticks… The leading mercenary gestured for his comrades to prepare themselves behind the bunker, but he didn't get the opportunity to speak reassuring words.</br>
</br>
PANG!</br>
</br>
Without any warning, a bullet lifted his skull. Under everyone's watch, the brain matter of the NATO veteran from Iraq was scattered all over the concrete floor behind him.</br>
</br>
"Sniper!"</br>
</br>
The captain immediately took over the command. He tightly pressed his head against the wall and yelled at his team.</br>
</br>
"Search for cover! Lower your head – FU*K!"</br>
</br>
There was another bullet. The sniper pruned on the top of the build fell down with his sniper. Now they were completely suppressed.</br>
</br>
The exchange of fire between the militants and the police soon ended. The police had nothing but pistols, explosion-proof shields, as well as tear gas. No one thought that this would happen. They never expected to exchange fire.</br>
</br>
"Smoke bomb!"</br>
</br>
The mercenary behind the cover threw out a smoke bomb, and the smoke quickly dispersed the battlefield.</br>
</br>
On the hill one kilometer away, the Eastern European beauty sneered. She gently pressed the radio life detection device button on the scope. Then she calculated her lead before pressing the trigger at the target that began to move.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1041: Breaking Down the Defense</br>
</div></br>
</br>
BANG!</br>
</br>
She pressed the trigger and the bullet pierced through the thick smoke.</br>
</br>
The sniper one kilometer away used the radio life detection device on its scope to harvest the life of the mercenaries attempting to retreat. But when Arrow mercenaries realized this, five people had already fallen under her sniper.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! He can see us!"</br>
</br>
The cement slag splashed against his face, and a frightened mercenary fell behind cover while yelling into the intercom on his shoulder. The bullets of the automatic rifle scratched over his helmet, but he didn't dare to fire back at the "rioters". He saw with his own eyes that a comrade five meters away died under the muzzle of the sniper rifle.</br>
</br>
He couldn't understand how the sniper locked onto them through the thick smoke.</br>
</br>
Their smoke bombs had a pseudo-infrared function. Even with thermal imaging, it was only possible to see bright white or bright red.</br>
</br>
Just as he was still shocked about what happened, a white pickup truck slammed through the entrance of the institute and rushed toward his rear. He saw from the corners of his eyes that there was no one in the driver seat, and two burning oil drums were tied behind the carriage.</br>
</br>
He had no time to react, and the deafening explosion pierced his eardrums.</br>
</br>
The scorching air swept through the open space in front of the institute, and the burning fire swallowed all the smoke.</br>
</br>
"Perfect."</br>
</br>
The militant leader peeked out from cover and looked at the defense engulfed in flames. A merciless smile formed on his already cold face.</br>
</br>
He raised his hand and waved his fist forward. A dozen armed soldiers left cover and fired in the direction of the institute. Under the cover of heavy machine guns and a sniper rifle, they pushed forward.</br>
</br>
The protesting crowd had disappeared, and bullets flew freely between the two sides. Arrow's mercenaries placed two heavy machine guns on the roof and hid behind the steel reinforcements to fire at the militant soldiers.</br>
</br>
The sudden, unexpected firepower caught the militants off-guard as five soldiers were torn into pieces by heavy machine guns.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, they hid two heavy machine guns in the institute."</br>
</br>
Behind the armored police car, the militant leader cursed and gestured to the soldiers behind him.</br>
</br>
Soon, four RPGs were aimed at the two machine guns. Followed by four whistling noises, the explosive warhead burst in the building, and the walls with reinforced concrete collapsed.</br>
</br>
With the loss of the two heavy machine guns, Arrow's firepower decreased substantially and was suppressed by the militant soldiers. The sniper in the distance forced them to stay undercover. Seeing that the situation was turning south, the head of the mercenaries had to order a retreat.</br>
</br>
Soon, the militant soldiers with automatic rifles rushed downstairs in the main building. They fired at the lock of the iron gate then knocked open the door with the stock. A grenade was thrown inside, and as the dust of the explosion oozed out from the room, four soldiers against the wall rushed in.</br>
</br>
</br>
They had already practiced this drill countless times while training abroad with expertise no inferior to anti-terrorist forces. The militant soldiers inside divided into two. One team immediately rushed to the second floor to clean up the rest of the mercenaries while the other team headed to the basement entrance to suppress the mercenaries who didn't have time to evacuate into the underground passage.</br>
</br>
Based on the information provided by Celestial Trade and the structural map of the institute, the 7th Institute was only an affiliated research institution of a pharmaceutical company. However, behind the scenes, it was conducting a special project called the Golden Apple Project, and all the sensitive experiments were conducted underground. The entrance to the underground was an alloy door that was comparable in thickness to any bank's vault. It was basically impossible to open from the outside.</br>
</br>
After being attacked by the militants, the director Carol, under the cover of mercenaries, brought all the researchers involved in the Golden Apple Project into the basement. As long as the door was closed, there was no chance for the militants outside to enter.</br>
</br>
In half an hour at most, reinforcements would arrive. Even if these "rioters" had three heads and six arms, they wouldn't be able to escape the cleansing power of Arrow mercenaries.</br>
</br>
However, things didn't develop in the direction they expected.</br>
</br>
The leader of the militants entered the guard room and pushed away the corpse of the security guard in front of the computer. He took out a USB drive from his pocket inserted it into the computer then he executed the program inside.</br>
</br>
Almost in an instant, a large number of black boxes and progress bars covered the screen. According to the agreement, Celestial Trade could hack the system through the institute's internal network.</br>
</br>
The mercenaries who fled into the basement didn't have time to catch their breaths, and the indestructible alloy door slowly opened under their terrified gazes.</br>
</br>
"Turn off the power! Quick!"</br>
</br>
However, it was too late. When the door opened, a tear gas grenade was tossed in. The tear gas exploded inside, and the militant soldiers wearing gas masks rushed through the narrow entrance. After a lot of casualties, they ripped apart the defense formed by Arrow.</br>
</br>
Intensive gunshots came from afar, and there were occasional blasts of grenades. Carol, who was previously relieved, once again entered a state of fear. Right now, he could only vent his anger at the head of mercenaries.</br>
</br>
"Damn, aren't you elites?! It's just a group of rioters. You can't even win against them?"</br>
</br>
"They aren't ordinary rioters. They received military training, are well equipped... and most importantly, they have the numerical advantage." While responding to the director's complaints, Jeff was locked onto the door.</br>
</br>
The exoskeleton that covered his body didn't bring him too much security. The approaching gunshots were enough to tell him about the tragedy outside.</br>
</br>
The gunshots that were gradually becoming clear confused him. If his soldiers on the ground were caught unprepared, losing to the well-trained "rioters" would be excusable, but the mercenaries stationed underground were all wearing "lightning" exoskeletons. Although it wasn't comparable to the K1 of Celestial Trade, they shouldn't lose against a group of nobodies.</br>
</br>
The combination of bulletproof steel plates and weight-bearing exoskeletons should be invincible in a battle between rifles.</br>
</br>
However, the doubts in his mind were quickly answered.</br>
</br>
The gunshots stopped and the door was slammed open, but no one came in.</br>
</br>
Jeff pushed Carol to the back of the desk. With the other three mercenaries, they scattered to the four corners of the room. Jeff held his breath and his crosshairs locked on the door while his left hand touched the grenade launcher hanging under the barrel. However, a tubular grenade rolled in front of him at this very moment.</br>
</br>
"Grenade!"</br>
</br>
With a roar, he instinctively bunkered down, but the expected explosion didn't arrive. He only heard static noise passing through his ears before his limbs seemed to be filled with lead.</br>
</br>
A drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead, and he seemed to understand what happened...</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1042: Living Hell</br>
</div></br>
</br>
If there were any weaknesses in the 'Lightning' exoskeleton designed by Krupp Group, EMP was one of them. Although Celestial Trade only provided a small number of EMP grenades to these militant forces, it was enough for them to win this battle.</br>
</br>
When Jeff heard the static noise, his heart sank. The stiffness from his joints allowed him to confirm one thing—the exoskeleton covering his entire body had completely shut down.</br>
</br>
With both hands pressed against the ground, he gritted his teeth and desperately wanted to get up. But a hundred pounds of alloy steel plates on his body wasn't easy to lift without the force of the exoskeleton.</br>
</br>
Just like that, Jeff could only watch the militant soldier walking toward him. The soldier first kicked him down then pulled off his helmet before sending him to sleep with a strike to his face.</br>
</br>
In the blink of an eye, the only four mercenaries in the room lost their combat abilities. Carol desperately tried to escape to the corner while watching in horror.</br>
</br>
"Don't-don't come close to me... I beg you, let me go. I'm just a researcher. I-I have a wife and a three-year-old daughter. They're still waiting for me to go home. You can't—"</br>
</br>
The leader of the militants grabbed his collar and lifted him as he stared at his frightened eyes.</br>
</br>
"Sample room, go and open the door."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes..."</br>
</br>
Carol nodded while shivering. His feet returned to the ground, but he stumbled in fear.</br>
</br>
With a gun pointed to his head, Carol didn't dare to drag things on. He took the soldiers to the underground sample room.</br>
</br>
The door of the sample room was already sprayed-painted with the militants' logo and various slogans. As he was pushed to a metal door, several soldiers were already waiting. Under watch of several pairs of eyes, Carol typed the password with his trembling fingers. With a clunking noise, he was rudely pushed aside.</br>
</br>
As the soldiers entered the sample room, the leader of the militants took off his gas mask and looked at everything in the sample room, muttering to himself.</br>
</br>
"God... What did we find?"</br>
</br>
Countless body bags, like dried fish on a production line, were neatly hung with hooks. Through the plastic on top of each body bag, he could even clearly identify the facial structure of each "sample" and the number attached to the body bag.</br>
</br>
"Sir, we're going to... do." The soldier's throat next to him felt dry and he squeezed out a few words.</br>
</br>
The militant leader silently took out his phone and gave it to the soldier.</br>
</br>
"Go take some photos. Remember, they have to be clear."</br>
</br>
After making the order, he put the rifle behind him, took out another USB from his pocket, and inserted it into the lab server according to the agreement with Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
After waiting for the data transfer to finalize, he grabbed the USB. The soldier who was taking photos had returned. With an ugly expression, he forced out a few words.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Done."</br>
</br>
The militant leader didn't say anything. He just nodded then ordered a retreat.</br>
</br>
As he passed by the door, a soldier stepped forward and poked the head of the director with a gun.</br>
</br>
"How are we going to deal with this guy?"</br>
</br>
Looking at Carol's horrified and pleading eyes, the militant leader scoffed and looked away.</br>
</br>
"Tie him up and leave him here."</br>
</br>
After hearing this sentence, ecstasy suddenly appeared on his face. However, the ecstasy didn't last two seconds and his heart sank to the bottom again with the next sentence.</br>
</br>
"There has to be someone to explain to the protesters and reporters outside what these body bags are for."</br>
</br>
"It seems that we've found something incredible."</br>
</br>
Through the holographic screen, Jiang Chen, who was in Future Building, was looking at the photos sent by the militants. The hanging bodies were daunting. While he was mentally prepared about the use of living people as materials for the Golden Apple Project, he didn't expect that the Freemasonry would place such a low value on life.</br>
</br>
If he remembered correctly, this was the modern world, not the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the other side of the office was Xie Lei. Compared to when he first met Jiang Chen, the boy had now matured. With Jiang Chen's support, his sister regained her vision. As agreed, after he returned to Xin from university, he swore his allegiance to Jiang Chen. He was mainly responsible for maintaining the network security for Celestial Trade and occasionally working part-time as a hacker for Jiang Chen to deal with things that must remain hidden.</br>
</br>
For example, like the current operation.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen got up and walked to the other side of the office. He patted Xie Lei's backrest and looked at the data stream flashing inside the computer. "How's it going? Are you done?"</br>
</br>
"Database deciphering is now completed, and a total of 197 gigabytes of experimental data has been copied.... To be honest, deleting their originals doesn't make any sense. As long as they aren't stupid, they probably periodically back up the lab's data to a specific location on the hard disk."</br>
</br>
Despite this, Xie Lei also pressed a few buttons, following Jiang Chen's request, and deleted all the research data on the Golden Apple Project in the 7th Research Institute.</br>
</br>
"I understand that the purpose of deleting the information here is just to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Russians. You don't have to worry about these things; concentrate on your work."</br>
</br>
Information related to Golden Apple definitely shouldn't fall into the hands of the Russians, including information related to brainwashing technology. This kind of technology was useless to Jiang Chen but not for other countries.</br>
</br>
"Okay, you're the boss. The Russians won't find any information related to the Golden Apple Project." Xie Lei yawned, but his typing motions didn't stop at all. The network security engineers at the institute were tied up. With the help of a quantum computer, the server was pretty much undefended to him.</br>
</br>
"Got it!" Xie Lei's hands left the keyboard and he snapped his fingers.</br>
</br>
Everything was going as planned, and Jiang Chen couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
"Remember to wipe your footprints."</br>
</br>
"Understand." Xie Lei grinned and tapped the enter key on the touch panel. At the same time, the screen began to load. "It's the Freemasonry who destroyed the data when they retreated. As long as we leave misleading traces then erase records of us breaking into the server…"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1043: In a Storm of Scandal</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The sound of the propeller whizzed in the air, and five transport helicopters arrived above the 7th Institute.</br>
</br>
Looking at the dense crowd below, Horvat's skull felt numb. He was ready to enter combat when he was dispatched, but there were no militants at the scene at all.</br>
</br>
Other than the wreckage and shambles, he only saw protestors that had already rushed inside, as well as media vans from the media outlets around the world.</br>
</br>
"Sir?" The mercenary sitting next to him looked at him with eyes of inquiry.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, Horvat pressed on the headset and made an order: "Lower the height, prepare for a rope drop."</br>
</br>
Five helicopters hovered in front of the main entrance of the institute, and dozens of special forces landed on the ground using ropes.</br>
</br>
The protesters had already rushed into the institute, and ambulances and fire trucks surrounded the entrance. Stretchers and cameras mixed with the crowd and made the scene particularly chaotic. Police dispatched from nearby were trying to control the situation and remove unrelated individuals and the media from the institute, but they were ineffective against the angry protesters and aggressive reporters.</br>
</br>
Sargent Dover leaned against the police car with his hand on his forehead. He brought over a hundred police forces, but they still had a minimal impact on the protestors who had already rushed into the institute.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the reporters found something in the research institute. Body bags labeled with numbers were lined up in the open space in front of the institute. The director of the institute, who had a bruised nose, was lifted into an ambulance. The protesters questioned who the police should arrest. The police also asked the police chief the same question. Dover didn't know the answer, so he could only resort to reporting to his superior.</br>
</br>
However, until now, his superior hadn't given him any clear instructions. He just repeated the sentence: "Control the situation."</br>
</br>
With heavily-armed mercenaries, Horvat walked to Dover's side and showed him the documents to enter the restricted zone... The documents were unnecessary since the restricted zone was already filled with protestors who couldn't be moved.</br>
</br>
"Where is Carol?" Horvat glanced at the protesting crowd and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
"You're talking about the director of the institute? He was carried to the ambulance." Dover raised his chin and pointed to the ambulance next to him. "He looks a bit miserable; you should be mentally prepared... when we retrieved him from the protesters, we almost didn't recognize him."</br>
</br>
Horvat's eyebrows twitched and he walked in the direction of the ambulance.</br>
</br>
Looking at the mercenaries rushing into the crowd, the protesters looked at them with hostility.</br>
</br>
"Arrow? Where is our 9th Anti-Terrorist Brigade? When did Peter outsource 'anti-terrorism' to military contractors?"</br>
</br>
"Who knows? Maybe next time, they will even outsource the ballots."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ah, then I have to sign up for a printing factory to bid."</br>
</br>
Without paying attention to the protesters, Horvat pushed aside the protestors in front of him, walked to the ambulance, showed the medical staff his documents, and pulled Carol out of the ambulance. The sound of the bolts scared off the protestors who were preparing to rush forward. They formed a human wall and retreated in the direction of the helicopter.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, this guy got messed up." The stretcher was pushed into the transport helicopter while a mercenary whispered.</br>
</br>
"As long as he's the right one." Horvat glanced at him and told the medic to handle the director's wounds then turned back to the crowd.</br>
</br>
Although he was miserable, Carol fortunately still had some air left in him or it would be difficult for him to answer to his superior.</br>
</br>
In addition to the director of the institute, other researchers surrounded by protestors were waiting for rescue. When Horvat rescued key researchers from the locked office, he returned to the helicopter and Carol, who was almost on his last breath, woke up.</br>
</br>
Horvat sat down beside him and stared into his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Where is Jeff? How come I didn't see him?"</br>
</br>
"Jeff..." It took a while for Carol's concussed brain to recall the owner of the name.</br>
</br>
Coughing violently, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm his violently pumping chest.</br>
</br>
"He was taken away by the militants."</br>
</br>
"How could that be with Jeff's skills?" a mercenary interrupted.</br>
</br>
Horvat frowned, raised his hand to cut the mercenary off and persisted further.</br>
</br>
"Tell me all the details."</br>
</br>
"The militants broke into the underground research institute's security system and opened the alloy door. The last mercenaries and the militants exchanged fire in the corridor in front of the main entrance, and Jeff took me to the office at the back of the lab. Then..."</br>
</br>
"And then?"</br>
</br>
Recalling the tragedy that occurred an hour ago, Carol was frightened. Suppressing his fear, he narrated what happened with great discomfort.</br>
</br>
"Then they quickly pushed the front door and threw a grenade inside. Jeff and the other three got down, but the grenade didn't explode. There was only a very faint static noise then they couldn't crawl back up. They were knocked out by the militants who rushed through the door. If I'm not wrong, that should've bee—"</br>
</br>
"EMP" Horvat muttered to himself and spoke the three letters for him.</br>
</br>
Located in the Finnish manor, Carmen quietly listened to the report from his phone.</br>
</br>
The 7th Institute was attacked by the militant army organization claiming to be the "People's Liberation Front." They released a video of the battle at the research institute, not only publishing evidence of human experiments to the whole world but also letting in the protestors.</br>
</br>
"The traces of EMP weapons were found on the scene," Johnson said with a dignified look.</br>
</br>
Whenever these three letters were mentioned, it wasn't difficult to guess who was behind this. All Celestial Trade possessed were non-nuclear EMP weapons. However, Carmen didn't expect that not only did they reduce the size of their EMPs to non-guided support rockets, but they also further reduced it to a portable grenade.</br>
</br>
After listening to Johnson's report, Carmen didn't speak. After a long silence, he picked up the phone and called the Krupp Group to tell them that the 'Lightning' exoskeleton required EMP protection then hung up.</br>
</br>
After being neglected for a long time, Johnson waited for Carmen to finish calling then he hesitated for a moment before asking: "...What should we do now?"</br>
</br>
"I'll give you all of Arrow's resources in Frankberg. Find them and kill them in their cradle. "</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Johnson lowered his head then left with quick steps.</br>
</br>
Looking at the closed door, Carmen gritted his teeth in anger. He gazed at the Golden Apple on the table sullenly and said, word by word, "You will pay for your stupidity."</br>

"The Frankberg People's Liberation Front announced its support for the exiled government led by former Deputy Prime Minister Evelyn. The leader of the rebel militants, Franz, claimed that 10,000 people have joined their ranks and they will be armed to protest against New Choice Party's decision for EU integration and the blatant disregard for the interests of the people."</br>

"Evelyn told the media in exile that the tragedy in the 7th Institute wasn't an accident. With Peter's involvement, the country is rotting from the inside. The New Choice Party isn't the people's government but a puppet government controlled by corporations. Everyone should stand up and fight against this tyrant..."</br>
</br>
Leaning on the sofa, Jiang Chen enjoyed Ayesha's gentle massage while watching CNN's report. When he saw the chaotic scene that had erupted at the 7th Institute, he couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
The conceitedness associated with power and fanaticism for the Golden Apple would bring him and his empire into the grave sooner or later. Of course, without the work of Celestial Trade and Russia behind the scenes, the rebel militants wouldn't have made such great progress.</br>
</br>
So far, everything was going as planned.</br>
</br>
The scandal might force Peter to step down, but it wouldn't hurt Carmen Rothschild at all. Before the first shot, Ghost Agents had already investigated that Bava Pharmaceuticals, the parent company of the 7th Research Institute, had no direct equity relationship with the Rothschild Bank, but it was controlled by an overseas shell company. The legal representative had lived abroad for many years and the police couldn't even find a person, let alone pursue legal actions.</br>
</br>
Without any further incidents, after Carmen took this slap to the face, his next step would be to revise the Public Gathering Bill and the Anti-Terrorism Act. This would provide assistance to his own forces to remove the militants from the territory. However, New Choice Party's support rate, already losing popularity, would fall to the bottom. This would push the already fierce conflicts in the country to a new peak.</br>
</br>
"According to the agreement, the militants handed over the captives of the Arrow to us. Our people used Truth-Telling Serum and obtained the location of Arrow's training base on the Finnish border. We then provided the information to an informant of the Russian Security according to your instructions."</br>
</br>
"Very good. Then it's up to Russia's decision." Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
The pictures on TV were showing the police using tear gas to clear the area. Western reporters seemed to have a soft spot for reporting this scandal. Perhaps a reporter might've been hit on the head by a stick, but the TV even showed a few close-ups of the faces of the Frankberg police.</br>
</br>
Now the world was waiting for Frankberg to make a decision. But in an interview, Peter, who won the election with his tough and extremely right image, was acting like a disgruntled clown. Other than defaming and denying the rebel's statement and the opposition's voice from the country, he couldn't think of any practical way to put an end to the chaos.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What about us?" Ayesha asked.</br>
</br>
"Us? We don't have to do anything," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Nothing at all?" Ayesha seemed to be confused.</br>
</br>
"Nothing needs to be done. Our ghosts only need to hide in the dark, wait for an opportunity to appear, and deal the enemy a fatal blow. Now it's Russia's turn to play the game; let them attract firepower first... Of course, we aren't out of this mess yet. Our two orbital airborne brigades will create a big victory on the Eastern Front and light a fire under their as*."</br>
</br>
Looking at his confident expression, Ayesha smiled and leaned down to kiss his ear. "Go eat now—breakfast is ready, and it will get cold if you don't eat."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll go now."</br>
</br>
Feeling the warmth on his ear, Jiang Chen smiled and kissed her on the cheek. He lifted the remote, turned off the TV, and walked to the kitchen with Ayesha with his hand around her waist.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the afternoon, Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse and retrieved life necessities for this quarter.</br>
</br>
With the development of the NAC, the materials he needed to transport were decreasing. The three Gardens of Eden were enough to support the consumption of survivors in the city, and surplus food was exported elsewhere.</br>
</br>
In the past, he mainly transported canned food and compressed crackers. But now, he brought back mostly rare earth metals which were difficult to obtain in the wasteland. Recycling alone couldn't sustain the consumption of the iron and aluminum mines on Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen moved the last container into the empty warehouse, he let out a long breath of air. Out of habit, he raised his arm and wiped his forehead before he walked out. The guards at the warehouse saluted, followed behind him, then sat in the military vehicle.</br>
</br>
Because a new research institute was built in the backyard of the mansion, the warehouse that was originally used to store the "transported materials" was demolished. Now, the warehouse was placed outside Fishbone Base's walls due to the ease of transport and the discreetness of the location.</br>
</br>
"You're done already?" With her arms on the steering wheel, Sun Jiao smiled and looked at Jiang Chen who sat in behind her.</br>
</br>
Because it was a break, she was wearing clothes that Jiang Chen brought from the modern world. Because her smile was too bright, Jiang Chen had an illusion that the girl in front of him was from a modern world metropolis.</br>
</br>
But soon after, the illusion disappeared. Because of Sun Jiao's uniqueness, even if she wore modern clothes, it would be hard for Jiang Chen to compare her with white-collar workers in the city.</br>
</br>
"Are you thinking of something rude?" Sun Jiao's smile was even brighter, but Jiang Chen shuddered.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, absolutely not. Don't be so suspicious, dear."</br>
</br>
"Then I want you to compliment me, such as saying this dress is very... very well-fitting." With a smirk, Sun Jiao persisted.</br>
</br>
"It's perfect."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't lie as only sincerity was in his pristine gaze.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao blushed and her head that had peeked over slowly shrank back. They had been dating for a long time and already tried countless different positions, but she never was good at dealing with Jiang Chen's "sweetness".</br>
</br>
Her thumb and index finger fiddled with a strand of her hair. She coughed and hid her shyness in the roaring of the engine.</br>
</br>
Driving on the main road on the base, Jiang Chen observed the scenery along the way through his window and casually talked to Sun Jiao about the base.</br>
</br>
"Preparing for winter already?"</br>
</br>
"The sooner we prepare, the better. Last year's heavy snow was so memorable." Looking at the cloudless sky outside the window, Sun Jiao yawned. "The Holy Shield system hasn't been fixed yet. If nothing surprising pops up, it probably won't happen this year... Are those people really trustworthy? I always feel they're too slow. Is it that difficult to repair a shield?"</br>
</br>
There was a rare case of good weather today; it was typically hard to see such clear clouds in the wasteland. The rays mixed with hues of yellow and green and the hazy radiation dust were the normal state of the wasteland, along with the zombies and Death Claws among the ruins. But with the establishment of the NAC, they started to disappear.</br>
</br>
"It should be very difficult. It wouldn't benefit them if they chose to be slow. We don't supply them with free winter supplies, so if they can't fix it by the end of this year, they will have to freeze in Shangjing." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"I thought you stepped down from intelligence work."</br>
</br>
"Kutpov is responsible for this task. I'm only responsible for helping him contact Celestial Trade. The coordinates of Arrow have been exposed. If everything goes smoothly, he will fly to Finland tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"Hah, that old man. I know—very interesting guy."</br>
</br>
"Interesting? I don't see anything interesting on his face with as many knife-scars as wrinkles..."</br>
</br>
In a villa on the outskirts of Moscow, an old man and a young woman sat across from each other and enjoyed a not-so-family dinner. However, Nikolaev was very content. Since the death of Marina, his family was fragmented. The cold war between the daughter and father had continued till now. The last time they had dinner together was in the distant past.</br>
</br>
Both sides knew that this wasn't each other's fault but they couldn't forgive each other. Regardless of what Marina did, she was Natasha's mother, and she died in Georgia because of his orders. He didn't expect Natasha to forgive him, even if he believed she could understand him...</br>
</br>
Nikolaev looked at his daughter deeply. Natasha stopped moving her fork and touched her face with a frown.</br>
</br>
"Is there anything on my face?"</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of things, lots of reminders of Marina... Sorry, I shouldn't mention her name."</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I know she died. You're in more pain than me." Natasha was nonchalant.</br>
</br>
Nikolaev forced a smile, pinched his eyebrows, hesitated for a while, and finally spoke the words that had been brewing for a long time.</br>
</br>
"Listen, I heard he has many women."</br>
</br>
"Are you not the same?" Natasha sneered.</br>
</br>
"This...this isn't exactly the same..." Nikolaev touched his nose awkwardly after his daughter revealed his private life. "I just hope that you can take care of yourself—"</br>
</br>
"I will."</br>
</br>
Nikolaev opened his mouth, but his vocabulary seemed to have disappeared, as nothing came out in the end. He spread his hands and said, "...I hope so."</br>
</br>
This was her own life, and he had no right to interfere too much, even if he was her father. She was already an adult. But if possible, he wanted to see Jiang Chen again. This time, he swore that he would grab Jiang Chen's neck and beat the wicked and lucky boy.</br>
</br>
Looking at her father's expression, Natasha knew what he was thinking and couldn't help but sigh.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, she slowly said, "After some time, I will be there."</br>
</br>
"Oh," Nikolaev responded with his nasal voice as if he didn't seem to mind</br>
</br>
"Although I have no plans to forgive you... I remember the things you've done for me."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Natasha stared at the steak on her plate and said in a casual but forced tone, "Anyway, thank you."</br>
</br>
However, from her slightly trembling voice, she wasn't calm.</br>
</br>
"Thank you..."</br>
</br>
The old man smiled and touched his chin full of grease.</br>
</br>
He had previously made up his mind that he must beat that guy, but he suddenly changed his mind.</br>
</br>
</br>
Drinking two bottles of vodka with him didn't seem like a bad choice either.</br>
</br>
"Achoo!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's nose was a little itchy, and he couldn't help but sneeze.</br>
</br>
Perhaps someone was thinking about him, but it was the second time he sneezed in the last few minutes. If it wasn't for the fact that he knew his body was immunized against most colds, he would wonder if he caught a cold.</br>
</br>
Sitting across from Jiang Chen, Chu Nan joked with a smirk while drinking tea.</br>
</br>
"Got a cold from last night?"</br>
</br>
"It's just that my nose is a little itchy... Where were we again?" Jiang Chen said as he rubbed his nose.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan sighed. "Did you really listen to what I said about the Northern Alliance Area?"</br>
</br>
"Indeed." Jiang Chen waved his hand and motioned for him to continue.</br>
</br>
To the NAC who had rekindled civilized fire, the Northern Alliance Area was like nomads. Because of the climate problem, they targeted the relatively rich area of ​​Wanghai, and they tried to take away this "prosperous" land from the NAC with equipment inherited from the Pan-Asia Cooperation.</br>
</br>
Especially the three Gardens of Eden. Half of the decision to choose Wanghai as the destination was because of the three gardens.</br>
</br>
However, the NAC wasn't an easy opponent. The offensive attack from last winter ended in the defeat of the Northern Alliance Area. Their strongest Wanderer tank was simply incomparable against the advanced pre-war Particle Cannon.</br>
</br>
With the Particle Cannon as their trump card, even if the Northern Alliance Area wanted to attack, there would be no opportunity to advance a step further. However, Jiang Chen was facing the same issue.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, Han Junhua, and other high-level NAC executives certainly discussed a conquest of the Northern Alliance Area. It wasn't impossible to execute, but a very real problem was placed in front of them. It was the problem of profits.</br>
</br>
Regardless if they won or lost, even if the NAC managed to maintain a thousand-kilometer supply line through countless zombies, mutants, and raiders on the wasteland, even if they won, there would be no substantial benefit to the NAC.</br>
</br>
The "gap between the rich and the poor" was too great. Other than weapons, the Northern Alliance Area had nothing Jiang Chen envied. The only thing he was curious about was a launch center, but he was only curious. Since it was based on the Sectarian Guardians, there was nothing left there.</br>
</br>
Since it was the worst choice for both sides, there was only one option left.</br>
</br>
"You mean they're going to trade with me?" Jiang Chen laughed and sipped on his tea. "We have a lot of good stuff here, but what can they trade?"</br>
</br>
Chu Nan didn't speak, but he also smiled. He took a graphene card from his pocket, wagged it with his fingers, and placed it on the coffee table between them. He then gently pushed it in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the graphene card and rubbed the switch, then a list of goods appeared in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Mutant fur, Steel Tooth Tiger teeth, Blood Vine, crystal... how come I don't understand some of things on here?" Jiang Chen furrowed.</br>
</br>
"In addition to the crystals and industrial-use Blood Vine, the others are luxury goods. They're only available in the northwest area of the mainland. They can be used to produce coats, jewelry, or other items. These luxury goods are in high demand on the wealthy Sixth Street, the southern area, and overseas. What do you think? Interested?" Chu Nan asked.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the word "luxury," he almost burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, the pursuit of a high quality of life was part of human nature. Without a need to worry about food, people begin searching for other things, but this was also part of the path toward civilization. A civilization without luxury couldn't ever be truly prosperous.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?" Jiang Chen tossed the card back on the table and didn't directly answer his question, but instead, he asked Chu Nan for his opinion.</br>
</br>
"If trade can feed them, at least they can control their own hands. I think this is a good thing. But we have to consider what can be sold and what can't be sold." Chu Nan said, with a shrewd light piercing out from his eyes.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1046"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1046: The Force of a Prairie Fire</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The representatives from the Northern Alliance Area were also brought over, and the negotiations lasted for an entire afternoon. The "NAC-NAA Free Trade Agreement" that made countless businessmen on Sixth Street ecstatic was finally introduced.</br>
</br>
However, while it was free trade, there were still restrictions.</br>
</br>
First, "strategic materials" like iron, aluminum, titanium, tungsten, molybdenum, and rare earth materials were all restricted. Businessmen who were caught would be immediately treated as smugglers. At this point, Jiang Chen didn't make any concessions, no matter how the Northern Alliance Area representative protested.</br>
</br>
Iron, aluminum, and titanium were the keys to the production of advanced weapons ranging from the optical components of laser guns to the accelerometers of Type-50 Electromagnetic Pulse Cannons, all of which depended on these strategic resources. As for tungsten and molybdenum, one was raw material for smelting C-type steel, and the other was used to produce neural connection devices.</br>
</br>
In addition to the ban on the sale of strategic materials, Jiang Chen also imposed an additional 15% tariff on luxury goods. They must pay the tariff if their products entered the Sixth Street market. For the modern world, a 15% tariff didn't seem to be high, but in the apocalypse which had limited resources, it was very high.</br>
</br>
Objections? Useless.</br>
</br>
The products of the Northern Alliance Area weren't the only option available to the NAC. NAC's extensive trade routes went south to Yizhou and west to India, all of which could substitute as trading partners.</br>
</br>
However, the Northern Alliance Area didn't have much choice. Although they could find large survivor hubs in the south, the mutants and zombies along the way made them miserable. The extreme cold weather in the north wasn't suitable for the cultivation of mutated fruit trees. The production of nutrient supply couldn't just be supported by hunting unless they wasted their already-limited ammunition on mutants. Not just nutrient supply, but many things piled up in Wanghai's warehouses were in short supply in the north.</br>
</br>
Opening up the trade route down the river was their only choice unless they could access a large reserve of helium to build airships, but that was obviously impossible. In the 22nd century, helium was a scarce resource and only Jiang Chen could lavishly use it to fill "balloons".</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen didn't make a one-sided agreement. Light weapon bullets, laser gun batteries, and other supplies could be purchased by merchants of the NAC. But in order to prevent them from hoarding ammunition, the amounts of each purchase were strictly limited.</br>
</br>
With the signing of the trade agreement, the two sides finally lowered the guns pointed at each other. A peace that had appeared to have an expiry date had finally arrived on the land ruled by the NAC.</br>
</br>
So far, Jiang Chen was finally able to deal with all the matters on this temporary return. And at this time, another new piece of information arrived from the modern world.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although she was very disappointed, Sun Jiao finally let go of Jiang Chen, who was "squeezed out". She left a kiss on his lips and watched him disappear from the room.</br>
</br>
News came from Europe.</br>
</br>
Since the militants fired the first shot at the "7th Institute Campaign", they declared war on Peter's government.</br>
</br>
In the few days that Jiang Chen was gone, the fire of revolution had already ignited throughout Frankberg.</br>
</br>
The state of Bava which had the most intense conflict was under martial law, and Ber once again welcomed a curfew after a year and a half. Following the principle of running away if they couldn't win, the rebel militants used civilian vehicles and light weapons to fight mobile warfare against special forces and regular troops in the city. When they were under siege, they fled into the mountain ranges on the border and used the treacherous terrain to engage in guerrilla warfare.</br>
</br>
The reason why these protesters could cause such a massive upheaval was mainly due to the integration of the EU.</br>
</br>
After several years of continuous "efforts," according to data released after further disarmament in 2012, the entire Frankberg Army had only retained three divisions. The main battle tanks were reduced from more than 2,500 tanks to 230 tanks and 470 vehicles. Other than a strong air force, the size of the entire force was smaller than an army group for most countries.</br>
</br>
Although Peter made adjustments to the defense budget after he took office, it was impossible for a reserve of more than 100,000 to fight a war against the militants at a moment's notice. Frankberg used a recruiting system and soldiers were volunteers with salaries. With Peter's current approval rate, even if he still maintained support from the right-wing, the votes in the EU integration meant he would only receive boos from the people of Frankberg.</br>
</br>
At present, NATO had yet to send troops. At the time of the contract, no member countries determined there was a need to send troops to maintain stability in member countries.</br>
</br>
After all, the country wasn't a private enterprise, and sending troops wasn't a simple matter. However, it also fitted Carmen's intentions. Arrow took a strong stance and intervened in the drastic changes happening in Frankberg caused by the revolution.</br>
</br>
After Peter signed a decree that read: "If encountering resistance, soldiers can shoot rebel militants on the spot," the protests and crackdowns were heightened to the extreme. Bloody conflicts occurred in every corner of the city. Walls were smeared with the black marks left by explosives. The bullet holes were like scars, contradictions that couldn't be erased.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that this could happen in a developed country. Although this predicament had been previewed countless times in games and films, no one truly believed this.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was a cultural war brought by the refugees.</br>
</br>
In the early morning of May 21st, Coro City Airport welcomed a special guest. Under the escort of four bodyguards, the old man with a hooked nose smiled and greeted Jiang Chen with a hug.</br>
</br>
"I had a hunch when I left last time that we would meet again. I didn't expect this day to come so quickly."</br>
</br>
"It's not that quick. When I saw you last time, you were forty." Looking at the two side-burns on the old man, Jiang Chen smiled, "Welcome, future Prime Minister."</br>
</br>
"It's still too early for that. I'm just a poor man who's living under other people's rooves." Although the tone was modest, Jiang Chen could clearly sense the sense of relief from his bright smile.</br>
</br>
Bloody conflicts weren't something to be happy about, but the Frankberg finally picked up weapons against the tyrants they selected. It was a big step forward. More and more people joined the Frankberg People's Liberation Front, went overseas to receive military training, and returned to their home country to advance their progress.</br>
</br>
Evelyn had reasons to believe his days of exile would end soon.</br>
</br>
For this reason, he was able to represent "New Federal Frankberg" to visit Coro City to discuss the future of the country with Jiang Chen…</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 1047"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 1047: Taking Advantange of The Situation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Sitting in the gazebo behind his Coro Island mansion, Evelyn and Jiang Chen chatted about the future of Frankberg while leisurely enjoying the sea breeze. Ayesha, in a maid uniform, poured iced black tea for the two then left with gentle steps.</br>
</br>
"Europe's anti-dumping and countervailing investigations of Celestial Trade and Future Group are against the law. If I was in office, such a ridiculous thing wouldn't happen." Evelyn sipped the black tea in the cup and began to speak: "The whole world is enjoying the convenience brought by technology. It's unreasonable for the people of Frankberg to only use smuggled goods. The consortium led by the Rothschild family has been controlling politics for too long. Now they're working together to take the voting rights from our people? That's theft!"</br>
</br>
"I believe you will bring the much-needed change." Jiang Chen smiled, took a sip of the iced black tea, and turned his eyes to gaze at the beach not far away.</br>
</br>
His mansion was located in the deepest part of the wealthy area, and it was also at the highest point. In addition to the 500-meter-long private beach, they could also see the busy public beaches not far in the distance and the luxurious yachts in the sea.</br>
</br>
Everyone who lived in this community possessed a significant amount of wealth. The beach and the yachts were naturally full of beauties with different skin colors. Jiang Chen once saw a man crowded by more than a dozen beautiful ladies on a yacht, and he suddenly felt that his life was too clear-minded.</br>
</br>
Compared to those animals.</br>
</br>
"The beach, sea breeze, palm trees... It'd be perfect if we had some champagne now."</br>
</br>
"If we popped some champagne now, what would we use to celebrate after the victory? Tea?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha." Evelyn laughed. "I didn't expect you to understand American humor."</br>
</br>
"I know a little about the cultures of all countries." Jiang Chen smiled and put down the teacup in his hand. "Let's leave the chitchat to dinner time. You flew here not just for a vacation, right?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. Are we not discussing the future of Frankberg?" Evelyn laughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head. "We already agreed on opening the channels for Future Group and Celestial Trade prior. It was also a prerequisite for us to support you. This isn't discussing the future."</br>
</br>
Evelyn spread his hands. "Well, precisely speaking, the purpose of my trip was to hear your opinion or recommendations."</br>
</br>
"Recommendations? What recommendations do you want?" Jiang Chen leaned back in his chair and looked at the old man, intrigued.</br>
</br>
"The civil war has pulled Frankberg into chaos. I believe you must've seen on the news what the country is like now. I'll be straightforward—once I'm elected as the next prime minister, if I want to stabilize my position, I must fix the mess left by Peter and reinvigorate the Frankberg economy from its ruins."</br>
</br>
"You came to seek out investments?" Jiang Chen acutely sensed his intention.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Yes." Evelyn nodded solemnly. "What we lack is exactly what you have. Whether we have a poor market or an energized market depends on you."</br>
</br>
On the economic issue, Russia, which lacked self-sufficiency, definitely wouldn't be able to help. Evelyn could only discuss this matter with Jiang Chen. If Frankberg wished to step out of the grim civil war, it must inject a lot of money. However, no one was willing to spend hundreds of billions to take a risk on Europe, which would be in turmoil for the next decade or even longer.</br>
</br>
Evelyn anxiously observed Jiang Chen's expression, and he was relieved that he didn't see signs of rejection. However, Jiang Chen's grin made him question if the decision to ask the question was wise…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled. "Are you sure? My appetite is very big."</br>
</br>
Evelyn's eyebrows twitched, and he bit the bullet. "Go ahead."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen extended three fingers and said slowly: "Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW..."</br>
</br>
"That's impossible!" Evelyn exclaimed and interrupted him. "Do you think Frankberg is Xin? Our antitrust regulations won't allow—"</br>
</br>
"When I finish talking." Jiang Chen raised his hand to signal for him to not overreact then he put up a finger. "100 billion Xin New Dollars."</br>
</br>
More objections were stuck in his throat, and nothing came out of Evelyn's mouth.</br>
</br>
At the current exchange rate, 100 billion XND was almost equivalent to 150 billion Euros. After the German People's Liberation Front succeeded in its revolution, his party would again become the majority party and end the EU integration process. It was possible that 100 billion XND could be equivalent to 200 billion Euros.</br>
</br>
Two hundred billion Euros, a number he couldn't refuse in any way.</br>
</br>
"You have to promise not to move the Frankberg factories to Xin..." His shoulders were no longer tense, and Evelyn compromised.</br>
</br>
"If I really had that idea, why wouldn't I just open a few factories in Xin? Rest assured; even if I wanted to do that, Xin has no room for me to build another industrial park. Let Frankberg become Future Group's factory in the Eurozone—this is the option that suits my interests. With the injection of our funds, the people will get jobs, and the government will have tax revenue. This is a win-win situation, isn't it?"</br>
</br>
Listening to Jiang Chen's unrealistic vision, Evelyn twitched and squeezed out a few words.</br>
</br>
"I sure hope so."</br>
</br>
The automobile industry was a 1:10 industry, which meant the output of one unit of the automobile industry could increase the overall output of at least 10 units in all sectors of the economy.</br>
</br>
The most direct impact was the development of upstream raw materials industries such as steel, petrochemicals, non-ferrous metals, plastics, rubber, and glass. In the mid-stream manufacturing process, the automotive industry had brought considerable benefits to industries such as machinery and electronics, CNC machine tools, and automated production lines. In the downstream industries, the automobile industry had effectively promoted logistics, finance, insurance, sales, and advertising industries. This huge multiplier effect was unmatched by any other industry.</br>
</br>
To boost Frankberg economically, choosing the automotive industry as an entry point was undoubtedly the perfect choice.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen wasn't helping Evelyn out of a spirit of selflessness. His money didn't grow on trees. Without profits, he wouldn't think at all.</br>
</br>
Taking advantage... um, a more elegant description would be... win-win! That was the motive for his decision to boost the Frankberg economy.</br>
</br>
28% of Research and Development personnel in the Frankberg industrial sector were engaged in automotive R\u0026D, while one-ninth of the employees in the automotive industry worked in R\u0026D-related fields. On average, the Frankberg automotive industry released 10 patents per day and generated 3,650 patents each year. All of this ensured the technological leadership of the Frankberg automotive industry, which Luer under Jiang Chen lacked.</br>
</br>
A lot of things had to take time to accumulate. Luer Motors was like a limping giant, leading the world in lithium-air batteries and wireless charging technology, but its management experience and research and development capabilities only compared to second-tier companies.</br>
</br>
However, these problems wouldn't exist if he acquired the Frankberg auto industry. With equity manipulation, Jiang Chen could allow the companies under his name to hold shares of other companies to allow for the exchange of experience and share the global market.</br>
</br>
Looking at the hazy Evelyn, Jiang Chen's eyes began to consider other opportunities.</br>
</br>
Since he already bought the automobile manufacturing industry, why not just spend more money and purchase the second pillar industry, electronics? Just as the tentacles of the global power grid plan already spread across Asia and brought a significant reduction to the cost of household electricity throughout Asia, the cost of household electricity had been greatly reduced. The entire Asian electronics market was ready for a chemical reaction to bring change to everyone's lives.</br>
</br>
But the old fox, Evelyn, wasn't an "indigenous" of MLL Island. What price would be appropriate this time?</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 1048: Battle of Dnieper River</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen and Evelyn worried about the future of Frankberg, it was late in Ukraine on the other side of the globe.</br>
</br>
It was already late May, and the air on the outskirts of Dnepropetrovsk began to feel hot.</br>
</br>
The old church stood alone in the middle of the shambles. Perhaps it was because the warring parties had intentionally avoided firing at it that it miraculously survived. In the cemetery behind the church, dark smoke slowly floated up. In order to prevent the plague from spreading, the citizens of the suburbs all helped the government forces to drag the dead bodies there and incinerate them.</br>
</br>
Two streets away from the church were the front lines.</br>
</br>
A ragged old mother limped forward and wandered around the Dnieper River filled with dead bodies. She was numb to the constant cannon shots in the distance. She mechanically touched the faces soaked by water as she muttered: "God", "Jesus", "No".</br>
</br>
The mother river that gave birth to the Ukraine people was now filled with countless floating bodies.</br>
</br>
Zhang Feng sighed, raised his hand and pressed on a button outside of the helmet.</br>
</br>
"A05 district, found a civilian ... who's going to bring her back?"</br>
</br>
After he ended the communication, he looked at the time and saw that it was time to change shifts, so he switched to the team channel.</br>
</br>
"Okay, guys, pack things up and get ready to change."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Soon, the squad sent by the militants took over defense from Zhang Feng. Several militants wearing worker uniforms placed machine guns behind the bunker, seemingly guarding their posts diligently. However, Zhang Feng knew that except for the captain who led the team, these people all recently joined the military without proper training.</br>
</br>
However, he didn't say anything.</br>
</br>
Why did it matter? Anyway, the situation was similar on the other side. The veterans' luck was exhausted, and it was the rookies' turn. At least the morale of the militants was high. They fought for freedom.</br>
</br>
At least they thought so.</br>
</br>
Out of kindness, Zhang Feng patted the shoulders of a soldier when he left, pointing to the ruins on the other side of the river.</br>
</br>
"At three o'clock, there will be firepower from the government forces."</br>
</br>
The captain in the gray sweater glanced on the other side of the river and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"Good luck—"</br>
</br>
BOOM.</br>
</br>
Zhang Feng didn't finish before the roar of the artillery interrupted his blessing.</br>
</br>
The two men bent down to protect their eyes and blocked the rubble from the ceiling. The glass window shattered into pieces, scaring the machine gunner to curse in horror while retreating into the corner.</br>
</br>
"Damn, *cough*. What are they doing?"</br>
</br>
After inhaling a full nose of dust, the captain straightened his back, dusted off his arm, and quickly walked to the window. He zoomed on the shoal of the river. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he subconsciously swore. "Fu*k…"</br>
</br>
</br>
Tanks and armored vehicles formed a steel wave. With the roar of artillery, the enemy launched an attack across the river. Soldiers screamed out and held the rifles on their chests, closely following the steel wave. They stepped across the burning ruins and assaulted the smoke-filled defense.</br>
</br>
The machine gunners on both sides directed firepower at each other, and orange trajectories darted wildly over the Dnieper River, tearing the quiet night sky into pieces. On the other side of the river, a dozen transport helicopters were escorted by armed helicopters, penetrating the flank of government forces.</br>
</br>
Leaning against the other side of the window, Zhang Feng blankly stared at the street in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Sir?" Sergey went to Zhang Feng and looked at him with questions in his eyes.</br>
</br>
Just as Zhang Feng was ready to answer "I don't know", the signal light in his vision flashed, and the commander's holographic image appeared. Raising his hand to stop Sergey from speaking, Zhang Feng listened to the commander's orders, then immediately saluted, following by a shout, "Yes, sir!"</br>
</br>
Sergey and Hans looked at each other with confusion then looked at their captain.</br>
</br>
After taking a long look at his team members, Zhang Feng took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, guys, the activity is temporarily canceled."</br>
</br>
"Ten minutes ago, Celestial Trade Command Center issued the highest attack order and ordered the frontline troops to cooperate with the militants to take Dnepropetrovsk Airport before dawn and pushed our defense line to the city center."</br>
</br>
"It's time to end the war. Let's cross the river to finish those idiots."</br>
</br>
"The destination is the airport. You have a minute to check the equipment! Now follow me to the checkpoint and get moving. MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!"</br>
</br>
The air filled with chaos blew in their faces and blew away any last remaining drowsiness. Behind the first teams to engage, Celestial Trade soldiers wearing kinetic skeletons rushed out behind cover and advanced through the shoal area at a faster-than-normal speed.</br>
</br>
Flare and fire flashed in the sky. Aurora-20s and F18s fought among the clouds. After a while, the parts belonging to the F18 fighters rained down.</br>
</br>
The anti-aircraft firepower deployed by the government forces in the eastern part of the city was marked by Celestial Trade Special Forces wearing K2 skeletons and turned into alloys by the tungsten rods descended from heaven. Under the cover of optical invisibility, they walked through the battlefield like ghosts. Even if government forces deployed a large number of infrared sensors on the front lines, they would still be dodged by these experienced veterans.</br>
</br>
In just ten minutes, five Aurora-20s obtained air superiority from the government forces. The dropped bombs set off a wave of explosions, sweeping a path for the militant's First Armored Brigade.</br>
</br>
The fierce battle seemed to have brought down the clouds from the sky, and rain began to splatter in the previously-clear night.</br>
</br>
Arrow's armed helicopters appeared in the northern part of the city, trying to flank the militants' forces. However, they lost their air superiority and were at the mercy of Aurora-20s. Without any need for missiles, the Aurora-20's machine guns sent the helicopters crashing into buildings.</br>
</br>
"Damn! Did they mobilize all of their tanks? These madmen!" Behind their defensive position, venting about the fragile firepower, the government soldiers shouted in horror, "Where are our anti-aircraft guns? Who's going to take care of those planes—"</br>
</br>
Without the opportunity to finish, a bomb landed above them. When the smoke dissipated, his unrecognizable corpse was already hanging on a billboard ten meters away.</br>
</br>
Not only did the government forces acting as the main force of combat face immense pressure, but Arrow's mercenaries were also placed in a difficult position.</br>
</br>
Unlike the temporarily armed refugees and European volunteers who fought on the Northern Line, they were sent by Arrow to guard the city. They were all veterans who had engaged in previous wars before. Having participated in two asymmetric wars prior, it was their first time being on the losing side.</br>
</br>
The strong people were still resisting in vain, and weak people were crying for God. They even forgot how to resist.</br>
</br>
In half an hour, two armored brigades completely lost combat ability, but the militants only paid a price of less than twenty tanks as they pushed forward two kilometers.</br>
</br>
Chaos was the tone of the city, and the government forces who could not change the fate of the war, began to desert. The Arrow mercenaries first began to desert. They didn't have any sense of honor in a war for someone else. Naturally, they didn't feel guilty when they ran.</br>
</br>
Immediately after the soldiers of the government force began to desert. Many of them were forced into the army. When they saw their captain was killed in action, almost everyone chose to take off their uniforms and hide in nearby houses.</br>
</br>
Looking at the battlefield through binoculars, a joyful smile emerged on the face of the militant commander.</br>
</br>
Anyone could see that there was no more suspense about the outcome of this war.</br>
</br>
Victory was only a matter of time.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The militants' offense lasted for eight hours. It wasn't until dawn that the control of the airport fell in the hands of the civil militants. Seeing that the situation was irreparable, the Ukraine forces and Arrow mercenaries were forced to withdraw from Dnepropetrovsk and hand over the strategic center of Europe's third-largest river.</br>
</br>
The news of the Dnieper River's victory spread to every corner of the world. It was so fast that some people didn't even get a hold of this sudden "accident".</br>
</br>
As for the result of this battle, some were happy while others were worried.</br>
</br>
Russia sent a congratulatory message to the militants, and at the same time urged the Ukraine government to make a choice to adapt to historical trends. The UA sent warnings to Russia, militants, and Celestial Trade, warning mercenary organizations not to add fuel to the situation in Ukraine...</br>
</br>
After receiving the good news, Jiang Chen, on Coro Island, had a good night's sleep.</br>
</br>
Although the victory was expected, there was nothing more joyous than listening to the celebratory trumpet.</br>
</br>
Of course, while it was an effortless win, it had a high cost.</br>
</br>
In just eight hours, Celestial Trade unloaded more than 2,000 guided tungsten rods to the enemy's frontlines. The bill for the space-based weapons alone was as high as 100 million XND. Of course, the majority would be footed by the Russians, so Jiang Chen wasn't in too much pain.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen expected, the victory on the Ukraine battlefield directly affected the revolution thousands of kilometers away. Militants crossed the Dnieper River and ignited war across the originally peaceful part of Kane. The country's capital located in the upper reaches of the Dnieper River was no longer safe.</br>
</br>
Ukraine was standing at the intersection of history—the decision to head east or west became the focus of the world. It was about whether NATO's frontlines would be in Ukraine or at its doorstep in Poland.</br>
</br>
"Useless fools!"</br>
</br>
The battle report was slammed onto the table.</br>
</br>
The office was silent. Other than Carmen's heavy breathing, there wasn't a single decibel of sound. Johnson and the executives of Arrow lowered their heads, terrified.</br>
</br>
Carmen's chest violently pumped and his bloodshot eyes covered any haze in his eyes, replaced only by madness.</br>
</br>
"I gave you the best weapons. A division couldn't stop two brigades. Were your fortifications made out of paper?"</br>
</br>
Sardes lowered his head. As the CEO of the Arrow Company, he wanted to argue for the soldiers on the frontlines. Against "space-based weapons", their fortifications and tanks were basically made out of paper.</br>
</br>
The real reason for their failure wasn't because of the terrifying space-based weapons, but it was because air supremacy was never in their hands. Even F35s couldn't gain an upper-hand against Aurora-20s, let alone the old MiG-29s and the second-hand F-18s from Western countries.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, Sardes didn't open his mouth after all. He knew that his boss was fuming. It was more effective to lower his head than to raise his head and argue.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for a long time. Carmen took a deep breath and calmed his emotions, speaking slowly: "How's the situation in Frankberg?"</br>
</br>
"It's not good..." Johnson hesitated, gritted his teeth, and finally said, "The 10th Armored Division is fighting the rebels in Bava. Although it's achieved victories, the number of rebels actually increased. Yesterday, at noon, the 23rd Mountain Infantry Brigade was blocked by a human-formed wall when it entered the city. The 12th Armored Brigade was attacked with Molotov cocktails. If the situation persists, we will probably lose control of Bava..."</br>
</br>
"We absolutely can't lose control of Bava." Carmen seemed to have recovered his rationality. He calmed said, "Add a division of mercenaries to Bava."</br>
</br>
"We don't have that many people," Sardes buried his head and said under immense pressure: "Our combat power has been contained on the Kane battlefield. If we dispatch troops from Ukraine, we can't stop the attack from militants and Celestial Trade, and we may lose Ukraine entirely..."</br>
</br>
Frankberg couldn't lose Bava. Europe couldn't lose Ukraine. For Carmen, it was a dilemma.</br>
</br>
After a moment of contemplation, Carmen made a decision.</br>
</br>
"It seems that the Frankberg military service system needs to be adjusted. Since they don't want to be soldiers, then we will change our recruitment system to a conscription system, and the army size will be expanded from three divisions to ten divisions."</br>
</br>
Johnson and Sardes looked at each other and saw each other's concern in their pupils. Everyone standing in this office knew it was a bad idea to amend the law at this time, but no one dared to say anything at that moment.</br>
</br>
If this was two years ago... No, even if it was a year ago, Carmen would never have made such a reckless decision. But now, his ambitions began to outgrow what he controlled or the strength of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
"The Federal Senate is unlikely to pass this proposal to amend the law. Earlier, the Minister of Defense raised the possibility of this change, but it was rejected by the Speaker. We have influence in the Senate, but some people have begun to question us—" The middle-aged man standing next to Sardes tried to convince Carmen from a reasonable point of view, but he was interrupted by an undeniable voice.</br>
</br>
"I will convince those who are sitting on the fence," Carmen said emotionlessly then eyed Johnson. "Make them understand who's the master of this country."</br>
</br>
Johnson was secretly relieved. He nodded, turned and left the room where he didn't want to stay for a second longer.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man no longer said anything, but he took a deep breath and looked around subtly then said, "Peter is still on a diplomatic visit to Sweden... I will tell him to come back."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, go."</br>
</br>
After receiving permission, the middle-aged man left the room with relief.</br>
</br>
There were only three people left in the room aside from Sardes, the CEO of Arrow. The other two were the managers of Arrow in Ukraine and Frankberg. From the start of the meeting, neither of them had said a word.</br>
</br>
"Nate."</br>
</br>
"Yes." The burly man with an obvious Jewish accent took a half step forward and answered.</br>
</br>
"My only request for you is to protect Kiev." After a pause, Carmen smiled and lowered his voice. "Remember, this is your last chance."</br>
</br>
Nate's muscles trembled involuntarily, and fear flashed across and quickly disappeared in his eyes. He knew very well what the last chance meant for him. The cold sweat gradually oozed down from his forehead. Being pierced by Carmen's gaze, he squeezed a word out of his throat.</br>
</br>
"Yes…"</br>
</br>
"Good, go on." Carmen nodded, indicating that he could go, and he turned to the other manager. "Mr. Derek, step forward."</br>
</br>
Derek didn't hesitate to take a step forward and quickly said, "Guaranteed to complete the mission!"</br>
</br>
"Yes? Not even asking the task? Very good." Carmen nodded with satisfaction. "At least your attitude is pleasing to me."</br>
</br>
Just as Derek felt relieved, his boss suddenly took out a pistol from his pocket and fired at his forehead.</br>
</br>
There was a spark and his blood stained the cashmere carpet.</br>
</br>
Derek couldn't dodge. His eyes were widened and frozen in shock before he collapsed on the floor.</br>
</br>
He didn't understand why he died.</br>
</br>
Carmen quickly answered the confusion in his heart, but he could no longer hear it.</br>
</br>
"It's understandable to lose against Celestial Trade. After all, the weapon differential is there. But you can't even deal with a group of mobs—what would be the use in me keeping you?" Carmen slowly spoke, raised his chin, then gently place the silver-plated revolver on the table.</br>
</br>
Sardes felt that his legs were weak. He didn't dare to look at his boss, and he didn't dare to look at his colleague lying next to him.</br>
</br>
"Sardes."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes!" Because he was trembling, Sardes' tone even changed.</br>
</br>
Carmen smiled and whispered: "Take him out, and congratulate the deputy manager of the Frankberg branch for me—he got promoted."</br>
</br>
"Yes..." Sardes gulped then his stiff waist and knees bent down and he put Derek on his shoulders.</br>
</br>
"Right—by the way, remind him for me again." Looking at Sardes, Carmen stopped him at the door and said with no emotion: "He only has one month. I need to see results in one month. Otherwise, the person on your shoulder will be his role model."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
As an extreme comparison to the turbulent Europe, the situation in Xin on the other side of the globe was encouraging.</br>
</br>
Although Evelyn wasn't elected as prime minister yet, Zhang Yaping showed the exiled head of state first-class courtesy under Jiang Chen's instructions. They put their European friend up at the British Royal Hotel, which had existed since the colonial era.</br>
</br>
All the members of the upper class in Xin were invited, and Jiang Chen was naturally amongst those who were invited.</br>
</br>
After hearing abut the victory at Dnieper River, Evelyn congratulated Jiang Chen. While expressing his praise for the military prowess of Celestial Trade, he said in a half-joking tone, "Why don't you send two orbital airborne brigades to Frankberg and end the war for us? Just put our name in the employer section—don't worry about the money."</br>
</br>
"I'm not that gutsy." Jiang Chen handed the empty glass to the waiter and took another cup of champagne. He swished the clear liquor. "Ukraine is already NATO's bottom line. If my people went a step further, your enemies wouldn't be Frankberg troops and special forces."</br>
</br>
It was important to know your limit. Entering a full-scale war with NATO wasn't something Jiang Chen wished. Regardless of whether he lost or won, the world would be no different than the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
A war that could stay rational till the last moment didn't exist.</br>
</br>
"It seems that you're not drunk." Evelyn laughed.</br>
</br>
"Are you testing me to see if I'm drunk? I'm sorry to disappoint you. This kind of juice is like boiled water to me." Jiang Chen also joked. He knew Evelyn wasn't really serious.</br>
</br>
Rather than testing him for drunkness, he was testing his ambitions for Europe. If Jiang Chen really thought about stationing troops in Frankberg, Evelyn would have to reconsider his cooperation with Celestial Trade. He didn't want to drive out the wolves only to bring in another tiger.</br>
</br>
After exchanging a few words with Jiang Chen, Evelyn went to socialize with other circles.</br>
</br>
Looking at the cunning old man chatting with several billionaires from Xin, Jiang Chen smiled and shook his head. He brought his champagne glass to the balcony next to the ballroom.</br>
</br>
I seem to be getting better and better this?</br>
</br>
A few years ago, he wouldn't be able to tell other people's intentions.</br>
</br>
The balcony was the second resting area at the banquet other than the dining table. As long as one stood there, no one would come and chat unless the guests were close.</br>
</br>
Leaning against the marble guardrail next to the balcony, the sea breeze from the western Pacific Ocean blew away the heat of his mind. To be honest, compared to the bustling ballroom, he enjoyed watching the bustling room from the side. Of course, it was nothing elegant. He spent most of his time watching what the ladies wore.</br>
</br>
Although he could see what the beach beauties wore from his balcony, they couldn't compare to the upper-class ladies. Regardless of their appearance and bodies, the difference in their temperament alone was like night and day. Jiang Chen noticed a very interesting phenomenon. The female guests at the banquet all looked fine.</br>
</br>
</br>
Anyway, since he had nothing to do, he simply tasted his champagne while he rated the ladies, easing up the tension he had felt in the past few days.</br>
</br>
Yet, he wasn't as relaxed as he appeared to be.</br>
</br>
He looked across the ballroom "observing", but he was very careful not to look at any one particular person for too long. If he caused unnecessary misunderstandings, that would be troublesome. After all, when he looked at others, many people were also peeking at him .</br>
</br>
After staying on the balcony for a while, the champagne glass in Jiang Chen's hand was empty. When he just saw a "princess" almost as cute as Yao Yao, a glamorous beauty walked over to him.</br>
</br>
She had a soft evening gown designed like a waterfall, pouring from her left shoulder to the carpet. A silk ribbon was wrapped around her waist, conservative but not without mystery. Her crystal high heels and her white ankles loomed under her spiral skirt, which complemented her fair skin above her neckline, highlighting her noble and glamorous temperament from inside out.</br>
</br>
"Do you want a drink?" With a glass of champagne in each hand, Xia Shiyu smiled and offered.</br>
</br>
"Of course, my beautiful queen." Jiang Chen placed the empty wine glass next to the marble guardrail. He teased her and took the champagne. "You're stunning today."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's thin red lips curled up, and her eyes were filled with gorgeous colors. Obviously, she was very fond of Jiang Chen's praise.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen wasn't a proper person. When she wasn't paying attention, he put his hand around her smooth waist.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's cheeks suddenly turned red from being pulled into Jiang Chen's arm. After she broke free, she looked around anxiously. When she realized no one had noticed, she felt relieved. Then she rolled her eyes. "What do you want? Look at the occasion..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen innocently shrugged, tilting his glass and gently clinking with her. "The Knight and the Queen—I thought you would like this setting."</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu heard the word "Knight", she blushed even more. She eyed Jiang Chen with a smirk then walked away in her high heels.</br>
</br>
Looking at her seductive figure. Jiang Chen put the glass close to the lips and a smile formed.</br>
</br>
[Maybe this dress will do for tonight?]</br>
</br>
Just then, there was a long-distance call from Europe which interrupted his reverie.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the holographic screen and saw it was Monica. He pressed the button and walked to a quiet corner of the balcony.</br>
</br>
"Peter has boarded the plane." As soon as he picked up, Monica spoke.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was slightly surprised.</br>
</br>
If he remembered correctly, Peter should be in Sweden for a three-day diplomatic visit, and his next stop should be the three Baltic countries. Why did he return to the country?</br>
</br>
For a moment, he couldn't guess why. He shook his head and didn't think about it anymore.</br>
</br>
Anyway, to someone already dead, there was no difference.</br>
</br>
"Good, you can execute."</br>
</br>
Monica closed her lips and smiled respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The battle ended.</br>
</br>
Based on estimations, there were 972 mutated human casualties, and 57 modified vehicles, 42 anti-air machineguns, 15 72mm cannons destroyed. Also, countless ammunition exploded.</br>
</br>
On the Fishbone side, there were 19 casualties with five people dead. No armored units were damaged. Black Blood Mercenaries suffered 9 fatalities and 21 casualties.</br>
</br>
All in all, this result could be considered historically significant.</br>
</br>
Flames that burnt on the snow had been extinguished. The soldiers were busy moving between places as they dragged the bodies of the mutated humans outside of the base and burnt them with fuel. If they just let them sit, it could draw out mutants hibernating near by. Although they would not lose, it would be troublesome to deal with.</br>
</br>
The 8 Tigers drove across Taifu river into the mutated human's base.</br>
</br>
Within the center of the base, the leader of Black Blood Mercenaries and Jiang Chen stood shoulder-to-shoulder as they chatted and laughed at the scene.</br>
</br>
"What the f*ck, that missile was wicked. The explosion left nothing behind." Luo Yang had a cigarette in his mouth and was staring at the metal scraps on the ground, still feeling uneasy.</br>
</br>
To be fair, the missile was not considered strong. It had no anti-radar layer, nor did it possess an energy shield to guard against anti-air laser weapons. It could only be considered a basic cruise missile where the commander sets the target for the missile, and then the control center calculates its trajectory.</br>
</br>
The first step was simple as it only required Jiang Chen's command.</br>
</br>
But the difficult part was the second step. Because of Jiang Chen's words, Jiang Lin had to spend an entire night in front of the computer.</br>
</br>
"It's okay." The word sounded humble, but Jiang Chen's laughter was cocky.</br>
</br>
[This is okay? Are you kidding me.]</br>
</br>
Luo Yang glanced at Jiang Chen with a "bright" smile as he ridiculed in his mind.</br>
</br>
"But then, there is no need to think about looting anymore." He cracked a smile. "Where did you get the cigarette?"</br>
</br>
"Somewhere good," Jiang Chen shrugged as he gave an ambiguous answer. "Maybe you can buy this from the Sixth Street very soon."</br>
</br>
The modern world was indeed a good place. Whether it was food, cigarette, or beer, everything was cheap. Of course, only relative to his net worth.</br>
</br>
"I wish I had Mr. Jiang's prosperity." Envy flashed across Luo Yang's eyes as he greeted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Prospering together. Aren't we?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Luo Yang paused for a second before he reacted with a smile.</br>
</br>
A fee of ten thousand crystals was added to upgrade his mercenaries' equipment to the next level. With the trade route to Liuding Town, the upgrades would begin this coming spring. Even if the spending power of Liuding Town was not as high as the Sixth Street, it still was the second biggest survivor's force in Wanghai City. There would at least be tens of thousands worth of profits. With 10%, his mercenary group being rewarded thousands of crystals with a single trip.</br>
</br>
</br>
On this wasteland, no ordinary bandits dared to butt heads with the Black Blood Mercenaries.</br>
</br>
The only problem was zombies and mutants. But as long as they avoided the city center, the route to the port was relatively safe.</br>
</br>
It was a winning business.</br>
</br>
Luo Yang was thinking how much money he could make, but Jiang Chen was thinking something else.</br>
</br>
Purchasing the microchips from Liuding Town improved the combat ability of the kinetic skeletons produced at the Fishbone base. At the same time, Liuding Town's technology would also offer great help to Jiang Chen's plan in the modern world.</br>
</br>
As long as he puts in an order, Liuding Town's chip factory would accept any kind of business, even the communication chips from one hundred years ago. Although it was a desolate technology for the apocalypse, it would still be ahead of the modern world's technology by ten years. This advancement was enough for Future Technology to conquer the phone market.</br>
</br>
As they envisioned their bright future, they both fell into silence.</br>
</br>
At this time, the communication chip beside Jiang Chen's ear vibrated.</br>
</br>
It was Zhao Chenwu.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to take a call," Jiang Chen told Luo Yang as he walked to the side.</br>
</br>
He picked up the call.</br>
</br>
"What's going on?' Jiang Chen said with a lighthearted tone.</br>
</br>
"Did you solve your troubles?" Zhao Chenwu's voice didn't sound as collected as before.</br>
</br>
"Yes, is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
"I have a few small problems, can you help me?" Slightly embarrassed, Zhao Chenwu still pleaded.</br>
</br>
His embarrassment was due to refusing Jiang Chen's help just moments ago.</br>
</br>
A mischevious expression appeared on Jiang Chen's face, but for the partner that had offered him quite some support, Jiang Chen didn't seem to be troubled.</br>
</br>
"Is it about the God's Cane in the city center? Speaking of this, I have received information that the thing didn't land on the earth's surface."</br>
</br>
"It is confirmed that it is fake." Zhao Chenwu's voice sounded bitter.</br>
</br>
"Then?"</br>
</br>
"Somone betrayed the Group of Ten council."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone as his expression was rather stern.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu briefly explained the situation.</br>
</br>
First, a declaration of war was sent to the Sixth Street two years ago, sending the peaceful council into unrest.</br>
</br>
The declaration of war has been intercepted by the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, the "treasure" mentioned in the visual had drawn the interest of Cao Jinsong. He had a feeling that the "treasure" mentioned by the Northern Alliance District could be a superweapon! Based on the simulation of a super computer, he obtained the conclusion that God's Cane landed in the city center of Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
Because of his greed, he hid the declaration of war and obviously hid his discovery of the sky-based weapon.</br>
</br>
He secretly sent exploration forces to the city center in an attempt to find the wreckage of the weapon with a plan to transport it to the secret base outside the city. If he could repair it, not only the Sixth Street, but the entire Pan-pacific area would be under his control.</br>
</br>
But in the end, he didn't find the wreckage. Instead, he wasted a decent size of his force.</br>
</br>
Just as he was debating if he should announce this declaration of war to allow the Sixth Street to prepare, the spy he planted in the Northern Alliance District had sent back good news.</br>
</br>
Civil war!</br>
</br>
The military government that controlled the majority of the survival camps had engaged in a gruesome war with another large force, the Dusk. Although the military government won in the end, they suffered significant losses which postponed their plan to advance to the east,</br>
</br>
Although the invader didn't come in the end, their stance of plotting against Wanghai City had alerted him.</br>
</br>
Also, the word civil war had given him a new idea.</br>
</br>
If the military government could use civil war to obtain absolute control in the Northern Alliance District, why couldn't his Crimson Chamber of Commerce do the same?</br>
</br>
Once the seed called ambition has been planted, it would spiral out of control.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 202: The Choice</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Dictatorship!</br>
</br>
What an attractive thought.</br>
</br>
Although they had sworn to coexist in front of the round table, the endless arguments through the years had made him grow wry.</br>
</br>
A proposal for the abolition of the ghetto would cause the ten council members to argue for half a month.</br>
</br>
It was just over a few thousand "bugs" and they had to argue for half a month.</br>
</br>
He has had enough.</br>
</br>
Crimson Chamber of Commerce, the strongest force, logically should control the piece of land. But under the hindrances of other nine council members, he could not have free reign. For example, the Disaster-32 cruise missile. One single missile would turn the military base into dust. For example, the Double-headed Bull Chamber of Commerce's Landbird armor, or...</br>
</br>
The people that became part of the Group of Ten council were no simple characters. Even if he possessed five Wanderer tank known as the land cruiser, it would still be difficult to do what he wanted.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he had a brilliant plan.</br>
</br>
When he threw out the bait that lured him to put his nose into the city center onto the conference table.</br>
</br>
Indubitably, he pleasedly saw that everyone's eyes turned red.</br>
</br>
Some due to the anger they had towards the Northern Alliance District. Some and the majority were due to the greed for the treasure.</br>
</br>
Sky-based weapon. The wreckage of God's Cane.</br>
</br>
As he had expected, the council passed the proposal to build a collective defense, face the external enemy together, and then explore the city center. However, every council member had their discreet moves as they didn't put much effort into building the defense. Instead, they leveraged the council to attack their political enemy. Criticizing other people for their lack of effort in the construction of the defense, while at the same time secretly sending out a large number of forces to explore the city center.</br>
</br>
As usual, everyone had their own plans, but all were within rationality.</br>
</br>
Then immediately, a piece of news shattered their rationality.</br>
</br>
A mission worth one million crystals.</br>
</br>
Because of this mission, the facade on everyone's face was ripped off.</br>
</br>
It was not only himself that did something behind everyone's back; everyone was plotting for that sky-based weapon.</br>
</br>
Regardless of their purpose, they could not let their competitor acquire the weapon.</br>
</br>
The nine council members all put their hands on the betting table.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Crimson Chamber of Commerce unleashed their machete to chop their hands.</br>
</br>
At the external area of city center, Crimson Chamber of Commerce first tried the Zhao Corporation which ignored the flames of civil war.</br>
</br>
To protect 80% of the force he sent into the city center, Zhao Chenwu permitted the usage of the Disaster-32 cruise missile in agony.</br>
</br>
Because of this, Cao Jinsong achieved his plan and also ignited the nuclear bomb which wiped out 80% of Zhao Chenwu's force. The same force he tried to save with his life.</br>
</br>
</br>
A Wanderer tank in exchange for a Diaster 32. The remainder four Wanderer tanks along with some infantries reaped the forces of the remaining council members.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the flames of war had erupted inside the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
As everyone knew, the force inside the inner circle was created by the private force of the Group of Ten council members in the form of an agreement to provide defense service. Now that the nine council members had sent out the majority of the forces to the city center, the inner circle was extremely lacking.</br>
</br>
Of course, not including the Crimson Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
The steel gate had fallen which segregated the inner and outer circle.</br>
</br>
The soldiers of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce engaged in heavy fire with the civil force along with other council member's private forces.</br>
</br>
With the manor of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce's boss being burnt down as the fuse, the flames of the civil war had officially been ignited.</br>
</br>
There were three options in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
First. The more conservative approach. Stop now and reinforce along the river.</br>
</br>
Second. Capitalize on the victory by heading for the Seventh Area.</br>
</br>
Third. Accept Zhao Chenwu's request for help and send out forces to help the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
To be honest, the second and third options were both tempting.</br>
</br>
The mutated humans suffer a significant loss if they march west. Along with the Defenders, it was a great opportunity to completely eliminate the mutated human beings in the Seventh area.</br>
</br>
But if they respond to Zhao Chenwu's request for help and send out forces to the Sixth Street, it would also bring a considerable amount of gains.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu's offer was attractive enough. If he helped the Group of Ten council, the weapon export restriction would no longer apply to him. Therefore, he could purchase power armors from the Sixth Street to equip his force.</br>
</br>
A tent was set up in the middle of the base.</br>
</br>
Within the base, Jiang Chen gathered Sun Jiao, Chu Nan, and Cheng Weiguo for a quick meeting.</br>
</br>
"There are a lot of choices in front of us. I want to listen to your opinions," Jiang Chen said straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
"If we could gain contact with the Defender Alliance in Jia City. Capitalizing on our victory is not a bad choice. If we can't, even without an armored vehicle, there are still around two thousand mutated humans stationed in the Seventh area. The safer choice would be to reinforce along the river," Cheng Weiguo gave an unbiased response.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded, he didn't make a comment but instead looked at Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"I support your decision," Sun Jiao smiled and said.</br>
</br>
"But I still want to listen to your opinion."</br>
</br>
"I personally don't agree with providing assistance."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Why?"</br>
</br>
"It has happened twice. When we encountered problems, he never sent help to us. Now that he has a problem, maybe we could sell him a few barrels of explosives," Sun Jiao said ruthlessly.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen smiled and didn't comment.</br>
</br>
It was indeed Sun Jiao. Such a simple and direct response was indeed her style.</br>
</br>
The few barrels of explosives would pay back the high-energy vacuum bomb Zhao Chenwu sold him last time. As for help, he did offer them some, and he did take some risks to do so.</br>
</br>
Although it would be thrilling to take an eye for an eye, it was infeasible for the base.</br>
</br>
As the leader of force, he should consider collective interest, not childish actions.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?" Jiang Chen looked at Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
"I agree with sending out a force." Chu Nan smiled.</br>
</br>
"Because of power armors?"</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, Chu Nan shook his head.</br>
</br>
"There is absolutely no need for that."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan paused as he looked at Jiang Chen, then continued.</br>
</br>
"Backstabbing each other, this is the end of the Group of Ten Council. It is not a bad idea for a new wise leader to rule the place."</br>
</br>
Everyone in the tent held their breath.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at Chu Nan dumbfoundedly, his expression was odd.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to say something, Cheng Weiguo already said what he wanted to say.</br>
</br>
"Do you know how many people are in the Sixth Street's civil force? A total of 560 people!"</br>
</br>
"How many would be left after this civil war? Especially when no one knows the ability of those soldiers." Chu Nan laughed nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Not only the force, but influence is also a factor. With the combination of the two, they could deter the small military forces around the Sixth Street, but if it was us..."</br>
</br>
"Now that everyone's strength has been spent on the city center. Mercenaries, hunting team for that one million crystals mission, the Group of Ten council for that sky-based weapon wreckage, the Sixth Street is at its weakest! There is only one opportunity. We could use the name of providing assistance to enter the inner circle and start a coup. As long as we control the inner circle, the Sixth Street would be under our control." Just he said these words, Chu Nan's eyes were locked onto Jiang Chen's.</br>
</br>
"This is a gamble. Can I hear the reason for this proposal?" Jiang Chen pondered for a moment before he spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Because I trust you. Only you can bring real order to this wasteland."</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"F*ck, their firepower is too suppressive!" With his back against the barrier, a civil soldier in a bulletproof vest attempted to shoot out of cover but was quickly subdued back.</br>
</br>
"We require cover fire! I repeat we need cover fire!"</br>
</br>
He clenched onto the rifle as the soldier hiding behind the concrete wall roared into the communication device with no reply.</br>
</br>
A soldier fearlessly ducked out of the cover and aimed at the anti-armor RPG. As the armored vehicle unleashed its reign of power, he pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
With a trail of red flames, the RPG flew like an iron fist. But when it was ten meters away from the armored vehicle, it was blown away by the activated nitrogen shield, and it smashed into the shop nearby.</br>
</br>
The subsequent fires shredded the soldier docked out into pieces.</br>
</br>
The battle erupted out of nowhere.</br>
</br>
The enemy was not only the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, but it was also some of the civil soldiers. They were bought out by the Crimson Chamber of Commerce. The moment the armored vehicle drove into the inner circle, they responded to the coup.</br>
</br>
It was an unfair battle.</br>
</br>
Although both sides didn't use heavy firearms, the private force of the council members was much more powerful than the civil soldiers'. Not only in training but also in equipment. Although the civil soldiers on the side of the council were 400, they were completely subdued by the force of 150 people from the Crimson Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
Especially since 100 something civil soldiers suddenly turned against them and they only had five armored vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns.</br>
</br>
On the side of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, even the ordinary light infantry wore carbon nano armor along with the digitalized helmet that provided shooting assistance. Not to mention the special forces wore kinetic skeletons, as well as power armors.</br>
</br>
Because of everyone's selfishness, although they possessed the most advanced fire production line on the wasteland, the council never proposed to upgrade the weapons of the civil force. Because only when the civil force lacked behind in technology, could their own private force be "hired." Their commission was not a small amount. It was paid through taxes and was essentially a gold mine.</br>
</br>
But now, they tasted their own medicine.</br>
</br>
The only soldiers that could match evenly in terms of equipment were the private soldiers of the other nine council members. But because of the city center exploration project, most of their power was put into the city center. There, they were scouring the reapings by the armored force of Crimson Chamber of Commerce; it was still a question how much would remain.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu stood on the top floor of the Zhao Corporation building as he speechlessly watched the gun fires below him in the Inner Circle.</br>
</br>
The ring of fire began to contract from the edge of the wall inwards; he knew exactly what that meant.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Crimson Chamber of Commerce had taken the upper hand. The 400 civil soldiers along with the 50 private soldiers suffered constant losses.</br>
</br>
He never imagined that five armored vehicles would push him to the edge.</br>
</br>
But that was the reality when both sides didn't possess heavy firearms. Even armored vehicles ruled.</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open, Su Lei walked in.</br>
</br>
The gorgeous female secretary with a cold expression had already changed into a pitch black combat suit. She carried the Reaper automatic rifle produced by the Zhao Corporation military factory. Normally, her identity was Zhao Chenwu's secretary, mistress as well as the driver. However, at critical times, she would act as the role of his bodyguard.</br>
</br>
"Boss, the Crimson Chamber of Commerce is approaching our building. Please retreat with me to a safe location," Su Lei said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Retreat? Where can we retreat to? The door has been shut tight." Zhao Chenwu smiled faintly.</br>
</br>
He had lost communication with Chen Wei. He must have died already.</br>
</br>
At this height, he obviously could not see that mushroom cloud.</br>
</br>
Nuclear bombs.</br>
</br>
He almost forgot about it.</br>
</br>
Speaking of that, it should be the cheapest thing here.</br>
</br>
"The underground shelter below Paradise Island hotel," Su Lei said.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Zhao Chenwu shook his head.</br>
</br>
"I never planned to use that thing. There is no shelter where you can hide forever. If that old thing won, even if I hide underground for ten years, the result would be the same."</br>
</br>
He has spent too much energy here. Even if it meant death, he didn't want to let everything go.</br>
</br>
"…I will fight for you till the last moment." Su Lei gave up on convincing her boss. She let out a sigh, and a rare smile appeared on her cold face.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu was at a loss as he feebly smiled. Saying nothing more, he kept looking downstairs.</br>
</br>
The rifle loaded, Su Lei walked downstairs.</br>
</br>
"Still not here?" He muttered to himself as he looked at the electronic clock on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen agreed to send help.</br>
</br>
It was the last straw.</br>
</br>
People of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce was approaching. He could even see through the dark bulletproof glass of the gunshots fired by the armored vehicles. The power armor used their high mobility to surround the building behind cover. The rotating machine gun on the right merciless shredded the soldiers on the ground.</br>
</br>
The floor shook violently all the sudden; the bulletproof glass jarred loudly. He already had guessed what has happened, but he still looked at the touchscreen on the table.</br>
</br>
He pressed the start button as the image from the hall surfaced.</br>
</br>
Outside of the door was soldiers of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce. Wearing kinetic skeleton, the steel made gate had already been blown open by aluminum heat agent. These soldiers carrying rifles quickly rushed into the building and exchanged fire with the building's security team.</br>
</br>
There was not much suspense in the battle. Although the security team of the Zhao Corporation received military training, compared to those professional soldiers, they obviously lacked in strength. Especially since they only wore bulletproof vests, like the civil soldiers. It was a frail attempt in the face of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce soldiers' attack.</br>
</br>
The first floor was captured quickly.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu saw with his own eyes that a soldier with kinetic skeleton pulled out a pistol and executed a struggling security wounded on the ground. Then, he turned the gun to the camera and pulled the trigger with a grimace.</br>
</br>
The visual was lost.</br>
</br>
The elevator was cut. The Crimson Chamber of Commerce fought fiercely with the Zhao Corporation's security within the safety tunnel. Boxes and safes were all thrown into the stairs as a blockade, but it was futile to the outcome of the battle.</br>
</br>
Su Lei was a great soldier. She gathered the remaining 20 security guards together as they exchanged fire on the 12th-floor hallway. She used the wall to take cover as she constantly ducked out to fire back.</br>
</br>
But from the blood on her shoulder, she probably wouldn't be able to last much longer.</br>
</br>
The security guards used anti-blast shields as cover while firing back with a rifle.</br>
</br>
The security robot dashed out with a machine gun from the corner; the shots caused casualties to the soldiers that entered the building.</br>
</br>
But that was all.</br>
</br>
An EMP grenade quickly disabled its weapon system. The particle gun without suspense cut through its metal armor, and it was turned into a pile of metal scraps.</br>
</br>
This place was not the military factory, only the office building of Zhao Corporation.</br>
</br>
With the balance of power, no one expected a war to break out here.</br>
</br>
Su Lei firmly held the gun as she maintained her shooting position while moving back. There were only a few security guards left.</br>
</br>
[Looks like they can't hold out much longer.]</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu let out a sigh as he pulled open a cupboard.</br>
</br>
There was a revolver inside.</br>
</br>
"Is this it?" He mumbled to himself as he slowly loaded the revolver.</br>
</br>
It has been a long time since he fought like a soldier on the front line. The last time seemed to the moment he became part of the Group of Ten council.</br>
</br>
But now, there was not much choice.</br>
</br>
The sound of explosion continuously transmitted from below him, but Zhao Chenwu never felt calmer.</br>
</br>
[Even if backup arrived, it is probably too late.]</br>
</br>
At this time, a blinding white light suddenly lit up the street in front of the building.</br>
</br>
The deafening explosion almost made him forget how to think. The bulletproof glass was covered in dense cracks.</br>
</br>
The rising mushroom.</br>
</br>
"…F*ck." His mouth twitched, and his eyes shook from the scene. It was the only word that came out of his mouth.</br>
</br>
Nuclear bomb!</br>
</br>
Someone exploded a nuclear bomb in the inner circle.</br>
</br>
It definitely could not be the Crimson Chamber of Commerce. They already had the upper hand. It must not be the civil force either; they wouldn't have such a thing.</br>
</br>
It could only be a council member.</br>
</br>
They would rather die together than give up the power in their hands.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu blankly stared at the mushroom cloud in front of him, but the action in his hands already ceased.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The shockwave flipped the armored vehicles, engulfed the fleeting power armors, and swept through all the soldiers unable to escape. The buildings worth tens of thousands instantly collapsed. The citizens without a fighting chance cried at the ruins. The merchants silently watch their shops turn into dust, forgetting even to run…</br>
</br>
The soldiers attacking his building; he didn't want to see any more.</br>
</br>
It was a bloodbath.</br>
</br>
Looking at the council building in the distance, the flag representing alliance and democracy lowered. A mocking smile appeared at the tip of his lips.</br>
</br>
The council building, the Crimson Chamber of Commerce had risen on the roof.</br>
</br>
The roundtable was smashed in half. Cao Jinsong stood in front of the window alone as he stared at the mushroom cloud outside, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Like a bucket of cold water was poured on his head, the excitement of climbing to the top of power was instantly cooled off.</br>
</br>
He had considered that other council members possessing some unbelievable trap cards, the coup was a gamble, to begin with.</br>
</br>
But he never considered that someone could explode a nuclear bomb here.</br>
</br>
"Already gone insane?" His voice sounded bitter.</br>
</br>
It made sense. On the wasteland without order, thinking about limits was foolish, to begin with.</br>
</br>
Exploding a nuclear bomb in one's own city; even in the country before the war had the same thing occur.</br>
</br>
He seemed to have seen these scene before.</br>
</br>
But because it was too distant of a time, that part of his memory was already covered by a thin layer of white mist…</br>
</br>
War never changes.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 204: The Chaotic War</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Nuclear weapons were always the cheapest thing on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Like the landmines that covered entire fields after the Second World War</br>
</br>
Without the need for sophisticated missiles, the tactical nukes that could be fired with artillery was an economical and efficient killing tool.</br>
</br>
Although the alliance government after the war had collected the nuclear weapon left on the battlefield, there must be some left out there.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu didn't want to think about who exploded the nuclear bomb.</br>
</br>
There was no purpose in who did it.</br>
</br>
As he watched from afar, he saw black smoke rise from his competitor Feng De's building. It then immediately collapsed.</br>
</br>
That fat *ss didn't compromise till the last moment as he chose to self-destruct the building and suicide along with the soldiers inside.</br>
</br>
Just like that nuclear bomb.</br>
</br>
The other council members suffered the same fate. Cao Jinsong seemed to have expected that the entire political power was concentrated in the hands of the few council members. After he broke through the defense line of the civil force, its soldiers immediately attacked the headquarters of the council members.</br>
</br>
The nuclear bomb didn't turn the tide of the battle; it was only a death trigger.</br>
</br>
As if they had suspected this would occur, the Crimson Chamber of Commerce forces were dispersed, the nuclear bomb didn't even hit one-fourth of their forces.</br>
</br>
[Already lost?]</br>
</br>
But just then, his phone suddenly rang.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Which floor are you on?"</br>
</br>
Like a heaven's melody, the voice he had been hoping to hear for so long rang into his ear.</br>
</br>
"21st floor," Feeling ecstatic, Zhao Chenwu said quickly.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I am not asking what floor you are on, I am asking about the soldiers in your building."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu paused for a second as he glanced at the visuals on the touchscreen.</br>
</br>
Su Lei has already retreated to the 16th floor, the 15th floor was completely occupied by the Crimson Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
"15th."</br>
</br>
"Got it."</br>
</br>
Just as the voice fade, explosion transmitted below him.</br>
</br>
The violent shaking almost sent him to the ground. He blankly stared out the window at the black dot in the sky.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The building in the distance had a daunting hole created on the structure as it exposed the steel frames.</br>
</br>
"Direct hit, beautiful shot."</br>
</br>
Looking at the visual on his table, Jiang Chen gave a thumbs up at the gunner at the hatch door.</br>
</br>
The gunner was excited to hear Jiang Chen's praise as he worked extra hard to load the cartridge before he waited for further instructions.</br>
</br>
He has been watching the battle for a while. Jiang Chen saw everything, including that nuclear.</br>
</br>
He just didn't expect someone to explode a nuclear weapon in the inner circle.</br>
</br>
</br>
To prevent this place from turning into shambles, he felt he must join the fray.</br>
</br>
"Retreating? No…" Jiang Chen looked at the fleeing dots on the screen, he muttered and pressed his finger on the screen.</br>
</br>
He had been using to the buzz of the electricity as well as the noise of breaking the sound barrier as snow was blown over ten meters high on the street within the screen.</br>
</br>
The retreating armored vehicle was smashed into pieces by the 10 kg level bomb without suspense.</br>
</br>
It was as easy as playing a computer game.</br>
</br>
The green dots on the ground began to surround the inner circle, it was Fishbone's soldiers.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left the Black Blood Mercenaries along the Taifu river. He didn't tell Luo Yang about the battle at the Sixth Street. He only said to him as long as he was stationed here for three days, he would receive 100 more crystals.</br>
</br>
No one would reject this kind of deal. Everyone knew that mutated humans could no longer invade the east.</br>
</br>
To avoid unexpected things from occurring, the mercenary force ranked one at the Sixth Street was left somewhere further away.</br>
</br>
Once the primary force approached the Sixth Street, Sun Jiao immediately declared their stance, with the identity of the alliance of Zhao Corporation to provide backup. The thirty-something civil soldiers cluelessly allowed them to pass without hesitation and then opened the airspace to Chu Nan's helicopter.</br>
</br>
They were loyal to the council, although the organization was in complete disarray since the Crimson Chamber of Commerce chose to fire at the council. The Crimson Chamber of Commerce was their enemy.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Buddy, you don't mind if I make a hole in the inner circle wall right?" Jiang Chen opened the communication channel with a grin.</br>
</br>
"…I don't mind."</br>
</br>
The Inner Circle wall was firm. It took four 10 kg level bombs to blow a corner apart.</br>
</br>
Seeing the wall had collapsed, Sun Jiao immediately led the 200 soldiers to approach that breaking point. The 6 power armors were responsible as the primary attack force, along with the 8 modified pickup trucks with machine guns attached and thirty-something soldiers with kinetic skeletons. Under air support, the scale of the war was leaning towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Zhao Gang, lead your people to take out their anti-air machine gun, as well as the anti-air missile." Jiang Chen continued to order.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Another 50 something people entered into the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The wall had been broken. The remaining civil soldiers all entered the Inner Circle for assistance, and the Outer Circle was left completely defenseless. The 50 people quickly took control of the anti-air control center and captured the workers on duty as well as confiscated all communication equipment.</br>
</br>
With this, there was nothing that could threaten this Type-51 helicopter.</br>
</br>
With the artillery support of this air gunship, the Sun Jiao led ground forces forced their way into the center of the Inner Circle. The people of Crimson Chamber of Commerce were completely dumbfounded by the force that suddenly joined the fray. Any points of power gathered together would be shredded into pieces by the 10 kg level shell.</br>
</br>
"The major street has been captured." Sun Jiao voice was transmitted to him.</br>
</br>
"Continue to push towards the council building," Jiang Chen ordered firmly.</br>
</br>
"Understood!"</br>
</br>
The targets of attack of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce were the headquarters of all the council members. From the looks of it, at least four council members were killed already.</br>
</br>
Only five council members desperately tried to hold their ground.</br>
</br>
"How long until your people get here? My side can't hold any longer. Zhao Chenwu's voice rang by his ear, along with the noise of a few gunshots mixed in between.</br>
</br>
"Very soon… Also, I recommend you open the window, and stay obediently inside your office."</br>
</br>
After he finished speaking, Jiang Chen closed the communication channel. At the same time, he ordered Chu Nan to fly the helicopter over and lower its elevation.</br>
</br>
"It's time for a surgery."</br>
</br>
"Personally, I recommend for Zhao Chenwu to die. By diminishing the old force, our coup is more likely to succeed." While operating the helicopter, Chu Nan said some formidable points.</br>
</br>
"…Perhaps. But there might be other uses for him later." Jiang Chen signaled Zhou Xiaoxia, who sat quietly across from him.</br>
</br>
She didn't say anything as she stood up and walked to the hatch door.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan shrugged as he didn't continue to try and convince his boss. He simply pressed a button below the control rod.</br>
</br>
Auto suspension once again opened. The electric pulse cannon was dragged into the cabin.</br>
</br>
Zhou Xiaoxia skillfully took off the sniper rifle on her back and aimed at the building.</br>
</br>
The zone scanned by the crosshair had only bodies remain.</br>
</br>
Search, fire, bolt, next.</br>
</br>
A set of swift actions.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu leaning behind his office table hugged his wounded secretary and gestured thank you to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and didn't say anything. He only held onto the tablet and looked towards the ground.</br>
</br>
It was already over.</br>
</br>
But this Inner Circle no longer had its formal glory. It has been changed into an entirely different scene.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Before dusk had arrived, the war was over.</br>
</br>
The soldiers that entered the council building found Cao Jinsong's body in the chamber.</br>
</br>
His temple was bleeding, and he held a pistol in his hand. When defeat was inevitable, this old man chose to suicide.</br>
</br>
Seeing that their boss died, the soldiers all dropped their weapons in hand and surrendered.</br>
</br>
The Crimson Chamber of Commerce's flag was dragged down by the soldiers who climbed onto the top of the building and was thrown into a pile of flame.</br>
</br>
"Died? He got off easy." Zhao Chenwu cursed while he limped beside Jiang Chen. His leg got shot. Although the wound has already been treated, he was still constricted by it.</br>
</br>
At that time, the two of them walked side by side in the hallway of the council building.</br>
</br>
There were only five people left out of the ten. A meeting was called.</br>
</br>
There was so much needed to be discussed.</br>
</br>
"Thank you so much. This way, without your people, Cao Jinsong, would have already succeeded. I'll do my best to say good things about you on the council." Zhao Chenwu smiled.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about it. As to good things... I think I can gain it by myself like before?"</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu's feet stopped. His smile froze on his face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed, pushed open the door to the chamber, and walked inside.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Because that roundtable had been smashed, Jiang Chen ordered the soldiers to drag a long table from elsewhere.</br>
</br>
The five council members sat on either side. However, Jiang Chen shamelessly sat at the head of the table.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's move, Zhao Chenwu seemed to know what he wanted to do. He let out a sigh and didn't say anything.</br>
</br>
But the other four council members didn't take it so well. If it were not for the two soldiers holding rifles and wearing kinetic skeletons, they probably would have jumped up and expressed their dissatisfaction.</br>
</br>
"For the tragedy that occur here, I express my condolences."</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's words, the council members all cursed in their minds.</br>
</br>
There was not a trace of condolence on his face.</br>
</br>
"But life must continue. Since everyone here is really busy, let's get things started."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged and said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I agree. The cleaning of the radiation materials in the inner circle, as well as rebuilding, must commence soon." A tall council member nodded. His name was Kong Zhe, the owner of Double-headed Bull Chamber of Commerce. Although he just received communication from the front line that his trap card - the Landbird Armor was destroyed by the Crimson Chamber of Commerce Wanderer tank, still 30 something soldiers managed to survive as they began to retreat towards the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"I consent."</br>
</br>
"I agree."</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu didn't say anything, but from his expression, he looked desolate.</br>
</br>
</br>
In this civil war, he suffered the most loss among all council members. Two spider tanks, 20 power armors, Disaster-32 cruise missile, as well as great soldiers. Now the only remaining force for the Zhao Corporation was the five power armors and 5- soldiers sent to the outskirts of the city to build a defense line.</br>
</br>
"First, we should hear some good news." Jiang Chen took out a graphene card from his pocket and put it on the table. "This is what we found on that old fox's body, the information recorded, the declaration of war was from three years ago. Also, because of their internal conflict, their plan to invade the east fell through."</br>
</br>
All the council members let out a sigh of relief.</br>
</br>
After going through the tragic civil war, if the Northern Alliance area attacked, without two to three years to rebuild, they had no odds of winning.</br>
</br>
"This is great news. In this case, the defense can be put aside for now." A council member with a beer belly wiped the sweat from his forehead. His name was Fan Chen. He operated the largest construction company at Sixth Street, the metal shell company's owner.</br>
</br>
Because of his weak force to begin with, in the civil war, his force suffered the smallest lost, but he had the most direct economic loss.</br>
</br>
The west side of the Inner Circle was turned into shambles by the nuclear bomb. As the biggest real estate owner of the Sixth Street, his direct loss was as high as two million crystals.</br>
</br>
But he certainly didn't look too remorseful, because being able to survive was always the best case scenario.</br>
</br>
"That's right. Moving the soldiers back from the frontline would also help to stabilize the situation of the Sixth Street. As to what is happening in the Inner Circle, the mercenaries and bandits who depend on the Sixth Street are starting to become unsettled. We must restore the authority of the Group of Ten council and control the situation," Kong Zhe said sternly.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about that, my people have already controlled the situation in the Outer Circle. After sending a 10kg level bomb to a small mercenary force attempting to take advantage of the situation, everyone seemed to have calmed down." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
The chamber was suddenly silenced. It was so quiet that if a needle dropped onto the ground, it would be clearly heard.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, could your helicopter be flown away now..." After moments of silence, Kong Zhe difficulty squeezed those words out.</br>
</br>
"To stabilize the situation, my helicopter will conduct routine air patrol. Trust me, this is for your own benefit." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Our soldiers will be back. As long as we restart the council, the situation will quickly be stabilized... Oh, let's talk about your compensation. The Sixth Street treasury will pay fifty thousand crystals as compensation for your assistance." Fan Chen's expression looked rather awkward, but he still squeezed a smile and proposed in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Fifty thousand? Are you pitying a hobo?" Jiang Chen couldn't help but laugh.</br>
</br>
"Then what does Mr. Jiang think?" Kong Zhe's expression turned cold.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I just want to take away what I deserve." Jiang Chen with a casual expression leaned against the chair, with fingers crossed, "For example, this council building. Since I got it back from Cao Jinsong, shouldn't it belong to me?"</br>
</br>
"This is crazy. You can't do that!" A council member stood up and furiously stared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"No one will listen to your order."</br>
</br>
"With just two hundred something people, don't you think your appetite is too big?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patiently waited for these furious council members to express their frustration, then he coughed lightly.</br>
</br>
When everyone looked in his direction, Jiang Chen slowly spoke out.</br>
</br>
"But you don't have a choice, isn't that right?"</br>
</br>
Everyone was suddenly speechless.</br>
</br>
"My people are outside, with two at the door now." Jiang Chen's chin pointed towards the two soldiers at the door. The two soldiers with rifles immediately saluted him and continued to stand on guard.</br>
</br>
"But you don't even know how many of your soldiers are alive."</br>
</br>
"The anti-air control center of the Sixth Street has been occupied by us. My helicopter can easily make any disagreeing voice shut up."</br>
</br>
"I am not negotiating with you; I am only declaring the facts."</br>
</br>
"From now on, this is my territory."</br>
</br>
"I will use my way to bring stability here."</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
The meeting quickly concluded.</br>
</br>
No, it was not a meeting. For Jiang Chen didn't discuss anything with them, but rather he announced the plans from today onwards.</br>
</br>
Starting today, the Sixth Street will be under a curfew with a duration of at least ten days until the situation was stabilized.</br>
</br>
The Group of Ten council will be expanded to twenty people, separated into upper house and lower house, which will be represented by influential merchants and industry leaders. The upper house would be represented by merchants with registered assets in the top ten, the lower house would be voted in.</br>
</br>
Because the civil group lost more than 80% of its force, partially due to internal corruption, they would dissipate immediately after the weapons are collected. The defense of the Sixth Street would be completely taken over by the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
To avoid similar civil wars from occurring again, Jiang Chen announced that a military government would be instated in the Sixth Street and control the law enforcement military authority. It would also have the right to veto any proposal from the council. The council's rights were strictly limited to law proposal and administration.</br>
</br>
As to the head of the military government - the role of the General had naturally fallen on Jiang Chen's shoulders.</br>
</br>
The decision to implement monarchy Constitution was also Chu Nan's proposal.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was surprised to discover that that guy knew quite a lot about politics.</br>
</br>
"Although the power of the Group of Ten Council has been cut by more than half in the city center due to the civil war, they should still not be underestimated. Whether it be their reputation in the Sixth Street or the soldiers on the front line. If we could not convince all of them, then we will have to dilute the power in their hands so the small forces in the Outer Circle will stand by our side. We only need to control the military. There is not much difference between direct and indirect control."</br>
</br>
The establishment of the lower house was great news for the small merchants, mercenaries, and hunting groups in the outer circle. Although there was a lot of them, because of the difference among them, they were always pushed outside of the center of power.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's decision obviously won the support of this minority. Although they wouldn't do anything, it without a doubt stabilized the situation. Along with the deterrence of force, the bigger mercenary forces chose to stay put.</br>
</br>
As to the five council members, including Zhao Chenwu, they were forced to accept the "glory chip" injection and became Fishbone Base's knight.</br>
</br>
As to their "cooperation", Jiang Chen highly noted the actions to be taken and promised that he would not misappropriate their assets at the Sixth Street. Also, Jiang Chen divided half of the property of the council members that suffered an unfortunate death as compensation to the remaining members. To some degree, it comforted their displeased mood.</br>
</br>
</br>
To these ruthless leaders, he had to use this method to control them.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the second floor of the council building, an office had been cleared out and transformed into the office of the military government general.</br>
</br>
Sitting in front of the table, Sun Jiao held a tablet as she reported their progress in the last few days to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"52 Crimson Chamber of Commerce soldiers were captured and all injected with slavery chips. They were reincorporated into the force stationed at the Shenxiang town colony. The rebels in the city center saw the coup has failed, and one Wanderer tank surrendered to us, while the other three retreated to the Crimson Chamber of Commerce base outside of the city.</br>
</br>
The surrender of the Wanderer tank was a joyful surprise to Jiang Chen!</br>
</br>
The use of Meissner effect of electromagnetic reaction armor would almost make the vast majority of metal shell kinetic energy weapons fail. Particle Shields also have a degree of resistance to energy weapons. As the main weapon of the type fifty-two particles, it can turn the vast majority of armored units into scrap.</br>
</br>
With the addition of the Wanderer tank, the armor force of the Fishbone base had improved by a level.</br>
</br>
"Is there any reaction from the Crimson Chamber of Commerce military base outside of the city?"</br>
</br>
"Not yet. They seemed to have some internal turmoil. Followed by Cao Jinsong's death, the slavery chip injected into his nephew Cao Wei's body had automatically failed. On the distribution of power, Cao Wei and Cao Jinsong's son had a disagreement."</br>
</br>
"Internal disagreement again..." Jiang Chen muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"Human minds are not something that could be controlled by the chip."</br>
</br>
Human minds?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head as he decided not to think about it anymore. He signaled for Sun Jiao to continue.</br>
</br>
"From the battlefield along with the warehouse of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, we looted ten power armors, 87 kinetic skeletons, and 210 carbon nano armors. Some of the equipment only require minor repairs before it can be used." A smile emerged on Sun Jiao's face</br>
</br>
"There is still better news to come." A sense of proudness appeared at the tip of Sun Jiao's tongue, she continued, "Acquired assets total a value of 1.5 million crystals, as well as one military factory, two pharmaceutical factories, and an organic material power plant."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gasped for breath before his face turned ecstatic.</br>
</br>
Organic material power plant. One ton of zombie fat would provide one thousand to two thousand watts of electricity. Thirty percent of the Sixth Street's power was generated by this power plant, removing the cost, on average one hundred watts would bring a profit of two crystals. A day's profit was between seven hundred to one thousand crystals.</br>
</br>
"How are you going to reward me?" Seeing the excitement on Jiang Chen's face, Sun Jiao flirtatiously blew him a kiss and said coyly.</br>
</br>
"Would a kiss be enough?" Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gave him a dirty looked as she pouted her mouth, put away the tablet, and complained while briefly stretching.</br>
</br>
"Done reporting. So tiring these few days, when are we going to go home?"</br>
</br>
"In a few more days. If you are tired, I can give you a massage." Jiang Chen peeked at the softness that was about to pop out of her clothes as he joked.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's face was covered by a thin layer of red, but she had a smirk on her face.</br>
</br>
She walked in front of the table, and in a seductive position, she sat down on it. Then, with one hand leaning against the table, the other hand's finger gently lifted Jiang Chen's chin, she put her face near his.</br>
</br>
"I want it now," the girl said flirtatiously.</br>
</br>
"Now? Uh, there is no place here."</br>
</br>
"There is a table right here. I can lie on top." With a seductive tone, the delicate finger slowly moved onto the table as there was only tenderness in her eyes.</br>
</br>
[This devil...]</br>
</br>
[In the office?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped. Just as he was about to succumb to the wild idea and reach his hand uncontrollably for that slightly opened collar-</br>
</br>
Knock knock.</br>
</br>
The sudden knock came from the door.</br>
</br>
Like a cat, Sun Jiao swiftly got off the table and stood still. Jiang Chen also put his hand on the table as if nothing had happened, but his eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, come in," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open. Cheng Weiguo's loyal face entered Jiang Chen's sight.</br>
</br>
Seeing the stern expression on the boss, as well as the displeased look on the "female boss"'s face, he seemed to have realized something as an awkward expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Uh, should I leave now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed his expression, and he too felt awkward, but he tried his best to remain composed.</br>
</br>
"No need. Important matters first."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Cheng Weiguo's face also became serious, and he thought, [That's the boss, he puts the important issue first!]</br>
</br>
So he quickly explained, "Liuding town has sent an ambassador who wants to meet you."</br>
</br>
Liuding town?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows rose.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 207: Liuding Town's Ambassador</br>
</div></br>
</br>
June 16, 2171, the South Sea War erupted. The battlefield was not only limited to the South Sea; it was not even limited to the sea itself.</br>
</br>
The flames of war spread across the twelve jurisdictions under PAC's control. The Bohai aircraft carrier fleet had a showdown with the Obama aircraft carrier 30 kilometers west of Jizhou Island, with NATO barely snatching a victory.</br>
</br>
The retreating Bohai smashed into Wanghai City's port because of nuclear strikes and EMP. Due to it losing its combat power early, it became one of the vessels best preserved after the war.</br>
</br>
A satirical ending.</br>
</br>
Because of funding problems, the World Alliance Organization leading the order after the war didn't repair the Bohai. Instead, it permitted survivors from migrating. Then, they fired the space colonization ship from Kennedy Space Center, Plesetsk Space launch position, Jiuquan Launch Center. The World Alliance Organization was officially dissolved, the subsequent nuclear winter along with a series of critical events occurred. The people being deserted went through the initial suspension before finally choosing to unite together...</br>
</br>
This is the history of Liuding town.</br>
</br>
If the pieces of history were described in detail, it would be an epic no less than one million words.</br>
</br>
"To put it in simple terms, all kinds of interesting people gathered there. There were "locals" like those who had entered the boat when I was young, NATO soldiers that gave up their nationalities, the suckers that didn't go into fallout shelters, and "pre-war" people from the fallout shelter that opened early.</br>
</br>
He cracked a smile as Chu Nan dragged the control rod and casually chatted with Jiang Chen who sat in the passenger seat.</br>
</br>
"What's life there like?" Jiang Chen asked, but his gaze was focused on what was outside the window.</br>
</br>
"So so. Because I was a pilot, my salary was reasonable. If I save the money for alcohol, I can eat a meal of sardines a week. That thing tasted pretty good with a low level of mutation. Also, on the deserted armory in the aircraft carrier, with only ten crystals, you can find a rather attractive girl to sleep with you."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Chu Nan smiled reminiscently.</br>
</br>
The third day on routine patrol.</br>
</br>
The nuclear crater, like a horrifying scar, pierced the land within the Inner Circle.</br>
</br>
Teams of cleaning personnel in orange protective suits carried a wide box with a thin hose in their hands, walked among the shambles while spraying radiation cleaner at things.</br>
</br>
For local radiation, this radiation cleaner was quite effective. With only a spray, it would neutralize the radioactive element on the surface.</br>
</br>
At the same time, it was complicated to manufacture with an expensive price tag. The World Alliance government did manufacture a batch, but for the radiation that covered the entire world, it was rather futile.</br>
</br>
</br>
If it were not for the tightly packed Inner Circle where land was valuable, Jiang Chen would not have permitted the usage of the expensive radiation cleaner.</br>
</br>
Since it was his territory now, he would have to allow the radiation to return to normal before the construction team could restart the rebuilding process.</br>
</br>
"I am asking about industrial capability, as well as the military force, you know."</br>
</br>
"The military is primarily comprised of an air force, with artillery assisting. As to industrial? Liuding Town doesn't have any industrial capabilities. It doesn't need any industrial capabilities." Chu Nan laughed.</br>
</br>
He paused for a moment before he continued, "The Beer Cap company is Liuding town's factory. They possess tremendous industrial capabilities and produce all kinds of bombs, shells, and aircraft missiles, as well as heavy machinery. There are some smaller survival camps spread out on the wasteland that transport goods to Liuding town.</br>
</br>
"Is the only specialty from Liuding Town sardines?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Of course not. A fair amount of mutant fish have rather "mild" changes; the crystal number is also stable. The income from fishing is not only the fish meat but also the sesame sized crystals on the fishbone. Also, there is the chip production industry, without the need for a significant amount of space, the raw materials were also easy to obtain by the side of the sea, but these are not the important points."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan mysteriously smiled as he looked at Jiang Chen dubiously.</br>
</br>
"The most luxurious casino and brothel on the wasteland are there. There are all kinds of tricks and games you can play, also very magical. A lot of merchants from Su city and Hang city visit because of the name as they hand over their hard earned crystals willingly while having the time of their life."</br>
</br>
"Then it's a great place, have you tried it before?"</br>
</br>
"No, I am only a cheap pilot," Chu Nan shrugged as he said helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Other than this?"</br>
</br>
"And artillery agreement."</br>
</br>
"Artillery agreement?' Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"That's right, that's also part of Liuding Town's business." The patrol was over. Chu Nan controlled the helicopter while pressing a few buttons as they started to make their return.</br>
</br>
"Bohai's electromagnetic cannon has a range of 500 kilometers. Therefore it can fire from the outskirts of Long River to Luzhou. Of course, the further the distance, the higher the cost, and the lower the accuracy. But it can easily strike targets in Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
"Therefore?"</br>
</br>
"One 100 kg level bomb costs 2000 crystals. It could be used on any small force, not within the artillery agreement. As to the artillery agreement, there is a fee of 10000 crystals per month."</br>
</br>
"What, that is like asking for a protection fee," Jiang Chen cursed.</br>
</br>
"It is a protection fee. So the reason they come to the Sixth Street is evident," Chu Nan said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Did the Sixth Street pay them before?"</br>
</br>
"No, because Disaster-32, that belonged to Zhao Corporation, could send them into the deep sea without the ability to defend at all, and the five Wanderer tank of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce could also cut off their supplies... But now, these things seem to be gone. The only remaining Wanderer tank could be counted as a chip on the table, but it doesn't provide deterrence anymore."</br>
</br>
The civil war had cost all the trap cards of the Group of Ten council. It also cost the firm stance of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The trap cards were not only there to create a balance of power, but it also deterred the external enemies.</br>
</br>
"Do you think I should agree to the artillery agreement?" Jiang Chen nonchalantly laughed.</br>
</br>
To be honest, if it was not for the fact that the Fishbone Base hasn't trained an experienced pilot, Jiang Chen really wanted to move Chu Nan into a managing role. A helicopter pilot was too limiting for his ability. Considering their take over of the Sixth Street alone, regardless of the decision of stabilizing the situation, Chu Nan offered him a lot of help.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, although ten thousand crystals were nothing to the Sixth Street, that doesn't mean we need to lower our heads to them."</br>
</br>
"Oh? We have other trap cards?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Chu Nan smiled, "Did the boss forget, what did we use to destroy the mutated humans?"</br>
</br>
"That big firework?" Jiang Chen burst out laughing, "that thing might not be enough for aircraft carriers."</br>
</br>
The technical content of the "ballistic missile" was too low. If it were not for the mutated humans being too careless with the construction of their base, a missile would not take out over half of their force.</br>
</br>
Anti-missile technology before the war was extremely advanced. Basic ones included radar lock on and laser anti-missile. The reason Disaster-32 was strong because it could render the most anti-missile system useless.</br>
</br>
If that missile were used to smash Liuding town, before it could land, it would be shot down by the anti-air laser cannon.</br>
</br>
"Of course it was for hitting the Liuding town aircraft, we only need to aim at Liuding town's alliance." Chu Nan shook his head, "For example the Beer Cap company, they could produce 100 kg level bombs, but it doesn't mean they can equally produce the matching electromagnetic cannon. Under the protection of Liuding town, they never developed a strong military force."</br>
</br>
"Without their alliances, Liuding town is only a dead boat."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen laughed out loud as he patted Chu Nan's shoulder with force.</br>
</br>
"Not bad. Also, something else, do you have an interest being the governor of the Sixth Street? I am starting to realize that some of your other abilities are much better than controlling a helicopter."</br>
</br>
"Are you hiddenly telling me that I suck at piloting?" Chu Nan made a funny expression as he joked.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, I am serious."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, you are the boss, I will listen to your order. But to be honest, rather than becoming the governor of the Sixth Street, I want to become Liuding Town's governor more."</br>
</br>
He wasn't joking.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 208"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 208: A Friendly Signal</br>
</div></br>
</br>
As to the Chu Nan's last sentence, Jiang Chen gave it a thought but didn't reply.</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street located in Jiading officially became part of his territory. Therefore, all the entrances from the northwest direction were under his control. Including the Fishbone base in Qingpu, and Shenxiang town colony in front of the Zhufeng highway. The three areas formed a triangle as the force almost included all the major roads to enter Wanghai city from the west.</br>
</br>
It was fair to say, half of Wanghai city was already in his hands.</br>
</br>
But, a highly volatile factor still posed a threat to the security of this area.</br>
</br>
It was Liuding town.</br>
</br>
That electromagnetic cannon was an immense force, its power far surmounted the cannons on his Tigers.</br>
</br>
Although they would not easily strain the relationship with the "ruler of the land" Jiang Chen, since they existed, it would still be a threat.</br>
</br>
How can one allow a threat to exist?</br>
</br>
If he wanted to control the entire Wanghai city area, then he must plan against Liuding town.</br>
</br>
But with the status quo, for both parties, cooperation was the better choice.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Within the chamber, Jiang Chen met the ambassador from Liuding town.</br>
</br>
To his surprise, the ambassador was a lady. The bodyguard behind her was a Caucasian male. From his buff body, he must be a great fighter.</br>
</br>
As to the female ambassador, Jiang Chen's first expression was utter shock, but presumably, he expressed his caution towards her.</br>
</br>
Under her high nose, a vibe of power surrounded her.</br>
</br>
Blonde hair, a western kind of body but an eastern face; she should be mixed.</br>
</br>
Tang Miya, that was her name.</br>
</br>
"It is a great pleasure to meet you, ambassador from Liuding town, I hope you enjoyed your stay last night." When he saw her enter the door, Jiang Chen had a friendly smile on his face and at the same extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
Because she arrived rather late, Jiang Chen arranged a room for her in the Paradise Island hotel.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for hosting me." The vibrant red lips were curled up as Tang Miya extended her hand and shook with Jiang Chen. "Your sex robot in the hotel was great."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as his expression looked peculiar.</br>
</br>
[That sex robot...has a female version?]</br>
</br>
To his surprise, this lady ambassador was rather wild in her private life.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, as long as you had fun. Please take a seat." Jiang Chen smiled as he avoided the rather inappropriate topic, he nobly pulled out the chair for her and invited her to sit.</br>
</br>
Tang Miya nodded with a smile to express her gratitude as she sat on the chair. The bodyguard stood in front of the door.</br>
</br>
"What kind of news is Miss Tang Miya bringing to us from Liuding Town?" As he sat on the chair, Jiang Chen asked the straightforward question.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Of course friendly news." Tang Miya blinked her eyes before she took out a document, "First, it is about the trade. Liuding town had signed a trade agreement with the Group of Ten council at the Sixth Street, now that owner of the Sixth Street has changed, I wanted to ask Mr. Jiang Chen if this agreement is still valid?"</br>
</br>
She put the document gently on the table.</br>
</br>
Before the meeting, Jiang Chen scanned through the agreement. The premise was to ensure that Liuding town's merchants were treated fairly and equally and also share the same free trading rights with other forces.</br>
</br>
"Of course it is valid." Jiang Chen picked up the agreement as he ceremonially scanned it before he gave out a direct response.</br>
</br>
A smile surfaced on Tang Miya's face as she put the contract away; she had all ten fingers crossed.</br>
</br>
"Also, it's about an agreement with the Fishbone base. Is it appropriate to bring it up now?"</br>
</br>
An obvious attempt to test the water.</br>
</br>
On the surface, Jiang Chen was the general of the military government, the council still exercised the decree. At least for other people, the Sixth Street was still open, and democratic.</br>
</br>
Deciding for the council was overreaching, to begin with. Now that the private matter of the Fishbone base was brought up in the Sixth Street Council building, it was practically asking: does the Sixth Street belong to you?</br>
</br>
The answer was yes.</br>
</br>
"It's fine, just say it," Jiang Chen said firmly.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's reaction, Tang Miya smiled and took out another agreement.</br>
</br>
"Regarding the food by the Fishbone Food Corporation, our party is very interested... If you don't mind my rudeness, you are the owner of that company right?"</br>
</br>
"Why do you think that?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"A woman's sixth sense," Tang Miya used a half-joking voice.</br>
</br>
"Maybe your sense is accurate, but we are off topic now." Jiang Chen shrugged as he didn't answer the question, but rather, he avoided the topic.</br>
</br>
Although Tang Miya was not too satisfied with Jiang Chen's response, she only smiled as she didn't persist on the question.</br>
</br>
"This is our trade list; we need meat cans, vegetable cans, beer, and sugar. On the other side, we can provide crystals, small electronic components like chips and batteries. We trust that the price we offer will please you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen carefully scanned through the content on the list as he nodded.</br>
</br>
The price offered by the woman was a bit higher than Zhao Chenwu. The total trade amount was around half a million per month. The deal could be executed next spring.</br>
</br>
"I am pleased with the price you offered, as the chips of your party, our side is also very interested. But the name on the contract is Lucky 32 Casino, not Liuding town, is there something I am not understanding?" Jiang Chen smiled as he signed the agreement with his name.</br>
</br>
"Liuding town is only an aircraft carrier, but Lucky 32 Casino is my property." Miss Tang smiled as she put away the contract.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a second before clarity returned to his face.</br>
</br>
"Then, in this case, the identity of Miss Tang in Liuding town, is similar to mine in the Sixth Street?"</br>
</br>
"Two kinds of political structures, not comparable." Tang Miya said, "You can interpret that as I am a sailor with some influence."</br>
</br>
[Not a complete dictatorship?]</br>
</br>
"Although I don't completely understand, I think it would not interfere with our cooperation. Now, do you have any interesting proposals?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen's surprise, Tang Miya shook her head.</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
[No? She didn't bring up the artillery agreement?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quickly regathered his thoughts, stood up, and announced the end of the meeting.</br>
</br>
After shaking Tang Miya's hand, Jiang Chen personally sent her out the door.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I personally enjoy chatting with a dictator like you," Standing at the door, Tang Miya said out of nowhere.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"Just this piece of paper, if it was for the Group Of Ten council, they could argue endlessly for two days straight. Compared with rowdy men, I think a decisive man like you is more charming." Tang Miya didn't bother to hide her praise in her words as her gorgeous eyes looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Miss Tang is overcomplimenting me." Jiang Chen humbly smiled, but the curled up mouth clearly exposed his satisfaction.</br>
</br>
Tang Miya would obvious not miss this detail as the tip of her mouth also curled up.</br>
</br>
No men would have no reaction to a beautiful girl's praise, it was a natural instinct of men.</br>
</br>
"I have a personal proposal, I don't know if Mr. Jiang would be interested?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
With her watery eyes turning, Tang Miya got closer to Jiang Chen with a smile, the tip of her nose stopped at the point where it almost touched his face.</br>
</br>
With an incredibly flirtatious tone, accompanied by her warm breath, she spoke out.</br>
</br>
"Tonight, do you want to come by my room?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The next morning.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Miss Tang Miya walked out of Paradise Island hotel together.</br>
</br>
They chatted and laughed as they walked along. Then, Jiang Chen nobly sent her to the gate of the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
If it were not for the people seeing them coming out of the hotel together, no one would have guessed what happened before.</br>
</br>
But if people observed carefully, both of the powerful individuals had minor dark circles under their eyes, it seemed like they didn't sleep well last night.</br>
</br>
Of course, what happens at the top of the pyramid, the people below don't need to know.</br>
</br>
As to the rumors, it will fade eventually.</br>
</br>
"Was it enjoyable last night?" Jiang Chen grinned as he mocked her.</br>
</br>
"You are better than the sex robot." The tip of Tang Miya's mouth curved up as she replied in the same mocking tone.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I'll take that as a compliment."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen without many boundaries would not refuse seduction, especially if it were in his own territory.</br>
</br>
Therefore, last night he gladly accepted Tang Miya's invitation as he hooked up with the queen from Liuding town.</br>
</br>
The intimacy happened last night, was no different than the negotiation on the conference table, both parties searching for what they want.</br>
</br>
Being able to thrust into the body of a boss level person made Jiang Chen feel the "conquering" sensation. At the same time, also as a person of importance, she enjoyed the sensation of "being conquered" as she hadn't experienced it for a long time.</br>
</br>
But that enjoyment will only last until morning. The two both chose to keep quiet on the details of last night.</br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen had his mistresses.</br>
</br>
As the boss of force, the owner behind Lucky 32 Casino Miss Tang Miya, also possessed her own lovers.</br>
</br>
"What a pity, it would be better if you are a nobody." Before she was about to leave, Tang Miya gently used her finger to lift up Jiang Chen's chin as her eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"If I am a nobody, is there any benefits to you?" Jiang Chen squeezed her hand with a smirk as he moved her finger away.</br>
</br>
With her hand held, she did not blush at all. Her shamelessness was no less than Jiang Chen's. With a mischevious smile, she said, "Then I could make you one of my lovers."</br>
</br>
With her invasive speech, Jiang Chen only smiled noncommittally.</br>
</br>
[Funny, although my boundary is a bit gray, I don't have that kind of fetish.]</br>
</br>
Ceremonially they said goodbye as Tang Miya along with her bodyguard disappeared among the ruins.</br>
</br>
Looking at her figure disappearing into the horizon while remembering her final words, Jiang Chen uncontrollably shivered.</br>
</br>
Although he just imagined it, the idea was a bit disgusting for a man.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After returning to the Inner Circle, Jiang Chen found Chu Nan who was cleaning the helicopter on the helicopter pad.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Was it thrilling last night?" Chu Nan laughed mischievously as he closed the hose shut.</br>
</br>
"How did you guess?" Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"The owner of Lucky 32 Casino, Miss Tang Miya. Her unique hobby is no news in Liuding town." Chu Nan threw the mop on the helicopter's back wing, clapped his hands, and looked at Jiang Chen. "Since she already hooked up with you, then the negotiation must be successful?"</br>
</br>
"You could say that. Also, she didn't mention the artillery agreement, your guess seems to be off." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
With eyebrows slightly raised, Chu Nan held his chin pondering for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? It looks like they chose the more cautious way."</br>
</br>
"Cautious?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. Perhaps because she realized from the interaction between you that your firm stance would mean you would never compromise, therefore Tang Miya didn't bring up the proposal that obviously would be rejected, but rather she brought up the genuine desire to cooperate."</br>
</br>
"That's something she can see through?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Tang Miya is a smart woman. Or else she wouldn't be managing Lucky 32 to perfection."</br>
</br>
Chu Nan paused before he continued to speak.</br>
</br>
"On the other hand, they might also be cautious about the force behind you."</br>
</br>
"Fishbone Food Corporation?" Jiang Chen pondered.</br>
</br>
It was only an elaborate lie, but since the food he brought out became evidence to support its existence, it made everyone believe its existence.</br>
</br>
Other than the most intimate people, no one knew that it is a fictitious creation, not even his own citizens.</br>
</br>
Although he didn't need it anymore.</br>
</br>
"If you could pardon my rudeness, boss, is your identity really just a representative?"</br>
</br>
"Does it matter?" Jiang Chen smiled noncommittally.</br>
</br>
"From the bystander's perspective, your identity is more like the boss of the Fishbone Food Corporation. And Fishbone base, rather than a supply station, is more similar to a military outpost."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen's eyes slightly moved.</br>
</br>
"Regardless, since I already settled the fact this military outpost exists, even if people want to touch it, they no longer have the ability to."</br>
</br>
"That's right because they are fearful." Chu Nan smiled, "Because they don't know the real power of the company behind you. Did they help to occupy the Sixth Street, what's the purpose and intention of entering Wanghai City. Because of the lack of information, it forces them to use a cautionary attitude."</br>
</br>
"Because of this, they should already have considered the mutated people of the Seventh area would somewhat pose a hindrance to our growth. If we accepted the artillery agreement, then we would definitely use electromagnetic cannon against the mutated human. If we easily solved the mutated human problem, it would be against the interest of Liuding town. Rather than the income of ten thousand crystals, they would much rather see mutated human and our struggle for power and hurting each other."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Thinking about Chu Nan's words, Jiang Chen returned to the council building.</br>
</br>
Regardless, Liuding Town's attitude was rather friendly, the mutated human at the Seventh area didn't make any moves either.</br>
</br>
In this case, his force in the apocalypse had finally entered a relatively peaceful period.</br>
</br>
He only needed to choose someone to represent him for the Sixth Street affairs, Fishbone base is his core. After leaving for so long, it was time for him to go back.</br>
</br>
Back in the office, he saw the pouting Sun Jiao waiting.</br>
</br>
His expression looked rather awkward since last night...</br>
</br>
"Was it fun last night?" Sun Jiao smiled with not the friendliest of smiles.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen forced a laugh as he embarrassedly scratched his head, looking away.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's mouth pouted unhappily.</br>
</br>
"There is still a small apple you haven't eaten yet, and you are picking fruit on another side."</br>
</br>
The small apple referred to Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
"Sorry."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knew there was no use saying anything as he chose to admit fault, he also walked up to hug Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
Feeling his body heat, a red hue covered Sun Jiao's face.</br>
</br>
With her expression showing a momentary confliction, she finally let out a sigh and gave up persisting this topic.</br>
</br>
"Let's talk about some important matters. When do we go back? I am worried... about her condition."</br>
</br>
That her was obviously referring to Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
Because it was too dangerous, she was still locked up inside the basement.</br>
</br>
Speaking of her own sister, Sun Jiao also gave Jiang Chen a hard and dirty look.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, the day after tomorrow, I'll do my best to finish taking care of everything."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, knowing he lost the high ground, chose to shamelessly avoid Sun Jiao's eyes of blame as he quickly finished saying everything he needed to before fleeing from the scene.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 210: Zhao Chenwu's Choice</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The cleaning of radiation was almost complete.</br>
</br>
As to the suddenly erupted and quickly ended civil war, the survivors living in the Sixth Street reacted calmly to the situation; the passersby also didn't cause any trouble.</br>
</br>
The new insurgent, with thunderous momentum, stabilized the chaotic situation.</br>
</br>
Other than the ten people at the top who changed seats, for most of the people living in the Outer Circle, life didn't really change.</br>
</br>
As to death.</br>
</br>
People died every day on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
"I always thought I am great at understanding people, but I guess I was wrong this time." Zhao Chenwu let out a sigh as he sat across from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Do you regret anything?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu was silent.</br>
</br>
Seeing that he didn't respond, Jiang Chen didn't mind, but rather he poured a cup of hot water for himself.</br>
</br>
Then, he took out a small plastic bag from his pocket as he ripped it open, then slowly poured the fine brown powder inside the steamy cup.</br>
</br>
Looking at the dark brown mixture, Zhao Chenwu's eyes widened as he uncontrollably gulped.</br>
</br>
"At our place, this is called coffee."</br>
</br>
"Of course I know." Zhao Chenwu's tone sounded urgent.</br>
</br>
"Do you still regret it now?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu looked at Jiang Chen not understanding his meaning.</br>
</br>
Seeing the expression on Zhao Chenwu's face, Jiang Chen laughed, and then took out something else.</br>
</br>
The white cube, in Zhao Chenwu's widened eyes, was dropped into the fragrant coffee.</br>
</br>
"You have a lot of good things," Zhao Chenwu difficultly squeezed out these words.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen shrugged as he said lightheartedly, "Some things I was afraid of bringing out, but now I don't have as much to worry about."</br>
</br>
"Are you really a representative?" Zhao Chenwu said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
"You are the second person that has asked me this question... But what I want to say is that who I am is not important. The important thing is, as long as you work for me, I can provide you with all of these." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Provide me with all of these?" Zhao Chenwu was dumbfounded as he looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen was straightforward, "Food, sugar, coffee, tea, as well as other similar things. I will provide you a batch every month and you'll be responsible for selling them for me. The right to sell food is in your hands. I won't interrupt your business and I will only send some people to provide assistance in accounting."</br>
</br>
"I don't understand, these things would be popular anywhere on the wasteland, why would you give it to me to do?" Zhao Chenwu didn't understand.</br>
</br>
"Because I trust your ability, I want to see my product appear in every corner of the wasteland."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Zhao Chenwu's expression turned peculiar as he had an odd smile on his face.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I can't believe that not long ago, we were still partners, now, I am working under you."</br>
</br>
"That's up to your interpretation. As long as you maintain your "coolness," then Zhao Corporation still belongs to you. The purpose of a "chain" is to prevent similar things from happening again. Our relationship can still be interpreted as a partnership, and it is a much closer partnership." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu paused for a moment before he burst out laughing and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"Then best of luck to both of us."</br>
</br>
Holding his hand, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Best of luck to both of us."</br>
</br>
The food trade specifics were quickly nailed down. The Fishbone Base was responsible for providing the supplies, Zhao Corporation was responsible for creating trade routes to send the goods to the corners of the wasteland, then bringing back other goods or crystals.</br>
</br>
The profit would be divided 30 to 70 with Zhao Corporation taking home 30%. The current trade boundary would be expanded to the nearby Su City and Hang City with trade commencing this spring.</br>
</br>
With the electronic agreement, Zhao Chenwu left Jiang Chen's office feeling jubilant.</br>
</br>
Fan Chen waiting at the door let out a sigh of relief when he saw the expression on his colleague's face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shouldn't be difficult to talk to or Zhao Chenwu wouldn't be this happy.</br>
</br>
As he thought, the fat guy knocked on the office door before walking inside.</br>
</br>
Sitting across from Jiang Chen, Fan Chen hesitated for a moment before he asked in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"What does the general need from me?"</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen didn't put his hands on their assets and even divided some more interests to them, no one felt relaxed because of it.</br>
</br>
The reason was that they were all injected with that chip.</br>
</br>
Now that the situation has stabilized, Jiang Chen didn't make moves at their wallet. But what about in the future? Who could promise that he wouldn't slowly take over the crystals and factories in their hands and then secretly get rid of them?</br>
</br>
That thing was originally meant for slaves, the people with it cannot defy at all.</br>
</br>
These council members at the top never thought that thing would be used on them one day.</br>
</br>
"Don't be so nervous, have a cup of coffee first?" Jiang Chen smiled amiably as he made him a cup of coffee.</br>
</br>
Looking at the coffee in front of him, Fan Chen's expression was even more vibrant than Zhao Chenwu's, the widened eyes were almost about to pop out.</br>
</br>
The hand holding onto the cup trembled as he excitedly put his lips to the cup and took a sip.</br>
</br>
The taste that has been long gone.</br>
</br>
"I finally understand why that guy Zhao Chenwu was so emotional when he walked out." Fan Chen let out a sigh as he smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
Thinking about the continuous partnership between Zhao Corporation and Fishbone base, even thinking with his butt, the two-parties must have reached some agreement.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I believe you will be more emotional by the time you walk out the door." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Fan Chen's face had astonishment written on it as he sat straight up, but then he slumped back, forcing a smile.</br>
</br>
"It wouldn't be the food business. Two food sellers competing would offer much less profit than a monopoly."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he took a sip of his own coffee.</br>
</br>
"Although it is not the food business, the profit margin is not any lower."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Fan Chen looked interested.</br>
</br>
"Oh? What business is it?"</br>
</br>
"The rebuilding of the Sixth Street Inner Circle, I will contract you everything," Jiang Chen softly released this mega bomb.</br>
</br>
Fan Chen's eyes opened wide as he looked at Jiang Chen in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Everything?"</br>
</br>
"What, are you not confident?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That would require a lot of money..." Fan Chen said difficulty.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, there will be funds." Jiang Chen put down the cup as his finger crossed, "The building destroyed in the civil war will be paid for by the assets of the Crimson Chamber of Commerce, totaling one and a half million crystals. Based on the progress of construction, for every 10% completed, 10% of the fund will be paid out."</br>
</br>
"Deal!"</br>
</br>
Fan Chen accepted without hesitation, the tense expression he had was as if he was afraid Jiang Chen would take back his decision.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled without saying another word as he took out the electronic agreement.</br>
</br>
After carefully confirming the terms of the agreement, Fan Chen pressed his finger on it.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I am confused." Putting away the contract, Fan Chen couldn't resist the temptation to ask.</br>
</br>
"What are you confused about?" Throwing the contract in his pocket, Jiang Chen sunk into his chair as he said amiably.</br>
</br>
After debating for a moment, Fan Chen still spoke out with his head lowered.</br>
</br>
"If I were in power, I would confiscate all the other council members' asset."</br>
</br>
"The reason why I want you merchants to have a seat at the table is that it is too difficult for me to rule this piece of land, you can just be a good merchant from now on."</br>
</br>
"Do you not love wealth?" Fan Chen forced a smile.</br>
</br>
Just as he said those words, in his shocking sight, Jiang Chen suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"The entire Sixth Street is mine, is there a difference whether the crystal is for me?"</br>
</br>
History had proved countless times whether the corporation should be governed by an individual or a collective group.</br>
</br>
Rather than hoarding crystals, Jiang Chen would rather hand out the small profits.</br>
</br>
It was not only a technique to gain people's loyalty.</br>
</br>
More importantly, under the motivation for profit, these ambitious merchants would naturally expand and conquer for him.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 211: The End for now</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The five council members were all called upon separately to Jiang Chen's office. When they left, all of them left with a happy expression.</br>
</br>
What would have taken two days of arguments around the roundtable, Jiang Chen used a few sentences to solve.</br>
</br>
The food trade was controlled by Zhao Corporation. From today on, they'll start to hire workers from the Outer Circle as well as guards. At the same time, they'll order from the mechanical repair factory in the industrial area. The order totaled to twenty modified trucks with crystals as the energy source for the transportation vehicles of the goods. These trucks would be modified at Zhao Chenwu's firearm factory with heavy machineguns attached on top, the exterior being wielded with steel armor and parts.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen remembered a sentence Zhao Chenwu told him when he took him on tour: "Unless it was a proposal passed by the Sixth Street council would my factory start producing these hard to take care of things."</br>
</br>
Now that there was no more trouble; the damn roundtable was smashed in half. The council no longer discussed these annoying problems and Jiang Chen's words were the law. When control was in one person's hands, there would be no comical proposals to keep him in check.</br>
</br>
Ten T-3 power armor orders with a total price of one hundred and ten thousand crystals would be completed by next March. Jiang Chen paid 20% upfront to Zhao Chenwu, Zhao Chenwu will use this funding to expand the production line and hire more workers.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen notified Zhao Chenwu to emphasize Zhao Corporation's weapon research to focus on new power armor types. They must develop a more mobile, higher load, and more powerful T-4 power armor.</br>
</br>
Not only Zhao Corporation, the other four council members all received their own benefits.</br>
</br>
Fan Chen's metal shell Chamber of Commerce acquired the project to rebuild the damaged buildings in the Inner Circle as well as repairing the damages to the wall. At the same time, Jiang Chen gave him the project to connect Fishbone Base to the Sixth Street's electric grid.</br>
</br>
Lu Yun's Shoreline company, who previously sold small items before the civil war and traded with Su city and Hang city, had a small portion of the pharmaceutical market. Unfortunately, the nuclear explosion in the Inner Circle almost wiped out half of his stores. Although the rebuild fee would be paid by Crimson Chamber of Commerce's assets, the products he lost during the nuclear explosion were not included as part of the compensation scheme.</br>
</br>
But just at the brink of bankruptcy, Jiang Chen helped him. He organized all the pieces of lands together and assigned him a large plot of land to aid in his business transformation - building the biggest entertainment city on the wasteland with casinos, hotels, as well as special services.</br>
</br>
Hua Weijie's star technology company still maintained its original business focus - to digest and improve the pre-war technology. But Jiang Chen gave him a research direction - Type-51 Transport Helicopter.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Sixth Street didn't develop their air force, part of the reason being that they never acquired the technology before the war. The other reason being the comical balance of power. "Because I don't have the helicopter, therefore you are not allowed to research. Therefore I will group up with the eight other people to sanction you."</br>
</br>
Now that the problem didn't exist anymore, Jiang Chen prepaid Hua Weijie twenty thousand crystals as funding for the upgrade of research equipment and hiring teams to explore pre-war facilities to gather information.</br>
</br>
Other than the four council members mentioned above, even Kong Zhe, who first stood up to oppose Jiang Chen in the initial meeting, gained something out of this. Jiang Chen, putting aside their history, made this guy who was living anxiously for the past few days graciously express his gratitude. However, Jiang Chen really didn't care about this appreciation as he used a casual voice to tell him that, as long as he is obedient, there will be things to gain out of it.</br>
</br>
Now that the Sixth Street was back on track, it was time to go back to the Fishbone base as that's where his core operations lie.</br>
</br>
The helicopter was left there. The star technology company's technologists will use equipment to scan the helicopter and acquire the needed technical data.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan, as the pilot, was obviously left behind on the Sixth Street. Considering that the restructure of the council to the upper and lower house would still require coordination, Jiang Chen granted Chu Nan as his representative to perform part of the duties as the general. He also left two hundred soldiers behind to maintain order.</br>
</br>
After taking care of these things, Jiang Chen took the remaining soldiers and left the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
"Finally get to go home." On the way, Sun Jiao lazily stretched.</br>
</br>
"That's right, finally going home." Jiang Chen smiled as he looked at the underground entrance.</br>
</br>
The underground tunnel modified with the cooperation of Zhao Chenwu now belonged completely to Jiang Chen; with elite soldiers wielding kinetic skeletons guarding the entrance.</br>
</br>
When they saw Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao approach, the five soldiers on duty saluted and opened the gate to the tunnel.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, a lot happened in this half a year."</br>
</br>
Walking on the dry concrete road, Sun Jiao abruptly started talking.</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
"Is that the only thing you can say?" Sun Jiao pouted her mouth as she gave a dirty look to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed as he naturally held onto her hand.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's face turned red but quickly returned to normal.</br>
</br>
"You are blushing?"</br>
</br>
"No."</br>
</br>
"We have done it so many times - Ahh, is your zodiac a cat?" Jiang Chen painfully shook his right hand as he exaggeratedly blew on his hand.</br>
</br>
This girl pinched him.</br>
</br>
After spending so long together, he almost forgot that she was a "lunatic' with a muscle strength of 44. Although the thin arms did not show any signs of muscle.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao stared at him in embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Why are you saying this here?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao glanced in the front as there were no signs of the team anymore.</br>
</br>
Leading in the front was Cheng Weiguo, as to the two people "intentionally" lagging behind, that guy understandingly took the forty-something soldiers and moved at a faster pace, leaving the quiet space to them.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, they are all gone." Jiang Chen with a grin put his arm around her waist.</br>
</br>
She didn't resist against Jiang Chen's intimate action as they walked in the not-so-romantic underground tunnel.</br>
</br>
Compared to the first time they walked inside, this place has been completely changed.</br>
</br>
The wall was covered with luminescent stripes that emitted cold blue lights which lit up the pitch black underground. The river flowing with dirty water had been blocked already with a layer of Polyethylene alloy separator. The outlets were blocked by polyethylene boards which stopped the possibility of bandits or cannibals from entering.</br>
</br>
"What is your EP indicators now?"</br>
</br>
"Why are you asking about it?"</br>
</br>
"I just want to see, do I have the ability to forcefully do you," Jiang Chen asked in a half-joking voice.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Sun Jiao's face turned red again, but it was soon changed into a smirk as she displayed the EP on her arm.</br>
</br>
[User Name: Sun Jiao</br>
</br>
Muscle strength: 49</br>
</br>
Bone strength: 67</br>
</br>
Reflex: 50</br>
</br>
Brain cell strength: 13]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Gasp-, wait, I remember you were 44, 61, 40?"</br>
</br>
Staring at the screen, Jiang Chen said in complete shock.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 212"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 212: That Smile</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Muscle strength increased by 5 points, bone strength by 6, and reflex by a shocking 10 points!</br>
</br>
[</br>
</br>
Muscle strength:49</br>
</br>
Bone strength:67</br>
</br>
Reflex:50</br>
</br>
Brain cell strength:13</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly looked at his own EP; the difference was still quite drastic.</br>
</br>
Muscle strength and reflex were okay as he was "only" behind ten something points, but she almost doubled his bone strength.</br>
</br>
"I thought I was going to catch up to you.' Jiang Chen forced a smile as he closed the EP in disappointment.</br>
</br>
"While you are improving, I am not lagging behind," Sun Jiao flipped her luscious black hair as she said proudly.</br>
</br>
"Looks like the difference is only going to get bigger." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
The EP stat determines, under an ideal setting, a human's maximum ability. For most humans, the maximum stat achievable is 100, while an infant's is 0. The stat thus quantifies the user's current ability.</br>
</br>
Under the circumstance that the DNA is not modified, the limit humans can reach is 100. If the modification causes reproductive isolation, then the person wouldn't be referred to human anymore, they would have to be named after another species.</br>
</br>
Once the stat passes 50, it is much more difficult to increase it. Although Sun Jiao's "stats points" speed didn't seem to be as fast as Jiang Chen's, which double within a few months, this was due to her initial stats being much higher.</br>
</br>
Just like in video games, the difficulty from level 1 to 10 is far easier compared to level 50 to 51.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen sigh, Sun Jiao though his dignity was hurt as she gentle comforted him.</br>
</br>
"There are lots of different definitions for being powerful. Body condition is only one of them. A lot of people on the wasteland possess a frail body, but with their superb shooting skills, they can still win a fight against people with body conditions multiple times greater. As well as people who have mastered mechanical knowledge, with the help of the assistive device, they're able to acquire strong powers. Also the hackers, they could infiltrate the mechanical people wandering among shambles to force them to fight..."</br>
</br>
"Then what am I strong at?" Jiang Chen cockily laughed.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen who was showing off. She then bit her lips as she stared into the distant darkness.</br>
</br>
"Do you know now?"</br>
</br>
"I just want to listen to my woman compliment me," Jiang Chen shamelessly said these words.</br>
</br>
He was always someone that liked to show off.</br>
</br>
With a slight smirk, Sun Jiao rolled her eyes at Jiang Chen, and then with a half-serious half-joking tone.</br>
</br>
"Your power comes from the fact that you can gain the affection of other people."</br>
</br>
[So, the charm stat is maxed out?]</br>
</br>
That was a unique way of saying this as Jiang Chen couldn't stop himself from laughing.</br>
</br>
</br>
"For example, you?"</br>
</br>
"Not only me, but Yao Yao, even Lin Lin, as well as everyone in the base."</br>
</br>
"Why don't you say leadership."</br>
</br>
"Different from leadership. Think closely, is there even a time where you used the slavery chip to force someone to listen to you?"</br>
</br>
"People trust that you can bring order, they trust you. Therefore, they follow you to a brighter future, that's why they are willing to listen to you."</br>
</br>
"To be able to gather so many people willing to fight for you, it is an amazing ability." Sun Jiao playfully winked.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen paused and then smiled, but he then exaggeratedly let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"What, are you still not pleased with having this power?"</br>
</br>
"Very pleased, but I still have some regrets."</br>
</br>
"Regrets?"</br>
</br>
"I can't tie you to a chair and seek revenge for the first time we met." Jiang Chen with a smirk spoke into her ear.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Don't you think it is thrilling to be tied down." She smiled like a little devil as she also spoke into Jiang Chen's ear, and naughtily blew inside.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I am not a masochist."</br>
</br>
[Although he was never against trying new things...]</br>
</br>
Looking at the side of Jiang Chen's face, the tip of Sun Jiao's mouth also rolled up.</br>
</br>
"You've changed."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I was not a masochist before," Jiang Chen said speechlessly.</br>
</br>
"Not that," Sun Jiao laughed out, she paused, and then with a ridiculing tone, she jokingly said, "You are more mature compared to the first time you were here."</br>
</br>
"Which one do you like better?"</br>
</br>
"Both... Although during that time you were also delicious... It is more attractive for you to be more mature," Sun Jiao with a finger on her lips said.</br>
</br>
[What do you mean by delicious?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had a helpless expression on his face.</br>
</br>
But speaking of that, within five short months, he did grow a lot.</br>
</br>
He was previously just a young man entering into society with no notable achievements in life. If he didn't acquire that magical interdimensional travel ability, he would probably be inside his apartment, rotting away. Or even going back to his hometown and becoming unemployed while still holding a honors university degree.</br>
</br>
Not even house, he would probably have to depend on his parents to not starve.</br>
</br>
Now looking back from this perspective, he felt melancholic.</br>
</br>
Seeing the adorable gesture of Sun Jiao, Jiang Chen also joked back.</br>
</br>
"You've also changed."</br>
</br>
"Oh? How have I changed?" Sun Jiao put her hands on her waist as she pretended to be authoritative.</br>
</br>
"Too many things." Jiang Chen laughed as he started to count his finger. "More civilized, no longer licking fingers after eating cans, knows how to match clothing, learned to be compassionate, and even knows how to knit a scarf."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's mouth curved up showing her proudness.</br>
</br>
"Which change do you like the most?"</br>
</br>
"Boobs are slightly bigger."</br>
</br>
"Be serious!" Sun Jiao gave Jiang Chen a dirty look as she reached to pinch Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen with a grin easily dodged the attack without any force.</br>
</br>
"From being audacious to more understanding, or more feminine."</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Sun Jiao's face immediately turned red, her eyes frantically looked around, as her finger twirled her hair around shyly.</br>
</br>
"Feminine? What, was I not before?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled but didn't reply.</br>
</br>
Chatting was a great way to pass the time, there were glares of different light in the distance.</br>
</br>
The ladder at the end had long been changed into a spacious elevator.</br>
</br>
When they approached at the exit, Jiang Chen pressed the button for the elevator.</br>
</br>
"Now that you have taken care of things here, will you go back to the other side?" Stepping onto the elevator, Sun Jiao said, not wanting to let him go.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."Jiang Chen nodded and followed her.</br>
</br>
As if Sun Jiao had already expected the answer, she didn't ask him to stay, she only spoke with a small voice.</br>
</br>
"What is this world to you?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as he didn't expect Sun Jiao to ask this question.</br>
</br>
But the pause only lasted for a second. Jiang Chen gently smiled as he tousled her hair.</br>
</br>
"It was only a gold mine in the beginning... But now, my second home."</br>
</br>
With his words, a bright smile emerged on Sun Jiao's face.</br>
</br>
That smile was beautiful.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When he walked out of the elevator, Jiang Chen was greeted by the thunderous applause of all the survivors at the Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
The snow was thick and cold, but it didn't cool off the people's energy by the slightest.</br>
</br>
A girl even gifted Jiang Chen with flowers.</br>
</br>
The first groups of survivors that joined the base were all refugees from the Sixth Street. They suffered from hunger, disease, and were looked down upon as they struggled to survive. It was fair to say that they don't have the slightest positive impression of the Group of Ten council. Although they have nothing to do with the Sixth Street anymore, Jiang Chen becoming the new owner of the Sixth Street made them feel proud and avenged.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved back at the crowd with a smile before entering the community center along with Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
When they entered the supply management office, Jiang Chen found manager Wang Qin.</br>
</br>
"All the compensation to the Black Blood Mercenaries have been paid out, a total of 11000 crystals. Because he was afraid that his base would be affected by the civil war, Luo Yang has already taken his people back to the Sixth Street. As to the trade with Liuding town, he left a representative to delegate with us.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded at Wang Qin's report.</br>
</br>
The food business for the Sixth Street as well as other areas were all given to Zhao Chenwu. As to Liuding town, because of the trade agreement with Tang Miya, Jiang Chen hired the Black Blood Mercenaries and Luo Yang would be responsible for escorting the food to the aircraft and then transporting back the crystals and chips.</br>
</br>
As to the specifics, Jiang Chen left it to Wang Qin to worry about. He trusted that in this field of expertise, her experience was more than enough.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, there were around one hundred survivors that joined the Fishbone base with the majority being survivors from Qingpu, and some were even from Songjiang area, near Qingpu.</br>
</br>
For the newly joined survivors, Jiang Chen had a welcoming attitude but was worried by Fishbone Base's housing limitation. The expansion of the Fishbone base has also slowed due to increased construction of the defense line near Taifu river.</br>
</br>
But following the decrease of pressure from the mutated humans, Lu Huasheng brought the construction team back to the base. It won't be long until the housing problem is resolved.</br>
</br>
"Did Luo Yang say anything before he left?"</br>
</br>
Pondering this for a moment, Wang Qin said in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"He said you are cunning but deceitful."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"I'll take that as a compliment then."</br>
</br>
If he heard the news of the civil war, he would do anything to bring his people back to the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Although 70 something people was not a lot, they were all experienced. With the 70 something mercenaries, he could have easily gotten more compared to the 11000 crystals.</br>
</br>
</br>
After arranging the related tasks, Jiang Chen walked out of the office and together with Sun Jiao, who was waiting outside, went to the mansion.</br>
</br>
After the interrogation, Sun Xiaorou has been locked in the basement. If it were a stranger, it would be okay, but she was Sun Jiao's younger sister. Considering his relationship with Sun Jiao, this Sun Xiaorou could be regarded as his sister-in-law.</br>
</br>
"What is your plan for my sister?" On the way to the basement, Sun Jiao asked in a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
"… To be honest, I don't know."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao gently bit her lips as she wanted to say something, but nothing ended up coming out.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen peeked at the side of Sun Jiao's face and didn't stay anything either.</br>
</br>
The two walked to the basement in silence as they pushed open the door.</br>
</br>
"The pervert is finally back?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin sat in front of the computer with her eyes focused on the screen while saying it without turning her head.</br>
</br>
Before they headed to the frontline, Jiang Chen asked her to investigate why Sun Xiaorou lost her childhood memory, or even why she doesn't remember Sun Jiao as a person. He then related it to the zeal without reasoning for the religion and suspected she had been brainwashed or experienced hypnosis before.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored Lin Lin badmouthing him as he glanced at the Sun Xiaorou floating in the nutrient chamber.</br>
</br>
"Did you figure anything out?"</br>
</br>
A proud smile flashed across Lin Lin's face as she pressed a few buttons.</br>
</br>
"Of course, who do you think I am."</br>
</br>
A brain shaped full sensory visual was projected out, Lin Lin stood up from the chair and walked beside the visual.</br>
</br>
'Using special equipment to scan, I found a Nano chip in her hippocampus. Its purpose was to block the nervous system from extracting information from the hippocampus which would act as a seal to her childhood memory."</br>
</br>
As Lin Lin said this, she clicked on the full sensory visual as she magnified the chip hidden in her brain.</br>
</br>
"Is there a way to remove this chip?" Jiang Chen said gently.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but it will be complicated…" Lin Lin let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the always cocky digitalized human scientist express her concern, Sun Jiao turned anxious as she grabbed onto Lin Lin's shoulder, pleading her.</br>
</br>
"There are still ways, right? Please, I don't want my sister to become someone's puppet. If there is anything I can do to help, tell me and I will do my best –"</br>
</br>
She was slightly uncomfortable being stared at by Sun Jiao's pleading eyes. Her face turned slightly red as she looked away and interrupted her in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"The chip has been in her brain since she was young. In the case that the chip can be removed without damaging her brain, even with the pre-war medical conditions, there would be no guarantee, especially here…"</br>
</br>
"So what options do we have?" Jiang Chen asked calmly.</br>
</br>
"The easiest way is to find the person who implanted the chip, release the control, and make the chip eternally dormant."</br>
</br>
"Could it not be taken down by an EMP?" Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Lin Lin felt exasperated.</br>
</br>
"When the size of the device and the sensor is much smaller than the wavelength of the microwave, the microwave frequency cannot be coupled to the device with sufficient energy to cause damage." The electromagnetic pulse on the nano-level electronic components is invalid… How did you learn your physics, aren't you a university student on the other side?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's face turned red as he tried to argue back.</br>
</br>
"We don't learn those things on that side?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao stared at her sister in the nutrient chamber as she suddenly spoke out.</br>
</br>
"As long as I catch the person that implanted the chip right?"</br>
</br>
"Even if he was caught, I don't think he would easily give up control." Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows as he was also troubled.</br>
</br>
"Then I will force him to give it." A grimace flashed across Sun Jiao's face as her tightly clenched fists shook with anger.</br>
</br>
Looking at the expression on Sun Jiao's face, Jiang Chen let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Seems like a war with the Dusk was inevitable, though there was no possibility of having a peaceful resolution to begin with.</br>
</br>
"I will help you." Jiang Chen held onto Sun Jiao's fist as he gently comforted her.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Sun Jiao's face was covered in a red hue as she buried her head.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin pouted her lips.</br>
</br>
Her heart began to beat faster out of displeasure from seeing the two display affection while completely ignoring her.</br>
</br>
Wait, how could a mechanical heart start beating faster.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was shocked. But just when she realized this, her body's control was already taken over by the "guest" in her body.</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh! Quick, help me, I can't control the power in my body!"</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 214: The Fourth Dimensional Messenger</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Lin Lin was bent over with her arms clutching her stomach as her body began to shake violently.</br>
</br>
Just from her posture and tone, she looked like an anime character.</br>
</br>
"What's going on?" Jiang Chen was alerted, but before he could react, Lin Lin already moved.</br>
</br>
Like a jaguar, Lin Lin leapt at Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
With no time to guard herself, Sun Jiao was pushed onto the ground with her back against the floor. Lin Lin sat on top of her waist, her eyes shone with a hollow and ominous red light.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to do!" Sun Jiao blocked Lin Lin's arm as she said furiously.</br>
</br>
But seeing the redness from her eyes, Sun Jiao suddenly realized.</br>
</br>
It was not Lin Lin, but rather the Tingting in her body.</br>
</br>
"Mine," A hollow voice said.</br>
</br>
"What are you even saying?" Sun Jiao's face was bloated as she locked onto Tingting's hands.</br>
</br>
The digitalized human's strength was surprisingly high. With Sun Jiao's power, she couldn't push it away. Seeing Lin Lin's usual timid look, it was hard to imagine that the body possessed this massive amount of power. Tingting for some strange reasons was enraged.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately rushed over when he saw Sun Jiao being pushed down to the floor; his hands hugged Lin Lin in an attempt to drag her away from Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
The scene was chaotic.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Yao Yao, who has been sending food to Lin Lin suddenly opened the door as she brought the delicious meal in.</br>
</br>
Then she saw the two twisting on the ground "fighting" and the cute loli was immediately shocked as she froze in place not knowing what to do.</br>
</br>
"What, what happened?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen with the corner his eye noticed the small rabbit slippers. He then turned his head just enough to look at Yao Yao and through his heavy breathing, asked for help.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao, help me, bring that tranquilizer over... Oh no, bring that static device over."</br>
</br>
"Okay!" Yao Yao fiercely nodded her head as she put the dishes on the table and then ran to the operating table, frantically searching for the equipment.</br>
</br>
"I, I don't know which one it is!" Yao Yao who couldn't find it was about to cry out of anxiousness.</br>
</br>
"F*ck, I can't take this anymore!" Sun Jiao's face turned a dark red as she began to swear, "Can I take her apart?"</br>
</br>
[Is this considered chaos among the concubines?]</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen, with a mixture of emotions, was trying to comfort Sun Jiao while doing everything he can to control the enraged Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
But suddenly, Lin Lin's actions stopped, but the red light in her eyes was even brighter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was alerted.</br>
</br>
"Dammit, it's the Klein particle beam!"</br>
</br>
"Then help me get her away!"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao didn't know what the Klein particle beam was, but Jiang Chen had seen the power of it, it was just that he didn't know if it is effective on humans...</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gritted his teeth as his eyes were covered with a layer of red dots.</br>
</br>
Fury!</br>
</br>
His strength exploded by 20 points.</br>
</br>
"Oooo!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's face was suddenly flushed red as the pressure around her chest made all her power go away for a moment. Falling backward, she was dragged away by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Under the critical situation, Jiang Chen didn't notice what he had grabbed onto. Seeing that Lin Lin finally got off of Sun Jiao's body, he immediately deactivated fury, but before he could gather a breath, a beam of red light scathed by his forehead and shot at the ceiling.</br>
</br>
The highly penetrative Klein particle didn't leave any traces on the wall, but it instantly destroyed all the electronics in the room as the light immediately turned dark.</br>
</br>
"Ahhh." The basement suddenly turning dark made Yao Yao drop the static device in her hand.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao stood up breathing heavily, she moved her body around, and fiercely started at the Lin Lin paralyzed in Jiang Chen's arms.</br>
</br>
Because the circuit was destroyed, the nutrient chamber initiated emergency protocol.</br>
</br>
The door slowly opened as the nutrients spilled all over the ground, Sun Xiaorou slowly fell onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Seeing that, Jiang Chen silently took out his pistol.</br>
</br>
The EP was broken, he could not control the mechanical arm on Sun Xiaorou. If she striked at this time, then he had to shoot her limps.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao also blankly stared at Sun Xiaorou on the ground.</br>
</br>
Under her vision, Sun Xiaorou's lips moved, and her mouth gradually opened.</br>
</br>
The nutrients emitted a luminescent light. With the help of the light in blurring her vision, she looked at Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
"Sis...Sister?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out the graphene memory card from the previous EP as he replaced it with a new one.</br>
</br>
The Klein particle seems to have destroyed the chip in Sun Xiaorou's head, which was a happy surprise.</br>
</br>
Seeing the sisters hug, Jiang Chen had a genuine smile on his face.</br>
</br>
But things were never this simple.</br>
</br>
After recollecting her memory, Sun Xiaorou seemed to have entered some kind of dismay, her childhood memory suddenly surfacing shocked her current memory.</br>
</br>
As if two people were fighting in her head. One represented her memory in the fallout shelter, while the other was the memory instilled in her at the Dusk.</br>
</br>
The exact symptom was that her expression was frightening at times while gentle in others. She hid between the arms of Sun Jiao as her body trembled uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
But one thing was clear when she saw Jiang Chen, her expression remained in fear...</br>
</br>
[Umm, maybe he went overboard last time?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought awkwardly.</br>
</br>
The damage on the mind would have to be left to time to heal...Of course, Jiang Chen didn't refer to the interrogation.</br>
</br>
For safety purposes, Jiang Chen closed the functionality of her left mechanical arm.</br>
</br>
To leave time for the sisters, Jiang Chen held onto Yao Yao and carried Lin Lin out of the basement.</br>
</br>
When Lin Lin drowsily woke up from her unconsciousness, the sun had already set.</br>
</br>
The red light in her eyes had vanished, seeing Jiang Chen sitting beside the bed, Lin Lin's face turned red all of the sudden.</br>
</br>
"Have you been here the entire time?" Lin Lin asked in a feeble voice.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm... Tingting returned to normal?" Jiang Chen didn't notice the unnatural tone as he wrily rubbed his temple.</br>
</br>
"She has been controlled. Controlling my body seems to cost a lot of energy, she is now asleep." Lin Lin gulped as she nodded her head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh as he stood up.</br>
</br>
"Rest well."</br>
</br>
Leaving those words, Jiang Chen headed for the door.</br>
</br>
"Wait." Lin Lin stopped him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped and turned his head.</br>
</br>
"Hmmm?"</br>
</br>
"Are you going back to the modern world?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, probably tomorrow morning."</br>
</br>
"I want mango pudding!" Lin Lin said without humiliation as she licked her lips in excitement, "Based on my research of history, the earth in 2015 must have that thing-"</br>
</br>
"So troublesome... If I remember next time when I come back." He was just about to reject, but for some reason, Jiang Chen lost the mood to bully her.</br>
</br>
[She seemed to be cuter when she smile?]</br>
</br>
A remorseful expression was just about to appear. However, when she heard Jiang Chen's last sentence, a joyful smile appeared on her face as she sat up on the bed.</br>
</br>
"You should rest a bit more."</br>
</br>
"No, pudding is more important."</br>
</br>
She wiped the tip of her mouth, ran to the experiment table in slippers, and took off something strange looking. She ran back and put it in front of Jiang Chen as if she was giving him a treasure.</br>
</br>
"I will remind you!"</br>
</br>
"What is this?" Jiang Chen looked confused as he played with the nail-sized chip in his hand.</br>
</br>
"The fusion of technology!"</br>
</br>
"Human words please."</br>
</br>
"To put it in simple terms, it is a communication chip. But it is unique... Umm, how should I say this? If you insert it in your EP, you can communicate through the time dimension."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 215: The Friendship Across Dimensions</br>
</div></br>
Fourth dimension messenger was the name Lin Lin gave to that chip.</br>
</br>
All in all, the thing was ridiculous.</br>
</br>
Because right now, Jiang Chen was standing in his mansion in the modern world while using his EP to video chat with Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
With a polished crystal as the core of the chip, it uses a unique method to activate the Klein particle and sends a wave to a different chip in another timeline. Then it uses a unique method to decipher the code. Because only a unique wave is sent out rather than a tangible material with mass, without the help of the interdimensional bracelet, it could not send messages between the two chips.</br>
</br>
"Point the camera outside the window, I want to look at trees!" Lin Lin spoke to Jiang Chen in excitement.</br>
</br>
[What there to look at for trees.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had no choice but to walk to the balcony as he demonstrated the vegetations planted in his backyard.</br>
</br>
"Woooo, I want to go to your side."</br>
</br>
"If you can transform from digitalized human to mechanical human, I can certainly take you here."</br>
</br>
"Uh, I'll pass on that." Lin Lin squinted her neck.</br>
</br>
Abandoning the human flesh and the DNA that defines the existence of humanity, would that still be called human?</br>
</br>
"Could you go somewhere more open?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was going to reject because it was too troublesome, but seeing the longing face on Lin Lin, he let out a sigh and walked to the top floor.</br>
</br>
Because the mansion was a scenic house, the part of the river with the most vegetation could be seen on the top floor. Jiang Chen leaned against the railing as he pointed his EP at the Huangpu river.</br>
</br>
The wind at night was chilly.</br>
</br>
It was already December. Wanghai city in the modern world has officially entered winter season for over a month, but Jiang Chen with only a jacket didn't feel too cold. The El Nino was at its peak, so the winter in Wanghai City will be a warm one.</br>
</br>
Lights on the passing by boats floated on the river. Along the river bank was a city of lights as the endless amount of traffic decorated the city skyline, painting a scene of prosperity.</br>
</br>
Seeing the drunken expression on Lin Lin's face, Jiang Chen felt teary for some reason.</br>
</br>
For the people living in the apocalypse, this scene was providence.</br>
</br>
"Woo! I have decided!" A firm expression appeared on Lin Lin's face.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
"I will research a method that will allow you to carry living thing across the time dimension!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled as he replied.</br>
</br>
"Then work hard. If you can really do it, it would not be a problem if you want pudding from all over the world."</br>
</br>
If he could really travel with humans, he could then fulfill the promise to Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
In the abandoned experimental school, he had promised Sun Jiao he would one day take her to the school he attended and take her to see how people lived before the war, how they interacted.</br>
</br>
</br>
Lin Lin on the EP screen slurped her own saliva without caring about her image. Her eyes had already turned to pudding as they flashed brightly.</br>
</br>
"Who is she?"</br>
</br>
Noticing Jiang Chen coming back, Ayesha came to the roof.</br>
</br>
She gently walked beside him as she curiously looked at the gorgeous girl on the screen.</br>
</br>
So beautiful.</br>
</br>
Silver hair, pale skin, the look of a porcelain doll.</br>
</br>
"She is digitalized human Lin Lin." Jiang Chen put his hand around Ayesha's waist as he introduced.</br>
</br>
"Woah, you have another woman on the other side!" Lin Lin jumped up as if she had discovered a new world as she looked at Jiang Chen without good intention.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was not bothered at all because it was not a secret, only Lin Lin didn't know.</br>
</br>
"Hello, can I know your name?" Ayesha gently smiled at her.</br>
</br>
She could guess that the girl on the screen was Jiang Chen's woman from the "future world" but she didn't mind. If she could, she wanted to establish a good relationship with her and live harmoniously together.</br>
</br>
"Wooo!" Ayesha's gentle smile seemed to have "stunned" Lin Lin, as to the tantrum she had been preparing in her mouth was stuck in her throat. She was too embarrassed to say it out.</br>
</br>
It was the first time someone smiled at her this gently, could it be that people were all this gentle before?</br>
</br>
"My, my name is Lin Lin."</br>
</br>
"My name is Ayesha," Ayesha put her finger out as lightly touched the screen, "nice to meet you."</br>
</br>
"Me, me too!" Lin Lin's face turned red as she scratched her head.</br>
</br>
"Could I be good friends with you?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm..."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin nodded shyly as her finger played with the tip of her clothes, it was a rare expression for her.</br>
</br>
Seeing the two people becoming friends, Jiang Chen also smiled.</br>
</br>
It was a unique feeling, a friendship beyond time?</br>
</br>
Because of the technical limitations, the chip could not maintain communication for an extended period of time.</br>
</br>
After telling Lin Lin to let Sun Jiao know about the chip so that she could let him know if anything important happened at the base, Jiang Chen hung up the video call.</br>
</br>
"Is she your woman?" Ayesha blinked her blue eyes and asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible," Jiang Chen answered without thinking.</br>
</br>
"But I sensed that she really likes you."</br>
</br>
Listening to Ayesha words, Jiang Chen paused as his expression turned peculiar.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps it is because of Stockholm syndrome." He seemed to be treating her better and better lately as he would always bully her for fun before.</br>
</br>
Ayesha only smiled at Jiang Chen's response as she didn't continue the topic.</br>
</br>
The instinct of a woman is never wrong.</br>
</br>
Even across dimensions.</br>
</br>
"I haven't been back for so long, do you miss me?" Jiang Chen all the sudden lowered his head to get closer to Ayesha's ear as he said with a smirk.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's beautiful face was burning.</br>
</br>
"Let's eat dinner first," She timidly buried her head and said in a faint voice.</br>
</br>
"Can we not eat it together?"</br>
</br>
"Eat it together?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha's face quickly turned into a red apple as her blue pupils began to look frantic.</br>
</br>
Without the need to think, it must be some weird game.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After dinner, Ayesha went to shower.</br>
</br>
After sticking the plates into the dishwasher, Jiang Chen went to the office and checked his email.</br>
</br>
Just like he expected, Robert sent the next step to him.</br>
</br>
The email was from three days ago.</br>
</br>
&lt;The Irish buddy's acting is excellent. I almost want to give him a raise although I don't know if he has the opportunity to spend it. Ahem, now to the serious topic. We can enter the second phase of the plan, I already arranged everything on this side, when will you depart?&gt;</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment as he began typing on the keyboard.</br>
</br>
&lt;In December.&gt;</br>
</br>
After pressing the sent button, Jiang Chen leaned against the chair and closed his eyes for a moment.</br>
</br>
While thinking, he took out his phone and called Zheng Hongjie, the manager of the food processing plant under his name.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Boss, what can I do for you?"</br>
</br>
Hearing his voice, he must be quite well off recently.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, I just want to see if you acquired the license for export and import?"</br>
</br>
"That is done. The new production line is also set, but because we haven't found a place to sell, it is not in production yet," Zheng Hongjie said in awkwardness.</br>
</br>
The food processing industry hasn't been doing so well as of late. The pork price remained elevated as all the plants decreased their production to pass through the industry's harsh winter. But at this time, the boss somehow wanted to increase production. Although he didn't say anything, in Zheng Hongjie's view, it was a terrible decision.</br>
</br>
But his concern was extraneous because the stuff he produced was not meant for this world.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had already registered a shell company in the Pannu Islands. In essence, the order from his "left hand" would arrive at his "right hand." The shell company would massively produce the canned foods provided by the Xinlong Food Processing plant, store it in the warehouse, and wait for Jiang Chen to transport it to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The purchased amount was increasing. To be cautious, Jiang Chen decided to complete the food transport in the small country.</br>
</br>
It would be his backyard in no time.</br>
</br>
"The new production line will start producing tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"But..." For the consideration of being responsible for the plant, Zheng Hongjie still wanted to convince his boss, but Jiang Chen continued to speak.</br>
</br>
"No buts. You will receive an order worth five million tomorrow, keep up the good work. I have already made the deal." Jiang Chen laughed, hung up the phone, and sent a text to the representative at the offshore company.</br>
</br>
Zheng Hongjie dumbfoundedly puts down the phone, scratched his nose and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Did something good happen?" Kong Jie looked at the expression on her husband's face as she felt happy for him.</br>
</br>
"Haha," Zheng Hongjie flung away the phone and gave a deep kiss to his wife, "We have a place to sell now!"</br>
</br>
Kong Jie rolled her eyes as she poked his chest with her finger.</br>
</br>
"Look how excited you are, it is not your plant."</br>
</br>
"What do you know." Zheng Hongjie glanced at his wife as he said displeasingly, "I have built the plant myself. Regardless if the shareholder is me or not, it is my own child!"</br>
</br>
Looking at her excited husband, Kong Jie had a genuine smile on her face.</br>
</br>
Not long ago, the family was facing the crisis of being crushed by debt. He didn't have a trace of a smile left on his face as if the world had fallen.</br>
</br>
But luckily, the family has returned to the right track.</br>
</br>
For that person has changed their lives.</br>
</br>
"Now that you are working for someone, you should be careful, don't make any mistakes. He is our family's savior." She urged the happy husband as she fixed his collar.</br>
</br>
"Of course, you know why I work." Zheng Hongjie said with his head raised.</br>
</br>
Jiajia tilted her head as she half knowing half not knowingly looked at her mom and dad.</br>
</br>
She still didn't really understand the conversation between adults.</br>
</br>
No mean people have been to her house anymore. Dad was happier, mom smiled more, and they even took her to the amusement park yesterday.</br>
</br>
It seemed like after the big brother came, everything in the family became better.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 216: Recent News</br>
</div></br>
Unlike the tense situation in the apocalypse, the development in the modern world had been smooth and steady. For newly emerging technology companies like Future Technology, the government had been supportive as they have given the green light to Jiang Chen in most areas of development.</br>
</br>
Of course, the reason why the local government took a such a stance was obviously due to the hundred million in tax amount Future Technology paid each month.</br>
</br>
Who wouldn't mind putting a money printer in their home? It was a political achievement. And Future Technology had only been formed how long ago? If it continues to grow, there will be a possibility that an internet giant, like Penguin, would form during their tenure.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, because of the continuous growth of Future 1.0's user base, the domestic users had broken the 200 million mark, and the multi-language international users had broken the 400 million mark.</br>
</br>
The rise of Future 1.0 drew in the attention of business elites from all industries who had an acute sense for the smell of cash, and all kinds of proposals for partnership came forth like snowflakes. Because of this, Xia Shiyu had been busy all over the place since the president of the company would always disappear...</br>
</br>
Even people outside of the industry knew that in the internet age, traffic is king. This could be seen through ridesharing, take out, or other businesses using the O2O(1) model. Companies were willing to invest heavily in marketing just to draw in traffic.</br>
</br>
But there was no need for Future 1.0 to spend that much since it was at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and performance enhancement industries. There were no competitors right now that could compete with Future Technology, so there was only one choice.</br>
</br>
Because of their monopoly in performance enhancement, after operating for free for two months, Future Technology "shamelessly" changed the service to a paid subscription model. New users would receive two months of free trial, but on the third month, if they wanted to continue enjoying the service, they must spend 10 RMB to upgrade to VIP1.</br>
</br>
To put it in simple terms, if you wanted to enjoy the speed of a 2000 smartphone with a 1000 smartphone, then you better pay the 10 RMB subscription fee.</br>
</br>
Would people pay for performance enhancement? The answer was, "Certainly".</br>
</br>
Think of all the games and apps that are originally unable to run on your phone. Due to the performance enhancement service of the Future 1.0, your phone would no longer become a scorching brick when you play games, and neither would you have to worry about your battery life when you watch a movie. Would you be able to go back to that kind of phone experience?</br>
</br>
A fee of 10 RMB per month was much cheaper than getting a new phone.</br>
</br>
Of course, when the subscription service was introduced, the forums were filled with negative opinions. The users that hadn't paid for VIP voiced out that it was fraud—they didn't know there would be a fee when they downloaded. Some people even stated that if it changed to a paid service, they will delete Little White.</br>
</br>
</br>
But that was only a small amount of people trying to shift the publics' opinion. Although there were a lot of users expressing their dissatisfaction, those came from a few IPs only. Even if they use their butts to think(2), it was obvious that they must be an internet army hired to shift the public's opinion.</br>
</br>
A lot of paid users who upgraded to VIP1 stood on Future Technology's side:</br>
</br>
"Is 10 RMB a lot? It's not even the price of a meal."</br>
</br>
"Service is not an obligation, why complain so much? Delete it if you want to, don't drag down the average user's intelligence."</br>
</br>
The users who haven't paid held an indifferent opinion. As long as the service was worth the price, they didn't mind spending the money. If they could afford a phone, why would they care about 10 RMB?</br>
</br>
Would the people who were causing a fuss really delete Future 1.0?</br>
</br>
The VIP1 domestic users who upgraded that month surpassed the 200 million mark, and the insanely high percentage of paid users destroyed the QQ membership service.</br>
</br>
The market had given its answer.</br>
</br>
As for the international market, it went relatively smooth. Since they were already used to paying for apps, and because no cracked version existed, most of the users accepted the fee of 2 USD a month.</br>
</br>
Just one membership service in the app brought billions of revenue to Future Technology.</br>
</br>
The insane ability to rake in money stunned Wall Street, leaving the venture capitalists who were unable to get a cut of this piece of pie in despair... all this despite Jiang Chen never mentioning that he would take in venture capitalists.</br>
</br>
It was an honor. Jiang Chen became the first man to be in the headlines for Wall Street Journal twice in just half a year — a man from Hua, nonetheless.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, although the performance of &lt;New Era&gt; paled in comparison to the stunning performance of Future 1.0, it was still able to achieve jaw-dropping results.</br>
</br>
First of all, the &lt;New Era&gt; player base had reached over 50 million, and the concurrent users almost broke the 10 million mark.</br>
</br>
The auction house, cosmetics, warehouse expansion, and a series of other revenue generation method quickly turned intellectual property into cash. The super game design translated into user retention. Now on any subway, or in any university classroom, the fine animation of &lt;New Era&gt; could be seen.</br>
</br>
The game editor provided by Yao Yao was immensely powerful. Almost anything that could be imagined could be implemented into the game. The &lt;New Era&gt; project team had increased to a group of 40 people, with 20 responsible for creating new content and the rest focused on character design, costumes, plot, and missions.</br>
</br>
Whether it was about game content or playability, it was all flooded with positive praises and, after a period of marketing, the international version also came online.</br>
</br>
Based on Xia Shiyu's report, the international users had exceeded the eighty million mark, and it was steadily increasing.</br>
</br>
Although the $200 million profit was a bit lackluster when compared to Future 1.0, it still exceeded that of its competitors by far.</br>
</br>
It was, after all, $200 million in profit, not revenue.</br>
</br>
Even though a lot of mobile games could break the $100 million mark in revenue, because of the expenses for research and development, in addition to the bad debts and many other factors, it was considered profitable if thirty percent of the revenue turned into actual profit.</br>
</br>
A mobile game with $200 million profit was a miracle.</br>
</br>
Due to the popularity of the game, a lot of famous clans entered &lt;New Era&gt;, and smaller game clans also sprouted like bamboo shoots after the rain. The popularity of the game also led to the growth and development of other related industries.</br>
</br>
For example, live streaming professional matches...</br>
</br>
A lot of third-party platforms had come to Future Technology in the hopes of forming a partnership with them on the game &lt;New Era&gt;. In regard to this, Future Technology opened its doors and welcomed all potential partners.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Sohu wants to form a partnership based on Future 1.0 and &lt;New Era&gt;, with a joint venture for a new kind of streaming platform for &lt;New Era&gt;."</br>
</br>
"What do you think about this proposal?" Jiang Chen said sluggishly as he lied on the sofa.</br>
</br>
"Hard to recover the investment in the short term, but it would expand &lt;New Era&gt;'s influence and increase user retention—"</br>
</br>
"Thank you so much!"</br>
</br>
As if she had already expected Jiang Chen to say that, Xia Shiyu, who was sitting in the office, facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"... Okay, also, Dalmer Corporation's representative had arrived in Wanghai as they wish to discuss a partnership. Because of the identity of their representative, based on etiquette, you would have to personally meet him."</br>
</br>
"Dalmer Corporation?" Jiang Chen paused as he never heard this name before.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu on the other side of the phone also paused.</br>
</br>
"The Maybach S600 you are driving is from Dalmer corporation."</br>
</br>
[ Now that's embarrassing! ]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scratched his face to cover his embarrassment,. He really didn't know much about cars.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, who is coming?" He decided to change the topic.</br>
</br>
"Carmen Rothschild."</br>
</br>
1. O2O: "Online to offline". Any e-commerce service that provides services online to aid the user with a better offline shopping experience. The "services" could be in the form of 'discounts', 'information', 'coupons', etc. For example, the website Groupon is an O2O site: it provides discounts *online* for *offline* things, such as "Up to 52% off Nail Services".</br>
</br>
2. "Even if you use your butt to think" is an expression stating how obvious something is.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 217: Artificial Intelligence + Cars?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Carmen Rothschild." Seeing Carmen entering the conference room, Jiang Chen stood up and greeted him.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your warm welcome. It is also nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen, the mysterious Oriental man." With the same friendly smile, Carmen shook Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
Carmen Rothschild had a high nose, deep eye sockets, and light green pupils. Not only did he look thin, but he was also sharp. From the gracefulness of his gesture, it certainly matched his background.</br>
</br>
"Haha, do I look mysterious?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"Of course, you possess an endless amount of possibilities, and in our eyes, it could be considered mysterious." Carmen had a deceptive smile on his face.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Jiang Chen paused slightly to think before he smiled and invited Carmen to sit down.</br>
</br>
In regard to the Rothschild family, Jiang Chen had heard quite a bit about them; however, this information usually came from unclear sources, with truths mixed with speculations. It was hard to discern what was the truth and what was a lie.</br>
</br>
Based on the information disclosed, the Rothschild Banking Group had a revenue of less than $10 billion per year with the profit of less than $3 billion; its asset was estimated to be below $30 billion, which is a few digits off of the UA and major European banks.</br>
</br>
Could it be that the family was truly on the decline, like how it appeared on to be on the surface, or could it be that the speculations were true—that the Rothschild family intentionally left the eyes of the public? No one would truly know. For example, even Jiang Chen didn't know that Dalmer corporation was a part of the Rothschild's asset.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen had no interest in researching the history of the family, and he just did a brief search on Carmen here for business before inviting him over for a conference.</br>
</br>
The two sat across from each other on the conference table, and there were two cups of tea on the table alongside two identical documents.</br>
</br>
"Our corporation is extremely interested in your company's achievement in the artificial intelligence field. I trust that Mr. Jiang has already read over this proposal. Do you have any good suggestions?" Without any small talk, right after they sat down, Carmen jumped straight to the topic.</br>
</br>
Artificial intelligence will experience a period of growth for the next fifty years; this trend was evident from the wasteland. Although its starting point from the Cold War did diverge from what originally occurred in the wasteland, the developmental trajectory of civilization wouldn't.</br>
</br>
To cut a piece of this pie for themselves(1), Dalmer corporation followed the trend and found the leading company in the artificial intelligence field to discuss the possibility of using artificial intelligence in the automotive industry.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Of course. But before we start, can I ask a question?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Please." Carmen smiled back.</br>
</br>
"Why would your company decide to choose us? You know, our leading edge is in the phone software industry. For the automotive industry, without exaggeration, I can say we know nothing," Jiang Chen spoke candidly.</br>
</br>
Even with Jiang Chen's confession, Carmen didn't give up as he shook his head and continued:</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter. The radar sensing equipment, as well as the primary control computer, had already been designed by us to allow for artificially intelligent driving, or self-driving, and we now only need the software part.</br>
</br>
"We originally had a partner, but during our partnership, the software development experienced some issues, causing the software and hardware to not be perfectly compatible with one another. The computer may freeze while the car is driving. You know very well what the consequences would be if that were to happen on a highway; therefore, we terminated the contract."</br>
</br>
Then, Carmen looked at Jiang Chen intensely as he said, "Our offer is high. The requirements are just as high."</br>
</br>
"Can I ask what is the offer then?" Jiang Chen took a sip of the tea.</br>
</br>
"1 billion USD," Carmen pointed out one finger as he slowly said.</br>
</br>
Hearing Carmen's offer, Jiang Chen was secretly shocked.</br>
</br>
[ Woah, no wonder they are a family that had existed for centuries. 1 billion USD as the opening for the negotiations, selling software is much more profitable than selling gold. ]</br>
</br>
While he was thinking, he chose to selectively forget the fact that he was already the president of a ten billion dollar company, and the one billion USD would only be equivalent to Future Technology's one month of profit.</br>
</br>
But who wouldn't mind more money?</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen's silence was, in Carmen's eyes, interpreted as being unsatisfied with the offer, so he smiled and asserted, "Of course, there is room for negotiation. If Mr. Jiang is not too happy with the offer, you can tell me."</br>
</br>
If they could pioneer into the field of "artificial intelligence and cars" before their competitors, Volkswagen and BMW, it would indeed offer them the initiative. And for only 1 billion USD. In 2014 Dalmer's pretax income alone was 10.8 billion Euros, so they certainly had the liquid asset.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought for a moment before he slowly opened his mouth.</br>
</br>
"1 billion USD is okay, but I have a condition."</br>
</br>
Carmen's eyebrows raised slightly, but a smile quickly returned to his face.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Please go ahead."</br>
</br>
"I want to add in Future 1.0's logo on the start up screen."</br>
</br>
"Add in Future 1.0's logo? Is that all? I do have to remind you that we don't have plans to add the social media platform to the vehicle," Carmen spoke in a humorous tone.</br>
</br>
"That's fine, it's only adding a logo and displaying it for one second." Jiang Chen didn't mind the joke.</br>
</br>
Carmen had to think for a moment before he nodded his head, then he extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"So I think we reached an agreement, right?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen shook his hand. "Pleasure to work with you."</br>
</br>
Because it was a minor change, Carmen also brought in a professional lawyer with him and the contract was fixed on the spot.</br>
</br>
After the signing, Carmen waved his hand at the secretary behind him as he took a briefcase from her.</br>
</br>
"After signing the confidentiality agreement, our party will provide the requirements of the software and the chip sample to your party. Your party only needs to create a software that is compatible with the chip. Although the timeline is fairly rigid, I trust your party's ability to bring out astounding results before May."</br>
</br>
The software must be completed by that time to ensure that it would hit the market with the new vehicles; otherwise, the approval process would be delayed and the release of the new vehicle would, unfortunately, be disastrous.</br>
</br>
However... May? That was severely underestimating Yao Yao's ability.</br>
</br>
"Of course, another question: is there any reward for completing it before the deadline?" Jiang Chen inquired half-jokingly.</br>
</br>
Surprised, Carmen didn't even think Jiang Chen could complete it before the deadline. The process for developing a professional software wasn't short—it would be a feat to complete it within five months.</br>
</br>
"If Mr. Jiang can complete it earlier, I can give you a small gift," Carmen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Could you give me a spoiler of the gift?" Jiang Chen said casually.</br>
</br>
"I heard Mr. Jiang's vehicle is our company's Maybach S600. Is Mr. Jiang satisfied with our brand?" Carmen smiled mysteriously.</br>
</br>
"Of course, whether it's comfort or reliability, it is satisfying."</br>
</br>
"If Mr. Jiang can complete the software before May, I can gift you a limited edition sports car—the Maybach EX, which is still being designed—with sales limited to just five units globally."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 218: The Importance of Brand</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Maybach EX. With a limited quantity of five units globally, the expected price is 4.2 million Euros or 28.66 million RMB.</br>
</br>
Although this amount was nothing compared to the two's assets, as a gift, it was undoubtedly a friendly gesture.</br>
</br>
Especially with it being a limited edition, it might be difficult to buy one even with money.</br>
</br>
After sending Carmen out of the company, Jiang Chen looked at his phone.</br>
</br>
It was only three in the afternoon, too early to go back. So, he decided to sit for a bit longer in the office.</br>
</br>
Since they acquired Lingyu Technology, the Lingyu building went under construction. Under the acquiescence of the second largest shareholder, 361 Corporation, was transferred to Future Technology and officially renamed the Future Technology building.</br>
</br>
Now that he had his own office building, it certainly felt different.</br>
</br>
Leaning against the chair, Jiang Chen sat in the president's office on the top floor as he sluggishly looked down at the street view outside.</br>
</br>
It was a magical feeling.</br>
</br>
Just half a year ago, he was only an ordinary person at the lowest level of society and working for a tiny salary. But now, he has obtained the right to be overlooking everything.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, just looking at the scene below, he could not fathom that the future on another timeline would become barren land.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Different from the image of a traditional president that always has a heated face, ready to execute the affairs of the company, he was young and energetic. His office was clean, referring to the lack of documents visible.</br>
</br>
His eyes lazily stared outside of the window, at the never-ending traffic and the busy looking crowd.</br>
</br>
Who knows what is there to look at. Other than being crowded, he couldn't think of a better word to describe everything on the streets below.</br>
</br>
Above was Xia Shiyu's perspective.</br>
</br>
She was standing in Jiang Chen's office.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was quietly looking out the window, and she somehow began to stare at the side of his face. She observed him for a while and forget about the time.</br>
</br>
They had been working together for a fair amount of time now, but she always felt that she didn't know him well enough. But he, he seemed to know everything about her.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, is there something you need?" It was Jiang Chen that first broke the peacefulness.</br>
</br>
With Jiang Chen's observation, the moment she came in he noticed her. What he didn't expect was for her to not say anything, but rather blankly stare at him.</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, he didn't have a proper conservation with her after the last gathering.</br>
</br>
"Ah, yes. Ahem," Realizing the franticness in her voice, Xia Shiyu coughed gently to adjust her mood as she changed into her professional self and spoke again, "It's about the agreement with Dalmer Corporation."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around as he slid the chair back to the office table and sat up straight. "Go ahead."</br>
</br>
"Putting Future 1.0 on vehicles, President, do you plan on entering the automotive industry?" Xia Shiyu pushed up her glasses out of habit.</br>
</br>
"Not yet, but I don't eliminate this future possibility." Jiang Chen shook his head. "Also, Dalmer Corporation wants a customized software, not the implementation of Future 1.0. The software would still be sent to the overseas market to be developed. I will take care of it."</br>
</br>
Based on Jiang Chen's plan, Future Technology would obviously not give up on the attractive automotive industry. As a key selling point, artificial intelligence would definitely be a part of it.</br>
</br>
But then, why would he accept Dalmer Corporation's request to design the autonomous driving system's software? It was not giving them a cake to bite but was due to another level of consideration.</br>
</br>
It is well known that for vehicles, quality is one aspect, but more importantly, brand is extremely crucial which requires years to build up.</br>
</br>
With a simple example, East Wind's vehicle quality is pretty high, but could they sell it at Mercedes or BMW's price?</br>
</br>
To a certain extent, the car driven by the owner reflected the status of the person. Cars were no longer only a method of transportation, but also a reflection of status. Or in derogatory terms, to see who has the bigger d*ck. With a Lambo, it would be much easier to pick up girls than a Volkswagon.</br>
</br>
The reason why he proposed including Future 1.0's logo on the car's startup screen was not for advertisement purposes. For Dalmer's new car is positioned as a high-end luxury vehicle, therefore sales would be low. Which indicates this form of advertisement would be ineffective.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw the brand. If Future 1.0's brand can be hooked to a high-end market, with the luxury vehicle introduced by Dalmer Corporation, it would allow them to prep the market before they independently enter the autonomous vehicle market.</br>
</br>
Imagine this, as long as you start the luxury vehicle with the system included, you would see Future 1.0's flashy and futuristic looking logo. Naturally, the Future logo would be known in the luxury market as well as the automotive industry.</br>
</br>
As to the automotive manufacturer who had taken the "initial opportunity"...</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen introduced a new energy vehicle with better performance, it would be a question of if those manufacturers would continue to exist or not. Similar to the fact that you don't see steam vehicles anymore.</br>
</br>
Dalmer Corporation would eventually become the stepping stone of Future Automotive.</br>
</br>
Of course, these are stories for a later time, the next strategic focus for Future Technology was not cars, but phones.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded after the explanation.</br>
</br>
"Then you'll have to be responsible for taking care of this. On the other hand, Linhua Corporation has sent you an invitation to join the Wanghai Economics Forum on the 3rd."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took out a gilded golden invite from her brief and placed it on the table.</br>
</br>
Linhua Corporation, a renowned real estate giant in Wanghai city. Other than real estate development, they were also a part of entertainment and retail which put them as one of the leading companies in Wanghai City.</br>
</br>
"Wanghai Economics Forum?" Jiang Chen picked up the invite as he raised his eyebrows in confusion, he has never heard of the name before.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, it is rumored that the participants are the elites of each industry. Assets over one hundred million is only one of the requirements. Ability to participate is also based on influence in the industry." Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
Rich people's gathering?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was dubious.</br>
</br>
"Is there any benefits to going to this gathering?"</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen asking the question so directly, Xia Shiyu felt exasperated.</br>
</br>
"Of course there are benefits. Since it is the gathering of the upper class in Wanghai City, you'll be able to meet and befriend some of the people at the same level with similar interest as you. These connections alone would be a form of asset."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scratched his chin and considered.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'll go then. Speaking of this, does this type of gathering require a female companion?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu paused for a second before she replied.</br>
</br>
"Of course, it is permitted to bring a female companion to the gathering."</br>
</br>
"Perfect, then come with me," Jiang Chen said without thinking.</br>
</br>
But what he didn't anticipate was, the moment the words came out of his mouth, Xia Shiyu's cold face suddenly turned burning red.</br>

</div></br>
"Huh? N...No, only really important people can attend..." Xia Shiyu's expression was obviously shaken as her tone changed into a rare franticness.</br>
</br>
"Then that's even better." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Xia Shiyu buried her head as her silky, black bangs slightly hid her eyes.</br>
</br>
"I, I am someone important to you?"</br>
</br>
"Of course," Jiang Chen answered without hesitation.</br>
</br>
As the CEO, Xia Shiyu played a pivotal role in Future Technology's current accomplishments. From the operating of the company to handling crises, Jiang Chen had no experience at all as he left everything to Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
The technology from the future is indeed powerful, but without the operations of a professional, it would only be a powerful technology.</br>
</br>
To Jiang Chen, Xia Shiyu was as crucial as his hands.</br>
</br>
But for the word "important", the two apparently had two different kinds of interpretation.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's "of course," Xia Shiyu's face turned redder.</br>
</br>
"But...But we haven't even dated, we don't know if we are right for each other, it would be too rushed if we go straight to the last step-"</br>
</br>
With arms across her chest, Xia Shiyu looked away. Her finger anxiously played with her own hair, even her pale neck was covered by the red hue.</br>
</br>
"Wait, I do not understand..." Jiang Chen immediately interrupted Xia Shiyu with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked at him and put her arms down.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"Uh, the requirement for the female companion, could you explain it to me..."</br>
</br>
Of course, the two had a discrepancy in understanding.</br>
</br>
It was okay to bring a female companion, but it must be a wife or at least a fiance. Even a girlfriend wasn't enough. Although there was no written rule, it became the norm.</br>
</br>
If a girlfriend or even a mistress could be brought to the gathering, then things could become chaotic. Most of the people participating in the gathering have more than one mistress, with some changing models or actresses every few days. If anyone can be brought into the circle, it would devalue the forum.</br>
</br>
In the end, it was a gathering meant for the elites, to find partners beneficial to their career, it was not a fun kind of party.</br>
</br>
Therefore, it was inappropriate to invite Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"Uh, sorry, I haven't thought about that level," Jiang Chen apologized, feeling embarrassed.</br>
</br>
"It's okay."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu let out a breath of relief.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was his illusion, but he sensed that she was slightly disappointed.</br>
</br>
"Umm, now that everything is done, I'm going to go back to my office." Xia Shiyu slightly bowed and turned around to leave.</br>
</br>
Looking at her leave, Jiang Chen opened his mouth but he didn't end up saying anything.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu came of the office, she headed straight for her own. But when she walked through the hallway, the red hue on her face was seen by her colleagues.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Eh, CEO Xia just walked out of the president's office." Seeing Su Mengqi's pouting expression, her good friend Li Fengying poked her arm and joked.</br>
</br>
After passing through the probation period, she was moved into the sales department with her good friend. The two were walking to their desk with documents in hand.</br>
</br>
"I see," Su Mengqi replied without any energy.</br>
</br>
"Her face is also very red."</br>
</br>
"Woo."</br>
</br>
"Why are you so boring, aren't you curious about what they did?" Li Fengying with a dubious expression whispered into Su Mengqi's ear.</br>
</br>
"I am going to tell CEO Xia and have your salary deducted." Su Mengqi stuck out her finger and "fiercely" poke her good friend's neck as she whispered.</br>
</br>
The two fooled around for a moment more as they walked towards their desk.</br>
</br>
But Su Mengqi's smile was bitter.</br>
</br>
If the competition was CEO Xia, she had no odds of winning at all.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Did you get the information?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Inside the presidential suite in Sheraton hotel, Carmen Rothschild sat on a chair, a black man was standing in front of him. From the muscular appearance, he looked like a soldier, at least one from not too long ago.</br>
</br>
Johnson served in the Fran foreign military before. After he has been discharged, he had acquired French nationality and worked in a security company. Now, he worked for the Rothschild family. He was the bodyguard for Carmen's Han trip, and also his assistance.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, born in 1992, from Hucheng. Studied at Wanghai University with a major in mechanical engineering. He became a salesperson in a clothing store after graduation... Damn, a resume made out of a mold," Looking at the stack of paper, Carmen cursed.</br>
</br>
Ten pages. It was all the information they could collect on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Since everyone in this country is cut out of the same mold," Johnson cracked a smile as he mocked.</br>
</br>
"No, you didn't understand my meaning." Carmen flipped through the document once more before putting it aside. "Because it is too ordinary, the validity of the information is suspicious. For example, if you throw a graduate from MIT, what would be his first reaction?"</br>
</br>
"Pee his pants?"</br>
</br>
"Exactly." Carmen snapped his finger and pointed at the document. "And this person, not only did he not pee his pants, he saved an American from the IS. This American is also an interesting individual. He smuggled firearms in Veit before, transported crude oil in Iran, and was finally under surveillance by the FBI. That's why he is a lot more obedient. But he has been moving around again, he seems to be working for Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
Johnson's contempt soon faded as he put on a serious expression.</br>
</br>
"True. From this point, this Han called Jiang Chen is not a simple character."</br>
</br>
"In your opinion, how much training would it take to get to his level?" Carmen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Mentality or shooting?"</br>
</br>
"Of course mentality."</br>
</br>
Thinking for a moment, Johnson gave a fair answer based on his own experience. "It would take three months in training, three days on the battlefield."</br>
</br>
Carmen nodded, he took over a bottle of wine and elegantly poured himself a cup.</br>
</br>
"I think there may be inaccuracies in our information. At least this resume is likely fake. The only thing I am curious about now is what does the organization behind him do. They played us in Ukraine, but only ended up taking a few old soldiers away to become trainers, and then built a military base in Nigeria. Interesting."</br>
</br>
"Then what's your intention boss?" Johnson asked.</br>
</br>
"Maintain status quo and keep in contact. Also, I am interested in where the USB would be sent to?" Carmen with elegance took a sip of the wine as he looked like he was fully in control of the situation.</br>
</br>
If everything goes as planned, that briefcase would be sent overseas, with the mysterious technology team taking over.</br>
</br>
He left a GPS tracker on the USB which would send the location to his computer.</br>
</br>
As long as they know the location of the mysterious organization, they would no longer be mysterious.</br>
</br>
When he heard his boss's words, Johnson took a moment to digest the information before he also started to chuckle.</br>
</br>
Carmen proposed a toast to Johnson. Then with a cheerful expression, he pressed a few buttons on the laptop.</br>
</br>
The map appeared in front of him.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The delicate wine glass smashed into pieces after falling on the ground.</br>
</br>
Without caring about the wine stain splashed onto his pants, Carmen immediately stood up. With both hands pressed against the table, he stared at the screen.</br>
</br>
On his face, his confident expression had vanished.</br>
</br>
"How is this possible!"</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Johnson walked up hastily, but when he saw the screen, his expression also froze.</br>
</br>
&lt;Signal lost&gt;</br>
</br>
"We got caught. Looks like we still underestimated him." With a bitter smile, Carmen sat back on the chair in defeat as he rubbed his temple.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 220: It's all Weibo's fault</br>
</div></br>
Caught? Did Jiang Chen really catch him?</br>
</br>
The answer was an obvious no. Jiang Chen was too lazy to carry it as he threw the briefcase into the storage dimension. As for GPS signals that could pass through the dimension, that's only a feat that Lin Lin could achieve.</br>
</br>
Now that his storage dimension had expanded to 20 cubic meters, there was no need to consider the lack of space inside. Five cubic meters was used to store weapons, such as the PK2000 assault rifle and the kinetic skeleton.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had already left. Looking at the empty office, Jiang Chen had nothing else to do.</br>
</br>
Work? If he randomly pokes his nose into the company's business, he may not even be helpful with anything—rather, he would be causing more trouble. Since he had already delegated his responsibilities, he must continue the tradition.</br>
</br>
If he didn't work, then he was playing games. As the president, merely sitting in the office is an effective method for increasing the morale of the employees.</br>
</br>
Mhmm, that's the case.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen thought, he sunk into the chair and took out his phone.</br>
</br>
Speaking of which, as the developer himself, he hadn't even played his own game.</br>
</br>
But thinking that it was too troublesome to register for a new account, he recollected that Future Technology had a partnership with Sohu in streaming. Jiang Chen smiled, searched, and opened Sohu TV.</br>
</br>
The new platform was still under development stage, but the Sohu TV now opened a column specific for &lt;New Era&gt;.</br>
</br>
Although it was a mobile game, because of the open world, great freedom, superb graphics, and rich contents, a lot of people play it as a computer-based masterpiece.</br>
</br>
Seeing its popularity being ranked as number one, Jiang Chen was secretly shocked breathless as he randomly opened a channel.</br>
</br>
The screen was big, but the streamer's face covered one-fourth of the screen.</br>
</br>
Looking at the exposed whiteness while hearing the flirtatious voice, Jiang Chen put on his headphones.</br>
</br>
The female streamer was playing a thief. She was in the middle of a mission, but her control certain sucked. To kill a turtle-like boss, she died five times.</br>
</br>
But that was not the crucial point. Every time she died, she would moan in a seductive voice.</br>
</br>
"Is this streamer playing a game or moaning in bed..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ridiculed while facepalming as he continued the "market research" until the end.</br>
</br>
Like this, Jiang Chen sent Friday in.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen chatted with the employees about to go off as he walked to the elevator empty-handed.</br>
</br>
Just as the elevator door was about to close, Jiang Chen, afraid of trouble, sped up and dashed into the elevator.</br>
</br>
Coincidentally, Xia Shiyu was also in the elevator.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Xia Shiyu was looking at him strangely, Jiang Chen realized that his action lacked confidence. He smiled shamelessly and said "Hi" to her first.</br>
</br>
</br>
"How's work today?"</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I have been used to being busy. I am taking the rest of the documents home." Xia Shiyu pushed up her glasses.</br>
</br>
"Don't work too hard, your health is the most important." Jiang Chen spoke with care.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded, but from her expression, she didn't seem to plan to listen to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You are working so hard, which is making me, as the president, guilty."</br>
</br>
"Then why don't you help me out a bit?" Seeing Jiang Chen being emotional, she couldn't help but mock him.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, I'll let the professionals take care of it. If I am doing it, I will only cause a mess. But I can treat you to dinner," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
It was only a joke. Based on Jiang Chen's previous impression of Xia Shiyu, this girl would probably coldly reject it.</br>
</br>
But to his surprise, Xia Shiyu took a moment to think about it, then nodded her head.</br>
</br>
"Okay, when?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Jiang Chen thought he heard wrong.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you say you are going to treat me?" Xia Shiyu raised her eyebrows while tilting her head.</br>
</br>
"Uhh, I thought you would reject..."</br>
</br>
"Do you want me to reject?" Xia Shiyu asked, downcasted, as she looked at the elevator door.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
The voice sounded like murmuring.</br>
</br>
In her eyes, Jiang Chen saw a hint of confusion, and there was also an indescribable feeling.</br>
</br>
He suddenly remembered that night.</br>
</br>
She was drunk that night when he carried her home.</br>
</br>
Under the influence of alcohol, they were very close...</br>
</br>
"Who do you like?" The confession-like words swirled around his ear.</br>
</br>
If it were not for the phone ringing suddenly, Jiang Chen knew that, with his personality and with Xia Shiyu being forward, he would not be able to control himself that night.</br>
</br>
A crazy but intimate idea overtook his head.</br>
</br>
If something did happen between the two that night, how would it feel like now?</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen smiled, and with a gentle voice, he asked, "How about tonight?"</br>
</br>
"Okay." Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
When the elevator reached the button, the two walked out of the elevator and into the parking lot.</br>
</br>
"Where is your car?" Jiang Chen asked as he took out the key.</br>
</br>
"I didn't buy a car yet. I drove company's car last time at the gathering, I usually take the train to work."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's response surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You are an executive at a billion-dollar company. The bank would not offer a loan to you?" Jiang Chen was puzzled as he opened the door courteously for her like a gentleman.</br>
</br>
"I hate loans." Xia Shiyu's mood was down.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment as he then recalled that she originally experienced hardship due to a loan.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I made you remember unpleasant memories."</br>
</br>
"It's okay... That time, thank you." Xia Shiyu got in the car and lowered her head.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, everyone has their ups and downs." Jiang Chen sat in the car, strapped on the seat belt, and started the car.</br>
</br>
"... I am talking about that time when I was drunk." Her face turned red as she said embarrassingly, "If I said something weird, I hope you didn't mind."</br>
</br>
Because they both remembered the intimacy that happened in the living room, the two fell into silence together.</br>
</br>
The ride was smooth.</br>
</br>
Once the car hit the highway, Xia Shiyu didn't say anything. Jiang Chen didn't know what to talk about either, and the atmosphere in the car was awkward.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Xia Shiyu broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"I have read Weibo recently."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"Do you have a girlfriend?" It was an abrupt question.</br>
</br>
"No, why do you ask?"</br>
</br>
"I saw that you are only following one person... Her name is Liu Yao?" Xia Shiyu asked, looking down.</br>
</br>
The words sounded like jealousy to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, Liu Yao seemed to have mentioned it before. Because she was the only person he followed, people spread rumors about them, and that girl became popular for a while because of this.</br>
</br>
Because of Ayesha's "interruption" last time, Jiang Chen forgot all about it. Liu Yao, without receiving permission from Jiang Chen, would not proactively clarify the situation, but instead, used a tactic common among celebrities—answer ambiguously.</br>
</br>
The girlfriend of the nation's husband!</br>
</br>
Liu Yao wouldn't have thought that her fans would increase exponentially because she registered a Weibo account for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I happen to see her movie, so I just clicked follow." For some reason, Jiang Chen subconscious lied.</br>
</br>
His Weibo account was registered by Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu opened her mouth as she seemed to have wanted to say something, but nothing came out.</br>
</br>
[ He isn't anyone to me. Why do I care so much? ] Xia Shiyu thought out of spite as she looked out of the car window.</br>
</br>
Although she had a boyfriend who hasn't even held her hands, when it comes to relationships, she was still as naive as a child.</br>
</br>
Realizing that the person she liked had an ambiguous relationship with a female, she didn't try to pull him back to her, but rather, she became cold to express her jealousy and pushed him away.</br>
</br>
Even more so now, since the two of them were not officially together.</br>
</br>
At this time, Jiang Chen's phone rang.</br>
</br>
[ Is it Ayesha? I'll have to tell her I am not coming home for dinner... ]</br>
</br>
He didn't mind. With one hand on the wheel, Jiang Chen connected to the Bluetooth and, with his eyes focused on the road, he accepted the call.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Do you have time right now?" A pure voice with a hint of seduction echoed by his ear. It was obviously not Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a moment, he then looked at the phone screen in his right hand:</br>
</br>
&lt;Liu Yao&gt;</br>
</br>
Also looking at the phone screen was Xia Shiyu, sitting on the passenger side.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 221"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 221: The Acheron on the Car</br>
</div></br>
"Haven't seen you in a long time, don't you miss me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could very well imagine her watery eyes looking at him filled with fervor.</br>
</br>
"Uh, very much." Jiang Chen took a peek at Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu had already taken off her eyes from his phone, but her action looked unnatural no matter how you looked at it.</br>
</br>
"So cold." Liu Yao instantly sensed that Jiang Chen was distracted and stuck her tongue out.</br>
</br>
"I'm driving... How have you been?" While holding onto the wheel, Jiang Chen changed the topic.</br>
</br>
"I've been filming and have been busy since this morning, so I ate lunch and dinner at the same time. I'm exhausted." Although she was complaining, Jiang Chen could hear genuine happiness from her voice.</br>
</br>
She really loved acting.</br>
</br>
If she just liked money, with the allowance Jiang Chen was giving her, she could just do absolutely nothing and enjoy life.</br>
</br>
He could faintly hear the other casts in the background, so she must have called despite her extremely busy schedule.</br>
</br>
"Have you not eaten yet?"</br>
</br>
"I am not eating. Woo, the food here tastes so bad, so I want you to treat me to a meal," Liu Yao said shyly.</br>
</br>
"We can talk about it once you're no longer busy."</br>
</br>
"Okay. Also, when are we going to go on a vacation? I'm looking forward to it," Liu Yao responded enthusiastically.</br>
</br>
"We'll go this month, but would you be able to leave at this time?" Hearing the delighted voice, Jiang Chen couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
"Haha, don't you remember that you're one of the investors? The director would have to listen to you. Postponing my shooting and filming it later would simply be up to you," she said in an adorable voice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pondered on it and realized that it was indeed the case.</br>
</br>
The producer did not necessarily choose Liu Yao because of her ability, and it might as well be said that it was due to Jiang Chen's ability. But Jiang Chen didn't mind. Having too much money, he immediately invested 100 million RMB to become the biggest investor in &lt;Ma Dongmei's Trouble&gt; film.</br>
</br>
Other than those blockbuster film directors, the investor was the bane of existence for any film directors. If they accidentally got off on the wrong foot, the investors could just withdraw their investment, and the directors would end up crying over their script. Where would you find an investor who would be willing to invest 100 million without putting up any demand?</br>
</br>
Ad such, Liu Yao had landed the role of a supporting actress.</br>
</br>
At the same time, all mobile boot interface was replaced by Future 1.0’s opening animation.</br>
</br>
"That’s true." Once realization dawned on him, Jiang Chen chuckled.</br>
</br>
"What are you doing now?"</br>
</br>
"Taking someone to dinner."</br>
</br>
"Someone beautiful?" Liu Yao pouted.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen answered honestly.</br>
</br>
</br>
"As pretty as me?" Liu Yao elegantly ate her meal, her eyes becoming cunning.</br>
</br>
"Both of you are unique," Jiang Chen’s answer was ambiguous.</br>
</br>
"Woo, I don’t feel satisfied with that answer. What kind of girl is she?"</br>
</br>
[She's beside me, how am I supposed to answer that?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a peek at Xia Shiyu while he responded cleverly and creatively.</br>
</br>
"Similar…to the section head in your last movie."</br>
</br>
"Oh! Her, the ice beauty that’s warm on the inside? I can do it too," Liu Yao paused and put her phone closer to her mouth, covered it with her hand, and lowered her voice, her voice becoming cold and strict. "Jiang Chen, why didn’t you finish your math homework? What? You didn’t write it? That’s not okay, come to my office, I will watch you finish it. Your unfinished homework. Give. It, All. To. Your. Teacher."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could very well fantasize how the vibrant crimson lips enunciated the last syllables.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, this little devil.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had almost stepped on the gas by accident.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k."</br>
</br>
"Coming! Ah, break time is over, I'm going to hang up. Mwah."</br>
</br>
As soon as she hung up the phone, Jiang Chen let out a breath and removed the Bluetooth headset.</br>
</br>
"…were you really just concerned about Liu Yao?" Xia Shiyu asked dubiously.</br>
</br>
"Well, I just happened to get her phone number."</br>
</br>
[Why do I have to lie…] Jiang Chen berated himself in his mind.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu didn’t seem to want to continue with this topic any longer as she didn’t ask more question. Instead, she turned her head away, averting her gaze.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt relieved and held onto the steering while focusing on the road ahead of him.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere felt odd.</br>
</br>
[Is she…being jealous?]</br>
</br>
A weird expression flitted across his face.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Because Jiang Chen didn’t know where the good food was, he took Xia Shiyu to Shimao.</br>
</br>
"Welcome! Table for two?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu walked into a western restaurant called Xiuyu Garden as the server greeted them with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, please pick a quiet spot for us," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Okay, sir. This way," The server said courteously.</br>
</br>
Because it was a business day, the place only had a few customers . Normally, they would have to wait for a long time.</br>
</br>
The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, and it was also quiet. Most of the people dining there were couples. Seeing this scene, Xia Shiyu turned red and her legs went numb.</br>
</br>
[Since we're eating here, wouldn’t it look like we're a couple?]</br>
</br>
With that thought, Xia Shiyu discreetly took a peek at Jiang Chen but failed to see the nervousness she expected on his face.</br>
</br>
[Maybe he didn’t even feel like it's a date?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu felt slightly frustrated despite not knowing why.</br>
</br>
Unaware of what Xia Shiyu was thinking, Jiang Chen was really oblivious to the mood. He just felt the ambiance was nice and quiet. Men were destined to be a simple creature in a sense that they wouldn’t think as much as women.</br>
</br>
After the server ushered them to their seats, Jiang Chen picked up the menu and passed it to Xia Shiyu like a gentleman.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to eat?"</br>
</br>
Because she was distracted by something else, looking at the dazzling variety of selections, Xia Shiyu couldn’t think of something to eat.</br>
</br>
Seeing the expression on the customer's face, the server smiled as she started to recite their menu.</br>
</br>
"Is it your first time in our restaurant?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm…"</br>
</br>
"Our cheese risotto is delicious, and our steak has also been praised by many. Of course, I personally recommend this set of couple meal, very fitting for a couple of two. We also offer a special desert— Heart-to-heart."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu’s face immediately reddened.</br>
</br>
Especially when she saw the Heart-to-heart ice cream on the menu, the two straws formed a heart shape and intertwined together.</br>
</br>
Her brain short-circuited in an instant.</br>
</br>
"C-couple? N-no, you are mistaken."</br>
</br>
"Ahem, we are only friends, not a couple." Seeing the frantic Xia Shiyu, Jiang Chen also explained to the waitress.</br>
</br>
Although both people denied it, the waitress acutely sensed that the female’s expression was more of an embarrassed one, and the male didn’t look awkward at all. Therefore, their relationship must be between friends and couple.</br>
</br>
With a smile, the server bowed to apologize for pushing the two together unintentionally.</br>
</br>
"I apologize. I just thought you two really look like a couple. If I misunderstood, I hope you don’t mind."</br>
</br>
[A, a couple look?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was utterly in panic, Jiang Chen almost touched his nose with a red face.</br>
</br>
But then, a harsh voice interrupted the moment.</br>
</br>
"Waitress, is it not ready yet? Could you hurry up?"</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the voice, Xia Shiyu’s expression froze immediately.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could clearly sense that the usual expressionless face turned even colder.</br>

</br>
"Please wait, sir, this table-"</br>
</br>
"Don’t you see that we need to order? Why would a poor bastard even come into a Western restaurant? He's slow even when ordering," the person cursed.</br>
</br>
"I apologize, sir, I’ll be right there." The waitress gave Jiang Chen an apologetic looked as she stuck out her tongue and ran to the other table.</br>
</br>
"Is your zodiac a turtle… Honey, what do you want to eat?" The man sitting close by arrogantly criticized the waitress while his expression changed into an "affectionate" one as he eagerly attended to the woman sitting across from him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the back of this man in shock, and his expression was rather odd.</br>
</br>
Poor bastard? Me?</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen looked at Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
Her expression was rather unnatural, her eyes glued to the lemon water on the table. She seemed scary.</br>
</br>
Was he someone she knew?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who originally wanted to go and "make some friends", quickly got the idea out of his head as he looked on contemptuously at the man.</br>
</br>
The man's face looked ashen white, his hair styled with gel looking somewhat "trendy," and the nicely fitted white suit was, indeed, worth something. All in all, other than being a bit feminine, he certainly looked attractive.</br>
</br>
However, it was the arrogant gestures that made it impossible to tolerate him.</br>
</br>
As for that woman...</br>
</br>
Her face was delicate, her hair black and curly, and her body donning a red cotton dress with a pair of brown boots sluggishly crossing over each other. From just her appearance alone, it was hard to judge what her net worth was; however, with the vibe she gave off, Jiang Chen could sense that she was born into wealth.</br>
</br>
Looking at her narrowed gorgeous eyes, one can tell that she seemed to be enjoying this flattering feeling.</br>
</br>
"Salad is okay?" an indolent voice asked.</br>
</br>
"Okay, do you want some desserts? For example, this Heart to Heart-"</br>
</br>
"No, it’s disgusting." Her red lips were curled up.</br>
</br>
The man’s expression stiffened, but then a heartwarming smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Ok, I’ll have the fried rice as well as a bottle of wine."</br>
</br>
"Okay, sir." The waitress endured the arrogant attitude while writing the order before taking the menu away.</br>
</br>
It was not the first time she had encountered customers with a bad temper—arguing would only hurt her salary.</br>
</br>
"So slow," the man added a sentence, then watched the woman "tenderly".</br>
</br>
"Xinyan, you are so beautiful," the man said in a corny voice.</br>
</br>
The woman’s expression became delighted as her eyes narrowed pleasingly.</br>
</br>
"My shoes are dirty."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" The man thought he heard wrong.</br>
</br>
"Shoes."</br>
</br>
The woman lifted her boots up.</br>
</br>
A glimpse of awkwardness flashed across the man’s face, but then he gritted his teeth. With one knee on the ground, he lifted her boot up with one hand while the other used a napkin to carefully clean the dust off the top of the boot.</br>
</br>
</br>
Everyone around them turned their attention towards the duo—the female customers’ eyes lit up as they discussed with their boyfriend while the male customers all appeared contemptuous.</br>
</br>
But the man didn’t mind these gazes as he "caringly" wiped her shoes.</br>
</br>
"This is crazy."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head. Seeing his dog-like posture, Jiang Chen finally understood. The man was definitely an escort. He was definitely an escort without dignity…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lost his interest.</br>
</br>
He really didn’t want to bother with someone like this.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to retract his gaze, to his surprise, the woman was looking at him.</br>
</br>
The narrowed eyes completely neglected the man who was attentive to her, but rather, she looked at Jiang Chen with quite a curiosity, as if she was waiting for him to do something.</br>
</br>
As for the woman’s stare, Jiang Chen only smiled. He didn’t say much and looked away.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't have any reaction, the woman yawned and looked away in displeasure.</br>
</br>
The waitress walked over again as she expressed her apology to Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu. Jiang Chen didn't embarass her as he ordered with Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
When the waitress left, Jiang Chen took a sip of the lemon water and he asked softly,"Do you know him?"</br>
</br>
"… I do."</br>
</br>
From the tone, it seemed like the relationship was not a great one. Was he her enemy?</br>
</br>
Seeing that Xia Shiyu was not in the best mood, Jiang Chen didn’t pursue the topic any further and, instead, he chatted with her about other things as the smile began to come back.</br>
</br>
"Are you not curious about my relationship with him?" Xia Shiyu asked abruptly.</br>
</br>
"Although I am curious, you seem to hate this topic, so I didn’t ask," Jiang Chen replied with a shrug.</br>
</br>
After a brief two-second pause, Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen and spoke rather apathetically:</br>
</br>
"He is my ex-boyfriend."</br>
</br>
But, Jiang Chen didn’t show any reaction. Xia Shiyu felt a bit frustrated although she didn’t understand why. Just what kind of reaction from Jiang Chen would make her feel satisfied?</br>
</br>
"But we didn’t even hold hands," she added subconsciously.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard this, he suddenly started chuckling.</br>
</br>
She raised her furrowed eyebrows and asked in a low voice,"What are you laughing at?"</br>
</br>
"I just think you are cute," Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu immediate blushed, and the coldness on her face now seems forced.</br>
</br>
"So random," Xia Shiyu murmured to herself as she lowered her head, her cherry-like lips biting the straw on the ice cream and her bangs hiding her shaken eyes.</br>
</br>
While eating, Jiang Chen felt the need to use the washroom, so he excused himself to the washroom.</br>
</br>
There, he also washed his face, but when he came out, he met the "queen-like" woman.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, is that right?" the woman asked with a grin.</br>
</br>
"Do you know me?" He put his hands under the hand dryer as he looked rather surprised.</br>
</br>
"The renowned president of Future Technology, with a net worth of ten billion at the age of 22, and the fantasy of countless of girls. With such prominence, how would I not know you?" the woman stated.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, you are over complimenting me." At least the waitress, as well as the people he walked by, didn’t recognize him.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it had to do with his low profile appearances. Since he spent time in the apocalypse, even if media were waiting outside of his community, they still may not see him…</br>
</br>
For the people who occasionally read the news, they may know Jiang Chen’s name, but as for his appearance, they often have no idea.</br>
</br>
"What is your name, Miss?" Jiang asked nobly.</br>
</br>
The red lips turned into a beautiful curvature, her eyes under the curly hair had mischievousness hidden inside.</br>
</br>
"Wang Xinyan."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 223: Three Slaps</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Is it Wang Xinyan? Maybe you should restrain your boyfriend a little? At least make him not stand out as much." Jiang Chen smiled standing in front of her.</br>
</br>
"Boyfriend?" She suddenly started giggling but quickly returned to her elegant self. With a look of rumination, she looked at Jiang Chen. "Mr. Jiang is very humorous. That's not a boyfriend, it's more of a puppy."</br>
</br>
Stunned, Jiang Chen didn't think she would be so direct. He then ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"Even if it is a puppy, it's better to keep in control of him. Since sometimes, the puppy's behavior indirectly reflects the taste of the owner."</br>
</br>
For a man to attend to her this much, her identity must not be so simple.</br>
</br>
Although he was not afraid of anything, with the attitude of less trouble is better, Jiang Chen cautiously chose to leave her some ground.</br>
</br>
He only vaguely made fun of her to express his own displeasure.</br>
</br>
As if she has already expected Jiang Chen to say this, Wang Xinyan paused but didn't look angry. Instead, she seemed somewhat interested.</br>
</br>
"Oh? If Mr. Jiang doesn't like me having a puppy, I can let him go."</br>
</br>
"What does it have to do with me?"</br>
</br>
"Is that so?"</br>
</br>
She smiled mysteriously as she left an ambiguous answer. Wang Xinyan then passed him and entered the washroom.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watched her silhouette disappear, confused. But then he shook his head and walked away.</br>
</br>
When he returned to the restaurant, Jiang Chen discovered that his spot seemed to have been taken.</br>
</br>
That man in the white suit was sitting in his seat.</br>
</br>
Seeing this, he frowned. Though his expression was soon replaced by a stunning smile as he walked over.</br>
</br>
"I can't believe I am meeting you here, how have you been?"</br>
</br>
The comical expression on his face appeared as if he has accomplished something already.</br>
</br>
"I don't know you, go away," Xia Shiyu said coldly.</br>
</br>
"You are still icy." The man shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Are you not afraid the woman you are trying to suck up will see all of this? While she is going to the washroom, you are hitting on another woman. Just like your usual tendency, Xu Youcheng. Xia Shiyu's iciness soon changed into contempt.</br>
</br>
"Hitting on you? You really think you are worth hitting on? I'm saying hi to an old friend."</br>
</br>
"I don't remember having a friend like you."</br>
</br>
"The usual coldness. Looks like you have found a new boyfriend? So, did he touch your hand yet?" Xu Youcheng examined the coldness on her face.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu inhaled deeply, suppressed the anger in her heart, and said calmly.</br>
</br>
"I don't have a boyfriend. Not before, not now."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then how did you pay back the loan? I remember you lost your job, could it be…" Xu Youcheng slyly glanced at her chest. "Did you finally put down your proudness and got a sugar daddy? Damn …"</br>
</br>
"Do you think I'm like you?" Xia Shiyu emotionlessly interrupted his rude words. Raising her chin, she mouthed, "a sucker without dignity."</br>
</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng's face was flushed with anger as he stood up.</br>
</br>
"You-"</br>
</br>
But before he could say anything else, a hand was on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng paused, turned around, and was confronted with a smiling face.</br>
</br>
"I agree with the perspective of this lady. Also, who allowed you to sit in my seat." Jiang Chen smiled at him.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen, Xia Shiyu let out a breath as she felt calmer.</br>
</br>
"Funny, did you open this restaurant? What if I did sit here?" Anger soon overwhelmed Xu Youcheng as he argued back.</br>
</br>
Right after he finished his words, his mouth was slanted to the side.</br>
</br>
Slap!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen without saying anything slapped him with his backhand while still holding onto his shoulder with the other.</br>
</br>
"I don't own the restaurant, and your butt is on your body so wherever you sit is your freedom. But now that I don't like you, my hand is on my arm and how I beat you is also my freedom," Jiang Chen said with narrowed eyes.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's action, Xia Shiyu was utterly stunned.</br>
</br>
She didn't expect, Jiang Chen with such a gentle attitude would strike so fiercely.</br>
</br>
[Is it for me…]</br>
</br>
When she thought about it, a red hue began to cover her face.</br>
</br>
The slap took the air out of Xu Youcheng as he began to tremble. A strength equal to three times that of an ordinary person, even if Jiang Chen purposely controlled his power, it wasn't someone who only spent a few days in the gym could compare to.</br>
</br>
"F*ck you, you f*cking hit me?"</br>
</br>
Blood rushed to his head, as Xu Youcheng became hot-headed. He grabbed the knife on the table and stabbed toward Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Be careful!" Xia Shiyu screamed as her face lost its color.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen only laughed contemptuously, he didn't even bother to dodge as he waited for him to dash over.</br>
</br>
Funny, if this level of attack could hurt him, he could suicide by banging his head on the tofu. (1)</br>
</br>
The knife reached two inches in front of Jiang Chen. However, Jiang Chen didn't move as he easily clenched onto Xu Youcheng's wrist.</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng felt as if his hand was clamped by an iron claw. His face became bloated, and the vision in front of face changed before he dropped on the ground.</br>
</br>
The knife pierced the wooden floor two inches away from him.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyes widened, mouth opened, and her cold expression was changed entirely into shock.</br>
</br>
She never thought Jiang Chen had this type of ability.</br>
</br>
No…</br>
</br>
The night when she was blocked at the flower shop by the thugs.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen strolled in front of Xu Youcheng while seeing him whimpering on the ground, contorting his body together to hide.</br>
</br>
The customers on the side gulped as they wanted to intervene, but Jiang Chen only glanced at them before the idea vanished in their heads.</br>
</br>
Someone secretly called 911, but Jiang Chen didn't mind.</br>
</br>
While squatting on the ground, he dragged his gelled hair and smiled at him.</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen slapped him.</br>
</br>
Slap!</br>
</br>
"This one is for Xia Shiyu. Do you know that because you left your debt to her, she was almost forced into a private club by a bunch of thugs? She was your girlfriend, are you even human?'</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's words, the crowd all looked at the sharp looking Xu Youcheng with despise. No one felt compassion for him for getting beaten up. He deserved it!</br>
</br>
If he didn't happen to encounter that night.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen thought about it again, he felt an inexplicable rage.</br>
</br>
Slap!</br>
</br>
"This one is because I don't like you, you can think of the reason yourself!"</br>
</br>
After two slaps, blood began to drip out of Xu Youcheng's nose and mouth. Seeing that there might be a problem if he continued, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and stopped. Jiang Chen threw Xu Youcheng's head on the ground and stood up</br>
</br>
It was not the apocalypse, after all, he should be careful.</br>
</br>
In dizziness, it took him awhile to regain his clarity.</br>
</br>
On the ground, Xu Youcheng stared at Jiang Chen maliciously.</br>
</br>
"Just wait, I will make sure you can't stay in Wanghai City anymore."</br>
</br>
"I am waiting."</br>
</br>
"Do you know who I am?"</br>
</br>
"Someone selling his butt?" Jiang Chen took a napkin to wipe his hand and mocked</br>
</br>
"I am Linhua Group's-"</br>
</br>
But just then, a female voice diffused from not too far away mercilessly destroying his last hope.</br>
</br>
"You are not anymore."</br>
</br>
(1) When the action is less likely to hurt him than a piece of tofu.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 224"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 224: I don't like men</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The voice not only contained a hint of sluggishness, but also of contempt.</br>
</br>
"Xin... Xinyan?"</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng, lying on the ground, looked absentmindely at the woman not far away as he stammered with disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Linhua Group will not offend the head of Future Technology just because of you. What do you think? Mr. Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
With graceful steps, she walked beside Jiang Chen as she smiled at him.</br>
</br>
When Xu Youcheng heard the words "Future Technology" and "Jiang Chen," the color of his face immediately changed. He initially thought that the man dining with Xia Shiyu was just a small business owner with some money in his pockets, but he didn’t know it was the legendary Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Now that he looked closer, that man did look familiar.</br>
</br>
The original blanked expression turned completely into fear.</br>
</br>
The Linhua Group? This fact caught Jiang Chen by surprise. Speaking of which, he did receive Linhua Group’s invitation to attend that Wanghai economic forum. However, Jiang Chen didn’t answer Wang Xinyan’s question and, instead, he responded with a question of his own:</br>
</br>
"Although I don’t want to ridicule other people’s hobby, I really don’t understand. What’s so good about this despicable man who sold his girlfriend?"</br>
</br>
"Even despicable people have their uses. For example, I could give him the status and power he had always dreamt of, just to see what kind of fool he will turn himself into." Wang Xinyan squinted her eyes, her visage gruesome.</br>
</br>
"… This is crazy."</br>
</br>
Looking sympathetically at Xu Youcheng on the ground, Jiang Chen stepped over him and headed towards Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
The server and security personnel of Shimao began to surround the scene, but seeing that Jiang Chen’s identity wasn't so simple, no one dared to do anything to him, and they only helped the bruised Xu Youcheng up. They only controlled the situation while waiting for the police to arrive.</br>
</br>
"Xin, Xinyan, I-"</br>
</br>
"You can go fu*k off now, I am getting bored of your looks anyways," Wang Xinyan yawned.</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng broke loose from the security, dropping in front of Wang Xinyan’s boots as he begged without dignity, "I, I really do like you! Please, give me another chance!"</br>
</br>
"Did you really think you could get me to date you?" Wang Xinyan scoffed, "Sorry, I don’t like men."</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng was utterly dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
[Don’t like men? ]</br>
</br>
[ Then what about the effort I spent these past few days? ]</br>
</br>
As if he had lost all energy in his body, his bruised face twisted and Xu Youcheng looked as though he lost his soul, and both of his hands slumped on the ground.</br>
</br>
Back then, after leaving Xia Shiyu, Xu Youcheng drove the car that was purchased with Xia Shiyu’s identity to run away with the person he cheated her for. But then, the story after wasn’t as smooth as he expected. When he lost his "income," he quickly used up all his money. Since he didn't have any ability and only depended on her, he couldn’t find even a proper job. After an argument, he and the girlfriend who he had just met for less a month broke up.</br>
</br>
</br>
After a series of event, he became a server at a bar. Through one occasion, he was introduced to the escort industry; however, this profession was not a long-term solution. The rich ladies with too much money and nowhere to unleash their energy would not give him a promise. He tried to do "one last gig" to find a permanent ATM, finally locking his sights on to the daughter of the president of Linhua Group—Wang Xinyan.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Wang Xinyan didn’t brush him like away like a fly but, instead, gave him the opportunity to flatter her.</br>
</br>
However, he didn’t think that from the beginning to the very end, he was just a joke used for amusement, unable to touch her hand and just there to wipe her shoes…</br>
</br>
Wang Xinyan’s contemptuous smile looked down at the wounded Xu Youcheng, and the smile soon turned into a delighted one.</br>
</br>
....</br>
</br>
[ This feeling is fantastic .]</br>
</br>
"Sorry, the one time I invited you to dinner, the mood was ruined by a fly. I’ll make it up to you next time?" Jiang Chen sat in front of Xia Shiyu as he said apologetically.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu’s face blushed, and she whispered, "No, it’s my problem."</br>
</br>
Just then, the chubby boss with glasses walked over. Looking at the knife marks on the ground, along with the crowd, he had a troubled smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"It is better to resolve things through peace, why use violence? Both look like people of importance, why fight?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen obviously saw the boss's intention in his eyes, so he took out a credit card from his pocket and threw it in the boss's lap.</br>
</br>
"One million, renovation of the restaurant, on me."</br>
</br>
The boss was first shocked, but then his face became ecstatic.</br>
</br>
A voice spoke up, "There is no need for Mr. Jiang to spend money, Xiuyu Garden’s loss will be covered by Shimao. Manager Chen, return the card to Mr. Jiang?"</br>
</br>
"Mi…Miss?" A cold sweat rolled off of Chen Anmin’s forehead. He just realized that the woman standing in front of the store was President Wang’s daughter, Wang Xinyan.</br>
</br>
Shimao was a property of Linhua Group. A small business owner like him definitely did not have the courage to say no to the president’s daughter.</br>
</br>
Chen Anmin forced a laugh as he put the card on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Wang Xinyan speechlessly, and she was blinking at him mischievously.</br>
</br>
Her eyes seemed to be saying, "You owe me one."</br>
</br>
This favor was indeed cheap… Jiang Chen mocked at the thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
One million was really nothing to him.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Because someone called the police at the beginning of the conflict, the police quickly arrived at the store.</br>
</br>
Xu Youcheng, who lost his "ATM", in despair, blamed all the "unfortunate events" on Jiang Chen. Facing the police, he "not understandingly" insisted that Jiang Chen beat him to this point as he demanded the police to punish Jiang Chen. He also said he will sue Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Wang Xinyan could not help but facepalm herself due to his intelligence level, and she then grabbed out her phone in annoyance and called her cousin, after which she gave Jiang Chen an apologetic look.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn’t mind as he had a mischievous smile.</br>
</br>
In this case, the wisest thing Xu Youcheng could have done would be to say that he bumped on the ground himself and settles with Jiang Chen privately. Perhaps he would have even received a large sum.</br>
</br>
But now…</br>
</br>
Funny, would Jiang Chen be afraid of him suing?</br>
</br>
The video showed that it was, indeed, Jiang Chen who struck first. But it was not a problem, especially when Wang Zhiyong personally ran over to the police department.</br>
</br>
Because of Xu Youcheng’s insistent stubbornness, following the procedure, Jiang Chen had to go to the police department to give testimonies, and then accept a negotiation of settlement.</br>
</br>
That’s right, negotiation of settlement.</br>
</br>
After communicating with their superior, the police selectively ignored the bruise on Xu Youcheng’s face, and instead, they determined the event to be a civil dispute. They then began to explain to Xu Youcheng his act of aggression through the eyes of the law, saying he provoked Jiang Chen; therefore, who started the fight first would not matter. Furthermore, he had used a knife, which would void any claims of self-defense due to its excessive nature.</br>
</br>
After a long spiel, Jiang Chen—who was bored already—left, and the defeated Xu Youcheng was still sitting on the chair, listening to the educating officers as he experienced the unjustness of society.</br>
</br>
Accompanying Jiang Chen out of the police department, Wang Zhiyong conscientiously sat in the driver's seat of Maybach as he asked with a bitter smile, "How did you get involved with that little devil?"</br>
</br>
[ Little devil? ]</br>
</br>
"Do you know Wang Xinyan?" Jiang Chen’s expression was also odd.</br>
</br>
"My cousin." After starting the car, Wang Zhiyong said, "Speaking of this, where is your girlfriend?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, that is not my girlfriend, only female friend… I asked her to go back first."</br>
</br>
Wang Zhiyong chuckled as he looked dubiously at Jiang Chen while he drove on the road.</br>
</br>
"I know."</br>
</br>
"Don’t be so sick minded." Jiang Chen was facepalming.</br>
</br>
"Also, I need to tell you something," Wang Zhiyong suddenly used a more serious tone as he said to Jiang Chen, "This is the advice from a friend, be careful of that woman, Wang Xinyan, and don’t get too close to her."</br>
</br>
"Oh? Is there a problem with her?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Problem? She is a psycho," Wang Zhiyong cursed out.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 225"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 225: Confusion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Psycho?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was peculiar.</br>
</br>
By Wang Zhiyong's tone, he didn't seem to have a good relationship with his cousin.</br>
</br>
But this was not the key point. The key point was, Wang Xinyan is Wang Zhiyong's cousin?</br>
</br>
Therefore, one of the top companies in Wanghai city, the president of Linhua Group Wang Linhua, is the brother of the General Secretary of Wanghai city, Wang Dehai? That was a big discovery.</br>
</br>
But when Jiang Chen thought this through, he was at ease.</br>
</br>
For business in the real estate industry, all had to have some form of connection with the government. Buying land, acquiring projects, passing quality assurance, the government is involved in every step of the way. Without any background, regardless of how profitable the real estate industry is, it would be hard to make money.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't think that Linhua Group's connections were this strong.</br>
</br>
"Psycho?" Jiang Chen used a casual tone to ask.</br>
</br>
"That's right." With a cigarette in his mouth, Wang Zhiyong scorned. "A little bit when she was young, then it turned serious when she got older. Who knew what happened to her, but personality-wise she has changed to this."</br>
</br>
"Naughty?' Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Because Wang Zhiyong was her cousin, Jiang Chen used a light tone when describing her.</br>
</br>
"Naughty?" Wang Zhiyong glanced at Jiang Chen. "You underestimate her. She just purely enjoys the misery of people."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was shocked, but then a nonchalant smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Whatever, they just happen to encounter each other.</br>
</br>
"Also," Wang Zhiyong abruptly spoke out, "Did you receive the invitation?"</br>
</br>
"Invitation?"</br>
</br>
"Wanghai Economic Forum."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, Linhua Group did send me an invitation, is there a problem?" Jiang Chen felt lost.</br>
</br>
Wang Zhiyong hesitated for a moment as if he wanted to say something, but then he shook his head.</br>
</br>
"It's fine, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyebrows furrowed slightly as he sensed something odd. But seeing that Wang Zhiyong didn't want to say anything more, he didn't ask further.</br>
</br>
In the time remaining, they just joked around as they didn't mention business anymore.</br>
</br>
He listened to Wang Zhiyong talk about the fun things that happened in the military. Finally, the car drove into a community and parked in front of a house.</br>
</br>
"Have dinner with us?" Wang Zhiyong invited Jiang Chen while chuckling.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I already ate," Jiang Chen opened the driver door as he thanked him for his invitation.</br>
</br>
After departing from Wang Zhiyong's place, Jiang Chen started the car again and drove to his mansion located in Songjiang.</br>
</br>
When he returned at home, it was already pitch black outside. He looked at the time as it was already nine in the evening.</br>
</br>
He parked the car inside the garage and rubbed Ayesha's head, who waiting at the door with a smile. Jiang Chen then went to take a shower.</br>
</br>
</br>
After the shower, he changed into a comfy robe. He drank some hot milk and rested for a while, before going to the kitchen and throwing two boxes of mango pudding into the storage dimension. Finally, he walked to the bedroom.</br>
</br>
In front of the bedroom door, he saw Ayesha in a black night dress. Her curled brown hair was covered by droplets of water and tied into a ponytail with white lace.</br>
</br>
From the white steam on her head, she just took a shower and dressed herself up.</br>
</br>
"Can we sleep together?" Ayesha's face was flushed, her tender eyes filled with love.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, probably can't tonight. I need to go back to the other side," Jiang Chen said apologetically.</br>
</br>
He must go back to the apocalypse tonight to give the sample chip and USB to Yaoyao and then ask Sun Jiao about the movements of Seventh Area to determine the next steps for the base. Sun Jiao would not let him go back this late…</br>
</br>
Although slightly disappointed, Ayesha still nodded her head empathetically.</br>
</br>
Seeing the slight pout, Jiang Chen smiled lovingly. He rubbed her wet hair and put his forehead against hers.</br>
</br>
"Tomorrow morning, I will wake you up."</br>
</br>
Ayesha's face became hot as she nodded shyly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen kissed her pale and soft forehead, before walking out of the bedroom and closing the door.</br>
</br>
He inhaled, closed his eyes, and started the interdimensional travel.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When he opened his eyes again, the beautifully decorated wall was replaced by a wall with visible cracks.</br>
</br>
He breathed out the air from the modern world and immediately headed out of the room.</br>
</br>
Before finding Yaoyao, Jiang Chen decided to go to Lin Lin's lab to bring her the mango pudding she wanted.</br>
</br>
"Eh? You are back already." Surprised by Jiang Chen's presence, Lin Lin put the test tube in her hand on the test rack.</br>
</br>
"I will head back immediately." Jiang Chen took out the two mango puddings and put it on her table. "Your puddings."</br>
</br>
Seeing the mango pudding, Lin Lin's eyes immediately turned into pudding as she snatched the box and hugged it joyfully.</br>
</br>
Seeing her joyful look, Jiang Chen couldn't help but smile.</br>
</br>
"Don't overeat at night, take care of your stomach."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry! I am a digitalized human!" Lin Lin clenched her fist as she said proudly.</br>
</br>
"Then do what you want. Freeze the rest in the fridge, it tastes better cold," Jiang Chen turned around as he finished speaking.</br>
</br>
"Wait."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin suddenly jumped down to the ground, ran to the door, and dragged onto Jiang Chen's shirt.</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Jiang Chen turned around looking at Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
"Hmm, thank you…" It was rare for this girl expressed her gratitude. She also didn't say her usual foolish words like "The offering you have is making me pleased."</br>
</br>
Looking at the coy Lin Lin, Jiang Chen was unsure of how to react.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about it."</br>
</br>
"Are you here just to give me the mango pudding?" With a blushing face, Lin Lin said shyly.</br>
</br>
Her expression seemed to be anticipating a specific answer.</br>
</br>
With eyebrows raised, a smirk irrepressibly appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, I am back to give a USB to Yaoyao."</br>
</br>
"QQ!"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's eyebrows twisted in disappointment. She put up her fist and fiercely punched Jiang Chen in the chest, then she stomped on her slippers and ran back to the room, slamming her door in a fit.</br>
</br>
With the wooden door shut, Jiang Chen still tried to muffle his laughter.</br>
</br>
Finally a chance to bully Lin Lin once again. It was surprisingly fun.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then shook his head and walked upstairs.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 226: I only need two hours</br>
</div></br>
Jiang Chen stood outside of Yaoyao's room, and he gently knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
Knock knock.</br>
</br>
"Yaoyao, are you there?" Jiang Chen spoke softly.</br>
</br>
It was a bit past ten already, he was not sure if Yaoyao had slept already.</br>
</br>
"Ah, Brother Jiang Chen? Coming!" The loli's surprise and joyful voice transmitted from the other side of the door, then immediately followed the sound of cotton slippers on the ground.</br>
</br>
The door was pulled open. Yaoyao's head peaked out as she looked at Jiang Chen in excitement.</br>
</br>
"Are you back already?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, although I have to go back tomorrow." Seeing her adorable face, Jiang Chen couldn't help but rub her hair.</br>
</br>
With her head raised, her narrowed eyes enjoyed the caress of the firm hand on her head as adorable sounds came out of her throat.</br>
</br>
"Are you going to sleep soon?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! But since Brother Jiang Chen is here, I can sleep later." She timidly played with her nightgown as she said with a blushed face.</br>
</br>
"It won't take too long. I only have a favor to ask Yaoyao, is that okay?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen had a favor to ask, Yaoyao's adorable eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
She immediately nodded and raised her head, and patted her chest to assure him. "Mhmm! I got it!"</br>
</br>
"Then I'll have to count on you. Regarding the specifics, can I come in? I need to use the computer."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen entered the room.</br>
</br>
The room was filled with a fragrance similar to lilies. Thinking that it might be the natural odor of Yaoyao, Jiang Chen's face turned red. But Yaoyao didn't notice the unnatural look on Jiang Chen's face as she ran to her table in excitement, sat on the chair, and turned on the computer.</br>
</br>
She kicked off her slippers as her legs dangled joyfully.</br>
</br>
The unguarded position was somewhat dangerous.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gulped as he muttered to himself "I am not a loli lover". Then he walked beside Yaoyao, put the briefcase down, and took out a USB and a chip from inside.</br>
</br>
"The requirements of the program are inside the USB. Basically, it is to design an artificial intelligence software that is compatible with the autonomous driving control chip. You don't have to make the program very powerful as long as the chip can operate, can you do that?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, Yaoyao's computer skills are great." Yaoyao inserted the USB into the computer, hummed a song, and her fingers began to type rapidly on the control board.</br>
</br>
Lines of code Jiang Chen didn't understand flashed in front of his eyes. The outdated data inside the USB was easily converted to a language that the computer in the apocalypse could understand.</br>
</br>
"Hmmm, it is not too difficult." Yaoyao carefully read through the requirements line by line, and nodded her head.</br>
</br>
"How long would you need?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Around two hours," With a finger on her chin, Yaoyao said after she had given it some thought.</br>
</br>
</br>
But the response of only needing two hours shocked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, how, how long?"</br>
</br>
"Umm? Two hours is enough. Since sister Sun Jiao already copied the entire database in the city library, this type of outdated technology would usually be stored as a form of an archive in the digital library. As long as the software with the highest compatibility is selected, some modifications can be done before it is good to go." Yaoyao tilted her head as she confusedly looked at the stunned Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"... This is insane." Not knowing how to express his astonishment in his mind, the shocked Jiang Chen only managed to say this one statement.</br>
</br>
A project that Dalmer Corporation expected to take five months to complete, Yaoyao said she could finish it in two hours. If they knew about this, what kind of interesting expression would appear on their faces?</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen say this, Yaoyao nodded. Then she inserted the chip into the multifunction slot and began to work.</br>
</br>
"Are you going to start now? Aren't you going to sleep?" Seeing that Yaoyao began to work, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Woo? It's only ten, so it is not too late. Since brother will go back tomorrow, I, I want to finish it soon and help brother out." Yaoyao's face began to burn as she timidly lowered her head.</br>
</br>
The pure sentence along with Yaoyao's adorable look made Jiang Chen feel his heart warm. Overwhelmed with emotions, he hugged Yaoyao's frail figure from the back.</br>
</br>
"Wa." The slightly frantic shout echoed beside his ear.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, you are helping me a lot... Yaoyao is working very hard." Sensing the warmness, Jiang Chen sincerely thanked her.</br>
</br>
Other than the popular &lt;New Era&gt; game, the applications inside the base, whether it was production or management were all creations of Yaoyao. But the timid loli never said anything. She only diligently worked and contributed to his success.</br>
</br>
Feeling the warm hug, as well as the praise she had been waiting for, Yaoyao's face was red and her tender mouth curled up in joy.</br>
</br>
"Hehe... No need to thank me. Yaoyao is brother's, so, it is my duty to help you."</br>
</br>
"Do you want any rewards? I haven't been rewarding you properly," Jiang Chen said guiltily.</br>
</br>
"Any kind of reward?" Yaoyao buried her head shyly, she blankly stared at her feet dangling as she murmured.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
When she received the confirmation, the red hue moved from her face to the tip of her ears.</br>
</br>
With lips bitten, she exhaled several times before she finally worked up the courage.</br>
</br>
"Last birthday... At night, could you hug me while I sleep?" Yaoyao wanted to say the thing that they didn't get to finish last time, but because of her shyness, she changed her words mid-sentence.</br>
</br>
"Uh?"</br>
</br>
As if she had sensed Jiang Chen's hesitation, Yaoyao carefully added, "You said anything is okay... Don't worry, Yaoyao has been taking a shower every night, I smell good. Yaoyao is also light and gentle when sleeping, I can be a soft pillow..."</br>
</br>
Her anxious explanation made it seem as if Jiang Chen was going to take back his promise.</br>
</br>
Looking at Yaoyao's hopeful expression, Jiang Chen gulped. He could not say no to such a cute expression. Therefore he nodded.</br>
</br>
A joyful smiled emerged on Yaoyao's face.</br>
</br>
The smile was mixed with happiness, as well as a hint of shyness.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, I'm so happy... Mhmm! Yaoyao will begin to work. Brother, you can go sleep, Yaoyao will be done soon."</br>
</br>
"Do you not need me to accompany you?" Jiang Chen rubbed her head.</br>
</br>
"No, No need. That will be really boring..." Yaoyao said slightly embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't insist.</br>
</br>
He walked to the bed, looked at the pink sheets as he awkwardly scratched his head.</br>
</br>
But when he thought about Yaoyao's hopeful expression, Jiang Chen gulped and with trembling fingers slowly lifted up the sheet and lied down.</br>
</br>
He nose was tingled by the faint aroma.</br>
</br>
Although he couldn't quite tell what the smell was, it smelt good.</br>
</br>
Under the sheets, Jiang Chen could smell her pureness. It was an intoxicating feeling.</br>
</br>
But this feeling didn't manage to last long.</br>
</br>
Because it was too comfortable, Jiang Chen's began to lose his consciousness, he yawned before quickly falling asleep.</br>
</br>
After typing up the last line of code, Yaoyao stretched her body. Then she timidly looked at the direction of the bed.</br>
</br>
Thinking that her love was sleeping in her bed, an indescribable joy and timid feeling rose in her heart.</br>
</br>
Yaoyao gulped as she put on her bunny slippers carefully and walked to the door to turn off the light. Then she sneaked to the side of the bed.</br>
</br>
Her heart was beating fast as if it was going to jump out of her chest.</br>
</br>
"Woo, fell asleep?" Seeing that Jiang Chen had already drifted to sleep, Yaoyao pouted her mouth in slight disappointment.</br>
</br>
But for some reason, she felt relieved and more at ease.</br>
</br>
It was a complex feeling.</br>
</br>
Already hitting puberty, she desired the mysterious but forbidden kind of feeling. At the same time, she felt unsettled by the idea.</br>
</br>
[Could it be that I am still not ready?]</br>
</br>
Yaoyao didn't understand her feeling.</br>
</br>
With a hand on her chin, under the pristine moonlight, Yaoyao pouted her mouth as she carefully observed Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Listening to his rhythmic breathing, a sweet smile appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Wooo, of course, let's maintain our current state. Since brother already felt asleep..." She hummed to herself in a quiet voice before she sneaked into bed.</br>
</br>
She pecked Jiang Chen's lips as a soft smile emerged on Yaoyao's face.</br>
</br>
With this tiny bit of happiness, Yaoyao moved closer to his warm chest, adjusting herself to be in a comfortable position before closing her eyes.</br>
</br>
Her breathing began to turn rhythmic and gentle.</br>
</br>
Yaoyao's crescent-shaped mouth revealed her happiness.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 227: The Mist</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, a streak of faint morning light poured into the room through the window.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen yawned unhurriedly as he opened his sleepy eyes and gaze through the window.</br>
</br>
Such a rare scene, the outside was actually sunny. The insulated window blocked all the coldness outside, so it was warm like the spring inside the room. If it wasn't for the snow, watching the bright sun, he almost felt like he slept all the way through the start of spring.</br>
</br>
A faint, warm breath fluttered on his chest, Jiang Chen looked down and found Yaoyao all curled up on top of his chest.</br>
</br>
Like a small rabbit, she slept peacefully. Her breathing rose and fell rhythmically. Her eyelashes quivered along with her breath as she cast off the angel-like vibe in the bright sunlight. Even in her sleep, her lips formed in a sweet smile.</br>
</br>
Gently sweeping her bangs to the side, Jiang Chen kissed her on top of her smooth forehead, and then he sneaked out of bed.</br>
</br>
He picked up the already completed USB and chip from the table, and then he quietly left the room and closed the door.</br>
</br>
It was only six o'clock in the morning, but based on Jiang Chen's understanding of Sun Jiao, she should already be up and about.</br>
</br>
He was supposed to find her last night, but Yaoyao's expectant eyes made him stay the night.</br>
</br>
While heading towards the third floor of the mansion, Jiang Chen heard the gunshots coming from the training room from a distance.</br>
</br>
"You're up so early as usual." Pushing the door open, Jiang Chen spotted Sun Jiao in combat gears shooting at targets.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm? You're back?" Turning around, Sun Jiao wore a surprised smile.</br>
</br>
Throwing the pistol in the case, Sun Jiao excitedly jumped in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Have you finished everything on the other side?"</br>
</br>
"Not yet but I'm worried about this side, so I came back to check things out."</br>
</br>
"You're worrying now that we have the communication chip? If there's anything urgent, I will inform you."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin shared the video that she and Jiang Chen had recorded with Sun Jiao and Yaoyao. Yaoyao's reaction was somewhat blasé since she did live in a more prosperous pre-war life for 12 years. Seeing the "ancient era," other than envy, she also felt melancholic.</br>
</br>
But Sun Jiao, who hadn't seen a civilized society before, almost had her face plastered on the screen.</br>
</br>
For her, the other side was the embodiment of a fairy tale</br>
</br>
"It would be too late if something really happens. Has the Seventh area taken any action yet?"</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's posture turned rigid upon hearing Jiang Chen's question.</br>
</br>
"The mutated humans have yet to make a move. The defense on the east of Zhufeng highway has been established, with the 10 Tigers and 200 soldiers being stationed there."</br>
</br>
Nodding, Jiang Chen pondered on it for a moment before continuing, "What about the Defender in Jia City?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Hearing that, a troubled smile flitted across Sun Jiao's face.</br>
</br>
"Not even a reaction. Not a single news at all."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had exchanged a communication channel with Lin Chaoen at the Bullet Shell tavern at the Sixth Street last time. The first few times, Jiang Chen could still reach the general of the Defender Alliance in Jia City, but as soon as winter came, they seemed to have disappeared all the sudden. All communication with the Fishbone Base had come to a halt.</br>
</br>
Did they get wiped out? Or was it another type of accident?</br>
</br>
Frowning, Jiang Chen had a vague feeling that something was off but could not pinpoint what exactly it was.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou was captured, but there was no reaction from Dusk at all.</br>
</br>
The mutated human's front posts were destroyed twice, but their reaction was also somewhat abnormal.</br>
</br>
Could it be since their plans were foiled, they were at a loss on what to do?</br>
</br>
But rather than optimistically thinking that the threats had been eliminated, Jiang Chen was more inclined to believe in another possibility—that they were planning a massive conspiracy. The silence now was to endure through this period of time.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, did Sun Xiaorou's condition get...better?" Jiang Chen asked, somewhat awkwardly.</br>
</br>
"She's better now." Sun Jiao's expression looked despondent at the mention of her sister.</br>
</br>
She would spend most of her time everyday with her sister and attempt to wake up the personality in Sun Xiaorou's body, and make the devout believer of an occult slumber for eternity.</br>
</br>
However, it was extremely difficult.</br>
</br>
In the face of psychological issues, she really had no way of dealing with it.</br>
</br>
"It'll get better." Seeing the despair on Sun Jiao's face, Jiang Chen embraced and comforted her.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao nodded and leaned her head on Jiang Chen's shoulder.</br>
</br>
Just like this, silence perpetuated for a while and was broken when Sun Jiao suddenly asked, "How are you doing on the other side?"</br>
</br>
"Me?" Jiang Chen paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I haven't asked you about the other side, so can you talk to me about it?" Whenever the other world was mentioned, Sun Jiao's eyes lit up with anticipation.</br>
</br>
"There's nothing special about…it's probably the exact opposite of this place. A mouse is only the size of a fist, and a cockroach is just as big as your thumb. There are no mutants, the street is littered with all kinds of people, and there is an endless number of stores that are filled with fun and delicious things…It's hard to explain with just words, so I will just have to take you there when there's an opportunity." Jiang Chen scratched his face.</br>
</br>
"Woo, I'm envious of you for being born in heaven." Sun Jiao pouted.</br>
</br>
"It's not as good as you think. Compared to here, yes, but it's not exactly a heaven. There are people who are extremely rich, and some people are so poor they don't have a place that belongs to themselves, and they would have to depend on other's goodwill to be able to rent a place."</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Jiang Chen became the former from the latter.</br>
</br>
"Rent?" Sun Jiao raised her eyebrows.</br>
</br>
She could not wrap her head around what Jiang Chen had just told her. The things that the wasteland didn't lack were concrete and steel buildings, so she couldn't imagine why it would be so valuable.</br>
</br>
If she got tired, she could find any building and could just place a trip mine on the stairs to sleep.</br>
</br>
"Before the war, a house is considered a luxury. Just like the mansion where we currently reside at, if it was before the war, it would cost millions… You can think of it as millions of crystals."</br>
</br>
"Woah, so expensive." Sun Jiao was astonished.</br>
</br>
"So don't think that the other side is perfect, lest you'll end up being disappointed." Jiang Chen tousled Sun Jiao's silky hair.</br>
</br>
Just then, Sun Jiao suddenly asked, "Which side do you like better?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the serious expression on Sun Jiao's face, Jiang Chen took a moment to think.</br>
</br>
He then gave an answer that even shocked himself.</br>
</br>
"Probably…this side, or at least for now."</br>
</br>
In the modern world, he was just a billionaire. Even as the president of a multibillion-dollar company, he was just a wealthy person.</br>
</br>
With the growth of Future Technology, he gradually become embroiled in the vested interest of other people.</br>
</br>
Precisely because of the secrets he had to protect, Jiang Chen's development had to be carefully measured, and he had to control the speed of his improvement. Despite possessing copious amounts of astonishing innovations, he could not easily bring it out in the open.</br>
</br>
Innovation like virtual reality MMORPG, Du Yongkong had already developed it. The headset version virtual reality gear could be produced in the Sixth Street, however, bringing it out in the modern world would be no different to committing suicide.</br>
</br>
In the apocalypse, however, he was the commander of a force. After becoming the general of the Sixth Street, there was no organization in the entire Wanghai City that could force him to hide his growth.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the development in the modern world should be hastened?</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 228: The Dinner of the Elites</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After bidding Sun Jiao goodbye, Jiang Chen returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
It was around eight in the morning, thinking of the promise he made with Ayesha last night, Jiang Chen's face broke into a smile.</br>
</br>
After preparing breakfast and putting it into the microwave, Jiang Chen took a shower before he entered Ayesha's room, smirking all the while.</br>
</br>
When the two came out of the room, it was already ten o'clock.</br>
</br>
"I shouldn't have prepared breakfast had I known it'd be lunchtime soon," Jiang Chen uttered in disappointment as he removed the bread and poached egg from the microwave.</br>
</br>
"It's okay. Just put it in the fridge, and we'll eat it tomorrow," face still blushing furiously, Ayesha muttered and took the plate out of Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
After putting the plate in the refrigerator, Ayesha started preparing lunch while wearing an apron.</br>
</br>
Looking at Ayesha's profile, Jiang Chen was enamored by the scene.</br>
</br>
The loose brown curls reflected a golden streak in the sun. Beneath it was a gentle and serene face, and with the elegant apron, she resembled a newly married wife.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Ayesha seemed to have sensed Jiang Chen's gaze because she slightly tilted her head and looked up.</br>
</br>
"Uh, nothing, just thinking how beautiful you are." Jiang Chen scratched his cheek.</br>
</br>
Face blushing, Ayesha lowered her head shyly and started cutting the meat.</br>
</br>
Lunch was roasted beef and borsch with steamed rice, a combination of western and oriental cuisine.</br>
</br>
When the two finished their lunch, it was already twelve o'clock. After cleaning up the dishes, Ayesha, as part of her usual routine, she headed to the gym to complete today's virtual reality training content. Jiang Chen rested a bit more on the sofa, and then went out of the door and drove to the metropolis.</br>
</br>
Tonight he was going to attend the Wanghai Business Forum. Jiang Chen, who had not always been confident in his own style, wisely decided to leave the task to the professionals to deal with. Although what's inside was more important, it was also necessary for the look to reflect that.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen allowed the cold but gentle hands to fiddle with his face and hair for a while before coming out of the high-end style studio feeling refreshed. Although his hair was still short hair, he felt sleeker.</br>
</br>
Then he headed to the mall to buy a few sets of formal suits. Although he didn't know which attire would be most appropriate for the event tonight, the best choice would be to buy the most expensive one!</br>
</br>
After throwing the tens of thousands worth of formal suits on the counter, Jiang Chen, in front of the cashier whose eyes had already turned into glittering stars, swiped his card without blinking.</br>
</br>
It was already three o'clock when he was done with everything.</br>
</br>
Seeing that there was still some time to spare, Jiang Chen went to a Starbucks and ordered a cup coffee before he started fiddling with his phone.</br>
</br>
</br>
When it was about five o'clock, Jiang Chen drove to the venue where the party would be held, Linhua Hotel.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
One could see the elegance of the beautifully designed building just by looking at its appearance. Marble and red brick were the main materials used, which gave a touch modern simplicity combined with the elegance of classic beauty.</br>
</br>
Linhua Hotel—an embellished sign with huge neon letters.</br>
</br>
The parking lot was almost like a luxury car dealership. He actually saw no less than two or three of Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce, etc. So that his car Maybach S600 being parked there looked inconspicuous.</br>
</br>
When he parked the car, following the direction of the valet, he was ushered to the front of the hotel. After flashing his invitation, he then entered the hotel along with those well-dressed elites.</br>
</br>
Although it was a fancy banquet, in the end, it was still hosted by locals. Jiang Chen didn't get to see some famous people and could not recognize most attendees.</br>
</br>
But he didn't look down on the party because of it. While they may not appear in the media, it did not mean they could not do so. Sometimes the more low-key the people were, the more powerful they truly were.</br>
</br>
When he entered the hotel, he distinctly noticed a lot of people staring at him.</br>
</br>
In this regard, Jiang Chen did not appear to be the least bit anxious, After all, it was not the first time he would be participating in a gathering this level. When he was in Sanya, he attended a birthday dinner hosted by the hospitable prince of Arabia for his princess. Although the birthday party was more private and informal than the business forum, the process was, in fact, roughly similar.</br>
</br>
After the host delivered all kinds of ceremonial speech, the business elites naturally formed themselves into a small clique and exchanged ideas with those they were interested in.</br>
</br>
Because he was not good at this kind of things, Jiang Chen deliberately picked a secluded spot in the corner of the hall and started enjoying the delicious food.</br>
</br>
While he did consider using this opportunity to get acquainted with some business associates, but he was somewhat unable to get started after arriving here. Most of the active participants here were not a first-timer in this kind of event. As such, a number of people in the circle were familiar with each other. It was undoubtedly difficult for some newcomers like Jiang Chen to mingle with this clique.</br>
</br>
But he had clearly underestimated his presence in the technology sector because who would actually cast a delicious morsel of cake aside?</br>
</br>
The profitability of Future Technology did make people green with envy, but for those who could take part in the event of this caliber, how many were actually short-sighted? Ignoring Jiang Chen because of jealousy, only a philistine would do that.</br>
</br>
He hadn't sat for long before a middle-aged man sat beside him with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang is young and promising but doesn't show off in public. It's really rare at this age. Ah, I can't help but grow admiration for you even I were to be in 70s."</br>
</br>
"Nah," despite feeling proud inside, Jiang Chen still humbly acknowledged the compliment, and then asked, "and you are?"</br>
</br>
Though the person looked familiar, Jiang Chen was still unable to remember where he had seen him.</br>
</br>
"I'm Zhou Hongwei." Zhou Hongwei smiled.</br>
</br>
Isn't that the president of 361 Corporation, Zhou Hongwei? It made Jiang Chen somewhat shocked.</br>
</br>
"So it's Mr. Zhou, I apologize for not realizing it sooner." Not even recognizing his own strategic partner was a bit embarrassing.</br>
</br>
With the advent of a social media platform, Future Technology and other communication technologies like Penguin naturally stood on the opposite side. In particular, the impact of Future 1.0 on Wechat, which caused a drastic decrease in their users, had naturally earned Penguin's displeasure. Because of this, Future Technology was removed from all channels by Penguin, but it did little to Future Technology as they had already occupied the user group.</br>
</br>
The competitor's adversary would naturally band together. Most especially after the Lingyu Technology's incident, towards 361 Corporation's gesture of goodwill to Jiang Chen, Future Technology would naturally take the same initiative as the 361 Corporation. Both parties used Chenfeng Entertainment as a joint venture platform to form a tight relationship in the mobile gaming sector, focusing on low and mid-end games with short development cycles. 361 Corporation being the main developer while Future Technology was responsible for the channel. It can be said that this was the honeymoon period of cooperation between the two sides.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I'm already over 40 years old with an average-looking face, so even if I went on CTV, no one would remember me." Zhou Hongwei quipped good-naturedly, which cleverly resolved the awkwardness, then he began chatting with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When two Internet giants sat together, it would naturally attract a lot of people in the "same circle" to join their conversation. Without him knowing, Jiang Chen was equally surprised to realize that the quiet spot he had chosen for himself had somehow become the center of the forum.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen had somehow underestimated intricacies this business forum. If he had given it more thoughts, there were just few hundred companies with over 10 billion market value in the entire China. Now this Wanghai Business Forum, though the requirement was high, it was not as extreme as he initially thought.</br>
</br>
It could be even be said that in this entire venue, he and Zhou Hongwei could be considered to stand at the top of the pyramid. On the other hand, Zhou Hongwei only possessed 14% share in 361 Corporation, but Jiang Chen had an unbelievable 99% share in Future Technology. From this perspective, while both companies had a market value of 10 billion, Jiang Chen's "worth" had overwhelmed Zhou Hongwei.</br>
</br>
Other than the internet giants, the rest were mid-sized companies with good profitability and future prospects. While they probably have billions in assets, there was still a noticeable gap compared to Jiang Chen's assets.</br>
</br>
As such, there were quite a number of people who used all sort of methods in an attempt to establish a connection with him. Especially considering he was still a bachelor, the big bosses with daughters, regardless whether their daughter had a boyfriend or not, began to talk marriage with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Mr. Jiang is 22 this year, my princess is 21. Would Jiang Chen be interested in meeting her?"</br>
</br>
"No wonder Mr. Jiang Chen is capable of gracing the headline twice on Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jiang is indeed a talented person and gives face to his own country!"</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Jiang interested in a partnership? Our company had recently developed an O2O takeout software, considering Future 1.0 traffic, we can definitely..."</br>
</br>
Networking, fawning, and partnership.</br>
</br>
To be honest, his vanity was satisfied while looking at a group of rich people formed a circle around him as the center. Jiang Chen naturally responded to everyone's friendliness and listened to their business proposals.</br>
</br>
As for those seeking to arrange marriage, Jiang Chen chose to politely ignore them.</br>
</br>
In this relaxed atmosphere, halfway through the party, a familiar voice floated through Jiang Chen's ears just as he was about to start eating.</br>
</br>
"Hello Mr. Jiang, we meet again."</br>

To host this gathering, Linhua Group had certainly made an all-out effort. Not only was the food impeccable, the guests had also been given meticulous attention.</br>
</br>
When the party was halfway through, a sound of music began to play in the venue. In the center of the circular hall, the Chinese music circle goddess, Zhang Hui, was singing, the melodious and soft music revibrating in the hall. Clapping sound erupted as the music faded.</br>
</br>
To be able to invite a celebrity of this caliber to be part of this gathering showed the influence of Wang Linhua.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the atmosphere of the party has come to a peak, the host of the gathering took out the microphone. He first expressed his gratitude to Zhang Hui for her performance and to all the guests for coming to the event before announcing the next part of the celebration.</br>
</br>
The servers pushing the food carts entered the hall as they began to serve exquisite meals. Musical performance started playing from the center of the hall. The guests, exhausted from chatting, started enjoying their dinner.</br>
</br>
"Hello Mr. Jiang, we meet again." Wang Xinyan approached Jiang Chen with a glass of wine in her hand.</br>
</br>
Still clad in a vibrant red, but instead of a cotton dress, this time was an elegant cocktail dress.</br>
</br>
"It's a pleasure meeting you again, Miss Wang." Jiang Chen raised his glass and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Is it? But why do I sense that you feel the opposite?" With a graceful stride, Wang Xinyan proposed a toast to Jiang Chen and then took a sip of her wine.</br>
</br>
"That's just your imagination." While saying this, Jiang Chen muttered another sentence to himself.</br>
</br>
[But your imagination is too accurate.]</br>
</br>
"Woman's instinct is very accurate." Towards Jiang Chen's denial, Wang Xinyan just smiled mysteriously and did not give a direct response.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, let's cut to the chase. Come on, what do you need from me?" Jiang Chen coughed lightly as he put down the wine.</br>
</br>
"Can't I even look for you without having an ulterior motive?" Wang Xinyan gracefully sat across him.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but you're obviously not."</br>
</br>
Seeing the guarded look on Jiang Chen's face, Wang Xinyan let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"A man who doesn't understand a woman. Then, excuse me for being blunt... My father wants to see you."</br>
</br>
[Wang Linhua? Why would a real estate developer want to see me?]</br>
</br>
Frowning, Jiang Chen couldn't think of any potential business ventures between Linhua Group and Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"Right now?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, after the event ends." Her red lips curved upwards slyly.</br>
</br>
[When the party's over?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen still couldn't figure out the intention of Wang Linhua.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's slightly frowning expression, Wang Xinyan giggled."Why are you so cautious? Don't you think it'd be probably be something good?"</br>
</br>
"Because I noticed you used the word 'probably," Jiang Chen said dully.</br>
</br>
</br>
"That depends on you and how you interpret it." Wang Xinyan left a smile and a meaningful sentence behind, and then gracefully got up and exited in grand fashion.</br>
</br>
[Depends on my interpretation?]</br>
</br>
A profound smile broke on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Thereupon, the door to the hall became unsettled.</br>
</br>
"Is that Carmen Rothschild? My god, when did Linhua Group become this influential?"</br>
</br>
"Did Carmen specifically come here for this, or is he on a business trip for Rothschild family? Maybe Linhua was informed about it, and that's why he sent an invitation? But for the Rothschild family to attend this gathering, Linhua Group is surely powerful."</br>
</br>
"Haha, if they want to get a slice of the cake of the 1.3 billion people market, then they will need to establish a good relationship with the top dog."</br>
</br>
"That makes sense. I wonder which lucky person will have the opportunity to have dealings with these Europeans tyrants.."</br>
</br>
The ongoing speculations had made Jiang Chen's expression turn slightly strange.</br>
</br>
The lucky person they were referring to was him.</br>
</br>
Once the news about the deal had been publicized, what kind of interesting expression would be on their faces?</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, the control chip and artificial intelligence system had already been completed.</br>
</br>
As long as Jiang Chen willed it, the chip could just be transported from the storage dimension to his pocket.</br>
</br>
But to avoid drawing too much attention to himself, Jiang Chen cautiously decided to temporarily put it aside as he was planning to introduce it in April.</br>
</br>
Picking up his chopstick, he began to enjoy the food on the table. But then, much to his surprise, Carmen began to look around and headed his way.</br>
</br>
Seeing this scene, everyone's eyes widened.</br>
</br>
"So it's Future Technology? When did the Rothschild family get involved in the high-tech industry?"</br>
</br>
"Wait, I heard that Carmen is here representing the Dalmer Corporation. Could it be that Future Technology will be venturing into automotive industry?"</br>
</br>
Artifical intelligence on top of automotive?</br>
</br>
This was one piece of a hot news. What was the media doing, and how come there was no information at all?</br>
</br>
Disregarding the reaction of the crowd, Carmen sat across from Jiang Chen where Wang Xinyan had previously sitten.</br>
</br>
"Chinese food, I like it a lot," Carmen nobly said with a smile, but he picked up a knife and fork.</br>
</br>
"Nice to see you again, old buddy," said Jiang Chen and exchanged greetings with him.</br>
</br>
Whether if it was because of the language barrier or something else entirely, listening to Jiang Chen's words, Carmen's expression became somewhat awkward.</br>
</br>
"I apologize, my friend. I didn't deliberately provoke you—" Based on his understanding, the disappearance of GPS signal was because Jiang Chen had discovered it already. In view of their current relationship, Carmen chose to apologize sincerely.</br>
</br>
"It's okay, I'm a very easy person." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Carmen had blanked out for a moment before a grateful smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
[Being able to let go of the past is amazing. This kind of mental fortitude is truly admirable...] Carmen exclaimed in his head.</br>
</br>
Although it was not a big deal to be inept in using chopsticks and compared to 1 billion USD... How does one eat Chinese food with a knife and fork? Jiang Chen's expression looked strange as he stared at the knife and fork in Carmen's hand.</br>
</br>
The conversation between the two could be described as disjointed, but because of coincidence, it somehow connected together. Carmen thought that Jiang Chen had discovered the problem with the USB, but in reality, Jiang Chen didn't notice the mishap at all.</br>
</br>
One had to say that this disconnect in the information, which caused this misunderstanding, was really funny</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's taciturn behavior was seen as generosity in Carmen's eyes, so his words could not help but have guilt woven into them. While chatting with him, Jiang Chen became perplexed by his odd tone.</br>
</br>
Was this a difference in language expression?</br>
</br>
In short, the flow of conversation between the two was very harmonious.</br>
</br>
But this harmony, in the eyes of a certain person, was far from being pleasant.</br>
</br>
"So Rothschild is interested in Future Technology as well?" With wine in hand, the corner of his eyes peeked at the two as Wang Linhua muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
The wine swirling in the glass reflected the aged face immersed in deep thought.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The gathering ended. After saying goodbye to Carmen Rothschild, Jiang Chen went to the back of the hall and met Wang Linhua waiting there.</br>
</br>
The elder man's body looked healthy, and he had a head full of black hair. While wrinkles were visible on his face, it only added to his authoritative look. From this point alone, Wang Dehai should be his older brother and quite a few years older.</br>
</br>
When he saw Jiang Chen come in, he had an amiable smile on his face as he warmly welcomed Jiang Chen to take a seat.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I have been listening to my brother's praises of you, now that I see you, it certainly is true." Wang Linhua nodded his head.</br>
</br>
"Uncle Wang is overcomplimenting me," Jiang Chen said humbly.</br>
</br>
"Since you call me uncle, could I call you little Jiang?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, it's my honor."</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen's words, Wang Linhua smiled as he took a drink of tea to soothe his throat.</br>
</br>
"The reason why I asked you to stay today is that I wanted to chat with you. I hope little Jiang doesn't mind."</br>
</br>
"Not a problem." Jiang Chen smiled, but he was analyzing his intention.</br>
</br>
"Did you see my daughter yet?" Wang Linhua asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
[Wang Xinyan?]</br>
</br>
As to why Wang Linhua all the sudden mentioned this, Jiang Chen was rather lost.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded as he answered cautiously.</br>
</br>
"What do you think about her?"</br>
</br>
"Unique." Jiang Chen carefully chose his word.</br>
</br>
"I heard you don't have a girlfriend yet, you young people should spend more time together. As the elder, I don't need to say more."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen's expression became odd.</br>
</br>
[What is this? Arranged marriage? Encouraging me to chase after you daughter?]</br>
</br>
"Why did uncle Wang mention this all of the sudden?" Without replying directly, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Nothing really, only casually mentioning it, don't worry too much." Wang Linhua laughed as he waved his hands.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't continue this conversation as he also laughed along with him. He didn't understand what kind of show this old guy was putting on for him, so he decided to be careful with his words.</br>
</br>
As to the hint, there was no way he would agree to it.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't continue the conversation, Wang Linhua only smiled. He reached for the teapot and filled his cup with more tea.</br>
</br>
"Westlake Longjing, my friend gave it to me as a gift."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his cup to take a sip, although he didn't know the intricacy of tea, he still pretended to know as he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Great tea."</br>
</br>
"Haha, not bad right? It is limited quantity. Better than the ones available on the market." Wang Linhua laughed, as he also took a sip of the tea.</br>
</br>
However, simply through observing his action, he was more natural than Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, during one of my outings with the old friend who gifted me the tea, he spoke about an interesting problem. Could little Jiang solve my elderly man's confusion?" Wang Linhua said with a gentle voice as he smiled at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
</br>
"My knowledge is limited, but I will do my best," Jiang Chen answered cautiously.</br>
</br>
"I hope little Jiang don't mind, my old friend works in intelligence service. I am only curious because based on what he said, he couldn't find anything on the technology team behind Future Technology. That team, does it really exist?"</br>
</br>
A piercing and sharp look shot out of Wang Linhua's eyes.</br>
</br>
That fox-like sight, locked tightly onto Jiang Chen's pupils as if he wanted to look through Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was not a rookie anymore, he was at least a general of the Sixth Street. Although it was in another world, it didn't interfere with his new-found calmness as a leader.</br>
</br>
"Of course, it's just that you guys haven't been able to find them yet," Jiang Chen replied to Wang Linhua's suspiciousness with calmness.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Really?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. We only developed a partnership with them. Based on the agreement, they provide technology to us, and we focus on the operations. We also promise them confidentiality to all information about them." It was the second time Jiang Chen said something like this.</br>
</br>
The first was to the media.</br>
</br>
As to Jiang Chen's response, Wang Linhua was obviously unsatisfied, but he didn't show anything on his face, he only smiled, as he continued.</br>
</br>
"We are leaning towards another possibility."</br>
</br>
"Such as?"</br>
</br>
"That team is fictitious, everything is your work."</br>
</br>
"A very imaginative assumption. Disregarding the fact that I have studied mechanical engineering, what's my reason to do this?" Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"There are many reasons. For example, avoiding the trouble, or blurring the development cost." Wang Linhua smiled mysteriously.</br>
</br>
"You think I am avoiding tax? Let's disregard if the problem exists or not in the first place. I don't think Linhua Group is a tax agency right? Even if your brother is powerful, it doesn't mean I have to accept your interrogation. When did Linhua Group start doing the work of the government agency?"</br>
</br>
Although Wang Linhua had clearly heard the displeasure in Jiang Chen's tone, for some odd reason, he didn't stop the topic there.</br>
</br>
"Of course not, I am only listing out a possibility. But those two points are key. The key is, this could be your motive because you don't trust the government."</br>
</br>
"Don't trust the government? This is a serious accusation, I cannot accept this. And don't you think this kind of assumption is irresponsible? Where is your evidence?" Jiang Chen said calmly.</br>
</br>
Rather than lack of trust, Jiang Chen would rather refer to it as being cautious for his life. Since his right hand held the portal to another world!</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, I am only stating a possibility. Granted, our government system does have some flaws and unjust, but all in all, it is still a good system. For the people with talent, we always provide support."</br>
</br>
"Therefore?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Did little Jiang ever consider an equity infusion by state," Wang Linhua said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen let out a sigh in his mind, [It is finally here.]</br>
</br>
A monthly revenue over a billion, 99% of absolute share control, this juicy piece of meat finally made people feel unsettled?</br>
</br>
"Future Technology's operating condition is doing well, the cash flow is steady, there is no consideration of equity infusion."</br>
</br>
It was the point that made all venture capitalists grind their teeth. The lack of problem with cash flow meant that there was no possibility for them to cut a piece of pie from Future 1.0. Disregarding venture capitalists, Future Technology doesn't even need a bank loan. With its monthly profit alone, it could meet its growth needs. The company's incredible money generating ability did indeed make people's eyes glisten with greed.</br>
</br>
This would include private capitals, foreign capitals, and of course, state capitals.</br>
</br>
And Linhua Group is a renowned state enterprise. Wang Linhua's question was dubious in its nature.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't have to be operating poorly to infuse state capital. With liquid asset, you could develop freely and expand your operation." Wang Linhua took a sip of tea in an in control attitude.</br>
</br>
That gesture hinted at a layer of meaning worth thinking over.</br>
</br>
"If you don't mind me using a derogatory term, if you take too big of a stride, you might pull your nuts."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, little Jiang is going to refuse?" Wang Linhua narrowed his eyes, but the smile on his face didn't fade away.</br>
</br>
As to convincing, he had a mysterious sense of confidence. Jiang Chen didn't know what his trump card is, but he would not give any ground on this point.</br>
</br>
"It has to do with the future of the company, I must be cautious with my decision." Jiang Chen didn't back down.</br>
</br>
"Do you think infusing state capital would hinder the growth of Future Technology?" Wang Linhua laughed, he waved his hands, "Let's talk about policy, but you should have been paying attention already."</br>
</br>
After taking a pause, Wang Linhua continued.</br>
</br>
"Based on the state's newly discussed strategy, for the second type of corporation, the keystone corporation is an important industry, as well as its supporting industry, the high-tech industry. For these industries, the state wants an ownership control of 51%. Of course, this is only a recommended percentage, the actual percentage may differ."</br>
</br>
"I heard that it is not an enforced policy, only a method of supporting the company. There is no law that states I must accept an equity infusion by state," Jiang Chen answered emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen's answer, Wang Linhua shook his head with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Do you think, the government would let this type of high-end technology sit in the hands of an individual? With strong capital, the piece of gold would create more value."</br>
</br>
"Or it would be worth nothing." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Wang Linhua pretended to act curious.</br>
</br>
"The infusion of external capital would mean that the company might display the specifics of the operation to the new shareholder. My partner obviously has no intention to reveal itself to any country. Therefore they may terminate my partnership to seek other partners. Don't you think by that point, the move becomes pointless?" Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"That's okay." Wang Linhua smiled at Jiang Chen "Perhaps they would give up on Future Technology, but no reason to give up a 1.3 billion people market. If they truly exist, we'll treat their new partner better."</br>
</br>
At this point, Jiang Chen truly understood everything.</br>
</br>
The old guy was gambling, the type of gambling where he would not lose.</br>
</br>
Whether the foreign technology team is real or fake, it would only take a test to find out. If they actually existed, they would change to a different name, there was no need to worry about them leaving.</br>
</br>
As to if Future Technology would be abandoned or not, Wang Linhua didn't care at all.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, Wang Zhiyong not speaking his mind that day reflected Wang Dehai's attitude.</br>
</br>
At least he permitted the situation. Since Wang Linhua belonged to the Wang family, if Future Technology became Wang family's asset, Wang family acquired another cash cow.</br>
</br>
"So you are arranging this marriage for state capital?'</br>
</br>
"No, only arranging the marriage for the Wang family." Wang Linhua smiled.</br>
</br>
Of course.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen sneered.</br>
</br>
"I'll marry my daughter to you, then you will be the son in law of the Wang family. The dowry is five billion, the bride price... obviously is 50% of the Future Technology share."</br>
</br>
It was a great plan, disregarding the logic of "standing at the high grounds for the country, and forcefully selling and buying." Is the dowry supposed to be an asset after marriage? Based on the ten billion market cap two months ago, to acquire the Future Technology with monthly revenues of a billion, are they shameless? Or shameless?</br>
</br>
"What is this? Political marriage?" Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
"You could interpret it that way."</br>
</br>
"Therefore, Linhua Group can represent the government?" Jiang Chen ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"Although we can't represent, the Wang family has a certain amount of power. Also, Linhua Group is a state-owned enterprise. Therefore it means the same thing as state capital infusing into Future Technology," Wang Linhua said with a smile.</br>
</br>
What a shameless things to say.</br>
</br>
"Could I interpret it that your action reflects the attitude of the Wang family?"</br>
</br>
Pondering on Jiang Chen's question, Wang Linhua took another sip of the tea.</br>
</br>
"You could interpret it that way. Since, rather than giving this juicy meat away to other people, it is better to put it in my own stomach."</br>
</br>
[It is a straightforward analogy, you view my Future Technology as a piece of juicy meat already?]</br>
</br>
Seeing Wang Linhua's confident expression, the tip of Jiang Chen's mouth curved up as he said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"If you think you are so great, are you not afraid I will become a foreign company?"</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 231: Vote with my feet</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words made Wang Linhua pause for a moment, his cunning eyes narrowed into a line. His eyes reflected those of a hunter observing its prey's sharp claw.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen responded to the invasive sight by smiling fearlessly, he took a sip out of the teacup.</br>
</br>
His calmness made Wang Linhua uncertain.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen proactively gave out the shares, it would be the best case scenario. Five billion along with becoming the son-in-law of the Wang family in exchange for 50% of Future Technology's share, in Wang Linhua's eyes, was not too harsh.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua could not think through the reason for Jiang Chen's reaction. Without exaggerating, Future Technology was a piece of juicy meat. Not only the Wang family has spotted the meat, Zhou and Liu families, who had no less of a political influence, were also unsettled.</br>
</br>
But because the juicy meat lies in Wanghai City, and it was in the Wang family's territory, that's why they urged themselves. But followed by the increase in profitability of Future Technology, they could no longer sit around.</br>
</br>
Just like what he has said, rather than other people eating it, it was better to put it in his own stomach.</br>
</br>
"Foreign corporation?" Wang Linhua laughed, "Do you think foreign capital is as cute as it looks. As an elder, I have to caution you, their manner is even worse. Especially since the primary business of Future Technology is still in the country. A bite by us, we can give you some compensation. A bite by foreign capitals, you may have to eat the leftovers with them."</br>
</br>
Although he was saying this confidently, Jiang Chen could still hear the hint of the fear in his voice.</br>
</br>
Hua connecting to the world meant that it is no longer excluded from the world that's led by UA capital as they carefully maintained the image of their international state capital. Using the policy to forcefully buy and sell could occur between state and private capital, but it could never occur between state capital and foreign capital.</br>
</br>
These major shareholders are able to hide from the public's eyes as they only exist in the financial information of each corporation. But in actuality, the QQ we use every day, the largest internet company in Hua with a market cap of 250 billion - Tencent, the major shareholder is not Ma Huateng, but South Africa MIH.</br>
</br>
As to the famous Alibaba, their major shareholder was not Jack Ma, but Softbank.</br>
</br>
Regardless of the status of foreign affairs, foreign capitals are all thriving domestically without suffering any unfair treatment. For example, if the Rothschild family became a shareholder of Future Technology, even without becoming the top shareholder, Wang Linhua would definitely be afraid to make any moves.</br>
</br>
It was the reason why Wang Linhua felt nervous when he saw Carmen and Jiang Chen being so close.</br>
</br>
It was okay laying hands on private capital, it was like a father beating his son as it was the family business. But if a guest came, what kind of etiquette would be used to pull things from the guest's pocket? Although it was a situation that could not be helped, it was the sad truth.</br>
</br>
</br>
If Future Technology did get pushed away by him, not only would Wang Dehai not be too happy, Wang Linhua himself would get nothing out of it. The power within the structure is good against your own people, but not so effective against other people.</br>
</br>
"I am only explaining a possibility," Jiang Chen said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Are you threatening me?" Wang Linhua voice began to turn cold.</br>
</br>
"No, I am only responding to your threat."</br>
</br>
"Threat?" Wang Linhua laughed, "Linhua Group's equity infusion would be absolutely beneficial for Future Technology, you are too ignorant of the situation."</br>
</br>
Just like Wang Linhua said, it was not bad for state capital to infuse into Future Technology. A lot of companies at the brink of bankruptcy do everything they can to infuse state capital.</br>
</br>
With state capital, although it meant some profit would be lost, the company would receive preferential treatment in all kinds of areas. Such as loans. No possibility of a loan not being approved. The bank would nod their head even at the risk of bad debt. Another example, policies. As long as they have the correct political stance, they would not receive repressions from the political side.</br>
</br>
But there was no way Jiang Chen could do this.</br>
</br>
Once state capital is infused, that means that he must reveal the specifics of the company's operations to the new "major shareholder." For example, the team that developed Future 1.0, the point of contact, as well as the cost breakdown of software development. How could this be revealed to other people?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen doesn't have enough knowledge on political regulations to give his right hand to the government.</br>
</br>
"It's not because of ignorance, it's just you are too greedy. With only five billion, you want 50% share of Future Technology with billions of monthly profit, why don't you go rob instead?" Jiang Chen sneered as he stared straight into Wang Linhua's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Rob? Without the Wang family looking after you, do you think Future Technology could grow smoothly to this point?" Wang Linhua paused as he looked at Jiang Chen with more than one layer of meaning.</br>
</br>
"Rothschild family is wealthy, I know you formed a partnership with them. But they are outsiders after all, even with money, their influence in Hua is limited. If you think they can help you out, then you will be disappointed. If you think selling your share would avoid trouble, I recommend you get rid of the idea. Future Technology can escape from trouble, but you definitely won't be able to."</br>
</br>
The threatening intent was serious.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyes' narrowed.</br>
</br>
"I don't know if you have considered this question before, but Future Technology is an internet company with only a few servers. I can start the company anywhere. In the country, or outside of the country."</br>
</br>
"Then you mean?" Wang Linhua's eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"I retain my option to vote with my feet."</br>
</br>
With those words, the atmosphere in the room froze.</br>
</br>
After a while, Wang Linhua leaned against his chair, and slowly opened his mouth to break the silence.</br>
</br>
"Young, impulsive, unwilling to compromise, I can understand. But, I recommend you to think carefully before you make a decision. Linhua Group's control of Future Technology is not only the Wang family's decision, but the people at the top also nodded their heads. Vote with your feet? You have to be able to leave."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed without saying anything.</br>
</br>
[Funny, if I want to leave, who could stop me?]</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen didn't answer, Wang Linhua thought he was considering, he smiled, and didn't push him too hard.</br>
</br>
"It is pretty late, let's call it a day. I hope you can choose a happy ending. After the Han New Year, Linhua group will have its shareholder meeting, the official acquisition proposal will be handed to you by April. I trust that in four months time, you can think this through."</br>
</br>
"What if I reject?"</br>
</br>
"Future Technology's Han operation may experience some unpleasant surprises."</br>
</br>
[Looks like Wang Linhua is firm on grabbing Future Technology in his hands.]</br>
</br>
"Oh? It looks like I have to consider this carefully then."</br>
</br>
Sneering in his mind, Jiang Chen stood up.</br>
</br>
He walked towards the door but suddenly stopped. Turning back around, he smiled.</br>
</br>
"I hope you don't regret your decision today."</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua took a moment before he burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"Regret? Buddy, you have a big mouth. To make me regret, you are still too young."</br>
</br>
"Is that so?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left Wang Linhua with a smile that held a deeper meaning, he didn't stay any longer as he pushed open the door.</br>

</br>
"How did it go? Is it good news or bad news?" Standing outside of the room, Wang Xinyan looked at Jiang Chen, who just came out of the door, with a smile.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?' Jiang Chen stopped and looked at her, half-smiling.</br>
</br>
"I think it didn't go too well." Wang Xinyan crossed her arms as she stood beside Jiang Chen, "I don't understand, what's there to reject? Am I that despicable?"</br>
</br>
"What's there to reject?" Jiang Chen laughed dubiously, "You tell me, what's there to agree?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't respond to her plan of testing the water and left immediately.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen walking away, Wang Xinyan's flashed an unusual light as a mischievous smile appeared on her face.</br>
</br>
"Interesting."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After coming out of the hotel, Jiang Chen walked to the garage. Just as he was about to go into his car, a stranger approached him.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen was walking over, a man in a brown trench coat waved at him and walked towards his direction.</br>
</br>
"You are?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Just a salesman." The man shrugged and smiled friendly.</br>
</br>
"I am not in the mood to buy anything."</br>
</br>
"No, trust me, you will be interested in my offer." The man coughed, and extended his right hand, "Zhang Youjie, I'm an employee of the UA Consulate."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes moved slightly as he shook his hand out of etiquette, then with a layer of meaning, he said, "Consulate worker? What do you have for an ordinary merchant like me?"</br>
</br>
A Han name, should be a UA Han?</br>
</br>
"Ahem, Mr. Jiang is too humble. A normal merchant would not go save someone in Iraq, nor would he go step in the muddy water in Kane, he especially wouldn't train mercenaries in Niger." Zhang Youjie said in a low voice then he coughed.</br>
</br>
What a detailed investigation.</br>
</br>
"Then your intention is?' Jiang Chen asked emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Please don't be mistaken, I am here with good intentions. Although you are unnaturally active internationally, your current actions aren't threatening the security of my country." Seeing the caution in Jiang Chen's eyes, Zhang Youjie rushed to explain.</br>
</br>
"Can I hear about this good intention of yours?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Have you considered switching to a different nationality? The Wall Street is a broad stage. For a talent like you, it is too pitiful if you waste your time on those greedy politicians."</br>
</br>
"Wall Street? I currently have no interest in Wall Street." Jiang Chen said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Don't reject it yet." Zhang Youjie stopped Jiang Chen's words, he slipped a business card into his hand with a smile, "It is never bad to have a few extra options right? The door to freedom is always open for people with talent, especially for a genius like you."</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie bowed nobly before he turned around and left.</br>
</br>
</br>
Staring at Zhang Youjie's shadow, Jiang Chen played with the business card in his hand for as a dubious smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
Wall Street? Would the etiquette of the Wall Street capitalists be better? As long as they are politicians, they are the same everywhere.</br>
</br>
He stuffed the business card into his pocket as Jiang Chen sat into his Maybach.</br>
</br>
If Wang Linhua thought he could use the power within the system to force him to agree, then he is fated for disappointment.</br>
</br>
Future Technology will never be a subsidiary of the Wang family, Jiang Chen never had the intention to compromise.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After he got into the car, Jiang Chen didn't head home. Instead, he went to the rural area and parked in front of the Hongyi private club.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the door, entered the club, passed through the hall and walked straight to the reception desk.</br>
</br>
"Hello sir, what kind of service-" The receptionist smiled professionally as she greeted Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Those coming at this hour, needless to say, was here to "spend the night".</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's first sentence caught her by surprise.</br>
</br>
"Call your manager...Zhou Zihao here." Jiang Chen said in a straightforward manner.</br>
</br>
The receptionist paused for a moment and looked at Jiang Chen in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Sir?"</br>
</br>
"Just say that someone called Jiang Chen is here."</br>
</br>
She looked skeptically at Jiang Chen, but she still picked up the phone and called the manager.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Manager Zhou? Someone named Jiang Chen wants to see you -, Oh, okay..."</br>
</br>
When she hung up the phone, the way she looked at him changed from skepticism to respect.</br>
</br>
If the mention of this person's name in that one phone can get her manager to come down, this person is obvious not ordinary. In her impression, the only person that could do this was called Wang Zhiyong.</br>
</br>
Without waiting for long, Jiang Chen saw the "squint eye" coming down.</br>
</br>
"Haha, we meet again, brother Jiang." Zhou Zihao walked up to Jiang Chen with a smile, "How have you been?"</br>
</br>
The warmness made it seem like the unhappy ending that happened here last time didn't exist.</br>
</br>
"Not very good, so I came here to find you." Jiang Chen also smiled.</br>
</br>
"Find me? Uncle Wang wants you to be his son in law, does brother Jiang want me to be the best man?"</br>
</br>
"You already know?" Jiang Chen was slightly surprised.</br>
</br>
"I do have some connections here." Zhou Zihao shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Okay let's not play riddles then. Partnership, are you interested?" Jiang Chen was direct.</br>
</br>
After a brief moment, an interested expression appeared on Zhou Zihao's face.</br>
</br>
"Partnership? Is Future Technology not satisfied with great influence that is the Wang family?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing to do with Future Technology." Jiang Chen said emotionlessly, "A partnership between you and me."</br>
</br>
"You want me to go against uncle Wang, even though I don't have the reason -"</br>
</br>
"Military artificial intelligence project."</br>
</br>
Zhou Zihao's eyes immediately narrowed, although his eyes were not big to begin with.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen clearly sensed that he was tempted.</br>
</br>
"This is not the place to talk." Zhou Zihao said in a low voice as he signaled to Jiang Chen to follow him into the second-floor room.</br>
</br>
Immediately after they sat down, Zhou Zihao couldn't wait and asked.</br>
</br>
"Can Future Technology really do it? The military artificial intelligence program?"</br>
</br>
"Smart drone control system."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed clearly that he was tempted by the offer, but he didn't immediately agree as a hint of caution came out of his eyes.</br>
</br>
"How do you want me to help you?"</br>
</br>
"I heard you have a hobby of shooting adult videos, how many have you filmed?" Jiang Chen's sight was dubious.</br>
</br>
Zhou Zihao's eyes slightly moved, he obviously knew what Jiang Chen referred to.</br>
</br>
"You want those videos?"</br>
</br>
"Exactly."</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy, you think you could use those 147 political sex scandal video to take down Wang family?"</br>
</br>
"147 of them? That is more than what I expected... I wasn't thinking about taking down the Wang family, what I need is necessary deterrence." Jiang Chen stared at Zhou Zihao's squinted eyes, "Zhou family is in Shangjing, and you are in Wanghai City, I suppose you don't really favor your own family. Smart drone control systems... if you give me the videos, the systems are yours."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Future Technology had to go, and this was Jiang Chen had decided a long time ago. But even if it's gone, there would still be a process involved. Moreover, even if it's gone, that didn't mean he would abandon the domestic market. It's just that selecting a small country was easier to control as a headquarter to facilitate the future development of Future Technology later on.</br>
</br>
However, he didn't expect that Wang family would no longer be able to sit still so quick.</br>
</br>
In order to control the artificial intelligence technology and to rope state-owned assets in, the organization's authority was employed to compel Jiang Chen to surrender his shares of Future Technology. Using the state-owned assets and Wang family joint ownership of Linhua Group to own a controlling number of shares in Future Technology, Wang Linhua's formulated a sound plan.</br>
</br>
When all was said and done, Jiang Chen's connection could not be considered extensive. Future Technology's profits made people envious. Although the Wang family had kept him away from trouble, what if the Wang family became greedy too? Obviously, in the face of family interest, Wang Dehai naturally chose his own family and allowed Wang Linhua's behaviors.</br>
</br>
However, in regard to Wang Linhua's "not so excessive" conditions, Wang Dehai still gave it a thought. Although Jiang Chen had to give up his shares, they didn't make it "too difficult" for him. 5 billion RMB along with the identity of son-in-law, Wang Dehai thought it was enough compensation.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was not satisfied with this.</br>
</br>
So he went to look for Zhou Zihao.</br>
</br>
Don't be mistaken, Jiang Chen never thought those videos would work, or that those videos would make Wang family compromise with him and stop their scheming against Future Technology. If he did release the scandal videos, it would force the two parties on completely opposite sides without any room for negotiation.</br>
</br>
Taking a thousand steps back, even if the Wang family stopped, would it stop other greedy people from making move against him? A head-on conflict with the Wang family would mean that he would lose the protection of the top dogs, which would make it more difficult for Future Technology. Wang Linhua was convinced about this point. Thus, he directly confronted Jiang Chen and overtly plotted. "I want your shares. Are you going to give it to me or not?"</br>
</br>
After getting the videos from Zhou Zihao, Jiang Chen carelessly threw it into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The trump card he was relying on was the "UAV Smart Control System 1.0," which Zhou Zihao had happily taken home and taken credit for.</br>
</br>
Although Zhou Zihao submitted the project under his name, would the bigwigs be dumb enough to think that it was Zhou Zihao who really developed it?</br>
</br>
With just a simple investigation, it was easy to deduce the last person Zhou Zihao made contact with before coming back to Shangjing.</br>
</br>
</br>
The people eyeing his interest was not the government, rather it was the Wang family. Would the government really care about such minuscule profit? The government was only interested in the artificial intelligence project in his possession and nothing more. Wang Linhua could persuade the largest shareholder of Linhua Group, SASAC (State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission), to acquire Future Technology. Without a doubt, he appealed to this type of reason: "become the first shareholder that could transform Future Technology into a military tech company and use artificial intelligence in the military."</br>
</br>
Since the civil-level artificial intelligence could not whet the appetite of the higher-ups, then the military grade should do the trick.</br>
</br>
As long as the top dogs were satisfied with the contribution of Future Technology on the national defense and were persuaded that it would make more contributions in the hands of Jiang Chen, then the state's reason to control Future Technology would no longer exist. At the same time, the state could also provide certain policy protection to Future Technology.</br>
</br>
As for the Wang family? As long as Jiang Chen would be able to persuade the top dogs that Future Technology could only maximize its value in his hands, would he need to worry about the Wang family? Even if the Wang family was influential locally, their local sphere of influence was limited, so how could they oppose the will of the central authority?</br>
</br>
As for seeking connection with the Zhou family, it was only to avoid encroaching on the other party's vested interest. The video was nothing more than to divert Zhou Zihao's attention, so that he would think that Jiang Chen was only interested in his videos. As such, he was impatient to return and present the "treasure."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It has been a week since Jiang Chen made a deal with Zhou Zihao. Just like what Jiang Chen had expected, an unusual guest appeared in his mansion.</br>
</br>
It was a middle-aged man with a shaved head, lean, and sharp-looking figure. Despite possessing an ordinary face and a fading white sideburns, the shrewd aura emanating from him made Jiang Chen unable to ignore his presence.</br>
</br>
Standing behind him should be his bodyguard. His slightly burly figure made him look like a person with excellent combat ability, but Jiang Chen had seen too many of them, so he didn't give it much attention.</br>
</br>
"Ye Guolong, Colonel." Ye Guolong sharply extended his hand and shook hands with Jiang Chen. He only stated his rank without going into the details of his exact position.</br>
</br>
[It's actually a colonel. It's at least an officer rank, even at a deputy division level.] While Jiang Chen was secretly astonished, he did not reveal too much emotion on his face.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, just an ordinary businessman. Come inside, if you please." Jiang Chen smiled and invited Ye Guolong into the living area.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the sofa, Ye Guolong looked around the living room and spoke, "Has Mr. Jiang been expecting my arrival?"</br>
</br>
"Oh? Why do you think so?" Sitting across from him, Jiang Chen asked while smiling.</br>
</br>
"You even have the tea already prepared." Ye Guolong smiled and took a sip of tea. "It's still hot."</br>
</br>
"When an important guest is visiting, I can't be too shabby, can I?"</br>
</br>
After some casual small talk, Ye Guolong put on a severe face as he headed to the critical topic.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, I'll be straightforward with you—did you create the UAV Smart Control System 1.0?"</br>
</br>
Seeing Ye Guolong's seriousness, Jiang Chen turned solemn as well and put down his tea.</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
Since he already asked, it was apparent that already know everything through an investigation, so it would be not sincere to run around in circles.</br>
</br>
"When did you start developing this system? Other than Zhou Zihao, how many people have seen the source code?"</br>
</br>
"Is Colonel Ye interrogating me?" Jiang Chen didn't answer and retorted.</br>
</br>
Hearing that, Ye Guolong paused for a brief moment before he slightly frowned.</br>
</br>
"This is a state secret, so please cooperate, Mr. Jiang."</br>
</br>
"Someone seems to have submitted my work as military technology, so my work became a state secret? Could I interpret it this way, Colonel Ye?"</br>
</br>
With that, Ye Guolong could not help but feel embarrassed.</br>
</br>
This software was indeed submitted by the Zhou family, but according to their investigation, the software was developed by Jiang Chen. It was precisely the reason why they went to look for Jiang Chen. It was so they could ensure the safety of the software. Even with the software, they were hesitant in using it. Since it pertained to national security, there was no room for error.</br>
</br>
"Uh, for Mr. Jiang's contribution, we'll offer a fair amount of compensation. I hope Jiang Chen can consider what's important for the bigger picture," with that, Ye Guolong could no longer maintain a stern face and stated awkwardly.</br>
</br>
Seeing Ye Guolong's expression, Jiang Chen smile and stopped giving him a harder time.</br>
</br>
"The software started its development phase around three months ago before Zhou Zihao acquired the software from me, so only the development team overseas and I had seen the code. But I have to warn you, version 1.0 is only half-completed."</br>
</br>
"Half-completed?" Ye Guolong furrowed his brows.</br>
</br>
"Exactly, though it looks fine now, there are a lot of security risks in the system. These problems could have been solved in the subsequent updates, but unfortunately, Future Technology encountered some small problems. To tell you the truth, I gave the software to Zhou Zihao because of the threat I received from a not-to-be-underestimated person. This led us to rush out to release this semi-finished product in exchange for Zhou's policy protection," Jiang Chen responded.</br>
</br>
"Do you know the consequences of messing with us with a half-completed product?" Ignoring his last statement, Ye Guolong asked dubiously.</br>
</br>
"Was the software created by Future Technology?" Jiang Chen feigned astonishment.</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong was speechless again.</br>
</br>
In fact, the software was not submitted under Future Technology's name. Even if something did occur, it was the Zhou family's problem, it had nothing to do with Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong couldn't resist the urge to curse at the dumbass Zhou in his mind, who didn't realize that the software was half-completed.</br>
</br>
But the Zhou family was not to be blamed. Though the system was half completed, it was definitely still usable. Only through a series of experiments would the flaw be exposed. One could say that they were too impatient.</br>
</br>
After a brief moment of silence, he slowly opened his mouth, "How long will it take to complete it?"</br>
</br>
"A month would do."</br>
</br>
Hearing Ye Guolong asked this question, he knew the incident was about to be resolved.</br>
</br>
"What kind of small problems did you encounter?" Ye Guolong asked impassively.</br>
</br>
"This is the recorded message between the president of Linhua Group, Wang Linhua, and me." Jiang Chen put a USB on the table.</br>
</br>
Frowning, Ye Guolong picked up the USB.</br>
</br>
"I will report the problem for you to the higher-ups... Technicians should better stay away from politics."</br>
</br>
"I do too, but someone always wants to use politics against me," Jiang Chen shrugged and stated in a helpless voice.</br>
</br>
After thinking for a moment, Ye Guolong said, the UAV Smart Control System 1.0's maintenance will be contracted by Zhongxin High Tech to Future Technology."</br>
</br>
Zhongxin High Tech was the Zhou family's corporation responsible for the design of drones, a leading corporation participating in the military artificial intelligence project. It would be impossible to obtain the patent rights of the "UAV Smart Control System 1.0" since he already gave the software to the Zhou family. Thus, it belonged to them now.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't mind because compared to the profit of Future 1.0, the profit from this military artificial intelligence project was negligible. He viewed the skin of military tech company with utmost importance. With this, it was tantamount to the protection from the central authority. Wang Linhua must weigh it carefully before using the power of the system. A careless mistake could be regarded as treason.</br>
</br>
Afterall, plotting against a military tech corporation was different than an ordinary company.</br>
</br>
"So wouldn't Future Technology be considered as a military tech corporation?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That's right." Ye Guolong nodded, stood up, and extended his right hand again. "As for the specifics of the agreement, Zhongxin High Tech's representative will be here tomorrow to discuss it with you. I hope you will have great, outstanding contributions to the national security."</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen shook Ye Guolong's hands, smiling.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 234: Each Parties' Response</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Little Zhang, you drive."</br>
</br>
"Okay." The young man who stood behind Ye Guolong sat in the driver seat without a word and started the car.</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong sat in the car, he played with the USB in his hands, cracked a smile and stuffed it in his pocket.</br>
</br>
"The old guys at the Zhou and Wang family are embarrassing. F*ck, don't let the technical people be in politics. This is bullsh*t," Ye Guolong cursed before he lit a cigarette for himself.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he felt sympathy for people like Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When he was young, he also experienced something similar. It was his hard work, but people pointed things out on the side. In the end, when the results came out, his name had to go behind theirs.</br>
</br>
The good thing was that his technicals were strong. People without ability could no longer climb above a certain point, but he ended up prevailing to the top.</br>
</br>
He was at the subdivision level, with colonel rank. In a few years, it won't be difficult to become enter the division level.</br>
</br>
Because of his experiences in the past, the people he despised the most were people that wanted to steal the work of others. In his perspective, the technical people should stay away from politics and diligently focus on the technicals. Or how else could the strategy of the country to promote technology be achieved?</br>
</br>
But it was only wishful thinking. With technology becoming more and more political, even he had to play by the rules of the game.</br>
</br>
He had seen Future 1.0. The human-computer interaction achieved to such a high level of complexity. He still remembered how amazed he was at the intricate design of the system. What shocked him more was that an expert like him could not figure the fundamental principle of the software out. This made him amazed at the ingenious of the younger generation.</br>
</br>
Seeing today, the rumored chief engineer, Jiang Chen, was a stellar young man.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, even a stellar individual like him still must face the treacherous acts of people with ill thoughts.</br>
</br>
Although the smart drone control system 1.0 could no longer be categorized under Future Technology's name, even Future Technology has to be contracted to update and develop the later phase of the smart drone control system. Ye Guolong already made up his mind. Within the permissible boundary, he would fight for Jiang Chen's interest as part of the compensation.</br>
</br>
"You are right Colonel Ye." Zhang Wei drove the car and laughed.</br>
</br>
Because of his identity, he could not comment more on the topic.</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong, knowing that, didn't discuss the topic further with him.</br>
</br>
"Go back to the hotel. We will go back to Shangjing; we have a lot of things to work on once we go back," Ye Guolong said nonchalantly, as he opened the car window to dust his cigarette.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong let the cold air inside the car as he abruptly said.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Speaking of this, Little Zhang."</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Zhang Wei smiled.</br>
</br>
"As someone of your age, what do you think of Jiang Chen as a person?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Wei hesitated for a moment.</br>
</br>
"In what area?"</br>
</br>
"Anything, we are only chatting." Ye Guolong cracked a smile.</br>
</br>
"Very rich." Zhang Wei chuckled.</br>
</br>
"No sh*t, I don't need you to say that."</br>
</br>
"I don't know if it is my illusion or not, but I think he has great combat ability." Zhang Wei had a stern expression.</br>
</br>
"Great combat ability? Compared to you?" Ye Guolong asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"Of course I am a bit better since I did spend so many years at the border," Zhang Wei touched his nose and said.</br>
</br>
Ye Guolong laughed as he didn't say more. A soldier's combat ability compared with a technical person's? It was not embarrassing at all.</br>
</br>
But what Ye Guolong didn't know was, Zhang Wei was not completely truthful.</br>
</br>
Since it was his superior, how could he say he was weak compared to someone else? They were only chatting and would not actually fight.</br>
</br>
But he had suspected that his illusion was wrong.</br>
</br>
The instinct from the battlefield actually told him, if he met the person on the battlefield, he had no odds of winning at all.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Wanghai city UA Consulate.</br>
</br>
Smith sat at his table, with his legs crossed. He was drinking his afternoon tea while killing time reading the newspaper.</br>
</br>
As the person responsible for the consulate, if there were no foreign affair duties or a citizen causing trouble, he spent most of the time relaxing. He enjoyed the feeling of no reporters checking in to see if he had wasted taxpayer's money or not. He could relaxingly enjoy the afternoon during work.</br>
</br>
If the air were a bit better here, it would be perfect. But of course, he knew not everything could be perfect.</br>
</br>
Then, the sound of the door being pushed open signaled the end to his relaxing afternoon.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Smith. I think this is the second time I have seen you drinking tea in the afternoon," A yellow-skinned young man said in a ridiculing tone as he walked in with speedy steps, grabbed a chair without care and sat in front of Smith's table.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen were here, he would be shocked to find out that the Han young man was precisely Zhang Youjie. The one that described himself as a consulate worker and tried to lure him to immigrate.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, is CIB that bored that you are doing the job of the inspectors?" Although complaining, Smith still stuffed the newspaper in his hands into the drawer and folded his hand together. "Speak your mind, what kind of trouble did you cause."</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie was not a consulate worker at all. Although his name is on the list, he is actually a CIB agent. This secret, only Smith as the Consul General knows about.</br>
</br>
"No trouble. I just got an interesting piece of information from our insider." Zhang Youjie took out his phone and slid it across the table.</br>
</br>
Smith glanced at the tightly shut door before he looked at the picture on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen? I heard of this person before. The president of Future Technology. Wall Street seems to think highly of this person, stating he is the second Steve Jobs..."</br>
</br>
"Everyone knows him, especially the Consul General who spends time reading the newspaper during work." Zhang Youjie had no considerations for Smith as he glanced at the guy displeasingly. Smith sniffed his nose and ignored his ridicule.</br>
</br>
"Therefore? Is there a problem with this guy?"</br>
</br>
"Our intel had always suggested that Future Technology's artificial intelligence's value was not as high as we had imagined. Since Future 1.0's basic principle was logical answering, as opposed to say they are advanced in software design, it would be fairer to say they have a strong understanding of human psychology. Although the encryption on the database is shocking, it is not advanced to the point worth our effort."</br>
</br>
"Therefore?" Smith didn't look like he was too interested.</br>
</br>
"The situation has changed."</br>
</br>
"Future Technology has demonstrated value worth your effort now, am I right?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Zhang Youjie smiled mysteriously and lowered his voice. "Based on insider information, the smart drone control system designed by Zhongxin High Tech is actually from the president and chief developer of Future Technology - Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
"… This is surprising information," Smith turned more serious, he leaned against the chair and muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"Based on the source's analysis, this smart control system will be used on "Dragon II" High altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, it could be used to guide the DF-21D Anti-ship ballistic missile. Because of the barrier in design, the "Dragon II"'s control system has been delayed and expected to be completed by May of next year. But because of this goddamn Future Technology, our little friends in the South Hua Sea are too nervous to sleep now," Zhang Youjie cursed out.</br>
</br>
"It's only software, is it worth being so dramatic about?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie glanced at Smith.</br>
</br>
"Based on the information as well as the analysis conducted by the Pentagon, this artificial intelligence could allow "Dragon II's" hardware utilization efficiency to increase by 10% more than expected. Do you know what this means?"</br>
</br>
"I don't know, but I feel CIB doesn't seem to dislike Future Technology." Smith shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Of course, because the possibility of a partnership remains."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Smith looked curiously at Zhang Youjie, "Partnership?"</br>
</br>
"That's right, based on my research, Future Technology had a conflict with Linhua Technology, but Linhua Technology has connections to the political scene. Therefore, Future Technology received a hindrance to its growth. To alleviate the pressure from the connection, he had to submit this software to Zhongxin High Tech to gain protection." Zhang Youjie had a dubious smile on his face. "We can use this point to convince him. The ticket to the free world, the support from the capitals, there is no way he would not be tempted."</br>
</br>
"These goddamn "connections". God, this word is hard to pronounce, but I like it." Smith began to chuckle.</br>
</br>
"So I need your help." Zhang Youjie leaned against the chair, fingers crossed.</br>
</br>
"Of course, at your service. But what if he is not interested anymore?"</br>
</br>
"Make accidents happen to him, and also give a warning to the team behind him."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After sending Ye Guolong away, Jiang Chen returned to his mansion.</br>
</br>
Because she didn't like strangers, when guests came, Ayesha went to her bedroom. When she saw that the guests had left, she came downstairs.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen's delighted smile, Ayesha also felt happy for him and tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"Did something good happen?"</br>
</br>
"Somewhat, but there is definitely going to be more troubles than before." Jiang Chen smiled as he rubbed Ayesha's head.</br>
</br>
"Is it troubles I could help with?" Ayesha put her hand over his as she asked softly.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I need to give you a gun, not a sniper… Could the Type 11 tactical pistol work?"</br>
</br>
"Anything is fine, I have practiced hundreds of times in the virtual reality chamber."</br>
</br>
Inside her blue pupils radiated warmth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's head again, got up, and narrowed his eyes while looking at the bright sunshine outside. He muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"This is troublesome. Do I have to be careful even when I'm just on the streets?"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 235: Sunbathe in the Apocalypse</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Then? You brought out a more advanced technology and submitted it to the superior of the person that threatened you?" Sun Jiao lied on the beach chair. Her red lips bit the straw, and she said sluggishly.</br>
</br>
"Although your understanding is a bit weird, it is not wrong." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Ancient people are so troublesome, if there is a problem, solve it with nukes." Lin Lin bit on the plastic spoon and said without consideration.</br>
</br>
She spoke before the words processed through her brain, so Jiang Chen selectively ignored it.</br>
</br>
"Nukes. It is better not to use it. Since... The scenery on that side is so beautiful." On top of the chair, dangling her pale and thin legs, Yao Yao tilted her head.</br>
</br>
Right now, the four were relaxingly sunbathing.</br>
</br>
Wait, how could they be sunbathing in the apocalypse? Especially in the winter time when the average temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius.</br>
</br>
They had to thank Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
After Lin Lin heard about the magic known as sunbathing, she longed for the "ancient" culture and immediately began to work in the backyard of the mansion.</br>
</br>
She first took over the private pool used to store gold, then begged Sun Jiao to order the base's construction team to use polyethylene insulated wall to tightly surround the pool and add air filter vent. Then, she covered the swimming pool with sand.</br>
</br>
Immediately, she then used multiple artificial UV light devices to replicate natural light. She installed it on the ceiling and simulated the sun's position based on the time and angle of the light.</br>
</br>
Finally, she lavishly used hologram projection devices and flawlessly replicated a beach environment. Other than not being able to sleep in the water and no saline sea wind, there wasn't any big differences to the real thing.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen mocked her for all her effort as it would be simpler to use virtual reality to experience the joy. But Lin Lin argued, "the virtual world and real world are two completely unconnected things! This is the necessary experiment to research traveling through dimensions!" to negate his mockery.</br>
</br>
All in all, after her work, the sunbathing experience was completed.</br>
</br>
The room temperature was adjusted to 30 Celcius, even in the cold wasteland winter, they could enjoy the warmth of the summer beach.</br>
</br>
"Woo, I do agree with Lin Lin's proposal." Sun Jiao sipped on the cold coke as she pouted.</br>
</br>
Seeing that someone agreed with her perspective, Lin Lin immediately proudly raised her head.</br>
</br>
"The civil society has civil society's rules, how could one just pull out nukes randomly." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Civilized people are so problematic," Sun Jiao muttered.</br>
</br>
"Therefore, things on the other side are not easy," Jiang Chen said helplessly while grabbing a beer from the ice-filled box and taking a big gulp.</br>
</br>
</br>
The cold beer sliding down his throat was a thrilling feel.</br>
</br>
He burped and lied relaxingly on the chair, enjoying the rare moment of peace.</br>
</br>
The reason why he appeared here was purely because he had a little bit of free time in his busy schedule. Then he was dragged here by Sun Jiao and Yao Yao to sunbath.</br>
</br>
At first, he was not really interested, because this artificial sunbathing experience didn't look too fun.</br>
</br>
But he quickly changed his mind.</br>
</br>
Of course, the bikini is core to the beach.</br>
</br>
The bikini formed with delicate white laces and transparent clothes covered most of the skin but had an intricate and cute vibe to it. Without guessing, it obviously belonged to Yao Yao.</br>
</br>
With black lace as the main structure, the bikini that only barely covered the essential parts with seduction and sexiness naturally belonged to Miss Sun Jiao.</br>
</br>
As to Lin Lin, her almost blinding white skin made people particularly jealous. The digitalized metabolic function meant that she didn't even need sunscreen to carelessly enjoy the sun.</br>
</br>
Because it was too boring just to lie there quietly, Jiang Chen began to tell them about the things that happened on the other side.</br>
</br>
"But this type of outdated technology, is it really okay?" Yao Yao quietly said.</br>
</br>
Although it was Jiang Chen's special request, for her to create the "flawed" smart drone control system, it still made the benevolent Yao Yao feel guilty.</br>
</br>
"It is already really advanced. If it is more advanced, then there would be new problems." Jiang Chen rubbed Yao Yao's head and smiled.</br>
</br>
Technology from 2020. It would be considered extremely outdated to today's standard. Even the programming language was the "most primal," but it was advanced to the modern world.</br>
</br>
"If you can't use nukes, what about power armors?" Lin Lin continued to propose bad ideas as if the world is not chaotic enough. "A technology discrepancy of 150 years, a power armor alone would destroy that Linhua Group right? And there wouldn't be any nuclear radiation."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen facepalmed, why is communication so difficult.</br>
</br>
Although he would definitely bring out the power armor, absolutely not now.</br>
</br>
But wouldn't be too long until that happens.</br>
</br>
"Linhua group is not a military organization, how should I say this... All in all, they are just a normal company. You have spent too long in virtual reality, how would you not know what a company is?"</br>
</br>
"Umm, I didn't leave the hospital in virtual reality," Lin Lin murmured in a small voice.</br>
</br>
"Is there no military?" Sun Jiao bit the straw as she said with authority. "That's even easier, I can wipe them all out by myself."</br>
</br>
Then, she picked up another can of coke. She was on her fifth one.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao seemed to be particularly fond of coke.</br>
</br>
[Why are they so violent... Yao Yao is more gentle.]</br>
</br>
But hearing their words, Jiang Chen's heart felt warm.</br>
</br>
Although they had no understanding of the other world, they still warmheartedly gave him ideas, caring for him.</br>
</br>
"How's your research going? Lin Lin?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
He referred to carrying live beings through the interdimensional space.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin pouted her mouth in remorse and shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Are you stuck... Don't worry, take it slow," Jiang Chen comforted her.</br>
</br>
With research, there is no use in rushing, although he wants to see results earlier too.</br>
</br>
"Then what do you plan to do? Although I don't know civilized people's way of doing things, if you bring out the technology today, maybe tomorrow they will discuss with you the possibility of other technology," Sun Jiao said.</br>
</br>
"There is no need, I only need some time," Jiang Chen shook his head, "I'll leave by March at the latest. Once Spring starts, the required food for the Sixth Street trade will be gathered overseas. The software will be my departing gift since that place is my home country."</br>
</br>
Military tech is not military purchase, there was no room to collaborate with an external force. Since the research team is supposed to be overseas. Jiang Chen only stated he was only the representative for that research team in Hua. Once the complete version has been passed on to Zhongxin High Tech, the subsequent update would not easily be given to Future Technology. Once they have the source code, Zhongxin High Tech would likely improve on the completed version then create a final version. The subsequent update would be completed by them without much trouble.</br>
</br>
Within this month, his ability to leave the country would likely be restricted, but it would not be so problematic once he passed on the software.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen was not the developer, he was only a representative.</br>
</br>
If the research team is not in the country, it would be futile even if they controlled him.</br>
</br>
In the next month, he would only have to prove he is a representative. For example, travel around? Or head home. As long he pretended to be "not writing the code," the assumption of "the research team being factitious" would no longer stand.</br>
</br>
Controlling a representative would not bring any material benefits. It would be similar to the control of an embassy not being able to force the other country to give grounds in foreign affairs.</br>
</br>
By that time, even if he really wanted to go, there wouldn't be any difficulties.</br>
</br>
Perhaps someone would try to convince him to stay, but it would be impossible to force him to stay.</br>
</br>
At least there wouldn't be a fool like Wang Linhua, gambling on if Jiang Chen was the only developer.</br>
</br>
"What are you going to do with Linhua Group?" Sun Jiao asked.</br>
</br>
"I said I will make him regret." Jiang Chen's smile was evil.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen's expression, Sun Jiao smiled and didn't say more.</br>
</br>
At this time, the tablet on the table began to flash.</br>
</br>
"Your phone." Lin Lin used the plastic spoon for the pudding to point at the tablet on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grabbed the tablet as he pressed the pick up button.</br>
</br>
The image was first blurry before it quickly stabilized.</br>
</br>
Ayesha appeared on the other side of the screen. When Jiang Chen left, he gave his EP to her and told her to contact him if anything happened.</br>
</br>
"Did anything happen?"</br>
</br>
"Your phone just rang, it was Wang Dehai."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see, I'll head back immediately."</br>
</br>
Then, he hung up.</br>
</br>
"Umm? Is that your woman on the other side?" Sun Jiao was thinking about something as her gaze became mischievous. "Your taste is quite good."</br>
</br>
"Are you jealous?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible." Sun Jiao looked at him with charm, "Are her boobs bigger than mine?"</br>
</br>
"Bigger doesn't always mean better. Even if it is a bit smaller, it can still be delicious..." Yao Yao used a small voice to argue.</br>
</br>
"I agree." Lin Lin raised her hands, but then she smirked at Yao Yao without any good intention, "But for Yao Yao, there is nothing at all."</br>
</br>
"QQ!"</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 236: Meeting Wang Dehai Again</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When he returned to the modern world, Jiang Chen returned the call.</br>
</br>
During the conversation, Wang Dehai didn't mention what happened in the past few weeks at all and ceremonially praised Future Technology's outstanding achievement. Of course, he didn't mention the specific contribution, since name wise, the smart drone control system was the Zhou family's work. Then he briefly asked Jiang Chen to come to the municipal government when he has time before he hung up.</br>
</br>
He took the EP back from Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Are you going to go out?" Seeing that Jiang Chen changed, Ayesha said gently.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen nodded, then smiled. "I need to go to the municipal government. The old fox Wang Dehai wants to see me, so it's better for me to go soon."</br>
</br>
"Do you need me to accompany you?'</br>
</br>
"Drive for me." Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's head.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Ayesha obediently nodded. "Let me go change."</br>
</br>
Then, she turned around to go back to her room.</br>
</br>
She changed into a black trenchcoat and tied her brown hair back into a ponytail. On top her high nose bridge was a pair of shades. She certainly did look like a cold and merciless bodyguard.</br>
</br>
Although she always acted like a newlywed wife.</br>
</br>
The two went into the garage and got into the car.</br>
</br>
Ayesha started the car, and Jiang Chen put on the seatbelt. When the car drove out of the community, Jiang Chen scanned out the tainted window.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?"</br>
</br>
"Nothing, maybe just my illusion." Jiang Chen muttered before he leaned back in the chair.</br>
</br>
For a moment, he felt someone was watching him.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When they arrived at the municipal government building, Jiang Chen got out of the car, and Ayesha stayed behind.</br>
</br>
A smart looking, middle-aged man stood at the door waiting. When he saw Jiang Chen, he walked straight towards him.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang."</br>
</br>
"Hello. And you are?"</br>
</br>
"Wu Bo, Secretary Wang's assistant." Wu Bo extended his hand and shook with Jiang Chen. Then with a courteous gesture, he said, "Please follow me."</br>
</br>
The two didn't speak along the way. When he took Jiang Chen to Wang Dehai's office, Wu Bo left.</br>
</br>
Pushing the door open, Jiang Chen once again saw the aged but still dogmatic-looking face.</br>
</br>
"Please take a seat." Seeing Jiang Chen, Wang Dehai smiled and gestured for him to sit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and sat on the sofa before he too looked at Wang Dehai with a smile.</br>
</br>
"It's been a while, is Uncle Wang's health doing well?"</br>
</br>
"Very well." With the pen thrown into the pen holder, Wang Dehai looked deeply at Jiang Chen, then he said, "Little Jiang, you have been hiding quite well."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen obviously knew what he referred to. Wang Dehai wouldn't know that the smart drone control system 1.0 actually was created by Yao Yao not long after the meeting with Zhou Zihao.</br>
</br>
</br>
It only took two days to exchange the video with Zhou Zihao. It didn't take three months of development time.</br>
</br>
"Not hid well, just preparing for the worst," Jiang Chen said humbly.</br>
</br>
But this humble attitude didn't please Wang Dehai.</br>
</br>
Wang Dehai sniffed, laughed, and looked at Jiang Chen with eyes full of another meaning.</br>
</br>
"I remember that you told me two months ago, Future Technology's artificial intelligence has no value in the military."</br>
</br>
"Future 1.0 don't possess any military value, but the smart drone control system does," Jiang Chen replied expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
The smart drone control system 1.0 was created by Future Technology, everyone knew this secret.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Wang Dehai slowly said, "Linhua Group's shareholder meeting is canceled."</br>
</br>
What this sentence means was Linhua Group's equity infusion of Future Technology has died in its infancy. Disregarding the promise given by Ye Guolong, SASAC would not vote in favor of this proposition. When the people on the top specifically said to take care of Future Technology, how could Wang Dehai use the power of policy to help Wang Linhua?</br>
</br>
Without Wang Dehai's support, the flawlessly operated Future Technology was left with weaknesses for Wang Linhua to take advantage of.</br>
</br>
"A wise decision because Future Technology never had the intention to sell shares." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Why are you not satisfied with Linhua Group's proposal?" Wang Dehai asked emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"The hundred millions of monthly tax revenue for the local government is too little? Your life is not worth it?" Jiang Chen laughed and asked rhetorically.</br>
</br>
Even with more tax, it was still the government's money, it would only be Wang Dehai's political achievement, but Wang Dehai already has that in his book. If he could cut a piece of the cake from Future Technology, it would fit the Wang family's interest more. But since Jiang Chen did save his life, and practically helped the Wang family, it was not right for him to do this.</br>
</br>
Especially due to the last sentence, Wang Dehai was ashamed. The other person saved his life, but when Wang Linhua proposed to use Linhua Group to acquire Future Technology, he didn't stop him, but rather he permitted by acquiescence.</br>
</br>
Knowing he was in the wrong, Wang Dehai's face turned red and shifted his gaze away from Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Wang Linhua was at fault in this event. I have talked to him already. But since the unpleasant event didn't happen, could Mr. Jiang let this go?" Wang Dehai asked slowly.</br>
</br>
[Let it go? You are trying to get out of this. There is plenty of opportunities in the future to teach you a lesson.]</br>
</br>
Wang Dehai nodded as he picked up a document from the table. He lightly coughed before he started reading.</br>
</br>
"For Future Technology's outstanding contribution to national security in the high tech industry, on behalf of the Wanghai city government, I am honored to praise..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly waited for him to read through the bullsh*t before he accepted the certificate.</br>
</br>
"So that's all for today?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Wang Dehai nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then I'll go back." Jiang Chen smiled and picked the pile of documents before leaving for the door.</br>
</br>
"Wait." Wang Dehai abruptly stopped Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hmm?" Jiang Chen stopped and turned around.</br>
</br>
"The thing you got from Zhou Zihao... Is it that?" Wang Dehai asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"I don't know what you are talking about." Jiang Chen shrugged as he smiled at Wang Dehai.</br>
</br>
The two silently gazed at each other.</br>
</br>
"How do you plan to use that thing."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I will never use that thing." Pausing, Jiang Chen then continued, "Of course, on the basis that the Wang family remains restraint."</br>
</br>
Then, Jiang Chen disregarded the gloom on Wang Dehai's face and left his office.</br>
</br>
But what Wang Dehai didn't see was, the instant he turned around, a contemptuous smile appeared Jiang Chen's face before it vanished.</br>
</br>
[Linhua Group?]</br>
</br>
[The sentence "I hope you don't regret this" is not merely a joke.]</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 237: Will you kindly step into the jar?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Inside Linhua Building.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua sat in front of the office table with a gloomy look on his face.</br>
</br>
The meat that was almost in his hands somehow slipped away and he couldn't do anything about it. His mood was obviously not too pleasant because Jiang Chen suddenly introduced the smart drone control system 1.0 which completely disrupted his plans.</br>
</br>
The domestic real estate on the market was contracting due to the high price, but no market became apparent by the day. Linhua Group during 2008 was indeed very profitable, but it was going downhill. With the population aging and the growth of excessive housing, the downhill trend to the real estate market was almost irreversible.</br>
</br>
Even with the introduction of policies such as decreased interest rate, the second child, it was still too difficult to reserve the inevitable trend of the downfall to the real estate market.</br>
</br>
Just like the previous glorious, but now doomed coal industry, the real estate market will have to accept its inevitable fate. This point could be demonstrated by the shaky results on the financial report of Linhua group. While still in the positive, but their margin was getting narrower.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua, who could foresee the end to this industry, obviously was not going to wait for his own death.</br>
</br>
There were only two choices in front of Linhua Group.</br>
</br>
One to expand to the international market, two to shift into a different industry.</br>
</br>
It was challenging to expand into the international market, for simple reasons. Due to the identity of the largest shareholder of Linhua group. While this skin worked well domestically, it didn't fair too well internationally. The current status quo is, to slice a share of the cake in the international market, then they would have to use the money to do so. Although Linhua Group had money, they were not like CNPC who could not care about losses and depend on government for subsidization. This route could work but at too high of a cost.</br>
</br>
Especially because the international market was not within the territory of the Wang family, this increased too many variables for investment. The people back home didn't dare to trick you, but it would a different case outside. Once on the international stage, they may not withstand the test of capital.</br>
</br>
As a careful consideration, Wang Linhua didn't use the first option.</br>
</br>
On the second hand, it was easier to shift to a different industry. Just like the mine owners that sold the unprofitable mines, some invested in sports, some in movies, even some entered the real estate market to eat "the leftovers."</br>
</br>
While Linhua Group was prepared to enter the entertainment industry. But at this time, Future Technology's rapid growth gave Wang Linhua a tempting idea.</br>
</br>
One software, a few servers, thirty-something programmers and sales would do. Once the software received recognition by the market, cash would be flying in.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although Wang Linhua was lusting for Future Technology's profit, he consciously knew that tech was an industry where risk and reward both existed. Even Buffet didn't dare to invest in it, which meant that the risk and reward were not proportional.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he had some scandalous ideas.</br>
</br>
High risk, it only referred to the tech company that hasn't managed to secure a stable source of revenue generation. For Future Technology that already has done so, there was no risk. As long as he controlled Future Technology, and use this as the point to enter the tech industry, Linhua Group would smoothly complete its transition!</br>
</br>
Future Technology's operating condition was smooth, had stable cash flow, the capitalists at Wall Street with bundles of cash could not exchange away Jiang Chen's share. But for Wang Linhua it was not a big deal. In this country, having money meant nothing, or there wouldn't be so many people with money leaving.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen didn't manage to leave yet. Future Technology's primary operation was in the country. Before it could even enter the world stage, it was the perfect opportunity to make his move!</br>
</br>
As long as he controlled Future Technology, he could enjoy the current profits and lead Future Technology to expand into the military tech field. Military artificial intelligence happened to be the strategic focus of the national defense now. It would not only increase the Wang family's stake politically, but it could also allow the core asset of the Wang family smoothly transition through the downward trend in the real estate market.</br>
</br>
Two birds with one stone.</br>
</br>
Because of this, Wang Dehai would permit his action.</br>
</br>
But unfortunately, his plan fell through.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua rubbed his sore temple and picked up a document on the table. He forced himself to focus on the work at hand and not think about those bothersome things.</br>
</br>
But then, there was a knock at the door.</br>
</br>
With a frown, Wang Linhua cleared his throat.</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
His secretary walked in with a pile of documents in his hands.</br>
</br>
"What good thing just happened? You are so happy," Seeing the smile on the secretary's face, Wang Linhua's eyebrows jumped as he said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"President Wang, the company just received a big project." Calming his excitement, his secretary Zheng Kai spoke with a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
"How big of a project?" Wang Linhua slanted his mouth as he leaned against the chair.</br>
</br>
Big project? The number of buildings yet to be sold are almost rotting in Linhua Group's hands. Knowing that it was hard to sell houses and that the stock market seemed to be rising again, who would save the housing market now?</br>
</br>
"It's a project overseas. With initial estimates totaling over ten billion USD!"</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Wang Linhua's eyes widened as he immediately sat up.</br>
</br>
"What did you say? An overseas project? How much?"</br>
</br>
"Ten billion USD..."</br>
</br>
He stood up from his chair, circled the table, and ripped the documents from the secretary's hand as he looked emotionally at the documents in hand.</br>
</br>
"Pannu Island's 680 square kilometers tourism, commercial as well as basic infrastructure agreement... Johnny International?" Wang Linhua was more and more excited as he read through the document, but when he saw the company name, he paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
He never saw this name before.</br>
</br>
"They have passed through the credit check for the first phase of construction fee. It is rumored that the party behind them is a South African Gold company, they have two mines that could be used as collateral for the loan, so it should be fairly trustworthy." Zheng Kai saw the skepticism on Wang Linhua's face as he rushed to explain.</br>
</br>
He had heard about Pannu Islands before; a small country with relatively rich tourism resources but lacked infrastructure development. The foreign relation of Pannu and Hua was just stable, although they have a consulate in Wanghai city, they still rented an apartment in Shangjing as an embassy.</br>
</br>
Because they didn't have the money to build the basic infrastructure, they naturally could not attract investments. But if capitals were willing to heavily invest in the island country on the Pacific, everything would be different.</br>
</br>
Based on this proposal's content, the project would be divided into four phases. After the completion of the first phase, Johnny International would pay the first phase of two billion USD in agreement, then the remaining eight billion would be paid at the end of the construction. As to the guarantee fee of two billion, it would be paid using the land near the construction zone of 110 square kilometers, a 70 square kilometers adjacent island as well as cash.</br>
</br>
Paying with land pleased Wang Linhua perfectly.</br>
</br>
Without exaggeration, once the ten billion USD infrastructure is completed, the land sold to him at a discount would more than double in price! As to whether the land would be developed by themselves, or sold to other people, it would be profit regardless.</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua's hands trembled.</br>
</br>
Even if he had seen the ups and downs in life, a ten billion dollar contract was a first.</br>
</br>
This contract, for the Linhua Group in the stagnant domestic market, was an opportunity.</br>
</br>
He didn't get overblown by the amazing deal. Inhaling a few times to calm his breath, Wang Linhua told his secretary in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"Pannu Islands' political environment, Johnny International's background, I need you to give me a detailed report in two days. Do your job and your bonus doubles."</br>
</br>
There was too much unknown in the international market. Without a detailed investigation, a wrong investment could send the company crashing. Even if the proposal was attractive, Wang Linhua didn't let his guard down because of this.</br>
</br>
But when he saw the two gold mines as collateral in the appendix of the proposal, as well as the asset verification from the UA side, he began to feel floaty.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Hearing his bonus could double, Zheng Kai was ecstatic and immediately left the office.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Zheng Kai closed the door, Wang Linhua threw the folded documents on the table, the gloom on his face vanished.</br>
</br>
[This is god helping me! How did that saying go...Misfortune may actually be a blessing.]</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua almost wanted to shout to the sky to unleash his thrilled emotion.</br>
</br>
Although he lost the opportunity to control Future Technology, there was a major breakthrough in the international market.</br>
</br>
After taking a few more deep breaths, Wang Linhua grabbed his phone and called the person responsible for managing the Wang family asset.</br>
</br>
Once the ten billion USD deal is revealed, Linhua Group's market capitalization would without a doubt double! Because of his pessimism towards the real estate market, he used the bull market before to decrease Linhua Group's holding. But now, he must increase his holding again through the secondary market. He must do this before the details are revealed so that he can increase the holding of the Wang family in Linhua Group and maximize their gains!</br>
</br>
Wang Linhua excitedly licked his lips before he sat back in his chair. He picked up the phone, called the manager of each department as he planned for a brief meeting.</br>
</br>
They must win this contract!</br>
</br>
But not even in his dreams could he imagine Jiang Chen had dug a giant hole for him, waiting for him - the Wang family to jump inside.</br>
</br>
(1) Will you kindly step into the jar? - Try what you have devised against others.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 238: The Bodyguard from the General Staff Department</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"I already called that Irish guy, that bastard must have started already. Hehe, you are such a bad person. Linhua Group would cry in a few months." Robert cussed in jest.</br>
</br>
"I just want the greedy people to pay for their sin," Jiang Chen shrugged and said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
The Wang clan would never imagine that Johnny International was just a puppet established by Jiang Chen through Robert. Once he subverted the current government of Pannu Islands, that Johnny International would declare bankruptcy, and the contract between Wang Linhua and Johnny International would become nothing but a piece of paper.</br>
</br>
This 10 billion USD project would leave the Wang family in ruins.</br>
</br>
"So when do you plan to leave?" Robert asked.</br>
</br>
"I may have to delay until January. I'm afraid I can only stay in the country this month," Jiang Chen uttered helplessly.</br>
</br>
"Restraining order? I understand," Robert smirked.</br>
</br>
When he came back to the UA from Iraq, he was put on a restraining order by FBA until he was able to close the shell company in Saudi and dispose of the tanker that was used to transport crude oil. It was only then that his name was finally removed from the blacklists off major airline companies.</br>
</br>
"Only a month. It would get better after this month. How's training at the base?" Jiang Chen asked, yawning.</br>
</br>
"Already done. According to Ivan's report, these rookies are now resembling a real soldier."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. Once the training was completed, they could proceed to the next plan.</br>
</br>
"What about that Irish guy?"</br>
</br>
"Superb acting. He played the antagonist role to the extreme," Robert reported passionately. "Other than the politicians he bribed, not one person on the Pannu Islands doesn't hate that guy."</br>
</br>
"Then according to the script, the savior should be there soon." The corner of Jiang Chen's lips curved.</br>
</br>
"That's right, so you have to be faster."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone, stretched, put the satellite phone in his pocket, and leaned against the chair.</br>
</br>
This month would be relaxing, however, starting tomorrow, he would no longer be able to stay home.</br>
</br>
Only by wandering outside and allowing those skeptics to see for themselves that the program was truly not his creation would he could be considered safe.</br>
</br>
This was very easy as long as those people testified that he hadn't touched the computer at this period of time, and he wouldn't have the "time to commit the crime." Then he would suddenly come up with a finished product a month later, those skeptics would naturally be discredited.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought if he should call Liu Yao to tell her the delay in their vacation to Pannu Islands, there was suddenly a gentle knock on the door.</br>
</br>
"Is there anything you need me for?" Jiang Chen turned around and saw Ayesha standing at the door.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Someone wants to see you," Ayesha said softly.</br>
</br>
[He's here already?]</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I see, leave it up to me." Smiling, Jiang Chen got up from the chair.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
A black Santana parked outside the courtyard of the mansion, a man standing like a statue stood outside the steel gate.</br>
</br>
1.8m high, slightly dark skin, with a sharp buzz cut, facial feature could only be described as ordinary. The vintage grey jacket made him even more ordinary. But if one underestimated his ability, without a doubt, they would pay the price for that...especially those spies from the hostile force.</br>
</br>
Sauntering to the gate, Jiang Chen gave him a friendly smile and opened the door for him.</br>
</br>
"General Staff Department, Dagger," the man meticulously said and extended his right hand.</br>
</br>
The man called Dagger was the bodyguard that the bigwigs had sent to protect Jiang Chen's safety. One part was to protect him, the other to keep an eye on him. But Jiang Chen didn't mind since it was only for a month.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen," Jiang Chen he said in a casual tone and shook his hand.</br>
</br>
The moment they hand shook, Dagger's appeared astonished as he stared at Jiang Chen is disbelief.</br>
</br>
In response to Dagger's face's bewilderment, Jiang Chen merely smiled and let go.</br>
</br>
"Had Mr. Jiang worked with guns before?" Dagger asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"I played with them overseas. I don't think this breaks any law." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Dagger did not respond and nodded, and then he took out a document from his inner pocket and handed it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"From today onwards, your safety will be my responsibility until the program is developed and transferred to Zhongxin High Tech. If you have any concerns or if you're displeased with my performance, you can call the number provided in the document to report to my superior. I will do my best to do my work to the best of my ability without affecting your daily life, but I hope Mr. Jiang can also cooperate with me. In the next 30 days, please avoid traveling in crowded places as much as possible, so as to reduce the difficulty of my work.</br>
</br>
"Will I encounter any danger?" Jiang Chen frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
"We don't rule out the possibility of encountering external force's agents," Dagger responded tersely.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He had already expected this situation to occur until the completion of the program. If anyone wanted to prevent Hua from getting their hands on "UAV's Smart Control System 1.0," targeting him would be the easiest choice.</br>
</br>
But after this month, the situation should be a lot safer.</br>
</br>
"No problem, do I need to provide you with a room?"</br>
</br>
The man called Dagger shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No need, I will maintain a certain distance with you, Mr. Jiang can pretend I don't exist."</br>
</br>
"Then where will you stay?" Jiang Chen chuckled.</br>
</br>
Dagger pointed at the black Santana behind him.</br>
</br>
"I'll be okay in the car. Call me if you encounter any special situation."</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen shrugged. Just as he was about to say that was all, he suddenly remembered and asked, "What about my family?"</br>
</br>
"Rest assured, our people are already secretly protecting them," Dagger answered positively.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen himself was not too scared of the threat of the external force. As for individual combat power, no one in this world could match him, even the agent from General Staff Department named Dagger. The only thing he was anxious about was his family in the far Hucheng.</br>
</br>
Although Dagger had already stated that they were protecting them, Jiang Chen was still worried.</br>
</br>
The original plan was to go home in New Year to give the two elders a surprise, as well as carefully explain his current situation. Since some words were better off said in person rather than on phone.</br>
</br>
But now, it seemed to be necessary to head back earlier.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen briefly explained his recent itinerary to Dagger before he returned to the mansion.</br>
</br>
To avoid unnecessary trouble, Jiang Chen stored the virtual reality training chamber in the storage dimension. With nothing to do after Ayesha completed her two-hour training program, she started watching TV.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Jiang Chen came back, she lowered the TV volume and asked, "Is it done?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. What do you think about the ability of that person?" Jiang Chen was naturally referring to Dagger.</br>
</br>
"Weaker than me." Only after a moment's thought, Ayesha came to this conclusion, and then she went on without hesitation, "At least when I was observing him, he didn't notice my gaze at all."</br>
</br>
If Dagger heard this comment, he would probably have the urge to commit suicide by smashing his head onto a block of tofu.</br>
</br>
"My Ayesha is already this strong?" Jiang Chen praised her and couldn't resist rubbing the brown hair.</br>
</br>
Her gorgeous face blushing, Ayesha timidly lowered her head.</br>
</br>
"After all, I have already completed at least 500 times of training sessions in the system... Is that level of bodyguard necessary? I alone should be enough to protect you."</br>
</br>
Even for a veteran soldier, it would be impossible to complete 500 missions in peacetime. Considering realism of the virtual reality system and the increase in physical ability due to the genetic vaccine, the experienced agent Dagger would naturally lose to Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Somethings may not be what they appear on the surface. Rather than saying that the bodyguard Dagger is here to protect me, it is more fitting to say he is keeping an eye on me." Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
A penetrating light flashed across Ayesha's eyes while she softly uttered lethal words, "Do you want me to get rid of him?"</br>
</br>
"Ahem, that would cause more trouble, so just ignore him for now. It'll be difficult this month, but after this month, we can then move."</br>
</br>
"Move? This place is not good?" Ayesha asked as she tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"It's not about good or bad—there are too many things to consider here," Jiang Chen explained in simple terms as he didn't want to do too much explanation about this issue.</br>
</br>
Ayesha half-knowingly nodded.</br>
</br>
In regard to the trouble that Jiang Chen was facing, she didn't really understand. But she was clear on one point: regardless of he faced, as long as he needed her, she was willing to raise her gun for him.</br>
</br>
Just like what happened in Veit.</br>
</br>
With her hands encircling Jiang Chen's neck, her blue eyes gazed softly at the black pupils.</br>
</br>
"Wherever you will go, I'll always be with you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt his heart being filled with warmth. Heart throbbing, Jiang Chen bit the lovely, red lips.</br>
</br>
The quiet atmosphere lasted for a long while before the two parted.</br>
</br>
"I plan to go back to Hucheng tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"Hucheng? Your hometown?" She vaguely recalled Jiang Chen mentioning it before.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I will stay there for a month. Take some change of clothes with you."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Ayesha's face all the sudden turned red as a rare hint of coyness crept into her voice.</br>
</br>
"Could...could I meet your parents?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused before a troubled look appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
[It's okay, but it feels...]</br>
</br>
"Forget it if it's troublesome," Ayesha softly said, albeit slightly disappointed.</br>
</br>
She didn't want him to feel troubled.</br>
</br>
"No, not troublesome at all..but you have to promise me one thing." Jiang Chen opened his mouth looking somewhat awkward.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" The blue pupils began to show an excited look.</br>
</br>
"When my parents ask you about your age, say that you're over 18..."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 239: The Glorious Return</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hucheng, a tranquil and beautiful small town that sat on the east side of Fanyang Lake.</br>
</br>
Compared to a major metropolitan like Wanghai City, the pace of life here was slow. There were no towering skyscrapers, crowded streets, nor an endless stream of traffic on the streets. The buildings along the streets were only four or five stories high with first floor shops. This type of scenery was hard to see in Wanghai city.</br>
</br>
After being used to the propensity of the big city, occasionally breathing the air of a small town indeed was a unique experience.</br>
</br>
Watching the familiar but strange scenes outside the window, Jiang Chen somehow felt melancholic about coming home.</br>
</br>
Since he entered Wanghai university five years ago, he rarely came back. After his graduation, he didn't even go home. He calculated, since the last time he came, it has been more than two years.</br>
</br>
With the dream of building his own career in the big city, as well as being a proud university student, he swore when he graduated that without becoming successful, he will never come back. Now that he thought about it, when he graduated, he didn't live the best life.</br>
</br>
But life is always filled with countless coincidences. The life full of hardships only lasted for a year before his life became a fantastic journey that was almost impossible to imagine. Not only did he drive a luxury car accompanied by a beauty, a Senata from the General Staff Department followed him.</br>
</br>
Not even the governor of the province could receive this type of treatment.</br>
</br>
When the car passed through the high school he attended, the familiar gate as well as the aged face in the security room flashed by. Looking at the rusty school emblem, Jiang Chen felt even more melancholic.</br>
</br>
"Should we stop here for a bit?" Ayesha noticed the change in Jiang Chen's expression as she caringly asked.</br>
</br>
"No need, I want to go home earlier." Taking a deep breath, Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
The people he longed for the most was without a doubt his parents.</br>
</br>
Finally coming home...</br>
</br>
Looking at the familiar street, a genuine smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Ayesha scanned the GPS and accelerated.</br>
</br>
The black Senata following them also picked up the speed as it followed Jiang Chen's Maybach without missing a beat.</br>
</br>
It was a young man sitting in the driver seat. He looked sharp, but also unsettled. He looked like he was new to the job. The man called Dagger sat in the passenger seat. With eyes narrowed, he looked like he was taking a nap. But the people who know him all knew, if you thought he was asleep, you would be absolutely wrong.</br>
</br>
"Business people are so damn rich," Miao Jun holding the steering wheel stared at the Maybach and said enviously.</br>
</br>
Living in a mansion, driving a luxury car.</br>
</br>
But envy was envy. With his meager salary, there was no hope of buying a car like that.</br>
</br>
</br>
Dagger opened his eyes to glance at his partner before continuing to close his eyes. His voice sounded reminiscent.</br>
</br>
"Experience life more when you are young. When the time is right, someone will ask you if you will leave or get promoted. If you decide to leave, once you take off your uniform, you can go work as a bodyguard for rich people. The money you earn is enough to buy one."</br>
</br>
The people wealthy enough to hire ex-agents as bodyguards would not cheap out on the money. Since the bodyguards' loyalty is connected to their life. The comrades that he worked with within the General Staff Department that chose to leave all made enough money not only for a car but a lovely house. But him, with all forms of injuries, only the shiny badges brought some comfort.</br>
</br>
But he didn't regret anything. Because he is a soldier, the moment he enlisted, he decided to continue down this route.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun looked at Dagger in shock and laughed in embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"We'll see. Leaving the army is still too far away."</br>
</br>
Dagger cracked a smile, and the wrinkles on his face were squished together.</br>
</br>
Although his partner named Miao Jun didn't say anything, he knew the young man would decide to leave the army. It was a different time now. Nothing wrong to consider more for yourself. There were only foolish men like him who would contribute his entire life to the greater good.</br>
</br>
"Not early, make up your mind earlier. Once this mission is completed, your profile will be promoted. If you perform well, it won't be long before someone asks you the question."</br>
</br>
"Haha, Commander Dagger, what do you think about my ability." Miao Jun laughed with a sense of pride in his voice.</br>
</br>
He had the pride of the young generation. Since he was a top student from military school, regardless if it was digital warfare, fighting, or shooting, he obtained A+ in every category. He did have the right to be prideful.</br>
</br>
But Dagger just laughed and said.</br>
</br>
"Enough to be a bodyguard for a small boss, but still too naive for people who fear death."</br>
</br>
He didn't hear the praise he expected to hear. Miao Yun paused for a moment as he made an awkward face.</br>
</br>
"People who fear death?"</br>
</br>
Dagger didn't respond to Miao Jun's question as he closed his eyes and continued to rest.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun glanced at the old commander, displeased.</br>
</br>
[As the newcomer of the new generation, what kind of qualifications do you have as an old man who didn't even go to university to berate me like this?]</br>
</br>
Under this mixture of emotion, he couldn't hide his temper and spoke with an attitude.</br>
</br>
"This is a B level mission, could you take it more seriously?"</br>
</br>
Dagger opened his eyes as he looked dubiously at Miao Yun, he only left a sentence with deeper meanings before he closed his eyes again.</br>
</br>
"The person sitting in the car in front is a person that fears death."</br>
</br>
Miao Jun was confused.</br>
</br>
This means he has a powerful bodyguard?</br>
</br>
[But other than the foreign girl driving, who else is in the car?]</br>
</br>
[Could someone be hiding in the trunk?]</br>
</br>
Dagger peeked at his confused expression and shook his head secretively.</br>
</br>
While this rookie has the abilities to be successful, his observation skill is too weak. As an agent, weak ability doesn't matter. But a flaw in observation is the most critical weakness of all.</br>
</br>
On the car in front, not only was Dagger unable to see the boundary of the VIP being protected, but he also sensed the foreign girl driving the car with a cold expression has abilities that should not be underestimated.</br>
</br>
Although the mission was B, there was no difficulty at all.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Whatever the two people behind them thought, Jiang Chen had no interest at all. Just like what Dagger suggested, he and Ayesha pretended that those two didn't exist.</br>
</br>
It was around half an hour more before the car drove into an old looking neighborhood.</br>
</br>
He parked the car, held onto Ayesha's hand, and stepped onto the familiar concrete stairs.</br>
</br>
When he climbed to the fourth stairs, looking at the old door, he had a bitter smile on his face.</br>
</br>
In three months time, he had sent over one million home. But by the looks of it, mom and dad didn't even touch the money.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen inhaled deeply, raised his hand, and gently knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
Ayesha who stood beside him had a rare frantic expression on her face. Although the franticness was carefully hidden behind her cold mask, when she met Jiang Chen's eyes, her coldness melted away, and her nervousness of "meeting the parents" was exposed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen squeezed her hand as he gave a comforting smile.</br>
</br>
"Don't be nervous, my parents are nice people."</br>
</br>
But even though he was the person saying that he began to feel nervous himself.</br>
</br>
Half a month ago he just told his mom he has no girlfriend, but now he brought a foreign girl back. Would mom and dad be happy or...</br>
</br>
The footsteps behind the door began to approach.</br>
</br>
The door opened.</br>
</br>
Staring at the emotional figure behind the door, Jiang Chen felt his eyes tearing up.</br>
</br>
"Mom!"</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 240"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 240: Mother</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hardship had left its mark of time on that face, seeing the dyed white hair on her temples, Jiang Chen could not help but become teary-eyed.</br>
</br>
"Mom!" Jiang Chen hugged his mom.</br>
</br>
"Little Chen, you're finally back." Embracing her beloved son, Li Xuemei's voice was choked with emotion.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'm back. Your son has grown up," the rim of Jiang Chen's eyes were full emotions as he took a deep breath and said with a tremulous voice.</br>
</br>
"Accomplished or not, you're always my son! Old man, your son is back. Come out and take a look!" Lin Xuemei shouted behind her.</br>
</br>
But there was no response in the room.</br>
</br>
She slapped her forehead and chuckled when it dawned on her. "Look at this memory—I think your dad is probably playing chess in that stone pavilion in the district. You quickly go look for him, since it's almost time to eat. That old man must be showing off with his chess friends, flaunting the house that his dear son had purchased in Wanghai City."</br>
</br>
Due to her old age, her memory was not as good. Jiang Chen was heartbroken while staring at his mother.</br>
</br>
"What's there to boast about me?"</br>
</br>
Although his words sounded humble, a proud smile unconsciously crept into his face.</br>
</br>
"Ok, stop bragging, go get your dad to help me. My little Chen is finally back, so your mom will show off some skills... Eh? This is?" As she spoke, Li Xuemei's eyes suddenly lit up as though she had discovered a treasure while she stared at Ayesha, who was hiding behind Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
A different face, to someone who never left the country, was always an exciting news.</br>
</br>
"I'm Jiang Chen's assistant." Because of trepidation, Ayesha almost bit her tongue.</br>
</br>
Assistant?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process it. It was different from what they had agreed upon. He gazed at the flushed face and facepalmed. It finally dawned on him why would Ayesha change her mind.</br>
</br>
He didn't expect that at the last moment, this girl would be frightened silly...</br>
</br>
But this could also work. It saved him from being "interrogated" by his parents.</br>
</br>
"Assistant?" Li Xuemei looked at her son, baffled.</br>
</br>
Why bring the assistant back? She thought it was a daughter-in-law that her son had brought back. Even if it was a foreigner, she would not mind. Rather, she would be proud of her son.</br>
</br>
Since she grew up in the Reform and Opening period, to the people in their era, being married to a foreigner was something to be proud of.</br>
</br>
"Assistant in my work. Because it's quite hectic in the company and due to some business needs, she has to come back with me. This is Ayesha from UA," Jiang Chen hurriedly explained.</br>
</br>
Strictly speaking. Ayesha is a Syrian, but considering the copious negative news in that area, Jiang Chen didn't want his parents to think too much, so he didn't say her real hometown. The green card was processed by an acquaintance of Robert's, so it would be accurate to say she was a UA citizen.</br>
</br>
</br>
Listening to Jiang Chen's explanation, Li Xuemei thought for a brief moment before she smiled at Ayesha, and then she warmly held her hand. "Come in. I haven't cleaned the house for a while. Please don't take offense."</br>
</br>
"It's, It's okay," Ayesha responded, face reddening.</br>
</br>
"Our little Chen has always been like this. He's pretty slow with the girls—"</br>
</br>
"Ahem! Mom, why are you revealing your son's dark past?" Jiang Chen grumbled and coughed loudly to interrupt his mom from continuing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked embarrassed, but Ayesha wore an interested expression on her face.</br>
</br>
"What dark past!" Li Xuemei rebuked Jiang Chen before once again smiled at Ayesha, saying, "Shasha, let aunt tell you, little Chen has always been courteous since he was young. It's the first time he brought a girl home."</br>
</br>
"Shasha?" Eh, isn't the spelling of a foreign name—"Jiang Chen forced a smile as he wanted to correct his mom's mistake, but Ayesha didn't' seem to mind.</br>
</br>
In regard to the name "Shasha," she appeared to take a liking to it.</br>
</br>
"His first time?" Ayesha had a timid expression.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!" Li Xuemei nodded. She obviously could tell the meaning behind Ayesha's expression. Thinking of her would-be grandchildren, she affectionately took Ayesha's hands and continued cheerfully, "Let me tell you when he was young..."</br>
</br>
Seeing the "mom and daughter-in-law" walking into the room, smiling and laughing, a genuine smile broke on Jiang Chen's face.</br>
</br>
Although he was afraid of his mom revealing his "dark past," but when he thought about the happiness on her face, it did not matter anymore.</br>
</br>
As long as she felt happy.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Ayesha began helping Li Xuemei to prepare dinner in the kitchen.</br>
</br>
Speaking of food, it was worth mentioning a small episode that happened between Ayesha and Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, Jiang Chen was concerned about Ayesha's religion. Therefore, he specifically instructed not to deliver pork to the organic food company that delivered vegetable and meat to his mansion.</br>
</br>
Until one day, when Ayesha and Jiang Chen grabbed a takeout ham pizza, did the pork taboo was finally resolved.</br>
</br>
According to Ayesha's argument, when she became Jiang Chen's woman, in fact, she had already violated the doctrine, and automatically abandoned her religious identity, therefore her diet taboo would naturally no longer exist. But when it comes to pork, she still preferred beef and lamb, and this was purely because of eating habits, rather than taboo.</br>
</br>
Witnessing the death of her parents at the hands of religious zealots, she had long begun to question her religion. Thus, towards her husband becoming an atheist, she didn't feel any repulsion at all. Particularly, after living in this highly secular state for some time, she began to get accustomed to living just for one person.</br>
</br>
In fact, Ayesha's change was noticeable, except Jiang Chen never really paid attention to it. For example, if Ayesha was really religious, she would be seen praying several times in a day, but Ayesha never prayed at home.</br>
</br>
Seeing that Ayesha and his mom had such a good relationship already, Jiang Chen left the time to the two as he went downstairs alone.</br>
</br>
Downstairs, he met Dagger and Miao Yun leaning against the Santana chewing on takeout food.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to come up for a meal?" Seeing the poor guys, Jiang Chen invited with a smile.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun wanted to accept, but Dagger shook his head.</br>
</br>
"There are strict rules within the organization, so just pretend we don't exist."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged and no longer insisted.</br>
</br>
"Suit yourself, but I don't understand how you guys are so obvious downstairs... Is this really okay?"</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Dagger cracked a smile.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Should agents go hide in the bushes? Those are assassins, not bodyguards."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed, he shook his head and walked to the stone pavilion.</br>
</br>
Dagger continued digging into his plastic container of fish-flavored minced pork with rice.</br>
</br>
"Do we not need to follow?" Finished, Miao Jun threw the container into the garbage and dusted his hands.</br>
</br>
Dagger chewed slowly. After swallowing the food in his mouth, he nonchalantly said," No need. This neighborhood is safe."</br>
</br>
Miao Jun immediately realized after taking a moment to think, he awkwardly laughed." People on the top didn't even tell us—"</br>
</br>
"Because there's no need," Dagger interrupted his partner's words, throwing the squeaky clean lunch box into the trash, "That's why I said, there is a lot more you need to learn."</br>
</br>
VIP was already under protection, how could his relatives' security be overlooked?</br>
</br>
If anyone dared to make moves here, it was no different than running straight into a gun.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 241: Jiang Jianguo Eager For Grand Children</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The district was not big, but the square was extremely lively, and it was probably due to the fact that the residents were mostly comprised of the elderly and children. After all, there were less and less young people interested in outdoor activities these days.</br>
</br>
Those who lived in the community were mostly employees of the nearby well-known state-owned steel factory. Years passed, the generation that had devoted their youth to the industrial foundation of the republic had become old, and this led to the community becoming a gigantic retirement home.</br>
</br>
Hucheng's young generation would often choose to live somewhere closer to the metropolis, near Hucheng or even further and more prominent city to search for opportunities, and they would leave their children to their parents. As such, leaving behind children and the elderly became a common scenario in this generation.</br>
</br>
Of course, these were off-topic.</br>
</br>
Those who were accomplished outside were rare. Therefore, when Jiang Chen's parents heard that their son managed to build his own business and was even able to buy a house, it was no wonder his parents were extremely gratified.</br>
</br>
The only thing that left Jiang Chen's parents worried was the matter of grandchildren.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen not in a hurry to get married this early, his parents were obviously not satisfied with the idea. His classmates in junior high, their kids had long been able to walk. And this included the prom queen of his junior high, though she no longer possessed her previous allure...</br>
</br>
In the center of the square, a few old women were getting ready to dance.</br>
</br>
While passing through, Jiang Chen walked to the Stone Pavilion where his mom told him to go.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Check! Haha," Jiang Jianguo laughed out and slapped the chess piece in his hand on the board in high spirits.</br>
</br>
The chess mate sitting across him had his eyebrows furrowed, but then soon looked relieved and exclaimed, "What a nice move, I thought my rook would be able to regain lost ground, but I didn't expect this bishop to take my rook out."</br>
</br>
"Tough Victory, tough victory. It's s getting late, and if I don't go back now, I'm afraid my wife will come here and made me go home to eat," Jiang Jianguo said humbly and waved his hands.</br>
</br>
"Ah, Old Jiang, you're lucky. Your son is accomplished now, your chess skill has improved, and your body is healthier than before. If my son is half as accomplished as yours, I'll laugh in my dream." Zhang Xinye sighed.</br>
</br>
His son went to Hongcheng to work, but his monthly salary could barely cover his expenses after the mortgage. Although they were close to Hucheng, they only had time to visit in New Year time. The only thing he was satisfied with was his three years old grandson. Although a bit naughty, he was born healthy.</br>
</br>
"Old Zhang don't sigh. Your grandson can already recite poems, compared to my grandson who still plays with building blocks all day long despite being four years old already." Although it sounded like Yan Zhengwen was complaining, from the big smile on his face, his affection towards his naughty grandson was quite evident.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, Old Jiang, when will you get your son to give you a grandson?" Old Zhang jested.</br>
</br>
In the topic of grandson, Jiang Jianguo's had nothing to say...</br>
</br>
"Don't even talk about grandson, that kid doesn't even have a wife yet."</br>
</br>
"Tha couldn't be... Logically speaking, now that little Jiang'has a house and opened his own company, matchmakers in Hucheng should be forming a long line. What do the city girls think?" Old Yan touched his mustache, looking baffled.</br>
</br>
Since the elderly were not using the Internet, they were obviously not aware that the little Jiang they were referring to was not only affectionately called as the national husband by the female fans on Weibo, he also had an ambiguous relationship with a female celebrity…</br>
</br>
Without exaggeration, if Jiang Chen would really post his intention to seek marriage in Weibo, those who wanted to warm his bed (1) would form a long line.</br>
</br>
"Old Liu, who works at a facility service, has a daughter who isn't married yet. She's also a university student who has just graduated this year. Why don't I help you talk to him about her?" Old Zhang asked tentatively.</br>
</br>
"There's also the daughter of Old Xia. She just graduated this year. I heard she is also in Wanghai City working at a big company. I think it will definitely work to match these two together!" Chen Weidong, who had just lost a chess game, also made his idea known to his friend.</br>
</br>
"Sigh. It's too early to say that," Old Jiang let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
"How's it too early? It's almost New Year, Your son will be back this year, right?" Old Zhang asked.</br>
</br>
"Yes, right now there are more men than women. Didn't you listen to the news? By 2020, there will be 20 million more men than women that it will be harder to get married by then." Old Yan, who was wearing a pair of spectacles, was a technician in a steel factory and enjoyed reading news.</br>
</br>
"Only 20 million, yet our population is over a billion," Old Zhang scoffed.</br>
</br>
"Fool, only less than 200 million need to get married. This 20 million makes up 10 percent of…"</br>
</br>
Listening to his old friends' banter, Jiang Jianguo looked worried. What if his son really couldn't find a wife? Now that the house is built, but without a grandson, what kind of sad story is this?</br>
</br>
Jiang Jianguo made up his mind and quickly pulled Old Jiang.</br>
</br>
"How is Old Liu's daughter?"</br>
</br>
"I have seen her before...extremely beautiful," Old Zhang said cheerily.</br>
</br>
"Then you have to help me out. I can't just wait for that kid to make his move," Jiang Jianguo urgently said.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Old Jiang can't sit around any longer. Okay! I will help you out on this one!"</br>
</br>
"And Xia Donghua's daughter as well…"</br>
</br>
"I'll go talk with old Xia. He is part of our technical department, so it's easy for me to talk to him about this. Haha, Old Jiang, if this works out, you have to treat me to a bottle of wine," Old Ye chuckled.</br>
</br>
"No problem, it's just a wine. If my kid really likes the girl, I'll treat you guys to ten bottles!" Old Jiang promised enthusiastically.</br>
</br>
"Then I'm lucky, I didn't help at all, and I get to drink alcohol," Old Chen said gleefully.</br>
</br>
"Eh? Is that Little Jiang?" the sharp-eyed Old Zhang craned his neck to take a look.</br>
</br>
Pausing for a second, Jiang Jianguo wanted to say he should get a pair of glasses like old Yan, but when he turned around, he was flabbergasted.</br>
</br>
"Dad! I'm back!" Looking at the familiar figure, Jiang Chen's eyes became moist, his voice was also shaking.</br>
</br>
"Son, this kid! You finally remembered to come back?" Looking at his son, Jiang Jianguo's eyes became teary. Although his words were harsh, he hugged Jiang Chen's shoulder and patted him vigorously nonetheless.</br>
</br>
"Not bad, stronger, good, good…" After saying several good words, his voice sounded choked.</br>
</br>
Being deeply aware of their old friend's tendency to save face, if someone he knew saw this emotional scene, he would be too embarrassed to play chess within a fortnight. Thus, the three friends bade goodbye.</br>
</br>
"Old Jiang, my wife is here, I'll be going ahead now."</br>
</br>
"Same for me, haha, I still haven't bought the egg my wife asked me to buy. I'll take my leave I'll leave the chess to you."</br>
</br>
"Haha, I'll go too. I will not disturb you two.'</br>
</br>
"Uncle Wang, Uncle Liu, Uncle Yan, I will go visit you another day," Jiang Chen promised sincerely.</br>
</br>
All of them worked at the steel factory, Jiang Chen remembered when he was young, Jiang Jianguo often took him to visit them.</br>
</br>
"Haha, little Jiang is accomplished now, yet he can still remember us…"</br>
</br>
After they said their greetings, the three elderly left.</br>
</br>
Though he had a lot to say to his son, his throat moved for a while, but no words came out.</br>
</br>
Thousands of words would not equate to seeing his own son.</br>
</br>
"Dad, mom asked me to tell you to go home to eat."</br>
</br>
When he heard "dad," Jiang Jianguo suddenly felt somewhere in his heart was constricting.</br>
</br>
Ecstatic, Jiang Jianguo patted his son's shoulder. He was so emotional that he words became incoherent.</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay! Let's go home and eat!"</br>
</br>
(1) Warm his bed is an internet way of saying wanting to sleep with him.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Dinner was very sumptuous.</br>
</br>
They were Jiang Chen's favorite—potatoes, roast pork, beef with green pepper, and fresh and tender steamed carp.</br>
</br>
Having been able to savor the familiar taste again, Jiang Chen devoured the food as though he would swallow his tongue along with it. He ate three bowls of rice before he was satiated.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the side, Ayesha secretly memorized Jiang Chen's favorite dishes and made up her mind to learn from Aunt Mei so she can cook for him every day.</br>
</br>
Speaking of Ayesha, she almost replaced Jiang Chen's position as the center of attention on the dinner table.</br>
</br>
When his parents realized that the foreign girl with brown hair and blue eyes spoke perfect Han and had a gentle personality to boot, they warmly welcomed her. Especially Li Xuemei, she constantly winked at Jiang Chen, who was busy eating his food. She wanted him to treat her more affectionately.</br>
</br>
As a woman herself, she was acutely aware that the relationship between the two was very unusual. At the very least, the foreign girl has affection towards Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's worry was nevertheless excessive. Li Xuemei, who hadn't met a foreigner before, could not discern Ayesha's age at all. She only felt the girl's skin was fair and pale and possessed a relatively slender figure, and concluded that all foreigners probably look this way.</br>
</br>
Simply put, she was pleased with Ayesha who could potentially become her daughter-in-law.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Jianguo didn't think too highly of a foreign wife. He wanted to get a grandson soon to flaunt in front of his chess buddies. If his son took a foreign wife, what if his daughter-in-law's side of the family took his grandson away? It would be difficult to see his grandson across the Pacific Ocean.</br>
</br>
Having never left the country and surfed the web much, he naturally didn't know that people overseas didn't have a habit of taking care of their grandchildren.</br>
</br>
After dinner, Li Xuemei had practically revealed all the embarrassing childhood stories of Jiang Chen to Ayesha before walking to the kitchen. Ayesha who had read through the etiquette in Han, timidly followed behind her and washed the dishes with her.</br>
</br>
This action naturally scored high points in the two elderly's eyes. Jiang Jianguo, who was slightly unwilling before, couldn't help but feel more pleased.</br>
</br>
While the two women stayed in the kitchen, the two men sat on the living room sofa, watching TV while bragging.</br>
</br>
After saying a few words, Jiang Jianguo suddenly put on a stern face and stared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Little Chen, be honest, when do you plan to get married?"</br>
</br>
"Married? It's still early—" Jiang Chen stated casually.</br>
</br>
"Not early at all! Your uncle Wang, who always put you on his back, had a grandson who already knows how to recite poems!" Jiang Jianguo said desperately, his eyes widening upon hearing that his son had no intention to get married yet,</br>
</br>
</br>
"Dad, don't rush things. Don't you want to enjoy life for a few more years?" Jiang Chen asked, slightly embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Towards becoming a father, he was not mentally prepared at all. How to bear the responsibilities of becoming a father? How to educate the child? He had never given these questions a thought before.</br>
</br>
And he was not really anxious about the issue of having children.</br>
</br>
With the advent of technology in the apocalypse, modifying the somatic DNA to increase life expectancy was no longer impossible. Though it could not achieve eternal life, it was bound to extend life expectancy to one or two hundred years, and it would be enough time to wait for the possibility of eternal life. Once the civilization in the apocalypse has been rebuilt, it would no longer be a dream.</br>
</br>
Since there was no need to consider aging, the necessity to pass on the genes didn't seem too imminent now.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen even considered that after moving his parents overseas, he would bring some "supplements" from the apocalypse for his parents. Although those who were in advance in years were not suitable to use a genetic vaccine, some anti-aging medicines could work wonders on them.</br>
</br>
"What enjoying life! I only want a grandson." Jiang Jianguo was furious.</br>
</br>
This was a bit difficult now.</br>
</br>
As for his father's willful demand, Jiang Chen found himself troubled. At the moment, he really couldn't think of a way to convince the elderly who was "eager for a son."</br>
</br>
"Ummm, marriage shouldn't be forced. After all, this isn't the old age. There's a famous saying... Right! It is better to be single than to get married to the wrong person."</br>
</br>
"What marrying? You're naturally going to get married!"</br>
</br>
"Isn't that all the same?" Jiang Chen asked, dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Seeing that his son refused to compromise, Jiang Jianguo pondered for a moment as he didn't want to push him too hard. If his son thought he was being too pushy, what if he doesn't come home anymore?</br>
</br>
After a moment, Jiang Jianguo said gently, "Okay, you can decide this on your own, but you have to keep marriage in your mind. The purpose of life is to have a career and family. Since you're accomplished now, use the opportunity to find a good wife to avoid problems in the future..."</br>
</br>
"Yes, yes, yes, you're right." Jiang Chen nodded fiercely.</br>
</br>
In short, whatever the elderly said, it would be better to just listen. As for how he would execute it, he had his own plan.</br>
</br>
"That girl..."</br>
</br>
"Ayesha."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, that Ayesha is not bad, but her family is too far. So if there are conflicts over the grandchildren, it will be ugly. So think about it carefully. Old Liu's daughter is not bad —"</br>
</br>
"Dad, do you want me to go on matchmaking dates now?" Jiang Chen smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
"What? You look down on these dates?" Jiang Jianguo's eyes widened. "Your dad married your mom through the dates set up by matchmakers."</br>
</br>
"No, I don't look down on them." Jiang Chen immediately waved his hands to pacify his father.</br>
</br>
[Sigh, what year is it already?]</br>
</br>
"Take some time in the next few days to see them. I already arranged it for you."</br>
</br>
"Okay." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
He would just treat it as making his parents happy. He would go, but he would find a random alibi as an excuse.</br>
</br>
If his date knew, he wondered if she would be angry or not. Without meeting first, the man already thought of ways to get rid of her.</br>
</br>
In the end, Jiang Chen didn't argue so that this subject would be over soon.</br>
</br>
But then, he thought of something.</br>
</br>
"Right, dad. Didn't I send some money home? Why do I feel you haven't used it yet?" Jiang Chen looked around the familiar furniture in the living room and asked.</br>
</br>
"We did use it. In fact, we bought a new Simmons mattress a few days ago," Jiang Jianguo responded dismissively. He didn't seem to want to stay on this topic further.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, don't save money for your son. Bragging aside, I have too much money that I can't possibly spend it anymore," Jiang Chen could not help but say.</br>
</br>
"Can't spend it anymore? Even if you have money, you have to be frugal. You have to be prepared in case of an emergency," Jiang Jianguo lectured and gave Jiang Chen a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"Yes—" Jiang Chen drawled in a feeble voice.</br>
</br>
"Let me ask you, tell me the truth, how's your company doing?" Jiang Chen picked up a cup of tea, drank the tea leaves that he had distributed from his units a few days ago. He was planning to teach his son about some business practices so that he wouldn't offend people or suffered a loss.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes turned, wondering if he said a billion dollar market value, his dad would not believe it. And even if he did, he would probably be scared silly.</br>
</br>
Therefore, after a careful consideration, Jiang Chen gave a really conservative number instead.</br>
</br>
"There are probably several tens of millions."</br>
</br>
Clank!</br>
</br>
The cup fell to the ground and broke.</br>
</br>
It was the third time Jiang Jianguo widened his eyes. He ignored the broken pieces on the ground and stood up.</br>
</br>
"How much?"</br>
</br>
"Around tens of millions... The company is still growing, it's hard to stay the number," Jiang Chen said in a small voice, gulping.</br>
</br>
[Good thing he didn't say billions or else my dad will get a heart attack...]</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Jianguo couldn't process that fact that there was now a millionaire in the family.</br>
</br>
He originally thought that his son only made a few million to solve the housing problem. After all, it was already impressive to go from nothing to a millionaire. He would never imagine that even calling him a billionaire was an understatement.</br>
</br>
After washing the dishes, Li Xuemei picked a guest room for Ayesha, and then took Jiang Jianguo and Jiang Chen into the living room, and seriously watched him.</br>
</br>
"Little Chen, tell me honestly, did you do anything illegal?"</br>
</br>
Li Xuemei was afraid that her son was doing something shady, which enabled him to become a millionaire in just a few months' time. She couldn't think of anything but a bank robbery.</br>
</br>
"How is that possible? Do I look like that type of person?" Jiang Chen gave a wry smile.</br>
</br>
He did rob banks before...but it was the apocalypse, so it was more appropriate to use the term "pick up".</br>
</br>
"Then how did you become a millionaire overnight?" Jiang Jianguo could not help but ask.</br>
</br>
"Develop software...but mostly by offshore operations for an overseas software company." Thinking that there might be other people listening to their conversation, Jiang Chen changed his words halfway through the sentence.</br>
</br>
"Software? Is that the stuff inside the computer? Is it reliable?" Jiang Jianguo widened his eyes, flummoxed.</br>
</br>
He could not understand how those things would make money.</br>
</br>
"It's mainly on the smartphone... Hmm, how should I explain this? Dad, don't worry about how I make money. You should think more about how to spend the money." Jiang Chen tried to explain, but when he remembered that his dad couldn't even figure the smartphone out, he gave up on this idea.</br>
</br>
"As long as you didn't do any illegal... Mom is just worried that you met the wrong kind of people. You have to remember: don't do anything against your conscience. Even if you make less, your conscience will be at ease," Li Xuemei told him as she rubbed Jiang Chen's hair.</br>
</br>
"Okay mom, I know. I'm more than 20 years old and no longer a child," Jiang Chen uttered helplessly.</br>
</br>
"In our eyes, you'll always be a child."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was frozen for a moment, feeling teary.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After the family meeting had ended, Jiang Chen went into the study.</br>
</br>
Because Ayesha was a guest, she slept in Jiang Chen's old bedroom.</br>
</br>
The two elderlies first insisted that they would take the study and leave their bedroom for Jiang Chen, but the latter would not allow his parents to sleep on the sofa. "Threatening" his parent that he would stay in a hotel, he was finally able to persuade his stubborn father and mother, who always doted on him.</br>
</br>
After combining the two sofas together and covering it with thick bedding, it didn't feel worse than a bed.</br>
</br>
In fact, if from the very beginning Ayesha had revealed her relationship with Jiang Chen, he would not be in this predicament. Jiang Chen felt pity at the idea that he was unable to hold the attractive body in his sleep.</br>
</br>
</br>
At about 10 o'clock in the middle of the night, the two elderlies gradually fell asleep.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen estimated it was about time. Thereupon, he sat up, walked to the window, and closed the blinds.</br>
</br>
After getting a fourth-dimensional messenger, he would call Sun Jiao from time to time. Now that he was back to his hometown, according to his agreement with Sun Jiao, he was ready to show them his hometown.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to take his EP out, the door sounded with a soft knock.</br>
</br>
"Come in, I haven't slept yet." Smiling, he didn't need to think to know it was Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Just like what he expected, when the door was pushed open, a gorgeous face peeked inside.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, dressed in pajamas, cautiously entered the room without any noise and closed the door behind her.</br>
</br>
"Did you miss me?" Jiang Chen walked beside her and encircled her slender waist with his hands.</br>
</br>
Her gorgeous face flushed, and her pristine blue eyes flashed with gentleness, but she quickly shook her head and changed into a serious expression.</br>
</br>
"I found this inside the room." Ayesha opened her hand and passed the content to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Stunned, Jiang Chen picked up the three thumbnail-sized black buttons from her hands.</br>
</br>
"And these are?"</br>
</br>
"Bugs."</br>
</br>
Expression turning grim, Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that someone had put the bugs in his house, and this made him utterly furious.</br>
</br>
"Has the location been tracked to determine the location fo the listener?" Jiang Chen asked in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"It's confirmed." Ayesha nodded and continued in a quiet voice, "Do you need me to go check?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen played with the three buttons in his hand and thought for a moment.</br>
</br>
"No need. If we discover those who we shouldn't discover, it would become awkward."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Ayesha nodded before she turned around to return to her room.</br>
</br>
Though she felt that it would be better to get rid of those stalkers, since Jiang Chen said it was not necessary, so be it.</br>
</br>
"Wait," Jiang Chen called out to her just when her hand was at the threshold.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?" Ayesha turned her head.</br>
</br>
"Check me out as well," Jiang Chen requested with a wicked smile.</br>
</br>
Although she didn't know why Jiang Chen was smirking, Ayesha still nodded. She quietly left the room and she came back while carrying a black pen-like device.</br>
</br>
This anti-surveillance detection device is one of the special equipment Jiang Chen had prepared for her. Jiang Chen had purchased it for around 100 crystals at the Sixth Street's market, which was the basic equipment of PAC agents.</br>
</br>
In the future where information channel was not limited to the electromagnetic waves, and anti-reconnaissance measures were emerging endlessly, this device may not be able to 100%, remove the surveillance devices. However, "150 years" into the modern world, there would be no surveillance device that could escape from the scan of this apparatus.</br>
</br>
Just like he had suspected, even the room, where people normally didn't stay, had also been bugged.</br>
</br>
"Only one?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, under the table," Ayesha muttered, then she put away the device and walked to the desk.</br>
</br>
As she bent down and fumbled on the inside of the desk to take a look, Jiang Chen unconsciously swallowed.</br>
</br>
The white nightgown, which previously covered the upper part of her thigh, because of bending, the hem of the clothes was now moving up and down so that the slender and long legs were all but exposed.</br>
</br>
The pale skin was smooth and seductive in the brightness of the moon.</br>
</br>
Along with that view, her underwear was also slightly exposed.</br>
</br>
In front of Jiang Chen, Ayesha had always been unguarded. While she was focusing on searching under the desk, she had no idea how exposed she truly was.</br>
</br>
Soon, she found a button-like device in the inner part the desk between a compartment.</br>
</br>
"I found it. Woo..." Just as she was about to turn her head, her excitement as a result of discovering her target morphed into a fiery blush.</br>
</br>
Caught unaware, Jiang Chen went behind her and embraced her gently.</br>
</br>
"Don't, don't do this. Your parents are just next door..." Ayesha groaned adorably. Nibbling on her lower lips her, eyes became misty in the moonlight.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen refused to let her go. Smirking, his hands wander around as he whispered into her ear, "That's why you better keep your mouth shut and don't make any sound..."</br>
</br>
Like a timid rabbit, Ayesha nodded, wearing a fierce blush on her face...</br>
</br>
A touch of cloud drifted by, veiling the moonlight ever so slightly.</br>
</br>
Even the moon in the night sky could not bear to take a look.</br>
</br>
A repressed piece of musical composition started playing inadvertently.</br>
</br>
Not until the clock ticked quietly for two hours did the night return to its former tranquility.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 244: If people don't showoff, what's difference compared to a salted fish?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
These days, Jiang Chen had been very free.</br>
</br>
Despite finding those surveillance devices in his room, he didn't bother to care who did these vile things. Everyday he just chatted with his parents, took Ayesha to the places where he spent his childhood, took several photos with his mobile phone and sent it to the three people in the apocalypse to satisfy their curiosity.</br>
</br>
"This is my high school," Jiang Chen explained to Ayesha. Standing in front of the gate, Jiang Chen stared at the building with a sense of nostalgia.</br>
</br>
It was where he spent his youth with sweat and tear.</br>
</br>
Reminiscing his past, he used to be a youngster who would blush and had his heart beat faster just by merely touching his seatmate's hand accidentally. Back then, he used to be so naïve and innocent.</br>
</br>
"Did you attend high school?" Jiang Chen casually asked.</br>
</br>
"Didn't get to finish it. The school was destroyed," Ayesha responded blankly.</br>
</br>
What an utterly tragic memory.</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry for reminding of your unhappy memories," Jiang Chen murmured.</br>
</br>
The cold face gave him a gentle smile, and then she shook her head.</br>
</br>
"No need to apologize. There's nothing we can do about it."</br>
</br>
Towards her tragic past, Ayesha had never felt any regret for it. Even to the tragedy that happened to her own family, she just accepted this fact in silence. When Jiang Chen asked her before if she wanted to seek revenge against the people who killed her family. As long as she desired it, he would be willing to help her, but still she shook her head.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't ask her why, but he could somehow guess the reason.</br>
</br>
It was a distressing reality. The residents of her hometown probably resembled the people of the apocalypse the most.</br>
</br>
Only those people who were accustomed to death would be so apathetic towards death.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that she could only be intimate to the only person that made her feel warm, the only person that made her open her heart.</br>
</br>
Rubbing her little head, Jiang Chen smiled, took her hand and went to the school gate.</br>
</br>
"Class is still ongoing at the moment. Uninvited guests can't enter the school premises," the old man, sitting in the security room and clad in a military jacket, solemnly said.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen could still recognize him; on the other hand, he would obviously not remember everyone who went out from here.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned as he could not imagine that he would be blocked by a security guard. However, seeing the alertness on the guard's face, Jiang Chen immediately understood why.</br>
</br>
There was nothing wrong with the guard obstructing anyone from entering the school. Jiang Chen remembered when he was still studying here, there would be young thugs who were fond of hanging out in the vicinity of the school. Even though they were nothing, they would pretend to be a "boss" in front of these teens to show off their grandiose" tale," and then they would gang up on inexperienced delinquent girls and ask them for money and the like.</br>
</br>
</br>
The brown curly hair of Ayesha was obviously misunderstood by the old guard as dyed. After all, the guard was getting old and could not see her facial feature clearly.</br>
</br>
As though reading the guard's mind, Jiang Chen smiled and walked over and started a conversation with the old man.</br>
</br>
"Is the principal still Mr. Wu?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, are you looking for him?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm... Call him and tell him someone wants to donate a school building."</br>
</br>
The guard was gobsmacked.</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Ordinary people may not recognize Jiang Chen, but as the school leader of the Hucheng High School II, how could he not recognize his outstanding alumnus? To start with, in a small place like Hucheng, it was rare to have someone so accomplished. And now, that this place had produced a president of a 10 billion company, someone who had been praised by the Wall Street Journal to be equal to Bill Gate and Steve Jobs; and recognized as the "third technology revolution leader."</br>
</br>
Wu Zechen had been working in Hucheng High II for more than ten years and could be considered as a veteran of the school. Although he didn't have much impression of Jiang Chen, who graduated five years ago, it didn't stop him from feeling proud. It was not at the point where he would mention Jiang Chen's name every sentence, but at the end of every principal's speech, he would use Jiang Chen's story to motivate the young students to study harder to get into a good university.</br>
</br>
This was despite the fact that Jiang Chen's current achievement had nothing to do with the university he attended at all...</br>
</br>
Less than half a minute later, Jiang Chen saw Principal Wu led a group of school officials walking out in hasty steps. From afar, he waved at Jiang Chen and greeted him with a bright smile.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Mr. Jiang came to visit us. We weren't prepared. You should have given me a call," Wu Zechen said passionately, shaking Jiang Chen's hands vigorously.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to bother. I just want to check the place out again." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That's not okay! Mr. Jiang coming back to Hucheng High School II is an important event, we need a welcome ceremony—"</br>
</br>
"There's no need. Let's not disturb the students." Jiang Chen waved his hand.</br>
</br>
Towards the old principal's excessive enthusiasm, Jiang Chen couldn't help but feel embarrassed. After shaking hands with the vice principal, directors, and other school officials, he finally entered the school gate.</br>
</br>
Of course, the reason why the old principal gave Jiang Chen such a warm welcome was because of his introductory words of "donating a school building." After receiving confirmation from Jiang Chen, his aging face bloomed like a flower and personally played the role of a "guide" by showing Ayesha and Jiang Chen around.</br>
</br>
He previously thought he would have to retire being a headmaster, but Jiang Chen somehow came back and contributed to his hometown's school.</br>
</br>
Once the new school building project had been finalized, it would not take him two years to transfer to Education Bureau. With this qualification, he would be promoted at least half a level, perhaps even a full level. After gaining so many benefits, it was no wonder why he would be so passionate.</br>
</br>
Originally, the principal's enthusiasm gave Jiang Chen a headache. After all, he initially intended to wander about the familiar campus while holding Ayesha's hand to reminisce the past in silence, and also made a bit of contribution for his hometown, but he didn't expect that he would have a group school leaders following him.</br>
</br>
But soon after, he quickly began to enjoy this experience.</br>
</br>
The reason being was because...</br>
</br>
"Quickly look, isn't that Jiang Chen?" Passing through the classroom where he spent his three years, a sharp-eyed girl immediately recognized Jiang Chen and dragged her seatmate excitedly.</br>
</br>
Among the youngsters using smartphones, Jiang Chen was especially famous since Future 1.0 had at least 300 million domestic users. The majority of people enjoying watching shows and playing games would choose to install Little White to save battery and increase speed.</br>
</br>
"Eh? It's true! OMG, how did Old Wu manage to invite the nation's husband to the school?" A pretty looking girl with long hair widened her eyes and stopped scrolling through Weibo.</br>
</br>
"Put your phone away, if the director sees you—"</br>
</br>
"Wait, let me take a photo first." The girl raised her phone to take a picture.</br>
</br>
Not only among girls, Jiang Chen was also popular among guys.</br>
</br>
A lot of smart students view this man as their role model and wished to become like him one day, to be able to strut back to their school and hold their heads high, and let those "arrogant" school leaders trail behind them and enjoy their fawning words.</br>
</br>
More than a billion of net worth, a foreign gorgeous female assistant: the epitome of life's winner.</br>
</br>
Though Jiang Chen really wanted to tell them that his present achievements had nothing to do with studying... despite getting a high score when he was admitted to Wanghai university.</br>
</br>
In short, it was incredibly exhilarating to be envied and praised by a crowd of energetic young people.</br>
</br>
That's right! Jiang Chen utterly enjoyed the feeling of vainglory.</br>
</br>
"What do you think of this, Mr. Jiang? Are you satisfied with the culture at our school?" Wu Zechen asked in great spirit when he saw Jiang Chen's mouth curved up.</br>
</br>
"Whether I'm satisfied or not, I'm not qualified to say it. But seeing that our students are so energetic, as an alumnus, I'm extremely pleased," Jiang Chen casually said and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Haha, how could that be? We have a lot of students that view Mr. Jiang as an alumnus," a female secretary in her 30s said while giggling.</br>
</br>
Towards this compliment, Jiang Chen cracked a smile.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of, where is teacher Cai?" That was his homeroom teacher. After walking around the campus, he failed to see him.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Cai is already old and retired. I heard that his son is doing well in the south, so he retired there."</br>
</br>
Already retired?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could not help but feel some regret, thereupon he felt relieved.</br>
</br>
He had already spent more than half of his life teaching, so it was time to enjoy life.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
5-million school building, a set of 1 million state-of-the-art teaching equipment, and a marble statue. Principal Wu insisted that a ceremonious donation ceremony should be made, or else it would be hard to express the gratitude of the students and staff of the school.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen rejected it. Afraid of trouble, he used the most straightforward method and donated it under Future Technology's name. The company's legal department would send people to coordinate with this matter, so he didn't need to worry anymore.</br>
</br>
After taking care of everything, Jiang Chen called Xia Shiyu to let her know.</br>
</br>
"Hello?" Jiang Chen drawled on the phone.</br>
</br>
"Ah, hmm? Do you need something?" Xia Shiyu sounded slightly absent-minded.</br>
</br>
Puzzled, Jiang Chen frowned and said in a voice filled with concern, "There's something... I feel like you don't sound right. Are you coming down with a cold?"</br>
</br>
"No, nothing, just a bit personal stuff," Xia Shiyu perfunctorily said.</br>
</br>
Her parents wanted her to go on an arranged date by a matchmaker saying it would be hard for older girls to get married. The male's side also worked in Wanghai City and owned a company. Apparently, he was quite well off... What era was this?</br>
</br>
For the past few days, Xia Shiyu has been troubled by this.</br>
</br>
She was unable to talk her insistent parents out of it and finally agreed to take a vacation and return home</br>
</br>
It just to make her parents happy.</br>
</br>
As for the date, she had unceremoniously sentenced him to death in her heart already.</br>
</br>
For some reason, even though it didn't have anything to do with Jiang Chen, she still didn't want Jiang Chen to know about this. The more embarrassing thing was, when she thought about marriage, what happened that night would somehow surface in her head.</br>
</br>
That night, their lips were only a few centimeters apart.</br>
</br>
If they kissed on that day...</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's donation distractedly, Xia Shiyu hung up the phone.</br>
</br>
After a long sigh, she held her phone in front of her chest.</br>
</br>
That bright, red thin lips pouted, it was a rare scene.</br>
</br>
She cluelessly murmured to herself, "Fool..."</br>
</br>
(1) Salted fish is an Internet slang for saying useless person.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 245: The Perfect Coincedence</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Hucheng was a small place.</br>
</br>
In such a small place, good news and bad news spread equally as fast.</br>
</br>
The news of a famous entrepreneur, Jiang Chen, visiting his relatives and donating a five million school building to his alma mater instantly circulated in this small place.</br>
</br>
There were plenty of people who made money in recent years, but there were not many who thought about their hometown. For a time, various titles such as "conscientious businessman" was named after Jiang Chen. As such, even the city officials also specially came to visit him.</br>
</br>
They didn’t receive any news of Jiang Chen returning to Hucheng to visit his relatives. After all, the General Staff Department kept his itinerary an absolute secret. Not only the city officials, but even the media also didn't receive a single bit of information. Not until the cheap Wu Zechen, who benefited the most from this, held a school ceremony and made a conference did the reporters receive the news.</br>
</br>
For a time, the previously quiet Jinsha Steel Plant residential area was instantly in an uproar.</br>
</br>
The city officials visiting him sent him a plaque of two meters in length in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the development of his hometown. In response, Jiang Chen was naturally gratified.</br>
</br>
As for the mayor wearing a huge smile, he immediately proposed potential partnerships and stated he was willing to provide additional generous policies for the staff of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only smiled at the offer proposed by the mayor and didn’t outright agreed. He just politely expressed his gratitude towards the government's enthusiastic reception, but because the development strategy of the company must be discussed with the company executives, he could not commit just yet.</br>
</br>
But what Jiang Chen didn’t expect was that after the city officials left, the district leaders also came for a visit. This made Jiang Chen at a loss on how to react as he didn’t expect that just by donating a school building on a whim would make his home feel like a tea shop with people constantly visiting him. The steel plant leaders, the directors of the board of education, and the relatives he hadn't met before all visited him.</br>
</br>
Simply put, these past few days was annoying the heck out of him. He was planning to donate a road before he left, but given the present state of affairs, it would need to wait until he left.</br>
</br>
But seeing how happy his parents were, he did not say anything.</br>
</br>
His home had been quite uneventful these recent years as the two elderlies lived a rather secluded life. Because they were just average workers, the relatives from their hometown didn’t really visit as they would only chat with their neighbors while they were shopping. When did they ever experience something of this scale?</br>
</br>
Not only those relatives who came from different places came and stopped, but even those fulltime top officials came running to their door to ask about their well-being. Astonished by the treatment that their son was receiving, they finally had an idea on how successful their son was.</br>
</br>
</br>
But even then, there was no escaping the matchmaking…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"You made such a bold move, and this increased the difficulty of our work." Leaning against the Santana, Dagger grinned with a cigarette in his mouth.</br>
</br>
"There's nothing I can do about it. Should l pay you overtime?" Jiang Chen jived and took out his electronic key and opened the car door.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, it's against the protocol to bribe civil servants." Miao Jun coughed.</br>
</br>
Dagger didn’t pursue the topic any longer. He flicked the cigarette and asked nonchalantly, "Is the software done?"</br>
</br>
"You're gonna have to ask the overseas team." Standing in the doorway, Jiang Chen s shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Good luck." Dagger nodded and gave a cursory glance at the passenger seat. "Where is your assistant?"</br>
</br>
"I’m going to matchmaking today." Jiang Chen’s expression looked somewhat helpless.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun burst out laughing, his arm on the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
"What era are we currently in?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not bother about him, put up the car window, and started the car.</br>
</br>
Dagger extinguished the cigarette butt and got into the car as well. He patted Miao Jun on the shoulder and said dismissively, "Follow him."</br>
</br>
The location of the matchmaking was in the downtown of Hucheng, roughly 20 kilometers away from the small area where Jiang Chen came from.</br>
</br>
In the entire Hucheng, only the Jialin commercial area was still considered flourishing. Although he wasn’t planning on agreeing, he would still give the other her due respect. He wouldn’t just find a random KFC to purposely anger her away.</br>
</br>
Near Lake Restaurant.</br>
</br>
It was Jiang Chen’s first time here, but because of the positive reviews on the internet, he called to reserve a private room. The place had beautiful scenery, Jiang Chen heard that it was possible to view the panoramic beauty of the East Like in the private suite on the top floor.</br>
</br>
After parking his car in the parking space, Jiang Chen readily locked the door and headed to the suite under the direction of the server.</br>
</br>
Dagger and Miao Jun did not follow him upstairs, and just picked a seat on the first floor, and then ordered a few dishes. They had been eating takeout food for the past few days, even the not picky Dagger was starting to get sick of it.</br>
</br>
Upstairs, Jiang Chen ordered a table full of dishes and then began to play with his phone while waiting for the arrival of his date.</br>
</br>
To be honest, he had never attended any matchmaking session before, so he somehow felt nervous.</br>
</br>
Not long after, Jiang Chen heard approaching footsteps near the door.</br>
</br>
The door opened, Jiang Chen put away his phone, but the instant he looked at the door, his expression froze.</br>
</br>
He was not the only one who was frozen.</br>
</br>
Standing in the doorway with one foot in, the gorgeous but expressionless face also appeared bewildered.</br>
</br>
"It’s you?"</br>
</br>
The two people simultaneously exclaimed in astonishment and both fell into an awkward silence.</br>
</br>
Black wool sweater matching with a pair of black stockings—the not-so-colorful outfit didn’t seem to be suitable when on a date, but on her, it perfectly complimented her serene yet stunning aura, which was normally hidden behind her expressionless face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn’t expect that it was his company’s CEO who would show up. He had never heard Xia Shiyu mentioned her hometown before, but coincidentally they were from the place and even lived in the same circle.</br>
</br>
What a coincidence.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu also didn’t think that the person to show would be him. Compared to the shocking reality, an unknown anxiety was welling up inside her.</br>
</br>
Her lips quivered slightly and felt her face was burning. The rejection spiels brewing inside her head after an entire night jumbled inside her head. The usually calm Xia Shiyu was now frozen at the door.</br>
</br>
[If it was him, should I reject?] Xia Shiyu was utterly lost.</br>
</br>
Looking at Xia Shiyu's messy expression, for some reason despite feeling awkward, he wanted to laugh as well.</br>
</br>
"Uh, have a sit first."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Head buried in silence, Xia Shiyu hastily at across Jiang Chen, and then remained silent.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that her pale neck went beet red all the way to her cheeks.</br>
</br>
Silence ensued for a long time.</br>
</br>
"What a coincidence, I didn’t think it would be you." Jiang Chen unnaturally laughed and broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm," Xia Shiyu assented again, her head still lowered, but there was nothing more.</br>
</br>
He had no experience on what to say during a matchmaking session.</br>
</br>
The set of words he prepared before coming here were completely useless.</br>
</br>
He was aware of Xia Shiyu’s affection for him that night. Or more precisely, right after that news conference, he had already been vaguely aware of it for a long time.</br>
</br>
Different from Liu Yao as a mistress, and Ayesha with a different cultural background, Xia Shiyu would never accept him with another woman.</br>
</br>
But because of the faint selfishness in his heart, he couldn’t do or say anything that would make her give up on him despite knowing that the ambiguity of his action towards her would hurt her more in the end.</br>
</br>
Reject? Or accept?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 246: What's your consideration?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The two didn't speak with each other until the server brought the dishes.</br>
</br>
Delicacies filled the table, the scenery outside was still scenic and picturesque, but Jiang Chen thought the food tasted bland.</br>
</br>
The red lips were chewing reservedly, so it was a tad unfortunate that not a single word came out. Although Xia Shiyu's blush had receded, her gaze remained glue on the food on the table. The somewhat stiff expression appearing as though she was avoiding his sight.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was about to say something to break the silence, Xia Shiyu suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Am I really boring? With her head bowed, she asked in a barely distinguishable voice.</br>
</br>
"How could that be?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was used to Xia Shiyu's aloofness, so he did not mind her being cold. If she suddenly became talkative one day, Jiang Chen would feel surprised.</br>
</br>
"Really?" she said in what seemed to be in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Why do you ask?" Jiang Chen could not help but ask.</br>
</br>
"If there's a gathering, everytime I speak, it would result in a silenced crowd," Xia Shiyu uttered in total bewilderment.</br>
</br>
While he didn't know why she would bring this up such situation, Jiang Chen trod carefully when he phrased his words, "Perhaps…it was because of your temperament?"</br>
</br>
"Temperament?" Xia Shiyu lifted her head looking confused, staring at Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Just like a pristine flower in the snowy mountain, gorgeous but can only be appreciated from afar." Because it was extremely hard to approach, so some chose to stay away.</br>
</br>
"Are you saying that in the...perspective of the opposite gender?" Xia Shiyu murmured.</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
"What about the same gender?"</br>
</br>
"It's probably due to jealousy."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's response made Xia Shiyu's calm heart sped up again.</br>
</br>
"Then what about you?" overwhelmed by indescribable emotions, she haphazardly asked this blunt question.</br>
</br>
"… That's hard to answer. Say, aren't we supposed to be on a blind date? Why do you have to talk about such a serious topic?" Jiang Chen quipped.</br>
</br>
"Then…do you want to marry me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was utterly astonished.</br>
</br>
[Does this count as a confession?]</br>
</br>
Towards this unexpected confession, he was not mentally prepared at all.</br>
</br>
He originally thought with Xia Shiyu reserved attitude, this issue would drag on for a long time before it actually came out in the open.</br>
</br>
Moreover, he didn't think her confession would be so straightforward.</br>
</br>
"Don't one discuss marriage after dating?" Jiang Chen gave a wry smile.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's face turned red and with her head buried, she admitted, "No one has taught me this."</br>
</br>
The coyness in her expression was a rare sight to see.</br>
</br>
"Didn't you date before?' Jiang Chen sighed, feeling helpless.</br>
</br>
"That doesn't count," Xia Shiyu promptly rejected the idea.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then what does it count for?"</br>
</br>
"Perhaps… just a failed attempt." Because she was curious about how dating felt like, knowing that she could not stay single for the rest of her life, and due to myriad other reasons, she accepted someone she didn't like but who pursued her for the longest time.</br>
</br>
And even she was aware that that strained relationship was not a sign of love.</br>
</br>
The only thing she didn't expect was that he eventually betrayed her merely because she didn't want to be intimate with him. Did he only pursue her is just so he could do that kind of thing with her?</br>
</br>
Just like Jiang Chen had thought, her emotional maturity was not directly proportional to her success in her career. Rather than calling it pure, it was more naïve.</br>
</br>
"When two people became a couple, do they have to kiss?" Xia Shiyu asked, her eyes becoming somewhat dazed.</br>
</br>
"Uh, it's not a strict requirement. That's to say, if you really do like the other person, then you won't mind kissing."</br>
</br>
"What about the opposite?"</br>
</br>
"The opposite?" Jiang Chen put down his chopsticks, staring at her perplexedly.</br>
</br>
"If I'm willing to… kiss, would you date me?"</br>
</br>
It appeared as though she had exhausted all the courage in her body.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Inside the washroom.</br>
</br>
Using both of his hands, he scooped a cold water and splashed it on his face.</br>
</br>
Feeling his agitated stated calmed down, Jiang Chen then flung the water on his face and looked at himself in the mirror.</br>
</br>
"The f*ck... I almost become a scum," Jiang Chen mocked himself before he let out a relieved sigh, he then shook his head and headed for the door.</br>
</br>
He didn't reject Xia Shiyu's confession. Although conscience told him that perhaps rejecting her was the wiser choice. He didn't dislike Xia Shiyu or rather, towards the girl who had been working diligently for his business, he appreciated her and also a very good impression of her.</br>
</br>
From the initial hatred to relief, and then because of her inadvertent disclosure of her love for him, this made him have a special spot for her in his own heart. Jiang Chen could not help but suddenly have a feeling of falling into her "trap."</br>
</br>
However, although he did not reject, he did not entirely agree.</br>
</br>
Simply put, the two were now in a relationship between friendship and lover.</br>
</br>
The parents were finally satisfied. The two agreed to tell their parents that they were dating. With this, there would no longer be trouble with matchmaking sessions, To this result, Xia Shiyu was pleased too. After all, she was not mentally prepared for this at all.</br>
</br>
Take one step at a time.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was prepared to leave the washroom, a familiar looking man stepped in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang, we meet again," Zhang Youjie greeted him amiably and extended his hand, exposing his white set of teeth.</br>
</br>
Slightly frowning, Jiang Chen's eyebrows soon were unfolded as he also extended his hand with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Why is Mr. Zhang here?"</br>
</br>
"I'm a salesman, so I always appear in front of people in need." Zhang Youjie shrugged and smiled. "Have you given it a thought? What's your decision?"</br>
</br>
"Decision about what?"</br>
</br>
"To become a citizen of UA."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked dubiously at him. "Do you know that there are two agents behind my butt at all time? Let me guess, you're going to be caught and deported?"</br>
</br>
"They have no right to do that to a foreign diplomat. Doesn't your country have right to even speak freely?" Zhang Youjie shook his head and mocked.</br>
</br>
"That's hard to say." Jiang Chen didn't refute it.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, seeing you is not really easy, so I'll keep it simple. If Mr. Jiang is interested in our immigration policy, the embassy will provide you with comprehensive "legal assistance." A country's government has no right to prevent a talented individual from choosing their nationality and being restricted to go abroad would be contrary to your country's law. We will put pressure on the International Court of Justice to send you abroad through special channels and force it through public opinion—"</br>
</br>
"Free choice of nationality?" Jiang Chen scoffed. "Why must it be the UA?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie paused and then laughed carelessly. "Is this Mr. Jiang's message, or the message from the organization behind you?"</br>
</br>
"The latter, of course."</br>
</br>
"That's unfortunate then. We could have avoided a conflict." Zhang Youjie shook his head, and then smiled, "Anyway, have a great vacation."</br>
</br>
Thereupon he turned around and disappeared at the corner of the hallway.</br>
</br>
Looking at the direction of his departure, Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen didn't think UA citizens could cause some trouble in Hua, especially under General Staff Department's watch, he still felt a sense of foreboding.</br>
</br>
He had a premonition that it would not be this simple.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 247: Undercurrent</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At the crowded Wanghai City airport.</br>
</br>
In such an international metropolis, it was common to see foreign faces. Especially with Christmas approaching, the number of foreigners visiting Hua increased due to the holiday.</br>
</br>
The announcement of flight departing echoed inside the terminal accompanied by the constant chattering and the cry of children. The terminal was a bit noisy.</br>
</br>
A foreigner sat on a chair with his eyes closed, resting. The gray overcoat made him look very ordinary, and under the brimmed hat was a brown face with stubble. Don't be mistaken, he was a Caucasian, and the skin color was due to staying in the desert for a long time.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that someone would be able to sleep in such environment.</br>
</br>
"Uncle, toy car," a soft voice rang beside his ear. A little boy stood in front of him and pointed timidly to his shoes.</br>
</br>
The person opened one of his eyes and smiled genially, thereupon the wrinkles on his face twisted like knife scars.</br>
</br>
He looked like a kind middle-aged man.</br>
</br>
Except for the dark green pupil, which destroyed his amiable impression. Inside the cluster of dark green hues was a lethal gleam like that of a dangerous wolf.</br>
</br>
The little boy retreated with a frightened expression on his face. He didn't dare to get the toy car as he scampered away.</br>
</br>
Seeing the boy ran away, the man shook his head, stood up, and headed out of the terminal.</br>
</br>
"As expected of Mr. Griss. The infamous name of Wolf that could scare little kids in the east thousands of kilometers away," an oriental man laughingly said as he naturally came to his side, and took the suitcase in his hand.</br>
</br>
"I don't want to cause trouble the moment I get off the plane, so, you better call me G," Griss cautioned bluntly.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Mr. G." The man who welcomed him grinned. "How do you feel on this new environment? How does it compare to Iraq?"</br>
</br>
"The smell in the desert is terrible." Griss grinned and continued, "But compared to the noise here, I very much prefer the tranquility of the desert."</br>
</br>
"What made the bloodthirsty wolf turn into Dickinson?" said the man in an exaggerated manner and rolled his eyes.</br>
</br>
"It's probably the blood." Griss shrugged. "Someone told me before that a poet and a killer are two very similar professions."</br>
</br>
"One praises death, while the other executes death?" the other person scoffed.</br>
</br>
"By the way, Mr. Li, you seemed to be late?" Griss said dismissively, glancing at the digital clock in the hall.</br>
</br>
"I've run into a bit of trouble…" Li Zhongping pulled out the car key from his pocket and laughed.</br>
</br>
"What trouble?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, we originally thought we could form a partnership with them, but now it looks like Zhang Youjie made an error in judgment. Give the change in the situation, we have to start the plan B. If everything goes as planned, we might fight with the Han agents." Li Zhongping sighed helplessly. Although the helpless expression looked exaggerated at best.</br>
</br>
</br>
Griss shrugged and drawled, "For me, there's no such thing as a surprise."</br>
</br>
He didn't care about the Han agents at all. Just like a battle-hardened wolf that fought through hundreds of battles won't care about the hissing of a shepherd. Although he couldn't do the proper walk in the military parade, he knew hundreds of tracking and killing method. He lost track of the number of terrorists who had died on his hands and those who had jeopardized the interests of the country.</br>
</br>
There was no possibility of losing.</br>
</br>
"A Han called Dagger is responsible for the target's safety."</br>
</br>
Griss' eyes narrowed, a grim smile appearing on his lips.</br>
</br>
"Dagger?"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"You've been gone for a while."</br>
</br>
"I met someone I know, and we chatted for a moment." Jiang Chen sat back across Xia Shiyu and smiled.</br>
</br>
Looking at the smile on Jiang Chen's face, Xia Shiyu's face turned red obscurely. She lowered her head while her finger played with the hem of her sweater.</br>
</br>
"So are we a couple now?"</br>
</br>
With the way Xia Shiyu looked, Jiang Chen's face also turned red. He looked away and scratched his face.</br>
</br>
"Uh, I would say so."</br>
</br>
[But not completely.]</br>
</br>
"Do we need to do something?"</br>
</br>
"No…just go with the flow." Jiang Chen swallowed his saliva, staring at the flushed cheeks.</br>
</br>
Although he wanted to say, "Let's start with a kiss," he managed to curb his evil urges.</br>
</br>
It was because their current relationship was only due to the insistence of their parents.</br>
</br>
He could feel Xia Shiyu's affection for him. Likewise, he harbored affection for her as well.</br>
</br>
However, given Xia Shiyu's personality, there was no way she could accept the existence of Ayesha and Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
Just go with the flow.</br>
</br>
"Once we get to know each other more, then we'll head to the next step." It was the agreement Jiang Chen made with her.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen drove Xia Shiyu home.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen courteously greeted the warm uncle and aunt, gave them the present he prepared, and left after some small talk.</br>
</br>
Mom Xia embraced her daughter by the shoulder and smiled while watching Jiang Chen's car left.</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Mom didn't lie to you, right? The little Jiang certainly is of great character, so you have to be nice to him. In this day and age, it's hard to find someone with such great qualities."</br>
</br>
"Okay, mom…" Xia Shiyu muttered, her head buried and her face flushed.</br>
</br>
"Work hard and get married as soon as possible. Your mom and dad are waiting for grandchildren."</br>
</br>
"Grandchildren? Uh, I — " The cold face instantly turned beet red. Xia Shiyu's mouth opened and her mind was in chaos.</br>
</br>
[Children…]</br>
</br>
[If I have to give birth to children, I have to do that…]</br>
</br>
Like a startled deer, Xia Shiyu dashed into her room without turning back and slammed the door shut, leaving the astonished parents in the living room.</br>
</br>
"Old man, what nonsense are you saying?" Mom Xia scoffed at the old man.</br>
</br>
With face red, Dad Xia rebutted, "What are you getting at? Don't you want grandchildren soon?"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu rushed into the room, closed the door, and leaned against the door.</br>
</br>
Her body leaning against the door gradually slid down, making her sit on the floor.</br>
</br>
Panting, she pressed her hand against her chest.</br>
</br>
Blush extended from her pale neck all the way to her ears, her heart was beating fast.</br>
</br>
[That kind of thing…]</br>
</br>
A fuzzy image unconsciously surfaced in her head.</br>
</br>
In a suit, Jiang Chen walked beside her with a bright, attractive smile. Blushing, she approached him and hooked her arm around his.</br>
</br>
Wearing an immaculate white wedding dress and a pair of high-heeled wedding shoes, and along with the wishes of her friends and family, the two walked along the red carpet, exchanging a kiss of vow in front of everyone.</br>
</br>
The scene turned and then showed their wedding room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen carried her around the waist, kissed her on the neck, and then he gently placed her on the matrimonial bed and reached…</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a faint noise came from outside the door. She didn't know if it was an illusion, but she heard them speak English.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu stopped and then stood up from the floor.</br>
</br>
For some reason, the arguing voice of her parents instantly vanished.</br>
</br>
She suddenly felt a kind of inexplicable panic.</br>
</br>
A frightening silence ensued outside.</br>
</br>
Gulping, she reached for the doorknob and twisted it open.</br>
</br>
A smiling face welcomed her outside the room.</br>
</br>
However, it didn't belong to Jiang Chen but to a woman. A woman with blue eyes, blond hair, and wearing a headset.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was stunned. It was an unfamiliar face.</br>
</br>
"You're— "</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about it, just Miss Kidnapper," Caitlin jeered before she smoothly stabbed the defibrillator to her stomach.</br>
</br>
Numbness immediately made Xia Shiyu fall unconscious, as she fell onto Caitlin.</br>
</br>
"The package has been retrieved," Caitlin reported leisurely on her earpiece.</br>
</br>
The two elderlies in the living room were both unconscious.</br>
</br>
"Perfect. Return to "warehouse" for further instruction." Inside a coffee shop, Zhang Youjie wore a triumphant smile.</br>
</br>
"Understood."</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie closed the laptop computer and headed out of the coffee shop.</br>
</br>
A trace of mockery disappeared from his lips.</br>
</br>
"What an absolute amateur."</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 248: The Greeting from Afar</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Speeding off along the highway, Jiang Chen's hands were on the steering wheel, but what happened during noon lingered in his head.</br>
</br>
"That's really regrettable. We could have avoided a conflict…"</br>
</br>
[Does this sentence mean they're plotting something?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen knitted his eyebrows. He really didn't really understand why would the UA embassy would be so interested in him.</br>
</br>
Could it be the UA intelligence officers heard that Future Technology was responsible for the actual research and development of the "Dragon II" program?</br>
</br>
This thought suddenly sent a chill down his spine.</br>
</br>
In the wasteland's timeline, a similar program would be developed in 2020. Despite the huge deviation of the history of wasteland from this world, and given how the speed and focus of technology and research differed greatly, the general development trajectory was not much different. Just like how the third scientific and technological revolution was led by computers.</br>
</br>
The next 50 years would be the 50 years led by artificial intelligence. The inception of basic AI database, which would ignite the fourth scientific and technological revolution, and then the introduction of intermediate AI Restriction Act, which would mark the end of the premature change in science and technology. Then it would be the fifth scientific and technological revolution led by the breakthrough in space technology, but that would be in the distant future...had it not been for the existence of Jiang Chen, who was a traveler between two worlds.</br>
</br>
If everything went smoothly, Zhongxin High Tech would be capable of completely developing this technology themselves. According to the history, the cutting-edge high-altitude UAV similar to Dragon II didn't have a long development cycle.</br>
</br>
Now that he thought about it, the delay in development was unlikely due to the barrier in technology. If someone could leak the information, there was no reason they wouldn't obstruct the progress in some way…</br>
</br>
At the thought of this, Jiang Chen furrowed his brows.</br>
</br>
He had never given this issue a thought.</br>
</br>
In that timeline, PAC, Soviet Union (CCP), and NATO could be said the tripartite that divided the world. However, in this timeline, PAC and CCCP simply did not exist at all.</br>
</br>
The series of drastic changes in Eastern Europe had ruined the last trace of Soviet. The collapse of the Berlin Wall completely pushed the alliance into the abyss and declared the collapse of the Yalta system. In 1991, the painstaking pillar of CCCP finally disintegrated and was divided into 15 independent sovereign states.</br>
</br>
The fate of PAC was even more interesting since it never existed in the first place. Moreover, judging from the territorial disputes and the geopolitical pattern among Asian countries at the moment, it should not be possible for the organization to be established in the next 50 years or so. An alliance would have to be formed from a political mutual trust; regrettably, this trust did not exist from the very beginning.</br>
</br>
</br>
On the contrary, NATO was the only one that stood out amongst the three. In spite of the constant portrayal of the media that NATO counties led by the UA were unable to extricate themselves from the quagmire of the Middle East disputes, all countries in Europe had been caught in dire straits by the Greek debt crisis and the influx of refugees. Needless to say, NATO was terrifying in both economic output and the military strength.</br>
</br>
When did it start?</br>
</br>
Rather, when did history start to diverge?</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen thought of what seemed to be an irrelevant question, his cell phone suddenly began to ring.</br>
</br>
Putting on his Bluetooth headset, he pressed the call button.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Do you still remember me, handsome oriental man?" Despite her jesting tone, Jiang Chen could detect that this sentence was almost squeezed out from her teeth.</br>
</br>
Han with a Russian accent. Although the other had not reported her name, her identity could easily be identified.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I remember the beautiful Ms. Natasha. How can I help you?" he replied casually and chuckled.</br>
</br>
[KGB? Other than tricking them in Veit, Jiang Chen couldn't think of any other connection with them.]</br>
</br>
"Why don't you take a plane to Moscow? I still owe you a shot of Vodka. We can have a long chat in the bar," Natasha said in a provocative way.</br>
</br>
"It's a tempting suggestion. Unfortunately, I can't make the trip since I can't even buy a plane ticket at the moment," said Jiang Chen, face not showing the slightest contrite.</br>
</br>
"If you really want to come, we can provide you with a free and secure method of entering the border."</br>
</br>
"Is KGB taking an interest in me? What an honor." Jiang Chen quipped and didn't accept her proposal.</br>
</br>
"It's Kremlin that's interested in you." After a brief pause, Natasha changed into a seductive voice and continued, "Are you really not going to consider? Han men are popular among the Russian women."</br>
</br>
Artificial intelligence would be the development trend for the next few decades, even potentially leading the fourth scientific and technological revolution, which was almost a foreseeable future. The value of artificial intelligence in military applications was even more invaluable. Since the advent of Future 1.0, it had garnered enough attention from Russia; not until they discovered its military value was extremely limited did they move their sight elsewhere.</br>
</br>
But who would have thought that Future Technology could really leave its mark in the military field?</br>
</br>
Even Jiang Chen himself did not expect that he would have wanted to make a contribution to his motherland before leaving the country. As a result, the information was surrendered and was leaked in the Han market before the development of the program was even completed. It was as if he just became a delicious morsel of meat.</br>
</br>
Of course, many companies possessed highly advanced technology companies such as Google and IBM in the world, and Future Technology was just one of them. The technology giants were not desperate to a point where they had to make a move, but Future Technology already possessed enough value to make these giants want to form a relationship with them.</br>
</br>
"For example, you?" Jiang Chen casually quipped.</br>
</br>
"If you can convince your team serving behind you to settle in Russia, I don't mind becoming your woman." Natasha wasn't kidding.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"I don't think it's funny," Natasha raged.</br>
</br>
"If I really wanted to do something to you, I would have tried all kinds of positions with you in Veit."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's mockery made Natasha extremely furious. She gnashed her teeth, wanting to drag Jiang Chen from the other side of the phone and roughed him up. Of course, it was only wishful thinking.</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, she worked hard to suppress the anger in her heart before continuing, "I believe we've already shown enough sincerity. If you're willing to cooperate with us, we can offer you the most generous conditions—"</br>
</br>
"Before our location is exposed, when we're finally safe, and we don't need to be in any cage in exchange for security. The only person who would be exposed to the troubles would be me," Jiang Chen shrugged and uttered in a nonchalant voice.</br>
</br>
"It seems that Mr. Jiang agent is not afraid?" Natasha scoffed.</br>
</br>
"There's no reason to be afraid."</br>
</br>
Towards Jiang Chen words, Natasha chuckled and didn't refute his words. "Looks like you are not yet fully aware of your situation. Because of your program, Dragon II will be deployed to the South Hua Sea ahead of schedule, and the strategic balance would be broken. The CIB is doing everything to prevent this from becoming a reality."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen he let out a discreet sigh.</br>
</br>
[Sure enough, it's the work of a spy? I was wondering why there are so many mishaps in the program, which made the development of Dragon II stuck in its final stage.]</br>
</br>
"So?"</br>
</br>
"Wasting resources on a harmless development team indeed seems unlikely, however, if an organization hinders the national interest of the UA, the White House will have a reason to the teach you a lesson. If I don't guess wrong, the UA embassy should have already made contact with you," Natasha snickered.</br>
</br>
"I rejected him," Jiang Chen said carelessly.</br>
</br>
"Then you might be in trouble. In the foreseeable future, at least before the program is transferred over, your photo will be on the CIB mission brief."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned for a moment, and then he chuckled nonchalantly and said, "Why don't you directly tell that to the General Staff Department of Hua? I'm only a businessman, I don't have the right to take actions."</br>
</br>
"KGB and The General Staff Department have no policy to exchange intelligence. As to why I'm telling you, can't you see it is an act of friendship?" Natasha mocked.</br>
</br>
"Then, as an agent, what would they do next?" Jiang Chen casually asked.</br>
</br>
"First priority is to force you to hand over the source code and then kidnap you to an aircraft carrier. The second priority is to shoot you as a warning to the organization behind you not to interfere in the game among the big powers, and at the same time, to cut off the only means for cooperation between you and Hua."</br>
</br>
Since all partnerships were done through a representative, it was enough to just kill the representative.</br>
</br>
Even if Future Technology indeed possessed value, it was not the extent where they could negotiate with the Rainbow Mansion.</br>
</br>
"Then what do you think I should do?" Jiang Chen chortled.</br>
</br>
"Stop at once and withdraw from the project."</br>
</br>
"And then join force with you?"</br>
</br>
If you do not want to fall into the hands of the UA and if you don't want to get stuck to where you are, we're your only choice." Natasha's face flashed a smile. In her perspective, Jiang Chen had no reason to reject her.</br>
</br>
Under the surveillance of the General Staff Department, just by himself, he had no opportunity to leave the border at all. However, it would be different with the help of KGB. As long as he was willing to cooperate, the existence of the so-called restriction was not a problem at all.</br>
</br>
"Do you think I'm scared of CIB?" Jiang Chen asked softly.</br>
</br>
"Few people whom they are targeting are not scared."</br>
</br>
"Then I'll have to disappoint you, I happen to be one of them." What could the CIB agent even do? Not to mention that this was Han territory, with Ayesha's counter-reconnaissance ability, Jiang Chen had nothing to worry about.</br>
</br>
From a combat ability perspective, he could deal with them by himself.</br>
</br>
"The Wolf." Towards Jiang Chen's confidence, Natasha merely provided a short name.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm?"</br>
</br>
"Griss O'Sullivan, senior CIB agent, who was previously active in Iraq war. There were more than 47 Iran officials who died either directly or indirectly in his hands. He was later transferred to the CIB Anti-terrorism team in Iraq. Have you heard of Laden? Although the SEAL shot him, he was the person that dug him out. Based on the intelligence, he already arrived at Wanghai City and forged his identity.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? That's a big fish."</br>
</br>
"It's a shark." Natasha laughed intriguingly. "Don't die. I'll be waiting for you to come to Moscow."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 249: Sorry, I'm not your subordinate</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The call ended.</br>
</br>
Laughing and shaking his head, Jiang Chen took off the Bluetooth headset and put it back into his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Griss, isn't it? It looks like this problem is becoming serious," Jiang Chen muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
From the standpoint of Russia, "Dragon II" being completed in time and being deployed in the South Hua Sea ahead of schedule was the best scenario. Considering Hua's growth in power, it would indeed hinder the UA's plan to return to Asia-Pacific. In this case, the pressure faced by Russia in East Europe and the Mediterranean would be significantly reduced.</br>
</br>
Natasha disclosing the CIB's action was partly a show of goodwill, and partly wishing for Jiang Chen to be prepared.</br>
</br>
He just did not know if Dagger of General Staff Department received the news or not.</br>
</br>
[Maybe I should send Ayesha to protect Xia Shiyu?]</br>
</br>
Driving back to the staff quarters, Jiang Chen parked the car and was about to head upstairs when Dagger came over.</br>
</br>
"How's the result of the matchmaking?" Dagger snickered.</br>
</br>
"I guess it's a success." Glancing at the empty seat on the Santana, Jiang Chen asked casually, "Where's Miao Jun who was driving you?"</br>
</br>
"Protecting your little girlfriend." Dagger sighed. "Say, could you be a little bit less busy this month?"</br>
</br>
Before the General Staff Department sent help, he could only get his deputy to help out. Even though Miao Jun was somewhat impetuous, his ability was quite good. He should be able to deal with the short transition period before their backup arrived.</br>
</br>
Whether if there was anyone was plotting against Jiang Chen, Dagger didn't receive any news from his superior that indicated that an external force was making a move on Jiang Chen. All of the security measures here were just for preventative measures.</br>
</br>
Looking at Dagger's wry expression, Jiang Chen smiled and patted the veteran soldier on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"I can only say I'll do my best. Anyway, thank you."</br>
</br>
[I'm paying hundreds of millions of tax each month, so it isn't too outrageous for you guys to work a little harder.]</br>
</br>
"Of course, this is my job." Dagger took out his phone and was preparing to make a phone call to Miao Jun to ask how was the situation.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to call, his phone suddenly rang.</br>
</br>
Upon seeing the name, Dagger paused for a moment. His expression turned grim and hurriedly put the cellphone to his ear.</br>
</br>
In the next second, his face changed dramatically</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Sitting in the tea shop downstairs of the apartment, Miao Jun ordered a cup of mocha. Crossing his legs, his eyes narrowed while examining every person that walked in and out of the neighborhood.</br>
</br>
Dagger had already gone back with Jiang Chen; on the other hand, he stayed here.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, the life of the rich is indeed different. He's picking up girls while I have to keep an eye out for him," Miao Jun complained in his mind.</br>
</br>
</br>
While complaining, he was meticulously doing the task that he needed to. It took abilities to be part of the General Staff Apartment.</br>
</br>
It was almost dusk when he lifted his hand to check the time. There was still an hour left before the person who would take over his spot would arrive.</br>
</br>
Just then, his pupils contracted and locked onto a man wearing a down jacket.</br>
</br>
Although on the surface, the man's behavior was very normal and reasonable to the point where he did not stand out from the crowd. However, Miao Jun noticed something unnatural from his actions.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the way he took out his cigarette or the angle he looked at this phone, he was able to cleverly avoided the camera in the neighborhood from capturing his face. It may be a coincidence if it happened once or twice, but if it happened all the time, there was only one possibility—the opponent was an anti-surveillance expert!</br>
</br>
Thinking of this, Miao Jun could not help but get a little excited and lick the corners of his lips.</br>
</br>
Although it was not his first mission, it was his first encounter with a foreign agent. If he captured a spy from an overseas force, it would undoubtedly be a great achievement!</br>
</br>
Of course, it was only a speculation. In the absence of conclusive evidence, any arbitrary arrests would not only cause unnecessary trouble, it would just unnecessarily alert the enemy.</br>
</br>
Putting his hand into his pocket, Miao Jun quietly moved towards the man in a down jacket.</br>
</br>
His hand, which was inserted in his pocket, was gripping a Beretta 92, his finger was gently pushing the safety.</br>
</br>
The man seemed to be oblivious to Miao Jun's gaze as he headed to the communal restroom.</br>
</br>
"What an amateur." Mouth raised a touch of ridicule, Miao Jun trailed after him quietly.</br>
</br>
However, when he stepped into men's restroom, the expression on his face suddenly froze.</br>
</br>
There's no one here?</br>
</br>
All the stalls were open and the side of the urinal was empty.</br>
</br>
Could it be that the person went to the female restroom on the right?</br>
</br>
His face turning speculative, Miao Jun prepared to leave.</br>
</br>
But then, he heard a casual voice behind his back.</br>
</br>
"Hello. Looking for me?"</br>
</br>
He did not know when it started, but the man he was following, was now standing behind him!</br>
</br>
Hackles up, a sudden chill went down his spine.</br>
</br>
Knowing he was in a dire situation, Miao Jun immediately turned and pulled out his gun.</br>
</br>
The man lunged at him, narrowing their gap. The man lifted his hand, easily twisting his wrist, and positioned his finger behind the trigger.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun was deeply astonished by how fluid the opponent took his gun. This man was obviously an expert.</br>
</br>
Since he was able to confirm his opponent's capability, there was no need to be reserved. Without ceasing the movement of his one hand, his other hand reached to snap the neck of the person, resorting to a killing move.</br>
</br>
But the other person just contemptuously scoffed and was seemingly able to read his thought, he once again easily parried his move.</br>
</br>
"Rookie."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the other's ridicule, a powerful knee strike struck his chest like a hammer.</br>
</br>
All the air in his chest was forcefully squeezed out of his chest.</br>
</br>
Because of breathing difficulties, Miao Jun's eyes widened and looked like it was about to pop out.</br>
</br>
The lack of oxygen made all the tense muscles in his body loosen, while the gun in his hand was easily taken out.</br>
</br>
Thereupon, his forehead made an intimate contact with the barrel of the gun.</br>
</br>
Succumbing to unconsciousness, Miao Jun fell head first to the ground.</br>
</br>
Not pausing for a second, the man pinched the button of the communications device on his collar.</br>
</br>
"Problem solved."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Turnin off her earpiece, woere her cap, Caitlin put on her baseball cap and carried Xia Shiyu who was lying on the floor and started to retreat.</br>
</br>
A van stopped by the apartment before it left the neighborhood.</br>
</br>
The entire operation took less than five minutes from start to finish.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was abducted.</br>
</br>
Hearing this news, Jiang Chen felt his head buzz and fury instantly engulfed his whole body.</br>
</br>
Although he had considered the possibility of the enemy plotting against Xia Shiyu, he never thought that they would make a move right after after their date.</br>
</br>
Given how fast they were, he didn't even have the opportunity to send Ayesha to protect her.</br>
</br>
"Calm down first, our people are already investigating what happened. Hucheng Police Department will assist us in our operation and put all roads under surveillance. The kidnapper must still be in the city." Dagger tired to placate Jiang Chen's emotion, despite feeling panic himself.</br>
</br>
He lost contact with Miao Jun and was presumably also caught in dire straits. Yet it was not clear which force made the abduction.</br>
</br>
Kidnapping Xia Shiyu must have been orchestrated to threaten Jiang Chen. What Dagger could only do at the moment was to ensure that Jiang Chen remained calm to prevent him from doing anything impulsive.</br>
</br>
"Your people? How long would that take?" Jiang Chen took a deep breath, his voice trembling due to wrath.</br>
</br>
"Within three days, I will definitely give you an update," Dagger said in a calm voice.</br>
</br>
"Three days?" Jiang Chen laughed derisively and filled with rage.</br>
</br>
Dagger wanted to say something, but this phone rang again.</br>
</br>
Dagger put the phone close to his ear, as he heard the voice from the other side of the phone, his expression looked helpless as he handed the phone to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
"You are?"</br>
</br>
"Liu Guangqi, Dagger's superior. You may call me General Liu."</br>
</br>
"My girlfriend was kidnapped," Jiang Chen said coldly.</br>
</br>
"We already received the news. Please be patient and wait for an update regarding this matter. We will definitely give you an account of the situation. Before that, we hope Mr. Jiang could consider the bigger picture and lessen unnecessary travel."</br>
</br>
"What do you mean?"</br>
</br>
"It doesn't mean anything. We're just worried that the enemy will use Ms. Xia as a bargaining chip, which may force you to make a regrettable decision.</br>
</br>
"You mean, you want to put me under house arrest?" Jiang Chen asked, his voice sounded intrigued.</br>
</br>
"This is for your own safety. Also, if the other could not reach you, then they won't be able to threaten you."</br>
</br>
"What if they contact you?" Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Taking Ms. Xia as a bargaining chip is be enough to coerce us into making concessions in light of national interest. I'm asking Mr. Chen to believe in the capabilities of the General Staff Department. We will give you a satisfactory answer within three days," said General Liu lightly.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen calmed down, his heart also started to turn cold.</br>
</br>
With these words, the message behind Liu Guangqi's words was very clear.</br>
</br>
The General Staff Department would absolutely not compromise with the agent even with the life of a citizen at stake. If the group that kidnapped Xia Shiyu could not reach Jiang Chen and could only get in touch with the General Staff Department, then the hostages on their hands would lose their value.</br>
</br>
At the same time, to maintain the status quo, the General Staff Department would immediately launch an investigation of this incident, and plan for the arrest of the enemy that designed and orchestrated the abduction.</br>
</br>
Thus, even if the kidnappers were to kill the hostage, they had nothing to gain from it.</br>
</br>
In the face of the national interests, all the sacrifices of an individual were worthwhile.</br>
</br>
"That's to say you're giving up on Xia Shiyu?" Jiang Chen asked softly.</br>
</br>
"We've never given up on anyone."</br>
</br>
"Which law allows one to restrict the freedom of the victim?"</br>
</br>
"It's not a law, it's an order," Liu Guangqi stated using an indisputable tone.</br>
</br>
Stunned for a moment, Jiang Chen chuckled.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I'm not one of your subordinates, so your order is invalid."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ended the call.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stuffed the phone into his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Please cooperate with my work, Mr. Jiang." Dagger forced out a smile as Jiang Chen was clearly not willing to follow the order.</br>
</br>
Daylight during the winter was short, and although it was still moments before six in the afternoon, it was already turning dark.</br>
</br>
Despite not being able to see the emotion hidden in Jiang Chen's eyes, Dagger could clearly sense that Jiang Chen was in a terrible mood.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen had no reaction, Dagger let out a sigh, extended his hand, and pleaded, "Please don't make this difficult for me… Give me the phone first."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes, and said—one word at a time—"I've never made it difficult for you. It's you that has always made it difficult for me, and now, I had enough."</br>
</br>
Dagger paused. He didn't think the always-cooperating Jiang Chen would say this.</br>
</br>
Although his words certainly had rationale to it, from the perspective of a soldier, Dagger could not back off.</br>
</br>
With his head lowered, Dagger made the last request pleadingly, "Please consider the bigger picture."</br>
</br>
"I don't understand the bigger picture, I will find my own way to save my girlfriend."</br>
</br>
It wasn't until this moment did Jiang Chen finally realize the thought hidden in the deepest part of his heart.</br>
</br>
If they were only girlfriend and boyfriend in name, and if he didn't like her, he would never be so livid.</br>
</br>
Since he was already sure, there was no need to be hesitant.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned to head to his Maybach.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I would have to force you to make the right decision," Dagger said as he took out a pistol.</br>
</br>
"You're pointing your gun at me?" Jiang Chen inquired interestingly.</br>
</br>
"Sorry."</br>
</br>
"You dare to shoot me?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
If he died, the program would definitely not be delivered to Zhongxin High Tech. The only winner would be the people unwilling to see Dragon II deployed ahead of schedule. For the General Staff Department, it was not an ending they wanted to see.</br>
</br>
Dagger didn't respond as he only stood there in silence, but the gun was moving down and pointed at Jiang Chen's leg.</br>
</br>
The intensity in his eyes seems to reflect his attitude—If you dare to leave, I will shoot your leg.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes began to turn cold.</br>
</br>
The two stood still without moving.</br>
</br>
Because of how desolate the place was, no one walked nearby. Dagger didn't need to disguise the way he held the gun.</br>
</br>
The only noise that interrupted this silence was the white birch tree swaying in the wind.</br>
</br>
They stared at each other.</br>
</br>
The calmness displayed by Jiang Chen confirmed Dagger's suspicions: he was not just a businessman. If he were an ordinary person, he would've wet his pants upon seeing a real gun.</br>
</br>
This was the real reason why he pulled out the gun.</br>
</br>
</br>
Instincts told him that in hand-to-hand combat, he had no confidence in restraining Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As the second and hour hands on the watch crossed at the six o'clock position, the street lamp suddenly lit up.</br>
</br>
The abrupt piercing light caused Dagger to squint his eyes.</br>
</br>
At that exact moment, Jiang Chen moved.</br>
</br>
Dagger was shocked by Jiang Chen's sudden movement in closing the distance. This ability that Jiang Chen demonstrated left him with no choice but to go all out.</br>
</br>
He lifted his left arm up, attempting to use his elbow to strike Jiang Chen's ribcage. If that move landed, Jiang Chen would have at least three rib bones broken.</br>
</br>
But his plan fell through.</br>
</br>
Despite how experienced he was at fighting, this level of attack was futile against a body strengthened by the genetic vaccine. With a bone strength of 29, it was two times that of an ordinary person; the resilience of Jiang Chen's rib bone was no less than his humerus.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen easily took the hit and ignored the stunned expression on Dagger's face. He took a swing with his right hand and landed a hit on Dagger's jaw, knocking Dagger right out.</br>
</br>
He quietly picked up the pistol on the ground and placed it in his pocket. Taking out his phone, he called Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Find me at where I parked, let's get going."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In a warehouse in Hucheng's rural area...</br>
</br>
Miao Jun sat slanted on a chair. His limbs were tied on the chair, his dangled face was bruised in red and blue, with blood dripping from his mouth.</br>
</br>
"I won't say anything."</br>
</br>
"I don't plan on letting you say anything." Zhang Youjie shrugged as he pulled a chair and sat across from him. A smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"We only need your cooperation."</br>
</br>
"Cooperation?" Miao Jun sneered and stared provocatively at Zhang Youjie in the eyes, "Why don't you just kill me."</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie's eyebrows raised as he stared back with an ambiguous expression.</br>
</br>
A cold sweat rolled down from Miao Jun's forehead. He suddenly felt that he was under the watch of a cobra examining its prey; there were no secrets in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Miao Jun, 25, graduated in Shangjin National Defense University with an outstanding performance. After graduation, received training in the province of Lu for new recruitment training. Later incorporated into the Ji Division's special force for special force training, and eventually became a part of the General Staff Department in 2014 to conduct anti-spy work domestically. With how fast you are rising up the ladder, you have connections, right?" Zhang Youjie crossed his eyes and said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Miao Jun was utterly dumbfounded and looked at the man in front of him in disbelief.</br>
</br>
His background was considered a top secret…</br>
</br>
With a grin, Zhang Youjie chirped, "Sorry, we also have 'connections'."</br>
</br>
"Traitor," He squeezed out a word in his mouth and stared gravely at Zhang Youjie's eyes.</br>
</br>
"You seemed to have mistaken something. Although I'm Asian, I grew up in UA. How should I say this in regular language... I'm an UA-born Han?" Zhang Youjie said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Seeing Miao Jun not saying anything else, Zhang Youjie's body leaned forward and examined him with manipulative eyes.</br>
</br>
"Although we have different nationalities, to me, I think you and I have a lot of similarities."</br>
</br>
"Oh? I don't think so."</br>
</br>
"I graduated from Northpoint Academy, and you also graduated from the top military academy in Hua. Are you really willing to die like this? Your life only just began."</br>
</br>
Miao Jun raised his head and enunciated, "It is my honor to sacrifice myself for the country."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? But what you did is contradictory," Zhang Youjie leaned on the chair, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and used an 'I understand you' tone, "Based on the attitude you displayed during work, as well as your stance during the conversation with other people, you don't seem to plan on dedicating your entire life to this job?"</br>
</br>
Miao Jun's eyes widened, he didn't understand how could they have such a detailed investigation with him just being a typical agent while still in the process of being evaluated.</br>
</br>
What he didn't know was that the enemy didn't have a detailed report on him—bluffing was a conventional technique used during negotiation. Obtaining vast amount of information through a limited amount of information, although it may not be effective against seasoned agents, was incredibly effective against new recruits.</br>
</br>
Seeing the expression on Miao Jun's face, Zhang Youjie displayed a triumphant smile.</br>
</br>
He opened his arm, stared Miao Jun in the eyes and spoke with the same understanding tone, "What's the difference? Obtaining some credentials and then retire to start a career that has nothing to do with protecting the country. With your background of being a former General Staff Department, you'll just become a bodyguard for the rich? Join us, we can make you a wealthy person right away."</br>
</br>
Miao Jun held his breath as his eyes began to waver.</br>
</br>
The ideology that had been engraved in him told him that he should reject; but with how Zhang Youjie described it, it seemed to be the case.</br>
</br>
He planned to leave the army anyways.</br>
</br>
Just look at Dagger, that was the reward for loyalty.</br>
</br>
Zhang Youjie acutely noticed the change on Miao Jun's face as he threw out another tempting offer.</br>
</br>
"One million USD, a green card, a ticket to the free world, you could easily start a new life. And what you only needed to do is to cooperate with us for one thing in the next two days."</br>
</br>
Then, Zhang Youjie no longer said anything as he silently listened to the breathing that was periodically tense, and then calm while he waited for the response.</br>
</br>
Typically, if the target was silent, it was half successful.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for fifteen minutes.</br>
</br>
"… What do you need me to do?" Miao Jun lowered his head.</br>
</br>
A victorious smile appeared on Zhang Youjie's face.</br>
</br>
"It's something simple, you only need to…"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 651: New Captain</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Good news quickly came from Donggang Plantation.</br>
</br>
It only took two days before Li Wang successfully convinced the local survivors, including the largest survivor gathering outside of the arena east of Gan River, to become part of NAC's jurisdiction.</br>
</br>
As an economic zone of NAC, Donggang Plantation would receive the management of NAC's director stationed in Hongchen, the leader would be elected by the local residents while they enjoye high autonomy. The current leader Zhang Weiping would continue to act as the first leader of Donggang Plantation.</br>
</br>
Five year term.</br>
</br>
The chip at the back of the neck recorded the mission brief of Li Wang. After reading some of the data, Jiang Chen nodded, pleased. Even with his pickiness, he could gave this guy's ability a high score of 90.</br>
</br>
Worth noting, full marks is 100.</br>
</br>
"AS Order is the aircraft carrier of NAC. As the captain, you will be the commander of this aircraft carrier. In a conquest, you will have high autonomy, and the choice you make will ultimately affect NAC's interest in the conquest area. Therefore, your ability to represent the best interest of NAC is the most critical part of the test. Congratulations, you passed the test."</br>
</br>
On the deck of the airship, under the watch of all crew members, Jiang Chen took off the golden emblem from his chest and put it on Li Wang's chest, beside the knight emblem.</br>
</br>
Under the glaze of the sun, the emblem reflected a golden ray.</br>
</br>
With the shield in the middle, the view of Order was engraved on top, two rifles crossed below the shield signaling conquest and order. From then on, he would become the flag of NAC's conquest to exert NAC's influence to places further.</br>
</br>
Feeling the hefty weight, Li Wang stood up with his back straight. His body was shaking in excitement while an inexplicable expression was on his face.</br>
</br>
After putting on the emblem for him, Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder, gazed into his eyes, and said sternly.</br>
</br>
"From today on, Order will be yours."</br>
</br>
"I will fulfill my mission!" The passion in his chest translated into his voice as Li Wang roared at the top of his lungs.</br>
</br>
"Great! That's the spirit! I'm looking forward to your performance." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The trumpeter started the music; the rough and melodious brass tone echoed in the sky.</br>
</br>
Order fired toward the lake and celebrated the appointment of the new captain.</br>
</br>
On the deck, Jiang Chen opened ten boxes of beers and asked the cooks to prepare eight tables of food for the fifty flight crew members; he announced the start of the celebration.</br>
</br>
It was certainly a difference to celebrate a thousand meters up in the air. Jiang Chen drank at least ten bottles before he was carried back to his room by his private force.</br>
</br>
The newly appointed private force captain was a young man named Lv Ze. It was the first time seeing the General so drunk, so he didn't know what to do. So he had to run back to his old captain Li Wang who was still "battling" and seek advice.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Well, he is drunk… burp, if you don't know how to take care of this, just leave it to the woman. You think that General wants a man beside him when he wakes up? Dumb!"</br>
</br>
Li Wang was clearly intoxicated as well, his speech became wild and disorganized before he pushed Lv Ze away.</br>
</br>
Embarrassed to disturb his old superior's celebration further, Lv Ze remembered his "wise words" and ran back to the captain room – before the official handover, the spacious room was still Jiang Chen's personal bedroom.</br>
</br>
"Captain, boss already puked twice!" When Lv Ze returned, his soldier began to complain.</br>
</br>
"Did you feed the General some medicine?" Lv Ze was completely clueless.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but the effect is not obvious!"</br>
</br>
"Captain Lv! General puked again!" The scream of agony came from the room.</br>
</br>
[What should I do!]</br>
</br>
Lv Ze looked around while pondering for a solution. He suddenly thought of a person and immediately said, "Where did Sun Xiaorou go? Get her to take care of the General. We are not convenient to draw a bath for the General. She can do that!"</br>
</br>
"Little Wu already went searching for her, she is not on the airship!"</br>
</br>
[With all men on the airship, where am I going to find a woman? The entire crew is drinking; it is not possible to lower the elevation either!]</br>
</br>
[How about… I'll just get someone to help General shower and change?]</br>
</br>
[But what if General is not happy! This is my first day on the job!]</br>
</br>
Hastily, Lv Ze suddenly thought of a person and dragged onto one of his soldier.</br>
</br>
"Go to the command room and get Advisor Han here."</br>
</br>
"Advisor Han? Are you sure?" The soldier trembled when he thought of the emotionless female superior.</br>
</br>
"Stop yapping around, go now!" Lv Ze said decisively.</br>
</br>
"Okay, okay!" The soldier took the order, bit the bullet, and ran to the command room.</br>
</br>
"All of you, get out. Leave this to Advisor Han, we'll stay somewhere else." Lv Ze ordered the private force soldiers taking care of Jiang Chen to come out.</br>
</br>
"Is, is it really okay to just leave the General here?" A soldier hesitantly asked.</br>
</br>
"Are you dumb?! If you're the boss, would you want a hot girl taking care of your or bunch of sweaty men taking care of you? Stop yapping, listen to Brother Lv, and let's go." Another soldier dragged his comrade out of the door.</br>
</br>
Lv Ze didn't know what to say and couldn't think of a way to explain to Advisor Han, so he didn't bother finding an explanation and directly left the mess in her hands to avoid the awkwardness.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long before Han Junhua walked to the door of the captain's bedroom.</br>
</br>
She furrowed her brows at the scene. Jiang Chen was snoring, his coat was taken off, and his clothes was stained.</br>
</br>
"How did he get so drunk? How much did he drink?"</br>
</br>
No one replied.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua turned around, the private force soldier that had taken her there already disappeared.</br>
</br>
The door to the bedroom was closed too.</br>
</br>
She expressionlessly looked at the sleeping face and was silent for a long time, before she let out a sigh. Speechlessly, she put him around her arm, and dragged him into the washroom.</br>
</br>
Without any extraneous emotion, she just purely thought… she had to do something.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua took off the puke stained shirt and looked at the firm chest.</br>
</br>
Already her heart was beating fast, she didn't have any corresponding emotion in her heart.</br>
</br>
"Is dopamine excretion accelerating? Really incredible. Obviously human feelings rely on hormone secretion, but the Psychic Commissar is able to cut off the link between the two." Han Junhua's index finger gently tapped Jiang Chen's chest, feeling the hot temperature and at the same time feeling the odd peacefulness.</br>
</br>
"What an annoying feeling."</br>
</br>
Han Junhua shook her head, retracted her finger, and planned to change him into something else.</br>
</br>
But then, she saw the sweat drops on his muscle, and she began to contemplate.</br>
</br>
[With so much sweat, I should help him take a shower first before changing into clean clothes?]</br>
</br>
[Logically speaking, it is better to take a shower or else the sweat would drench the clean clothes.]</br>
</br>
As she thought, she put her finger on her own buttons and put her jacket into the basket.</br>
</br>
To prevent making her own clothes wet, she took off her stockings and uniform, only leaving a thin white shirt.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua put his arms around her shoulder and felt the temperature on her back was even hotter. It could be because the amount of fabrics between the two decreased, or it could be because he was sweating.</br>
</br>
"...?"</br>
</br>
When she remembered the experience in the black room, the hotness on her back began to decrease.</br>
</br>
[Is it because my body temperature is increasing?]</br>
</br>
She didn't understand the feeling.</br>
</br>
She filled the bathtub with warm water and finally thrown Jiang Chen into the water. She let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
She felt relieved.</br>
</br>
With a wet towel, she cleaned his body. Just before she turned around to grab a dry towel, her hand on the bathtub was being held.</br>
</br>
"…?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua turned around and looked at Jiang Chen with questions in her eyes.</br>
</br>
But she was met with a pair of passionate pupils.</br>
</br>
The intimate atmosphere lingered between the two.</br>
</br>
Although she couldn't read the odd atmosphere, she could feel her heartbeat begin to accelerate and her body temperature was gradually increasing.</br>
</br>
The heat from her wrist made her suddenly not want to resist.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the drunk Jiang Chen didn't say anything and suddenly dragged her in.</br>
</br>
Without being able to react in time, she fell into the bathtub…</br>
</br>
"Pooch—"</br>
</br>
Water splashed around and her shirt and pencil skirt were soaked. Her eyes widened and a rare disbelief was in her eyes.</br>
</br>
The frosted glasses reflected two warm-colored figures followed by a monotone monstrous roar.</br>
</br>
Bathtub, toilet, sink, hallway, desk, the sheets in the middle of the bedroom… the marks of battle could be seen everywhere.</br>
</br>
The gorgeous face like an eternally froze ice without any expression began to melt into the flush of the spring rain, starting to ripple in the nightfall…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 652: Quantum Computer Research Institute</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Because the first time was in the bathtub, the mark of her virginity was nowhere to be found.</br>
</br>
The only evidence that could prove what happened last night was the still lingering pain.</br>
</br>
Han Junhua felt the unforgettable sharp pain and a hollowness in her mind, but it was soon filled up by something else…</br>
</br>
It was difficult to describe.</br>
</br>
She was hugged tight by the muscular arm; she slightly moved her neck and adjusted into a more comfortable position while savoring the inexplicable after feeling.</br>
</br>
[If I could… from this warmth…]</br>
</br>
Of course, she knew if Psychic Commissar could be removed this easily, she would be underestimating the power of technology.</br>
</br>
She lied flat while staring at the ceiling.</br>
</br>
She felt tired, so she temporarily gave up on thinking.</br>
</br>
The warm but heavy breathing hushed into her ear and made her tickle, but it was also oddly reassuring.</br>
</br>
[It is hard to believe, the dependence of the environment because of temperature is too stupid…]</br>
</br>
As she thought, her mind began to turn cloudy. She closed her eyes at dawn to fall asleep again.</br>
</br>
It was not until noon did the two wake up to Sun Xiaorou's grin.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his eyes and watched the gentle smile. He had a feeling of being caught cheating.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
"Boss, you… you can't blame me for that. We wanted to go find Miss Sun, but she was not on the airship." Lv Ze tried to justify himself with a bitter face.</br>
</br>
"But you can't go find Jun… Advisor Han, you can just find anyone to change for me," Jiang Chen criticized him snappily.</br>
</br>
Although Han Junhua didn't say anything when she got up, nor was she angry, she didn't have any extra expression at all. However, Jiang Chen had a feeling where he owed her.</br>
</br>
"Then, then next time General is drunk, I will find you a man…" Lv Ze carefully said.</br>
</br>
"… Just find Advisor Han."</br>
</br>
After kicking Lv Ze out, Jiang Chen packed up, got off the airship, and officially moved the command post from the air to the ground.</br>
</br>
When he stepped into the newly built command post, he bumped into Sun Xiaorou waiting at the door.</br>
</br>
Still the same long dress, Xiaorou looked at Jiang Chen with a grin.</br>
</br>
"Are you all packed up? Brother-in-law."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm… I'm packed up." Jiang Chen awkwardly replied.</br>
</br>
"Brother-in-law looks a bit tense."</br>
</br>
"Do I? Haha, hahaha." Jiang Chen forced a few laughs, but it was not enough to fool Sun Xiaorou.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou slowly strolled beside him, took the luggage in his hand, and whispered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"I promised sister to look after you when you're outside."</br>
</br>
"This, it was an accident." Jiang Chen looked away in embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Oh? How are you planning to treat Sister Junhua then? Although there was still a smile on her face, Sun Xiaorou's eyes were mixed with a hint of seriousness.</br>
</br>
Silence lasted for half a minute between the two.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although he knew he was greedy, Jiang Chen still said the most honest thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
"…I'll take responsibility."</br>
</br>
"Humph."</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou turned around, left Jiang Chen, and walked to the hall.</br>
</br>
But just a few steps later, the dress swayed and she quickly turned. She looked backed with a grin, "Looks like you still have some conscience. If you didn't take responsibility, I would have been disappointed."</br>
</br>
"That's something odd to be disappointed about." Jiang Chen face palmed.</br>
</br>
With her finger on her lips and still the same gentle smile, Sun Xiaorou titled her head, unaware.</br>
</br>
"Is it?"</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
After nearly half a month of investigation, the precise location of the quantum computer research institute was determined.</br>
</br>
The location was in the high technology park in the east. Due to the structure of building primarily resided below ground, it was able to be preserved. Although it was not far from the blast center of the nuclear explosion, the structure only received minor structural damage.</br>
</br>
Because of this, the place became a nest for mutants and resided a dangerous mutant named "Piano Queen"– a mutated spider. The head-sized spider did not rely on venom or teeth to hunt, but used its spider web to form deadly traps to wait for the preys to step into their own death.</br>
</br>
The near graphene ring structure even possessed the resiliency of Nano material and was almost undetectable under a faint light environment. A fly passing through the scattered web could still fly two or three meters before being cut cleanly into several pieces…</br>
</br>
Even the Death Claws could suffer a tragic ending if it accidentally entered its territory.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine, a small creature 2 cm tall could evolve into such a deadly creature.</br>
</br>
But "Piano Queen's" weakness was obvious.</br>
</br>
Once their traps were detected, they would lose the purpose of the trap. Without any attack ability, they had no way of fighting back before being burned by NAC soldiers with flamethrowers.</br>
</br>
After the mutants in the building were cleared out, reconnaissance soldiers began to search the internal of the building and finally determined the core lab of the quantum computer research institute to be located on the most bottom floor.</br>
</br>
Here comes the show.</br>
</br>
In a building preserved with PAC core technology, the security level was naturally not low. Even twenty years after the war, the security robots hidden in the corners of the building still maintained their functionality while waiting for intruders to wake them up.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen determined the security level of the building, Jiang Chen executed the attack.</br>
</br>
Obtain the password?</br>
</br>
Funny, after so many years, where was he going to find the password?</br>
</br>
As to hacking, that was even more of the question. To display the hacking skill at the quantum computer research institute was making a fool of oneself. The network security level was at least double of the bank.</br>
</br>
Even Yao Yao wouldn't be of help.</br>
</br>
Lv Ze took the private force and following Han Junhua's plan, exploded the side wall of the research institute before successfully enteromg the building.</br>
</br>
Eerie blue laser bullets danced among the hallways and collided with the orange bullet hailstorms.</br>
</br>
Because of the security system established by the quantum computer possessed high information suppression ability, the soldiers inside the building could not use drones or robots to assist them.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen finally understood why the Zhao Corporation couldn't get a few quantum computers; it was pretty darn difficult to obtain one.</br>
</br>
But fortunately, the private force soldiers were prevailing, with the support of the soldiers, they took an entire day to break through the security system of the building to arrive at the lab on the bottom floor…</br>
</br>
"Is this the production line for the quantum computer?" Jiang Chen looked speechlessly at the production equipment piled into a small mountain on the floor.</br>
</br>
[Damn, just by placing them together, they occupied over one thousand square meters in area.]</br>
</br>
To move the equipment out from underground, scientist from Fallout Shelter 027 had to travel there through the blimp and instruct the soldiers on what could be taken apart and what must be moved with extra caution.</br>
</br>
The parts were packed up, data copied, not even a single table or chair was left behind. With the scientists' directions, NAC soldiers raided the entire lab as if locusts had swarmed a crop field.</br>
</br>
The scientist responsible for the research of quantum computer was Zhang Fan. He was standing beside Jiang Chen currently and explaining to him some of the technical backgrounds</br>
</br>
"This doesn't include the general electronic parts as well as the shell of the computer."</br>
</br>
"Just give me some numbers, how many people do I need to get a plant running, how much land do I need?" Jiang Chen looked at Zhang Fan.</br>
</br>
"That… that is hard to say. Including the production of the general electronic parts, if we reach 50% automation, the entire plant would require 165 hectares of land and 5000 technical workers." Zhang Fan gave a conservative estimate.</br>
</br>
"Where am I going to find that many technical workers?" Jiang Chen said with a headache.</br>
</br>
All the technical workers in the Sixth Street were barely that number.</br>
</br>
"Ummm… General, don't think it as being too difficult. Knowledge can be learned through the virtual reality education system, and with the unopened fallout shelters in Wanghai, there are plenty of workforce with a high academic background," Zhang Fan said.</br>
</br>
"Fallout shelters are too unreliable, one would only popup once in a while. Let's think of a way to speed up the process. How long would it take to train a technical worker in the virtual reality education system?" Jiang Chen paused, before he added, "Starting from zero."</br>
</br>
"Probably a year."</br>
</br>
"That's too long." Jiang Chen shook his head."</br>
</br>
"It would probably take a year to absorb the technology in the production line. It is not too long," Zhang Fan explained."</br>
</br>
"NAC's gap in quantum computer is too large. Do you have any way to solve the production issue as soon as possible?" Jiang Chen's eyebrows furrowed.</br>
</br>
Without letting Jiang Chen down, Zhang Fan nodded, but he was hesitant.</br>
</br>
"Of course, since we obtained the technology related to the quantum computer, we could use 3D printing to produce at a small scale. But the disadvantage of this method is obvious… you know, for the product with high technical requirements and multiple parts, 3D printing is not only inefficient, the cost is also three times normal production through economy of scale."</br>
</br>
"Three times? Give me an estimate."</br>
</br>
"A commercial quantum computer will at least cost 300,000 credits."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen twitched at the response.</br>
</br>
The war only costed 400,000 credits till now.</br>
</br>
While he was pained, the money still needed to be spent. He will obtain the material from the modern world which should bring some cost savings. If the production problem of quantum computers could be solved, the expansion speed of the virtual reality network could be sped up in the modern world.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry about the money. Make two first."</br>
</br>
"Two?"</br>
</br>
Zhang Fan thought he heard wrong. However, seeing Jiang Chen nod, he confirmed his wasn't delusional.</br>
</br>
"How long will it take?"</br>
</br>
"One should be ready in one month and the second one probably just needs half a month," Zhang Fan said with certainty.</br>
</br>
"I will leave this to you. Get on it soon. Also, keep an eye on the technical workers' training."</br>
</br>
After assigning the task to Zhang Fan, Jiang Chen left the empty lab and headed back to the command post.</br>
</br>
Along the way, he bumped into Zhao Chenwu, so he stopped and said hello.</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu was there to see him.</br>
</br>
"What happened? Why're you in a rush?"</br>
</br>
Gloom covered Zhao Chenwu's face as he said.</br>
</br>
"Federation. They have started to make moves."</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 653: Dumping</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Since the open border agreement was enacted, the merchant fleets of Federation flooded into Qingshan Arena. After closure of more than a decade, the crowded and poor capital, the present day Qingshan Town, finally welcomed its long awaited prosperity.</br>
</br>
But the harmonious trade only lasted for two days.</br>
</br>
On the third day, the trucks from a few major chambers of commerce of Federation suddenly appeared in the Qingshan market. They put out giant signs in front of a few stores with the words "fire sale" written on them.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the salespeople in front of the store began to yell at the top of their lungs.</br>
</br>
"Cheap nutrient supply! Multiple versions available. Massive fire sale! Cheaper than the market price by 30%, don't miss out on this opportunity!"</br>
</br>
"Our store is selling it at a 40% discount! Is there anywhere cheaper than us? Come buy! If you miss the opportunity, you'll have to wait till next year!"</br>
</br>
"Buy, buy, buy. Since this is a necessity anyways with a long shelf life, it is not bad to store it at home. Where are we going to see such a massive sale again?"</br>
</br>
The residents seeing the opportunity all gathered around. With the shouting and yelling, they took out the crystals from their pockets and grabbed the cheap nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
The unexpected sale made all the store owners stare at their empty stores, completely dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Fire sale as well?</br>
</br>
But the merchants from Federation were all selling near cost! Some merchants even discovered that the price was lower than their cost. Rather than selling their own nutrient supply, it was better to purchase from Federation's store.</br>
</br>
Nobody thought that the common necessity could cause a massive shockwave.</br>
</br>
People had ideas.</br>
</br>
The major retailers of nutrient supply in Qingshan gathered together to discuss about purchasing the nutrient supply from the merchants of Federation, and then slowly wait for the excessive nutrient supply to be consumed by the market before letting the market price become rational.</br>
</br>
While the imagination was great, the reality soon proved to be cruel.</br>
</br>
The retailers took out 100,000 crystals to purchase away all the nutrient supply from the merchants of Federation. But before they could catch a break, a massive batch of nutrient supply was hauled into Qinghsan again.</br>
</br>
The massive dumping still persisted.</br>
</br>
Only in two days, based on estimate, the average nutrient supply held by the residents of Qingshan reached 600, it was enough for the survivors to eat for over half a year. And now, even the merchants of Federation couldn't dump any longer. The market was flooded, the local residents, due to the purchase frenzy, no longer had any crystals in their hands.</br>
</br>
After the frenzy, it was depression.</br>
</br>
To the current situation of Qingshan, Gears Chamber of Commerce was extremely pleased. As the supporter hidden behind the curtain for the Federation President, they were the ones that facilitated the peace with NAC as well as the open border agreement, and the perpetrator of the nutrient supply dump.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jia Ming, I will congratulate you in advance in becoming the president of the entire Hongchen area."</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, you're flattering me. Without your help, Mr. Liu, I wouldn't receive such an honor."</br>
</br>
Around the dinner table, Jia Ming continuously toasted with the merchant called Mr. Liu. Although he was the honorable president, he knew that half of the reasons why he stepped onto this position was because of the work of the man in front of him. Therefore, in front of wealthy man, he didn't act like a president at all.</br>
</br>
"NAC conquered the capital, but they wouldn't have ever thought that their fruit would end up in our hands. Hehe, how satirical." Liu Hong sunk into the chair, swirled the wineglass in his hand, and said casually.</br>
</br>
"What's your next step?" The president asked.</br>
</br>
"The market in Qingshan is a complete mess now. We only need to wait for the local merchants to go bankrupt. Then, we'll purchase their dumped assets from the bottom," The small eyes narrowed into two lines as Liu Hong said malevolently.</br>
</br>
"Do you need my cooperation?"</br>
</br>
"No, we just need to follow our plan," Liu Hong said, slowly.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Were those nutrient supplies really okay?</br>
</br>
Of course they were okay.</br>
</br>
Regardless how they were inspected, the nutrient supply was a proper product and not second grade.</br>
</br>
Most of the survivor gatherings with size would all inspect the product in an event where a massive amount of product enter the market. Since some of the D-grade nutrient supply was made with the flesh of mutants and zombies, without the examination of toxicity, who would dare eat it? And the possibility of raiders pretending to be merchants to poison the survivors was also a possibility.</br>
</br>
But because of the massive dump of the merchants of Federation, Qinghsan's inspection personnel tightened the examination of nutrient supply entering the market to prevent any poisonous products from entering the market.</br>
</br>
If it were the leaders of small survivor gatherings, they would laugh in their dreams with how cheap the nutrient supply was.</br>
</br>
But to the leaders of the more prominent locations, excessive nutrient supply would not only make people "full", they would make people "bloated"…</br>
</br>
"There are currently three nutrient supply retailers with a partnership with our cooperation that have gone bankrupt. If the nutrient supply price continues to remain low, with consideration of the margin, we must close the 100 acres mutated fruit plantation in Golden River Farm… Of course, I won't do that. But there are smaller shareholders demanding us do that," Zhao Chenwu said.</br>
</br>
"What do they want to do?" Jiang Chen furrowed his brows.</br>
</br>
"Use nutrient supply to disrupt our market. Not only nutrient supply but because of the massive dump, our merchant business' sale slid by 28%, and the other non-related industries also experience downward pressure in revenue," Zhao Chenwu said.</br>
</br>
"Using nutrient supply to 'raid' the currency from the consumers' hands and forcefully extracting the buying power from the market. Not only is nutrient supply affected, the instant noodles, compressed crackers, canned food, and other replaceable products also experienced dramatic influence. Weapons, ammunition, and even clothes are impacted…"</br>
</br>
"Not only that, inside the Sixth Street bank exchange, the price of land sales of Golden River Farm also slid down. Since… if Federation has such cheap nutrient supply, the raw ingredient mutated fruits are also effected."</br>
</br>
"Chain reaction? …it is impacting the Sixth Street six hundreds kilometers away," Jiang Chen thought, "But I don't understand, how they can supply the market with this much nutrient supply. Are they not afraid of going bankrupt with the dumping strategy?"</br>
</br>
"They could use the crystals they obtained from the dump to purchase the depreciated land. In this case, they not only would not lose any money, they could gain massively."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen understood with Zhao Chenwu's explanation.</br>
</br>
No wonder he was the devious merchant, this guy instantly read through the conspiracy of the merchants of Federation.</br>
</br>
The amount of crystals flowing the Hongchen market decreased would result in the purchasing power of crystals to forcibly increase. And nutrient supply's dump would result in the arable land depreciating, it would allow them to purchase more lands from farmers or bankrupted merchants.</br>
</br>
Finally, they will gain a monopoly of the mutated fruits in Hongchen and in turn monopolize the nutrient supply market.</br>
</br>
By that time, the price of nutrient supply would be determined by the merchants of Federation.</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen already knew their intention, he would not let their plan come to fruition. With an idea in his mind, a smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
"Gain massively? Hehe, I will make sure they lose everything."</br>
</br>
"Looks like you have a plan already, I won't offer my strategy then." Zhao Chenwu had a grin on his face too.</br>
</br>
"Of course there is a strategy, but I need your cooperation."</br>
</br>
"At the command of the General, at any time!"</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 654: Currency Weapon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the early morning of the next day, the merchants of Federation went to the market. They leaned against the quiet stalls, grinning at the angry Qingshan merchants.</br>
</br>
Although they belonged to different chambers of commerce, they were all linked with the same name - Gear Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
Liu Jin, the sales of the Gear Chamber of Commerce, joined Gear Chamber of Commerce due to his relationship with the boss, Liu Hong, but because of his sales ability, he quickly received the unanimous approval of the Chamber of Commerce shareholders and was repeatedly appointed with important tasks.</br>
</br>
At this moment, as one of the masterminds behind the dumping, he leaned against the door of a grocery store belonging to the Gear Chamber of Commerce while looking at the depressed market with ridicule on his face.</br>
</br>
To be honest, although he was in full control to win this trade war, he was still anxious.</br>
</br>
After all, NAC was a violent institution. If it can't win economically, it may flip the table and he wouldn't be able to do anything about the fact. While the consequence would cause great damage to NAC's influence and reputation, Gear would also suffer some losses.</br>
</br>
Boss Liu Hong judged that Jiang Chen would not sacrifice the influence of the entire NAC for the market of Qingshan. But as one of the masterminds, he, too, was uncertain.</br>
</br>
The honest militia guarded the entrance to the market and used their eyes to signal that the local businessmen on the verge of rebelling were not to cause trouble.</br>
</br>
Although they became aware of some of the insider information and also despised the actions of Federation merchants, they were powerless as soldiers. Their task was to maintain the security of the market, not financial order.</br>
</br>
With the decline in the price of nutrient supply, the land price of Golden River Farm plummeted and dropped 30% in three days.</br>
</br>
Federation dumped its two-years of hoarded nutrient supply in a few days. Although they lost nearly a million crystals from this move, they would reap ten times the reward as long as they could quickly change the crystals into land!</br>
</br>
There weren't many nutrient supplies on the truck behind them. But it didn't matter; no one was willing to buy this stuff anymore.</br>
</br>
The price of B-grade nutrient supply had fallen to one crystal for ten. Grade C, D, E nutrient supply synthesized by mutant flesh and blood no longer had a market.</br>
</br>
The current situation was that, for every ton of mutant fruit produced by farmers, the net loss was 10 crystals. For every tone of B-grade nutrient supply the processing plant produced, the net loss was 1100 crystals.</br>
</br>
The nutrient supply processing plant in Hongcheng had been completely shut down and about 600 workers had been laid off.</br>
</br>
The decline in the price of nutrient supply brought down the prices of a series of commodities such as rifles, bullets, protective gears and medicines. However, the result didn't improve the lives of local people. They lost all their purchasing power. The reason for the price decline was simply due to the reduction in crystals flowing in the market.</br>
</br>
</br>
These cheap necessities were bought by merchants from other areas, and 80% of these necessities flowed to Federation.</br>
</br>
Soon Qingshan would be in recession. People would start to realize that while the price of products were cheap, they just couldn't afford it…</br>
</br>
However, these Federation merchants didn't get to enjoy their success for too long.</br>
</br>
Just after the market opened up, Zhao Corporation raised a sign.</br>
</br>
[Exchanging B-grade nutrient supply credit, one credit in exchange for ten nutrient supply.]</br>
</br>
B-grade nutrient supply accounted for the largest percentage in the food consumption market. With the raw material being mutated fruits, the raw material was more stable than the other grades. Its price dictated the movement of other nutrient supply grade prices.</br>
</br>
As for the credit system, the people of Hongcheng certainly were no strangers to it. In areas under NAC's control, as long as a signal was available, it was possible to access their bank account in the Sixth Street and interact with other accounts for payments, collections and other operations.</br>
</br>
In addition to digital currency, the Sixth Street Bank also issued banknotes for merchants to use in other regions. Therefore, in areas outside of NAC, it was also possible to see the notes being used. The merchant fleets heading east all recognized the value of the note.</br>
</br>
At present, the accepted exchange rate between credit and crystal was 1 to 5. In places further, the rate was 1 to 4 or 2 to 5. However, in Hongcheng, the standard exchange rate was used.</br>
</br>
Under normal circumstances, the price of a B-grade nutrient supply was 0.5 crystal, the current market price was 0.2, exchanged into credit, it was 0.04.</br>
</br>
What is the Zhao Corporation thinking?</br>
</br>
A nutrient supply purchased at a price of 0.1 credit. Is it trying to artificially inflate the price of the nutrient supply?</br>
</br>
Liu Jin was in disdain.</br>
</br>
It was too late to do anything. Even if they ate all the losses and bought all the products available in the market, it would still be futile. The survivors would be happy to sell their nutrient supply at 0.1, but would they be willing to buy at a price of 0.1?</br>
</br>
And they already reached the goal of boosting the value of crystal. Disregarding the fact the survivors here had yet to adopt to the credit system. Even if everyone recognized the value of the credit system, crystals would still remain the strongest currency.</br>
</br>
Unless NAC transported crystals by truckloads from other places to here and forcibly injected them into the market. Or else, no matter what they do, it would be futile.</br>
</br>
"Boss, Boss Liu."</br>
</br>
"What is it?" Liu Jin, in a cheerful mood, looked at one of his pawns.</br>
</br>
He was in a good mood. He was about to lead Gear Chamber of Commerce to launch the first attack in monopolizing Hongcheng's nutrient supply market!</br>
</br>
However, just as he was fantasizing what kind of praises the Gear Chamber of Commerce would award him with, his pawn while trembling, handed him the newspaper.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Liu Jin frowned and took the newspaper.</br>
</br>
"The newspaper from the Sixth Street...a scanned copy from our merchant fleets."</br>
</br>
Liu Jin opened the newspaper and slowly scanned the contents of the newspaper. However, when he saw the headline, his heart suddenly sunk.</br>
</br>
[Ten mutant farms in Wanghai all announced an increase of production simultaneously. The value of crystal could experience the biggest drop in a single quarter.]</br>
</br>
[Sixth Street raised the official exchange rate between credit and crystal from the original 1:5 to 1:10!]</br>
</br>
At the same time, NAC announced that because of the overcapacity of crystal ranches, crystal was in a state of oversupply at the Sixth Street. In order to encourage investors to use credit with more stability, all real estate transfer in areas covered by NAC signal must be settled by credits.</br>
</br>
If crystal must be used, a tax would be imposed on both buyers and sellers...</br>
</br>
Seeing this while also witnessing more people gather around Zhao Corporation's shop, Lin Jin was sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
[It's just shameless to directly manipulate the exchange rate!]</br>
</br>
Not just that. The combination of moves made by the NAC directly prevented the possibility of purchasing real estate assets from the bankrupted survivors. In just the past five days, the crystals they hoarded by dumping nutrient supply suffered astronomical loss.</br>
</br>
Now, even if they hauled trucks full of crystals, no one would be willing to trade with them. Unless they paid a higher price at a exchange rate of 1:15 or even 1:20 to sell their crystals, or else no one would use their credits to exchange for the depreciating crystals.</br>
</br>
Gear was now "stuck" with crystals!</br>
</br>
[It's all over...]</br>
</br>
Liu Jin dropped down on the ground. He felt dizzy. He pushed away his pawn who was trying to help him up, stormed into the store, and took out a phone from the drawer.</br>
</br>
He must get in touch with his boss.</br>
</br>
At the moment, Liu Hong, the owner of the Gear Chamber of Commerce, was sitting in an office chair, staring blankly at the ceiling of the office.</br>
</br>
The loud phone rang in the office, but he didn't want to pick it up.</br>
</br>
Just half an hour ago, the wealth of the Gear Chamber of Commerce shrunk by half, and shareholders were blowing up his phone with phone calls.</br>
</br>
He already considered all kinds of situations, including the NAC accepting losses by purchasing the nutrient supply in the survivors' hands at a premium. He also considered NAC breaking the free trade agreement and learning from Empire in terms of imposing high tariffs on foreign businessmen. That way, they'd avoid the depression of the market at the expense of raising the cost of living for locals.</br>
</br>
However, he did not consider that the NAC would actually leverage the currency itself.</br>
</br>
And this move directly handicapped the Gear Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
So sudden that it completely caught him off-guard.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Liu Hong silently took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it up. He rarely smoked in the office. Although he was the most powerful man in Federation, he had strict control of himself. But now... he wanted to relax.</br>
</br>
Liu Hong closed his eyes, leaned back against the chair, and began to think about the next countermeasures.</br>
</br>
However, what made him desperate was that he couldn't think of any good measures. If NAC was set to push the new currency into Hongcheng, even if Gear Chamber of Commerce controlled even more crystals, it could not fight back against the currency.</br>
</br>
Wait for the value of crystal to return to normal? They couldn't wait...</br>
</br>
Just then, his secretary opened the door and walked in.</br>
</br>
Looking at the gorgeous figure in her suit, it was the first time Liu Hong felt bored and annoyed.</br>
</br>
"What is it? I said let me have some time alone."</br>
</br>
"Boss..." Secretary Xiaoru gulped.</br>
</br>
"Hurry up," Liu Hong pinched the cigarette and said impatiently.</br>
</br>
"Our third largest shareholder, through Federation's stock exchange, sold her shares to NAC," Xiaoru said quickly.</br>
</br>
For a moment, Liu Hong's eyes turned red, and he suddenly stood up and grabbed the collar of his secretary.</br>
</br>
"What did you say! That bit*h Wu Qian sold her shares to NAC?!"</br>
</br>
"Ye…yes." Xiaoru trembled and answered while gasping for air.</br>
</br>
Liu Hong let go of the secretary's collar and sat back in the office chair.</br>
</br>
Xiaoru was coughing as she tried to gain her breath back. Inadvertently, the corner of her eye spotted her boss.</br>
</br>
She was surprised.</br>
</br>
The savvy business leader instantly aged by a decade...</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 655: Peaceful Takeover</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The exchange rate was like a knife. If it were used well, it would be able to cut off a large piece of meat from the players participating in the market without any effort.</br>
</br>
The Federation's merchants' attempted to completely shrink the mutated fruits farm area by dumping low-priced nutrient supply so that they would then gain complete control of the nutrient supply production.</br>
</br>
However, Gear Commerce of Chamber did not think that NAC would directly devalue the crystal in their hands through leveraging the exchange rate.</br>
</br>
NAC had complete control of all the mutant farms in NAC region. And those farms accounted for 20% of energy consumption in NAC! This was already a very high number.</br>
</br>
Depreciation of the crystal was like a double-edged sword, hurting others and hurting oneself.</br>
</br>
The only difference was that NAC could withstand this loss and could wait until the value of the crystal returned to normal, but the Gear Chamber of Commerce couldn't. Unless they didn't want to do business and hoarded the crystal in the warehouse for a long time.</br>
</br>
Unless NAC opened a dedicated channel for the exchange of credits and crystals... but it was obviously an unfeasible option.</br>
</br>
Zhao Corporation purchased about 500,000 boxes of nutrient supply from the market and transported it back to the Sixth Street by NAC's cargo airship. Now the population of the Sixth Street exceeded 100,000, the floating population was above 70,000, and hundreds of merchant fleets moved through the area.</br>
</br>
The nutrient supply consumed every day there was three times that of Hongcheng. The excess nutrient mixture would soon be transported out of the Sixth Street by merchant fleets to other regions. With areas under NAC control free of any danger, the cost of transportation was very low.</br>
</br>
With Qingshan market returning to normal, there was still a few incidents left to be resolved.</br>
</br>
The Gear Chamber of Commerce was in a desperate situation. It was about to welcome its inevitable collapse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately sent a merchant from NAC to register a shell company in Federation, and then contacted shareholders other than Liu Hong about the acquisition of their shares.</br>
</br>
Instead of using the depreciated crystals, he used credits.</br>
</br>
The minority shareholders wanted to get rid of their shares as soon as possible. Although the rational majority shareholders were wary of the hostile takeover proposal, when NAC's premium rose from 10% to 20%, they couldn't resist the temptation.</br>
</br>
Was holding the full warehouses of crystals with Liu Hong worth it, or was accepting the credits from NAC and starting over somewhere else a better option?</br>
</br>
Smart people already made their decisions.</br>
</br>
However, a smarter person made a decision even Jiang Chen didn't expect.</br>
</br>
The most luxurious hotel in Qingshan.</br>
</br>
The guards outside were guarding the door, and inside...</br>
</br>
</br>
"...Gulp, gulp…" After taking a drink, the beauty gasped for some air and gently brushed her hair. "Did that feel comfortable?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Sitting by the window, Jiang Chen patted the beautiful face looking up at him with a sly smile on his face.</br>
</br>
The beautiful woman smiled softly. She slowly stood up, picked up her clothes, and covered her slim figure.</br>
</br>
"Astonishing. I thought you would live in a luxurious palace."</br>
</br>
Looking at the perfect hands putting on her clothes, Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I won't stay here for a long time. It doesn't make sense to clean the palace out."</br>
</br>
Wu Qian, the third largest shareholder of Gear Chamber of Commerce. When the merchant sent by Jiang Chen went to see her, she made a special request to the merchant - "I agree to sell the shares, but I want to meet your leader."</br>
</br>
After getting permission from Jiang Chen, the NAC people escorted her to Qingshan. However, when they met, Wu Qian proposed to become the spokesperson of NAC in Federation and attached quite an attractive condition - voluntarily becoming his mistress.</br>
</br>
Wu Qian was keenly aware that NAC's acquisition of Gear Chamber of Commerce was not for the purpose of ruining the largest chamber of commerce in the area, but intended to include the entire Federation within its rule. As a result, controlling Gear Chamber of Commerce was much more important than destroying it.</br>
</br>
For assets far from Wanghai, NAC's geographic separation would make it difficult to govern. Therefore, the decision was bound to be choosing a spokesperson as they did for the Empire.</br>
</br>
Ever since knowing this fact, Wu Qian too had her own initiative.</br>
</br>
For Wu Qian's proposal, Jiang Chen felt surprised. He did intend to retain the Gear Chamber of Commerce, and he also considered the idea of a spokesperson to help him manage Federation. However, he had yet to think of a good candidate. The President would be Yu Jicheng, but the person overseeing the chamber of commerce… he must find someone smart and easy to control.</br>
</br>
And Wu Qiao, just happened to be a good candidate.</br>
</br>
虽然江晨觉得她的附加条件很没必要,但本着嘴边的肉不吃白不吃的原则,他很无节操地接受了她的"服务".</br>
</br>
于是便有了刚才那出香.艳的戏码...</br>
</br>
吴芊已经穿好了衣服,恢复了那端庄而不失威严的女强人仪容,就好像刚才什么事都没发生一样,微笑道.</br>
</br>
"那么,先前说好的事,就拜托您了."</br>
</br>
离开房间的时候,她礼貌地带上了房间的门.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen felt that her condition was not necessary, in the principle of not wasting food, he accepted her "service" without any dignity.</br>
</br>
So that just happened in the hotel room.</br>
</br>
Wu Qian was already dressed and had restored her graceful and majestic appearance as if nothing happened. She smiled.</br>
</br>
"So, what we have agreed on before, please and thank you."</br>
</br>
When she left the room, she politely closed the door behind her.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In just three days, NAC completed the acquisition of Gear Chamber of Commerce, which cost a total of 500,000 credits and they controlled 52% of the shares. At the same time, NAC used the Federation's securities trading law and offered two times premium to forcefully acquire the remaining shares from Liu Hong.</br>
</br>
At this time, the valuation of Gear Chamber of Commerce for 37% of the shares owned by Liu Hong was only worth 200,000 credits. With double the valuation, it was 400,000 credits. When Jiang Chen paid the money to Federation's stock exchange, Liu Hong was kicked out of his own chamber of commerce.</br>
</br>
It was too late to change the law then.</br>
</br>
The Gear Chamber of Commerce, which was valued at 10 million crystals, became Jiang Chen's assets overnight.</br>
</br>
As a result, the only plantation in Federation was now also under NAC's control.</br>
</br>
However, it was just the beginning of Federation's nightmare.</br>
</br>
The NAC, which monopolized the production of Hongcheng nutrient supply, immediately announced a price increase and raised the price of nutrient supply to 2 crystals, citing the reason due to the depreciation of crystal.</br>
</br>
Commodity prices skyrocketed by a factor of four, the prices of other Federation goods also skyrocketed. Although the number of crystals in Federation citizens' pockets did not change, the wealth of every citizen shrunk. Facing the strength of credits, the circulating crystals in Federation plummeted.</br>
</br>
And because the survivors of Hongcheng had already exchanged their currency for credit, the price increase didn't impact them significantly. The only ones affected were the hunters who hunted for crystals, but the loss was negligible for NAC.</br>
</br>
NAC's first stab penetrated Federation's chest.</br>
</br>
The dissatisfied peopled naturally unleashed their anger on the president.</br>
</br>
The wave of protests completely collapsed the city.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Ji Yucheng, the NAC ambassador, announced his resignation and returned to Federation's parliament. He stood in front of the public and told the story of the assassination attempts on the president and how NAC saved him.</br>
</br>
No matter which era, political assassination was always a scandal.</br>
</br>
When the president's chief of staff released an audio recording of the president purchasing his head, the public opinion naturally stood on his side.</br>
</br>
Using the public's support, Ji Yucheng immediately announced his election campaign.</br>
</br>
"Conspiracy, depression, bankruptcy...Look at what our President has done? This can't continue anymore! Before he ruins our homeland to a point it can't be saved, we must kick out this villain blinded by power. I will run for the next presidential campaign. Brothers and sisters, I need your support!"</br>
</br>
The audience burst into loud cheers. People whistled and embraced him like a savior.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the Gear Chamber of Commerce had completed its restructuring. With the support of NAC, this aged behemoth finally regained its vitality.</br>
</br>
The former third largest shareholder Wu Qian was elected as the new president of the Chamber of Commerce.</br>
</br>
The dignified and glamorous female president, with her excellent management ability and negotiation "means", received orders for nutrient supply from NAC's military government. It also signed crystal supplying agreements with seven factories from the Sixth Street which completely turned around the company.</br>
</br>
Under the money offered from NAC, the media gave high praises to her and successfully fabricated her to be one of the most outstanding merchants. But what the public opinion didn't know was how scandalous their goddess acted when she was with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
What happened next is already predictable.</br>
</br>
The scandal, weak economy, and the public dissatisfaction with the president all reached their peaks.</br>
</br>
Wu Qian used her influence to speak through the media, attacking the president, accusing him of incompetence in solving employment problems and maintaining market order. On behalf of the Gear Chamber of Commerce, she demanded the president be impeached and called forth another election.</br>
</br>
Losing the support of Liu Hong, Jia Ming could only watch this all unfold.</br>
</br>
Without the support of capital, he didn't have a fighting chance.</br>
</br>
The army was controlled by the parliament, and the parliament was controlled by the merchants. Under the sugar-coated shell of NAC, the parliaments all turned one by one. NAC promised to exercise a high degree of autonomy in Hezhong City as it did in Qingshan Town. Since their own interests would not be affected, the merchants didn't have a reason to say no.</br>
</br>
Otherwise, Gear Chamber of Commerce would be their precedence.</br>
</br>
The election took place as scheduled.</br>
</br>
Without any suspense, the people of Federation welcomed their savior to the president's throne.</br>
</br>
The first thing Ji Yucheng did after he took office was disarmament. He sighed a defence agreement with NAC. At the same time, the price of the nutrient supply controlled by NAC fell, showing his people the president's "ability".</br>
</br>
Just like that, without a single shot fire, NAC's flag rose above Federation.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
In early September, because of the dumping event, Jiang Chen's return was delayed by a month. But following the conclusion of the Federation election, everything returned to peace.</br>
</br>
With the leadership of Ji Yucheng, Federation and NAC signed a more cooperative alliance agreement, officially marking the complete control of Hucheng by NAC.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen personally visited Zhonghe City and witnessed the commercial hub of Jiangyou Province highly praised by people.</br>
</br>
To be frank, after seeing the actual city, it fell short of his expectations. The city known for its freedom and prosperity was indeed much prosperous than Qianshan Town, but compared to the Sixth Street in Wanghai, it was lackluster.</br>
</br>
But after observing the local industries, Jiang Chen noticed a few interesting things.</br>
</br>
The membrane filtration technology of Zhonghe City was more advanced than Wanghai's technology. It was no surprise that the price of nutrient supply there was lower compared to other places.</br>
</br>
Their genetically modified Carm trees not only produced tree sap of similar quality compared to Shenxiang, but the production was also 20% higher per tree. They also possessed artificial intelligence for AI, improved graphene production technology and an array of technology…</br>
</br>
Following Federation joining NAC's jurisdiction, their secretly-guarded technology flowed into NAC territory through trade routes.</br>
</br>
From this point of view, the cost of merging Federation was negligible.</br>
</br>
Wu Qian, from Gear Chamber of Commerce, accompanied Jiang Chen on the tour.</br>
</br>
Just as the people of Federation witnessed, Wu Qian utilized her exemplary diplomatic tactics to mediate the conflict between Federation merchants and NAC and facilitated a partnership between both parties. The fact that both leaders could walk side by side together successfully proved the point.</br>
</br>
Of course, their relationship wasn't as simple as what the public saw.</br>
</br>
During the multi-day visit to Zhonghe City, Jiang Chen walked out of Wu Qian's private mansion feeling refreshed.</br>
</br>
And during the same period of time, Wu Qian went to work with dark circles around her eyes and her mind constantly slipped when she was working and in meetings, clearly overworked. The employees of the chamber of commerce didn't notice the abnormal behavior of their female boss. Instead, they thought she was working too diligently for the company, which caused her to be sleep-deprived…</br>
</br>
</br>
If the people who envied her figure knew she was being "trained" every night by a man, would their worldview collapse?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen occasionally entertained that thought.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
But whenever he mentioned that to her, Wu Qian would "beg" him not to do that or her image would be completely destroyed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen definitely wouldn't do that since he needed Wu Qian to act as his representative to maintain the stable operation of Gear Chamber of Commerce. He did purchase the company with half a million credit points; it would be wasteful if he just allowed it to erode.</br>
</br>
But that didn't stop him from mentioning it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's inner sadist pleasure was completely pleassed by Wu Qian's desperate pleas.</br>
</br>
Of course, it might've had something to do with Wu Qian being a sadist herself.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Their pleasure aside.</br>
</br>
On the last day of the tour, Jiang Chen went to see Ji Yucheng at the Presidential Palace in Zhonghe City.</br>
</br>
After seeing Ji Yucheng again, it appeared he no longer had a defeated spirit. In a clean and fitted suit, his hair was styled and he was accompanied by an advisor.</br>
</br>
The former president Jiang Ming left Zhonghe City at the end of the election for another city. He knew that once he lost, Ji Yucheng, who was the victim of his deceitful tactics, would not let him go easily.</br>
</br>
But his previous advisor Xu Chengwei wasn't so lucky.</br>
</br>
Because he was late by a few steps, evidence of unlawful transactions was presented against him and former owner of Gears Chamber of Commerce, Liu Hong, was then arrested to await trial. The judge already hinted to Ji Yucheng that Xu Chengwei could get a sentence of at least ten years.</br>
</br>
With a taste of power, Ji Yucheng was naturally loyal to Jiang Chen because he knew everything he enjoyed was due to that man. If Jiang Cheng wanted him to lose everything, it would only take a sentence from him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Ming, who fled, and Xu Chengwei, in prison, were all perfect examples.</br>
</br>
"Currently, we're discussing the proposal to join NAC's economic zone. We already explained to the public that it doesn't mean we're surrendering to NAC, and it doesn't mean we're being controlled by NAC. It's only a method to facilitate cooperation between the two parties. NAC's merchants can have easier access to investments in Federation, and we will no longer need to pay for our defense budget; the budget can go to more meaningful things."</br>
</br>
"Is there anyone who objects?" Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but only a small number." Ji Yucheng's eyes shifted. His fingers crossed on the table and in an assuring voice, he said, "We'll convince them."</br>
</br>
"No need to be so anxious," Jiang Chen took a sip of his tea and leaned on the sofa. "I said I'd make you the president and it became reality. I also said that as long as you listened to me, you would continue to sit on the throne."</br>
</br>
"Of course I trust you. I'm just not used to it yet." President Ji let out a long breath. His tense shoulders loosened slightly.</br>
</br>
"Try to get used to it."</br>
</br>
"I will."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. After a brief pause, he continued.</br>
</br>
"Did you discover anything about who sent the letter?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was still curious as to who leaked the password to Federation.</br>
</br>
Since it wasn't Doctor Sun, who else was connected to Fallout Shelter 072? The survivor of the "disaster" mentioned by Sun Jiao? The perpetrator of the attack? Or some other person?</br>
</br>
"We have some information now. From Xu Chengwei's mouth… the former advisor, we obtained some insight through some special methods." Ji Yucheng grinned.</br>
</br>
"That's fine. I don't want to ask about the details of your interrogation. Get to the point," Jiang Chen said with irritation.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng immediately replied:</br>
</br>
"The Northern Alliance Area."</br>
</br>
"The Alliance Area… did they reach this far already?" Jiang Chen's brows furrowed as he muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng didn't disrupt Jiang Chen's thought and waited for him to continue.</br>
</br>
"Where did they go?"</br>
</br>
"They?"</br>
</br>
"The Northern Alliance Area people."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng shook his head with regret.</br>
</br>
"I sent people to search for their whereabouts, but the trail ended ten days ago… Ten days ago, they left the Dad of Death Claws Hotel in Zhonghe City then no one saw them again."</br>
</br>
[Dad of Death Claws?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows jumped. [What kind of name is this - isn't Death Claws a matriarchal species…]</br>
</br>
"Ten days ago, the second day of your presidency."</br>
</br>
"That's right." Ji Yucheng nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then can we interpret that to mean they took away former president Mr. Jia Ming?" Jiang Chen said in an undertone.</br>
</br>
"That's also what my advisor and I thought, but… we couldn't find any evidence that proved a connection." Ji Yucheng forced a smile.</br>
</br>
"Evidence is only one part of the equation. I'm not a judge and sometimes I trust my instincts more. Just like how the media can't find evidence for the 'connection' between us when we do have a connection." Jiang Chen tapped the back of his neck with his finger.</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng gulped.</br>
</br>
He was injected with an "honorary chip" and was officially a knight of NAC; it just wasn't disclosed to the public. Once Federation officially joined the NAC big family, Jiang Chen would give him an emblem.</br>
</br>
Seeing as Ji Yucheng was silent, Jiang Chen thought for a moment and continued to delegate tasks.</br>
</br>
"Compared to Wanghai, you're closer to the Northern Alliance Area. I only have one recommendation: closely monitor their activities. Do you understand what I mean?"</br>
</br>
"You mean… the Northern Alliance Area is plotting against us?" Ji Yucheng's face looked somewhat pale.</br>
</br>
Although he had never been there, based on the merchant fleets, he could experience the powerful influence of the Northern Alliance Area. Compared to that place, the areas along the coast and river were more like barren land from the destruction of war.</br>
</br>
It was the reason why the Northern Alliance Area viewed themselves as the true rulers of this piece of land.</br>
</br>
"That's right," Jiang Chen said concisely.</br>
</br>
"But they're 1300 kilometers away from us. It'll be a problem just to reach them," Ji Yucheng said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
"It's only 1300 kilometers, two times the distance from Wanghai to Hucheng. A long time ago, they declared war on us. It's just that after ten years, the fated invaders never arrived, but we never forgot about their declaration."</br>
</br>
"Hopefully they forgot about it," Ji Yucheng said.</br>
</br>
"I'll never dare to imagine that our enemy forgot about us." Jiang Chen stood up, paused, and looked at Ji Yucheng sternly. "If they ultimately fulfill their declaration of war and clash against us, it will be a war between civilizations."</br>
</br>
A war between two civilizations was far more tragic than a war between barbarians and civilization.</br>
</br>
"I understand." Ji Yucheng nodded with difficulty then continued to ask while looking at Jiang Chen, who was standing up, "Are you planning to leave?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. I'll return to Wanghai tomorrow. I'll have to count on you for affairs in Federation."</br>
</br>
Ji Yucheng took a deep breath and said with sincerity:</br>
</br>
"Leave it to me."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 657: Victorious</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"Finally going home."</br>
</br>
On top of AS Order's steel deck, gazing at the rising sun from the edge of the apocalypse, Jiang Chen was eager to return.</br>
</br>
He had been away for two and a half months, which was far longer than the originally-planned one month journey due to various troublesome problems. Of course, the rewards from this journey were incredible. Based on valuations from Sixth Street Bank analysts, this battle contributed at least five million credit points to NAC's economy.</br>
</br>
But he didn't want to think about the losses and gains; he only wanted to enjoy this beautiful view.</br>
</br>
"The weather is quite nice today." Sun Xiaorou came up from behind him. She gently tucked her messy wind-swept hair behind her ears. "There's no radiation dust; we just see pure blue and white… this is the sky's original color."</br>
</br>
The rolling clouds were like fresh-picked cotton. Like waves, they swirled around the mountain range. The Order sailing between them was just like a small boat.</br>
</br>
In contrast with the pristine blue sky, below the steel airship were ruins and shambles, broken highways and tree-covered skyscrapers, as well as occasional flames…</br>
</br>
"How big is our territory now?" Glancing down from the edge of the airship, Jiang Chen abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"From the Sixth Street to Hucheng Federation, we have around 110 thousand square kilometers of area under control," Sun Xiaorou gently said.</br>
</br>
Because Sun Xiaorou often helped her sister with taking care of affairs, she knew bits and pieces of information. There were lots of NAC inspection stations in Suhang Province, and some NAC outposts were also established to provide supplies and protect traveling merchants and local survivors.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Jiang Chen, the boss, didn't know how big his territory was at all.</br>
</br>
"Just that much?" Jiang Chen muttered.</br>
</br>
In almost two years, they only occupied around one-hundredth of the Huxia Region, not to mention the entire Pac Pacific Area.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou rolled her eyes at his greedy comment and started to giggle.</br>
</br>
"We're doing very well. Even with 110 thousand square kilometers of land, only less than 10 thousand square kilometers are developed; zombies and mutants are present in the other areas. Civilizing the land is far harder than invasion."</br>
</br>
"That's true…" Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Limited population growth was always the shackle limiting NAC's growth. Even with an expansive territory, invading the land was futile without enough people to build on it.</br>
</br>
But without utilizing the strengths of both worlds, when the Harmony invaded, he didn't think he would have any odds of winning. One hundred years meant a lifetime for normal people; it meant the entire world to them. But for a civilization, one hundred years was just a tiny slice of time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took out the thumb-sized glass bottle and carefully examined it between his fingers.</br>
</br>
</br>
The serum with an orange hue cast an irregular sheen. This genetic password that would make all the great powers envious was like a poison…</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou got closer to Jiang Chen and gently whispered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"Don't feel so rushed."</br>
</br>
"Feel so rushed?"</br>
</br>
"About your hometown."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a second to process that before a smile emerged on his face. He tousled Sun Xiaorou's head.</br>
</br>
"You're like the bug in my stomach."</br>
</br>
"You can't just touch a girl's head like that." Sun Xiaorou grinned. She put her own hand on top of Jiang Chen's head and didn't move away.</br>
</br>
"Sorry… also, you're not a child anymore, right?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"… Minus ten points for that sentence." Xiaorou pinched him on the waist before she turned around.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen watching her figure leaving with a smile before he redirected his gaze back to the water's surface.</br>
</br>
Taifu River past the treacherous mountain, across the bank of Dianshan Lake, was like a giant egg. The translucent graphene mesh reflected a colorful vibrancy under the high noon sun. Construction vehicles scattered across the construction sites, accompanying the thousands of workers building a groundbreaking piece of work.</br>
</br>
The Garden of Eden laid there.</br>
</br>
The steel airship flew above the Garden of Eden and arrived in the Songjiang Area in Wanghai. With the help of radar, it slowly descended and moved to the airship harbor of Sixth Street. The soldiers and civilians all showed their respect and cheered the "steel monster" returning from afar.</br>
</br>
The reason why they chose to park at the Sixth Street harbor was to demonstrate NAC's military might to NAC citizens and travelers. Military power and environmental stability were the priority for survivors on their search for a new home.</br>
</br>
Amidst the deafening cheers of the crowd, Jiang Chen, dressed in power armor, along with the thousand soldiers in kinetic skeletons, walked through the streets of the Sixth Street to the square in front of the Council Building.</br>
</br>
People held flowers as they welcomed their heroes home. They tossed colorful petals into the air.</br>
</br>
As the man in the black polyethylene armor bathed in the petals and applause, all the soldiers straightened their backs with pride on their faces.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked slowly purposely.</br>
</br>
The soldiers had been away from their homes for two months and fought valiantly for NAC in foreign territory; they deserved all this glory as recognition for their hard work. A lot of the single girls present not only gave them flowers, but they also gave the warriors warm hugs.</br>
</br>
It is human nature to praise heroes.</br>
</br>
An adorable girl stopped in front of Jiang Chen. While she was hugging his power armor, she suddenly tiptoed and gave him a kiss in front of everyone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know if it was her first kiss because the girl instantly buried her head and escaped into the crowd like a startled deer. Amidst the loud cheers of the crowd, Jiang Chen only hesitated for half a second before a delightful laugh came out. He raised the flowers in his hand and waved at his citizens.</br>
</br>
Heroism and beauty were eternal crowd-pleasers.</br>
</br>
The fleet stopped only momentarily before it continued forward.</br>
</br>
Half a step behind Jiang Chen, Lv Ze whispered into his ear.</br>
</br>
"Judging by her experience, she's probably someone who just came out of the fallout shelter. If General is interested, I can search for her name."</br>
</br>
Because Lv Ze was uncertain about Jiang Chen's feelings toward that girl, he cautiously didn't use "Blue Skin" with a negative connotation.</br>
</br>
"There's no need."</br>
</br>
He recalled the purity in her pupils and shook his head with a smile. He placed the fresh flowers, still dripping with dew, on a nylon hook.</br>
</br>
Lv Ze looked at Jiang Chen's back with an odd expression.</br>
</br>
[Has the Sun risen from the West? The General's now a vegetarian?]</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
At the square in front of the Council Building.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was standing on top of the podium and was handing out Knight Emblems for every soldier worthy of this honor in addition to awarding soldiers for their contributions during the war. The spirits were high and everyone's faces were filled with pride.</br>
</br>
Being personally honored by the general was a great honor for the soldiers.</br>
</br>
For the soldiers who had fallen beside the Gan River and were unable to receive recognition, the logistics department sent personnel to their family's homes along with their emblems, bonuses, and pensions.</br>
</br>
Death must accompany any war.</br>
</br>
While material compensation wasn't enough to eliminate the families' grievances, at least it would improve their lives slightly.</br>
</br>
After the ceremony, Jiang Chen headed to the director's office with Chu Nan.</br>
</br>
The moment he pushed open the office door, his eyes caught the piled stack of paper on the table.</br>
</br>
"These are?"</br>
</br>
"Military expenses that just got sent over… No need to worry about them; it just looks like there are a lot. We already made our money back by selling land certificates from Golden River Farm, but there's still a lot of work to sign every expense form." Chu Nan swept the pile of papers aside, took a document from the table, and handed it to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up a thick stack of papers and flipped through them.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"Legal document." Chu Nan had a proud smile on his face. "I referenced the law books left by PAC and asked former lawyers and economists to make amendments to the previous bills. This includes the establishment of a security exchange to separate trading and offering securities, options, land certificates from the banking system and more standardized market regulations. Please take a look."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded at Chu Nan, pleased. He closed the document. "Thank you for your hard work."</br>
</br>
"Not at all, it's part of my duty." Chu Nan smiled.</br>
</br>
"Do you have any good news?" Jiang Chen asked nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
Chu Nan paused for a second before a rare, timid smile appeared on his face. He touched his nose as he said, "How did you know?"</br>
</br>
"It's written all over your face. Were you not planning to share with me?" Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
"It's not a big deal at all; it's about my family…" Chu Nan coughed into his fist and rapidly said, "I'm about to become a father."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
[I'm about to become a father…]</br>
</br>
On the helicopter returning to the Fishbone base, Jiang Chen was contemplating those words.</br>
</br>
To be honest, when Chu Nan said that, it took him by surprise. He always thought Chu Nan wasn't much older than him.</br>
</br>
From Chu Nan getting married to Zhou Xiaoxia one year ago to her getting pregnant, his identity changed from an abject Liuding Town pilot to an almost-father.</br>
</br>
From Chu Nan's life, Jiang Chen saw the passage of time.</br>
</br>
</br>
"… Is it time for children?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen muttered. As he thought, he took out the serum from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
He took a deep breath, threw the serum back into the storage dimension and shook his head forcefully.</br>
</br>
He'd consider the question later; he wasn't ready to take on the duty of a father…</br>
</br>
The helicopter quickly arrived and landed at Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen jumped off the plane and went to see Cheng Weiguo who came to greet him.</br>
</br>
On the way back to the mansion, Jiang Chen chatted with him about the status of the base and surprisingly heard a number of good news.</br>
</br>
Last month, a new fallout shelter opened in the northwest corner of Jia City. Cheng Weiguo sent out the soldiers of the First Division and transported them to the Sixth Street before the raiders arrived, and they also explained the situation on the surface.</br>
</br>
The Blue Skins who didn't understand the situation made quite a scene. For example, one person who previously lived in the Sixth Street before realized his house was bulldozed and went to complain, but he was thrown out right away.</br>
</br>
Based on investigations, there were no observers in the fallout shelter, meaning that the purpose of this fallout shelter was truly to preserve the population without any other purpose. These fallout shelters were mostly comprised of hibernation chambers. For the survivors, it was only a blink of the eye while they traveled from a peaceful era to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
It was as if they took a maglev to the fallout shelter in the morning, wearing a suit and holding a briefcase as they entered the metal gate, then laid inside the hibernation chamber afterward. Once they woke up, the world outside was entirely different.</br>
</br>
If Fishbone base hadn't taken care of them, some of them might've died or been forced into slavery. Some of them might've abandoned the dignity of civilization and become hobos wandering the wasteland.</br>
</br>
Of course, because of the existence of NAC, they didn't need to suffer that kind of agony.</br>
</br>
Accept, "educate," and release to society. NAC needed their knowledge and abilities, especially economists and scientists whose talents were in high demand in the Sixth Street. Also, people with computer knowledge could find a good job in the military zone.</br>
</br>
After saying goodbye to Cheng Weiguo, Jiang Chen stood at the door of the mansion.</br>
</br>
When he opened the door, before he could step into the mansion, a familiar figure bumped into his chest and locked his lips with force.</br>
</br>
After a while, their lips parted. Sun Jiao stared into his eyes with her face covered in a red hue.</br>
</br>
While there were thousands of words to say, after seeing him, only a few words came out.</br>
</br>
"… Fool, why didn't you come back earlier?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen chuckled.</br>
</br>
"What are you laughing at?!" Sun Jiao stared at him.</br>
</br>
"No, nothing. Right, where is Xiaorou?"</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou returned to the base by helicopter after she got off the airship. She wasn't a soldier, so she didn't need to attend the victory ceremony nor was she was interested in attending either.</br>
</br>
"She's still at the office… She told me you'd be back in the afternoon and let me come home early." Sun Jiao said, slightly embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Her younger sister just dropped off her luggage after a long trip and immediately went to help her; that made Sun Jiao feel embarrassed as the older sister. But then she thought about Sun Xiaorou spending two months alone with Jiang Chen and her embarrassment quickly dissipated.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao hugged Jiang Chen for a long time before she let him go. She planned to save the rest of her affection for midnight.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's mouth pouted while she stared at the two of them. She had been twiddling her thumbs for a while.</br>
</br>
Seeing Sun Jiao finally letting Jiang Chen go, the little girl immediately stopped twiddling. With both hands behind her back, she anxiously closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
Her lips opened slightly.</br>
</br>
It looked like she was waiting for something…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen started to chuckle upon seeing her cute gesture and tousled her hair.</br>
</br>
"Why are your eyes closed? Don't you want to see me?"</br>
</br>
"No, no!" Yao Yao immediately opened her eyes and met Jiang Chen's gaze before quickly looking away with a blushing face. She muttered, "I was just expecting something… Ah, of course, it's okay if- Woo!..."</br>
</br>
She went from shock initially to joy, to happiness, and to finally closing her colorful eyes while gently enjoying the affection between their lips.</br>
</br>
Their lips parted.</br>
</br>
Letting go of Yao Yao, Jiang Chen stared at her blushing, red face and her watery eyes, as well as her expression which said he could do anything freely. His heart suddenly skipped a beat. He somehow felt his Loli Loving Spirit awakening.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao's flush went all the way from her face to underneath her shirt.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao will go cook now! We'll eat red bean congee today."</br>
</br>
Still intoxicated by her joy, Yao Yao giggled while stumbling toward the kitchen. She looked like she could fall at any time.</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao also grinned.</br>
</br>
"Pervert."</br>
</br>
"I didn't even do anything though?"</br>
</br>
Then Jiang Chen noticed Lin Lin's eyes drifting toward him, so he looked at her and joked.</br>
</br>
"Do you want a kiss too?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin instantly turned red and jumped up like a squirrel with her tail stepped on. She shouted at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Wh-who would want that?! What a perverted statement! Illogical… Hmph!"</br>
</br>
[I want it…] Tingting raised her hand.</br>
</br>
[You-you shut up!]</br>
</br>
The crimson light flashed at Lin Lin; the suppressed Tingting didn't try to hide her desires at all as Lin Lin escaped back to her room. She slammed the door shut while leaving the two in the living room dumbfounded.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
It was already September.</br>
</br>
With the tail end of summer passing by, the apocalypse was already cooling down. Typically, winter would arrive by the end of October with snowfall coming half a month later. Winter in the apocalypse arrived one month earlier and ended one month later compared to the modern world.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin was overwhelmed with work lately.</br>
</br>
In order to ensure the exterior structure of Garden of Eden was completed before snowfall and to shift the construction phase to the interior to maximize construction time during the winter, she spent all day on the construction site. The previously freest person in the mansion now became the busiest out of everyone.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen spent his time inside the mansion reading through the legal document amended by Chu Nan. Even though it was scanned into a digital version, the 10 MB size of the document still gave him a headache. It was also a strain on his eyes as he had to stare at the screen for a long time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had to return to the modern world by October at the latest and had to take of things before he left. He also wanted to spend time with the girls. Sometimes, he wished he could chop himself up in half, leaving half on this side and the other half in the modern world.</br>
</br>
It was becoming more and more apparent that he no longer had enough time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen placed the tablet on the table and let out a long sigh while massaging his sore eyes.</br>
</br>
It was too torturous for an engineering graduate to read through all this. When Jiang Chen thought about it, he couldn't help but scorn Chu Nan. How did a pilot become so knowledgeable?</br>
</br>
Then the door behind him opened gently. Yao Yao gently walked beside Jiang Chen with a cup of coffee and put the steamy coffee on the table. Seeing how tired he looked, Yao Yao pouted with heartache and whispered:</br>
</br>
"Big Brother… it must be tiring reading through all these documents."</br>
</br>
"It's a little tiring, but it's okay." Jiang Chen sunk into his chair and looked up at Yao Yao's caring face with a smile.</br>
</br>
"If only Yao Yao could help you out."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at the little loli with a spoiled smile.</br>
</br>
"Yao Yao is already helping me a lot - always has been."</br>
</br>
"Hehe." With a timid smile, Yao Yao rubbed her face then clasped her hands onto Jiang Chen's shoulder. "You've been working for a while, Big Brother must be tired… So, Yao Yao will massage you."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Thank you."</br>
</br>
Feeling her soft hands rubbing his shoulder, he felt like his weariness was cured.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed his eyes and began to enjoy the service.</br>
</br>
Seeing how relaxed Jiang Chen looked, a happy smile appeared on Yao Yao's face.</br>
</br>
But looking at the thick stack of documents, the little girl's mouth pouted again.</br>
</br>
If only she could help.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a spark went off in Yao Yao's head.</br>
</br>
In that instant, she thought of a spectacular idea. Even though she only knew how to program, it could help Big Brother out…</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
One morning, Jiang Chen was reading through documents as part of his usual routine. But before he flipped open the document, Yao Yao pushed open the door in a pink robe while rubbing her sleepy eyes and wandered into the room.</br>
</br>
No one had the heart to rouse her from her sleep, seeing how sleepy she looked.</br>
</br>
Because of the inhibitor injected when she was in hibernation, Yao Yao wasn't very good with mornings. But today, she strangely woke up early in the morning at eight.</br>
</br>
"Ha-, here you go~"</br>
</br>
While yawning, Yao Yao handed Jiang Chen an electronic watch.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Jiang Chen took the small gadget from Yao Yao's hands and he began to examine it closely.</br>
</br>
From the light but durable textile, it was probably graphene. The thumb-sized screen looked small but sharp. The side had a grain-sized button which could open an adjustable hologram screen.</br>
</br>
The appearance looked similar to Microsoft's smart bracelet, but the difference in content was like night and day.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took off the EP and put the watch on.</br>
</br>
It was light with barely any weight.</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen opened the screen, he was shocked to discover something.</br>
</br>
It wasn't a watch at all; it was a lighter hologram computer that carried all the functionalities of EP.</br>
</br>
A more shocking thing happened.</br>
</br>
Just as the hologram screen expanded, beside the homepage, the image of a girl projected out. She had a ponytail and her clearly defined face looked cold; her emotionless eyes seemed to resemble Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
Of course, that was just from the vibes.</br>
</br>
Seeing shocked expression on Jiang Chen's face, Yao Yao chuckled while feeling pleased. She slowly began to explain things for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Her name is 'Jian,' an intermediate artificial intelligence entity developed by Yao Yao. Didn't Big Brother want me to develop safer artificial intelligence that possessed the ability to think? Hehe, Yao Yao completed the development."</br>
</br>
With a pause and both hands behind her back, Yao Yao timidly continued, "I saw how tiring it was for Big Brother to read through the documents. Therefore… I added some assistive features to her based on the original software. I hope she can help you."</br>
</br>
At the same time, the girl in the hologram project politely bowed to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Artificial Intelligence 'Jian' at your service."</br>
</br>
"Jian's appearance is downloaded from the library's database. If Big Brother is not pleased, you can modify her yourself," Yao Yao added.</br>
</br>
"Haha, how could I not be pleased with Yao Yao's work? Appearances aside, could you describe her functionality to me?" Yao Yao touched her chin while she examined the artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
The security of intermediate artificial intelligence was inferior to basic artificial intelligence, but from a functionality perspective, the workable field of intermediate artificial intelligence was much more expansive than basic artificial intelligence. For example, basic artificial intelligence could produce logical responses based on human actions; it could make calculations but it couldn't process further.</br>
</br>
Intermediate artificial intelligence was different. Not only could it solve math problems, but it could solve even deep application questions.</br>
</br>
Based on what Yao Yao said, Jian not only possessed the ability to program herself - she could even learn knowledge she came in contact with and gain understanding. Her reading, analyzing, processing and outputting of data was far superior compared to humans.</br>
</br>
Similar intermediate artificial intelligence assistants were also seen in major corporations before the war and were commonly referred to as legal intermediate artificial intelligence. Its role often involved managing company servers and helping the president in better managing the company. In this aspect, Yao Yao's "Jian" utilized a lot of the same design principles.</br>
</br>
And the security concern Jiang Chen was most worried about wasn't a concern at all.</br>
</br>
The probability of losing control was low enough to be negligible, but the amount of hard drive and RAM space required for "Jian" was absurd, so it could only be contained in special "containers." In the modern world, the spaces available for her to stay were extremely limited, so there was no need to worry about losing control.</br>
</br>
Even if she lost control, based on the settings in Yao Yao's program, "Jian" would absolutely obey Jiang Chen, limiting the conscious derived from the program itself.</br>
</br>
Security wasn't a concern at all.</br>
</br>
"I already programmed economic and law knowledge into Jian's database. Her current knowledge level is around the level of someone with a PhD. With Jian as your assistant, it'll be a lot easier for Big Brother to read through the documents." Yao Yao smiled.</br>
</br>
After listening to Yao Yao's description, Jiang Chen looked at the watch on his wrist and exclaimed from the bottom of his heart, "It's almost like a hack."</br>
</br>
"Hehe." Yao Yao joyfully smiled. "Although I don't know what a hack is, it's great to be able to help Big Brother out."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm! Yao Yao helped me a lot this time!" Jiang Chen lovingly rubbed Yao Yao's head.</br>
</br>
This artificial intelligence could be moved to the modern world and installed into Future Group's server. Xia Shiyu had constantly been bugging him about getting an assistant and he had been considering it too but he hadn't found the right candidate.</br>
</br>
Now, which assistant could be more professional than artificial intelligence?</br>
</br>
Its efficiency couldn't be matched by the human brain.</br>
</br>
After sending away Yao Yao, Jiang Chen immediately returned to the desk and connected the tablet to the watch to order the new assistant to read the entire document. It utilized economics and law to evaluate each section of the amendment.</br>
</br>
From a beginner's perspective, it was amazing to achieve a B+ rating. Jiang Chen was extremely pleased with Chu Nan's abilities.</br>
</br>
What made him even more satisfied and amazed was Yao Yao's artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
It was a hack!</br>
</br>
"Jian… That's an odd way of referring to a program." Jiang Chen slapped his forehead and thought about a game he thought was fitting, "How about this -I'll call you 'Jean' from now on."</br>
</br>
Jean was a female name too.</br>
</br>
"Name change completed, Mr. General."</br>
</br>
"Also, don't call me General. Refer to me as President."</br>
</br>
"Affirmative."</br>
</br>
Looking at Jean on the hologram screen, a pleased curvature appeared on Jiang Chen's mouth.</br>
</br>
With Jean's help, it wouldn't take long before he could solve the problem that had been giving him a headache.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Pleasant sunshine, trees swayed with the cool breeze.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laid on the bed, rubbed his eyes, and sat up from the bed.</br>
</br>
He pushed open the window and a gust of cool wind blew by. He inhaled the refreshing air deeply and gazed into the horizon. On the peaceful shoreline, there were glimpses of cruise ships and sailboats. The fishing boats were nowhere to be seen anymore…</br>
</br>
It was the middle of summer when he left. Now it was fall.</br>
</br>
But on a tropical island near the equator, there wasn't much distinction between summer and fall. The seasons never changed and the only changing aspects were people's clothing styles, busier streets, and taller buildings.</br>
</br>
In the one and a half year after the arrival of Future Technology, the Pannu Islands also welcomed drastic changes.</br>
</br>
As for the three months he had been gone, he had a distant feeling.</br>
</br>
The mansion hadn't changed, however.</br>
</br>
Staring at the drones cutting leaves in his garden, Jiang Chen thought.</br>
</br>
"Knock, knock—"</br>
</br>
A gentle knocking came from the door.</br>
</br>
It was definitely Ayesha outside.</br>
</br>
A smile emerged on Jiang Chen's face. He closed the window, pulled the blinds, turned on the air conditioner, and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
He hadn't seen her for three months.</br>
</br>
As for what naughty things he would do next, it wasn't to be discussed with other people.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
With "Jean's" help, Jiang Chen quickly finished his work and spent a relaxing September with Sun Jiao and girls. He would return to the modern world at the beginning of October.</br>
</br>
Before he left, he went to Fallout Shelter 027 to transfer the hidden genetic code surgery and the bottle of serum to Wang Fangping. With his leadership, the life science research institute of the fallout shelter would start researching the DNA strand named "resiliency."</br>
</br>
If they could discover the secret of immortality without transferring the genetic code, Jiang Chen would no longer need to debate over changing his skills. Although he rarely needed to fight, he was pleased with his "fury" ability.</br>
</br>
On the first day in the modern world, Jiang Chen and Ayesha didn't leave the house and spent the entire day together affectionately.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen finally made a trip to Future Building and the first thing he did was install "Jean's" secondary program onto Future Group's server.</br>
</br>
The server was previously a commercial quantum computer; it was perfect as a terminal for Jean.</br>
</br>
From now on, Jiang Chen could access the status of the computer from anywhere with internet access through the watch on his left hand and execute orders to all departments. Future Technology could be considered the first corporation in the world to utilize artificial intelligence for company management.</br>
</br>
After taking care of that, Jiang Chen then visited Xia Shiyu's office to say hello.</br>
</br>
Because she was used to his sudden disappearances, during that encounter, her reaction was rather normal. But it would be impossible to say she wasn't worried at all. Due to her worry, when she saw Jiang Chen, she criticized him for a long time.</br>
</br>
</br>
"You're a billionaire - can you not suddenly disappear? If a reporter catches you, there would be chaos."</br>
</br>
"I'm okay, aren't I?" Jiang Chen brushed the problem away with a smirk. He took out a USB drive and threw it on Xia Shiyu's office table.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Xia Shiyu picked up the USB on the table, confused.</br>
</br>
"'Jean Office,' a smart office software specifically designed for our company. From today onward, I need this installed on every employee's computer. All future emails, contracts, financial statements, and performance evaluations must be uploaded through this software and copied onto the company server to achieve complete digital management!" Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu sighed and spoke with her hand on her forehead.</br>
</br>
"It's too forced to suddenly change the working software. The impact of using unfamiliar software is clear on work efficiency, and our company's current software is applicable to our business needs so there's no need to change it."</br>
</br>
"Trust me. After you use it, you'll love this software." Jiang Chen smiled with confidence.</br>
</br>
This software was an enterprise management software designed specifically for Future Group, based on Jean's assessment of the company's server data and currently software's characteristics. With the aid of the quantum computer's computational power, she created enterprise management software the size of 500 MB in less than half an hour.</br>
</br>
"Drafting the idea" took 25 minutes while the actual coding took five minutes.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu skeptically eyed Jiang Chen, picked up the USB, inserted it, and clicked her mouse a few times.</br>
</br>
It was quickly loaded and the installation tool was installed on her computer.</br>
</br>
After installation, Xia Shiyu clicked on the fated software.</br>
</br>
"There's a user manual in the folder," Jiang Chen reminded her.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm. I see."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nonchalantly scanned through the user manual and began to follow the instructions.</br>
</br>
After one minute, she began to look intrigued.</br>
</br>
After five minutes, her interested look turned into shock.</br>
</br>
After ten minutes…</br>
</br>
"Are you still not done? We're only testing the functionality…" Jiang Chen had to remind Xia Shiyu, who was constantly clicking and typing.</br>
</br>
[Face palm! It's not a fun game. It's just enterprise management software - is it that addicting?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu blushed and pushed her mouse aside.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, it's for testing this… hmm, 'Jean Office' application."</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"It's fantastic. Whether it's user experience, speed or security, everything is impeccable. Especially the employee community system that is even more refined than in social media apps - not only does it have the ability for virtual conferences, it also simplifies document uploading, reviewing, and copying to the extreme." Xia Shiyu nodded. "Just like you said, this 'Jean Office' was designed just for us."</br>
</br>
"Then does Miss CEO still have any objections about pushing this software in the company?" Jiang Chen leaned against the desk and said with a mocking tone.</br>
</br>
"I don't have any reasons to object." A curvature appeared on Xia Shiyu's mouth and her serious but gorgeous face showed a rare, delightful smile. "I trust that as soon as we're familiar with the software, the efficiency of our employees will increase by at least 10%. I'll call for a meeting to discuss this with the executives of our subsidiaries. if everything is confirmed, we'll immediately implement and push for 'Jean Office'."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's style was so sharp and fierce without lacking consideration.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Then I won't disturb you further."</br>
</br>
He turned toward the door.</br>
</br>
Just then, Xia Shiyu suddenly stopped him.</br>
</br>
"Also, President Zhang came to look for you at the office a few days ago. He seemed like he had something urgent to discuss with you."</br>
</br>
"President Zhang? Did he mention anything specific?"</br>
</br>
"I'm not sure." Xia Shiyu shook her head. "I just heard it has to do with water."</br>
</br>
[Water?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, completely lost.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 661: Lacking Water</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Compared with the quietness from a year ago, the presidential palace located on Coro Island became more bustling. The white paint and marble poles resembled the White House and the beautiful tropical garden became a tourist attraction.</br>
</br>
On the grass field in front of the palace, Jiang Chen saw the bodyguards in suits and shades; he also saw the tourists taking photos.</br>
</br>
When he arrived, the advisor of the president was already waiting at the door.</br>
</br>
He was the only one in Xin that didn't require a reservation to see the president. After explaining the purpose of the visit, the advisor respectfully led him into the grand hall and brought him to the office.</br>
</br>
There were two people sitting on the sofa in the office.</br>
</br>
One of them naturally was Zhang Yaping while the other person looked rather unfamiliar.</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen come in, the two people stood up, Zhang Yaping first introduced Jiang Chen as the more honorable guest.</br>
</br>
"This is Jiang Chen, the president of Xin's star corporation. You must have heard of him before."</br>
</br>
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen." Smith ina black suit, was clean shaven, and politely extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"This is the representative from Matrix Desalination Company, Lude Smith." Then, Zhang Yaping introduced his guest to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Smith, it is pleasure to meet you as well."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook hands with him and nodded before taking a seat. Then he looked at President Zhang Yaping.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping sensed the question in his eyes and began to explain.</br>
</br>
"So this is the case. Currently, we plan to construct a water desalination plant in Xin, so we invited Matrix Desalination Company to conduct a construction analysis for us on Coro Island."</br>
</br>
"Desalination Plant? Is there not enough fresh water on the island?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
"Not enough is an understatement. Xin's current water supply relies on imports from Australia," Smith said while taking out a stack of documents from his briefcase, "This is the underground water basin distribution amd these are the possible water treatment plant locations."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had no idea how much his water bill was for his mansion, especially compounded with the fact that he constantly ran to the apocalypse. It was not until Zhang Yaping mentioned this did he realized this problem.</br>
</br>
Before the 20th century, Coro Island's underground aquifer stored an ample amount of water. But due to global warming, rising sea level, sea water being used to clean the roads and houses, the sea water filtrated and polluted into the underground aquifer. This depleted the fresh water resources, hence the water supply on the island could only rely on the aquifer in the center of island as well as the small fresh water lake in the nearby Galin Island.</br>
</br>
Tropical regions typical experienced a long rain season and Xin had an ample amount of fresh water resources, but with the increase in immigration and exponential growth in tourism, the water system previously designed to supply 50 thousand people now must supply 150 thousand people. To avoid paying for the expensive water price, a lot of tourists came with bagfuls of water.</br>
</br>
</br>
But it made life difficult for the locals. It would be ridiculous to buy fresh water off of Amazon.</br>
</br>
Including the workers without Xin citizenship, Xin's population reached the 50,000 mark.</br>
</br>
Typically, in major city with sophisticated facility, everyone consumed on average 400 kilograms of freshwater, therefore Xin's average water consumption was 20 thousand tons of water per day. Based on stats, 1% to 2% of the water was needed for drinking, therefore Xin require 200-400 tons of freshwater for its residents.</br>
</br>
Water for showering could be conserved, but drinking water could not be conservatively measured.</br>
</br>
The saving grace was that Xin's government had money and was able to sign a water supplying contract with Australia City West Water to alleviate the water supplying pressure domestically. But the high price of transportation meant that importing water was not a long term solution.</br>
</br>
The Xin Congress voted to start a bid for the construction of a water desalination plant on Coro Island to decrease the high water price.</br>
</br>
Before the citizens' dissatisfaction turned into protest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen flipped through the documents while Zhang Yaping continued to explain.</br>
</br>
"We plan to give the water desalination plant project to you. If Future Group is not interested, we can think of other solutions."</br>
</br>
"Why doesn't CWW build the water plant?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
In Jiang Chen's memory, it was Australia's City West Water (CWW) Corporation that handled the water supply and pipeline maintenance on Coro Island. Jiang Chen was really disinterested in the fresh water market.</br>
</br>
Even if the water reached a ridiculous price of 5 USD per ton and they gained an monopoly on Xin's water supply, the water desalination plant's monthly profit was at most half a million USD.</br>
</br>
A yearly profit of six million USD would not even make a material impact on any of Future Group's internet, food, automotive, or health care business.</br>
</br>
"CWW thinks our market is not enough to support a water desalination plant and chose to ignore our bid. And other small companies don't have the ability to accept the bid. If it not possible, Congress is discussing about treating the desalination project as a social benefit project, just like state schools and have the government run it," Zhang Yapin said with a bitter smile.</br>
</br>
Continue to fund fresh water through the state could not be sustainable even for the rich Xin government.</br>
</br>
"Your proposal is?" Jiang Chen looked to Smith.</br>
</br>
Smith smiled, took the document from Jiang Chen's hand and flipped to the page with color.</br>
</br>
"Based on an assessment of Pannu Islands, Our company recommends this integrated desalination unit in this document, which uses the LT-MED principle. The entire desalination production line can handle 35,000 tons of daily capacity and the processing cost of 1.6 USD per tonne can perfectly solve the current water supply crisis facing Xin. "</br>
</br>
"What's the price?"</br>
</br>
"Including the construction of the treatment plant, the total cost is 150 million USD."</br>
</br>
"It's too expensive." Zhang Yaping shook his head.</br>
</br>
Without considering the cost of maintenance, the water desalination plant under ideal settings would take thirty years to recover the initial investment. Even with plenty of money, Jiang Chen had no reason to accept a losing deal.</br>
</br>
Smith had a helpless smile.</br>
</br>
"Water desalination is a long term investment. Trust me, the one-time investment is more worth it compared to importing water long term."</br>
</br>
"Can you lower the price?"</br>
</br>
"This is the market price." Smith, in an unnegotiable tone, said. "Matrix has designed water desalination plants for Maldives, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and their price is much more expensive compared to yours."</br>
</br>
To be honest, Smith was growing impatient after the negotiation had taken so long.</br>
</br>
The negotiation was without any progress. The Xin government wanted to use water desalination but didn't want to spend the money. The biggest water supplier CWW refused the bid from the start which made him feel like he was wasting his time.</br>
</br>
His company urged him to finish this deal and take his team to Saudi. There was a 1 billion project with Saudi National Desalination waiting for him.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen spoke.</br>
</br>
"Wait, you mean… the price of water desalination equipment is expensive?"</br>
</br>
"You think? You think water desalination is just setting up a boiler? I recommend giving it a try."</br>
</br>
Smith said hashly, stood up, left a business card on the table, and looked at Zhang Yaping.</br>
</br>
"Regretfully, Mr. President, we didn't reach a partnership. My team and I already wasted a week on the island. Regarding the cost to the geology analysis, water treatment plant location selection, we'll bill separately and send it to the Presidential Palace seven days later. If you and your advisors have come to a decision, please contact us then. I have a plane to catch in two hours. See you."</br>
</br>
Smith picked up the briefcase and left without turning his head.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping wanted to keep him here, but Jiang Chen stopped him.</br>
</br>
"Let him leave. I don't want to work without them anyways." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Eh, we'll spend the money if it is necessarily since we can't just rely on importing freshwater…. Wait, what are you saying? You want to get into the desalination business?" Zhang Yaping suddenly realized and looked at Jiang Chen, ecstatic.</br>
</br>
IF Future Group planned to take this project, there was nothing for him to worry about!</br>
</br>
"I didn't have the plan from the start," Jiang Chen started to grin, "But based on what he said, the water desalination business is quite big."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost forgot that not only Xin lacked in water! Companies such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE were all countries where water was more expensive than oil.</br>
</br>
Even in Han, why did the Han government spent massive amounts of money to move the water from the south to the north? It was because the north lacked water! If the Han government could build tens of water desalination projects off of the northern coast, there would be no need to move water.</br>
</br>
Water desalination was not a small market at all, there were massive gains! Was water desalination technology a problem in the 22nd century? Reverse osmosis, low-temperature multi-effect method, electrodialysis were all outdated!</br>
</br>
He almost didn't pick up the cash lying on the ground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't sit around any longer as he stood up abruptly.</br>
</br>
[Sorry, is it Matrix? From now on, you have competition!]</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen was about to leave, Zhang Yaping rushed to asked.</br>
</br>
"You're going to?"</br>
</br>
He didn't stop Smith from leaving, now that Jiang Chen was about to leave too, he was uncertain.</br>
</br>
Someone must take care of the fresh water problem!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stopped, turned around, and smiled at him.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to see CWW. I suddenly remembered Future Heavy Industrial could potentially make water desalination equipment."</br>
</br>
The "could potentially" almost made Zhang Yaping cough blood in anger, he heavily criticized him in his mind.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k! Why didn't you say so earlier!]</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Not only the expansive international market, once Penglai City is completed, fresh water supply would become an actual problem. A total of 300,00 units are sold as of now, even with only 50% occupancy rate, the population of Penglai would be a ridiculous number.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left the Presidential Palace, got in the car, and asked Ayesha to send him to the gate of CWW.</br>
</br>
Once they were on their way, he first called the CWW people before opening the hologram image on his left hand.</br>
</br>
Blue particles emerged and a three dimensional portrait appeared inside the car.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's widened eyes were written with shock but she didn't say anything. She closed the windows of the car and continued to focus on the road.</br>
</br>
"Jean, initiate the fourth dimensional messenger and scan the technology recovery catalogue of Fallout Shelter 027 to match seawater desalination for me."</br>
</br>
"Understood." A girl in the hologram projection nodded and the realistic curvature flashed with light blue data streams.</br>
</br>
The fourth dimension messenger was previously attached to the chip on his EP and was used to connect with Lin Lin. It was later updated to connected with the Fishbone server to ease Jiang Chen in connecting with the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Because Yao Yao's watch included the function of EP, Jiang Chen transferred the chip into the watch.</br>
</br>
"Search complete. Seven matches found."</br>
</br>
"Download to my watch."</br>
</br>
"Affirmative, Mr. President," Jean said, emotionless.</br>
</br>
Watching the bar load on the hologram screen, Jiang Chen poke the projection.</br>
</br>
"Received! You can go play now."</br>
</br>
"Question, what does go play now mean?"</br>
</br>
"Uh, it means you can come out once I need you again."</br>
</br>
It was weird feeling having someone watch you. Even if she was an AI, as other than her expression, she was too close to a human.</br>
</br>
"Understood."</br>
</br>
She nodded and her figure changed into blue letters before fading from the air.</br>
</br>
Sinking into the seat, Jiang Chen called out the documents downloaded.</br>
</br>
When the infection source was cleared from the city center, Fallout Shelter 027, with the help of NAC First Division, began to conduct technology recovery work in Wanghai's shambles. Disregarding if they digested the technology or not, all the data was inputted into the server by the thousands of researchers for future use.</br>
</br>
Water desalination technology was a common technology in the population abundant 22nd century. Although Wanghai at the mouth of Huangpu River could not experience the agony of water shortage, it didn't prevent it in providing technology service to water shortage areas of the PAC.</br>
</br>
The scientists of the fallout shelter only recorded the technology without digesting and organizing the technology yet. However, the documents themselves had comprehensive conceptual drawings and data entries so Jiang Chen could read through the content of the technology.</br>
</br>
</br>
With his finger sliding through the interface, a blue rectangle appeared and outlined the outer appearance of the water desalination device.</br>
</br>
"Who is she?" Ayesha curiously asked.</br>
</br>
"Artificial intelligence. Her name is Jean."</br>
</br>
"It is a program… I thought she was your assistant," Ayesha said in a quiet voice while making a turn.</br>
</br>
CWW's office in Xin was located in the city center of Coro Island. Fortunately, the road condition was not too bad and they arrived at their destination in fifteen minutes.</br>
</br>
With the car parked, Jiang Chen's hand grasped in the air and retracted the hologram screen before he stepped out of the vehicle.</br>
</br>
In a tourism city full of taxis, a flamboyant Lamborghini was quite eye-catching. Some tourists even took out their phones to snap a picture… although Jiang Chen didn't know why they were so excited.</br>
</br>
He walked into the CWW building and an assistant came to greet him and took him up the elevator.</br>
</br>
On the way there, Jiang Chen already phoned CWW's regional manager. Although the manager didn't want to persist with Xin's government on the problem of water desalination, with the consideration of Jiang Chen's identity, Jim Attri still agreed to his unexpected visit and moved his other meeting back by an hour.</br>
</br>
"Please sit down, Mr. Jiang Chen." Attri poured a cup of coffee for Jiang Chen and sat across from him, "I'm surprised you came to visit our company. Is Future Group interested in the water business?"</br>
</br>
"Precisely speaking, we are interested in water desalination." Jiang Chen took a sip of the coffee before he decided not to touch it anymore.</br>
</br>
It was as bitter as Chinese Medicine.</br>
</br>
Attri thought Jiang Chen was here to convince him about the water desalination plant, he sighed.</br>
</br>
"We have a running joke in our company."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Jiang Chen looked at him, intrigued.</br>
</br>
"Our company's water supplying business in Xin's total profit is not even close to our gain in real estate." Attri savored the taste of the coffee as he continued in a lighthearted tone, "For example the building underneath me, including renovations, it costed a total of 150,000 USD. Now, I can sell it for 2 million USD."</br>
</br>
"Haha, that is a funny joke." Jiang Chen grinned. "Are you that pessimistic about Xin's fresh water market? There are only 50 thousand permanent residents here, but what about a year later?"</br>
</br>
"This is not the key." Attri shook his head, threw a cubed sugar into the coffee and gently stirred, "Xin Government wants us to increase our size here but they also want to treat drinking water as a benefit. In terms of price, we don't have the ability to set the price. Although Coro Island lacked fresh water, to be honest, we don't view too positively the market here."</br>
</br>
"Then do you have plans to sell the business here?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Attri shook his head.</br>
</br>
"While we don't favor it, we don't plan to leave."</br>
</br>
"So you want to maintain the status quo?" Jiang Chen understood their strategy.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Attri agreed.</br>
</br>
Xin's freshwater pipelines were owned by CWW, other freshwater companies who want to enter the market had only two options. Either work with them or relay the pipelines. Even if the government chose to import freshwater, they still must sell the freshwater at a low price to them based on the contract before they supply the water to the residents. The buy high sell low was another form of subsidization.</br>
</br>
Attri took another sip of the coffee, looked at Jiang Chen, and used a quite surprised tone.</br>
</br>
"Is Future Group interested in the freshwater business?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen nodded again. He looked at him and continued, "Future Heavy Industrial recently made a groundbreaking discovery in water desalination technology. Zhang Yapin happened to mention to me about the water shortage in Xin, so I plan to build a water desalination plant with an estimated daily treatment amount of 40,000 tons."</br>
</br>
40,000 tons was just a conservative number, Any water desalination technology from the 22nd century had a minimum treatment amount exponentially higher than that. But for Xin, the number was enough.</br>
</br>
"With Xin's electricty price, we can control the cost of every ton of treated water to be less than 0.5 USD."</br>
</br>
"0.5 USD? That's pretty good…" Suddenly, Attri's hand holding the coffee cup froze.</br>
</br>
Bang, the cup smashed on the ground. Without caring for the coffee spilled on himself, he banged on the table and looked at Jiang Chen with eyes widened.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible! I never heard of any technology that could compress the cost to this low, even Matrix can't do this!"</br>
</br>
"But we are Future," Jiang Chen said without much expression, but he was laughing in his mind. [This is because the electricity price is high here. If it were in the 22nd century, with mature nuclear fusion technology, the cost of water desalination is not much higher than the underground water itself..</br>
</br>
Attri wanted to rebuke, but his words were stuck in his throat. He suddenly remembered that Future Group always made miracles come true and they always revolutionized the traditional way of thinking. From virtual reality to housework robots…</br>
</br>
An absurd idea surfaced in his head.</br>
</br>
Maybe they could really do it!</br>
</br>
"What do you think? Are you interested in working with us?" Jiang Chen, with a smile, looked at the silent Attri.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 663: An Old Friend</br>
</div></br>
</br>
1 US dollar!</br>
</br>
The desalinated water at this price was cheaper than some of the water pumped from the underground aquifer! Attri never heard of such a powerful water desalination technology!</br>
</br>
The cost of seawater desalination was highly dependant on the local electricity price. Xin had no oil production and used renewable resources for electricity generation. While it was environmentally friendly, electricity was not cheap. Based on CWW's estimate, a desalination plant on Coro Island, even with the most advanced equipment, would have a cost of 2 US dollar per ton.</br>
</br>
So when Jiang Chen suggested the cost of 0.5 US dollars, Attri was very shocked.</br>
</br>
Even with a nuclear power plant on Coro Island, the desalinated water wouldn't be so cheap!</br>
</br>
Both parties quickly reach an agreement and penned the negotiating terms.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy industrial will build the desalination plant, CWW will be responsible for the pipeline to connect Future Group's treated water to Xin's water supply system.</br>
</br>
Attri immediately asked his assistant to print the contract and signed with Jiang Chen a water supplying contract of 20,000 tons per day. He looked anxiously, afraid Jiang Chen may back out on the deal.</br>
</br>
When the contract was signed, Attri personally sent him to the door.</br>
</br>
"The black coffee I brought back from West Australia, do you want to take some home?"</br>
</br>
"No need." Jiang Chen thanked him for the offer.</br>
</br>
He already experienced how awful it tastes.</br>
</br>
A 20,000 tons supply agreement, take away the cost related to human labor, 0.5 US dollar per ton of profit could bring Future Group a monthly income of 300,000 US dollar.</br>
</br>
The profit was meager, even if Future Group purchased CWW's water supplying system and vertically integrated the entire chain, it would at most double the number.</br>
</br>
From the start, Jiang Chen put his focus on the international market. He happened to have a person's phone number that would definitely be interested in cheap water.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Mr. Yerif. It's me, Jiang Chen. Future Heavy Industries has some new gadgets now… No, no, no, I'm not referring to a new robot, it's water desalination equipment."</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen got into the car, he took out his phone and called Yerif in the far Saudi Arabia.</br>
</br>
"Water desalination equipment? We do have a plan to build a new seawater desalination plant at the coast of the Red Sea, but we contracted Matrix to design it for us. They are the experts in this field and an old partner of ours." Yerif heard Jiang Chen seemingly to be advertising desalination equipment to him, and his brows slightly furrowed.</br>
</br>
Although he had a great personal relationship with Jiang Chen, he would not give grounds because of personal relationships to a project related to the wellbeing of Saudi's people. Matrix promised them to build a 1,097,000 cubic meter mixed desalination plant powered by ultra-high-concentration photovoltaic technology in the Mecca area off the Red Sea coast to replace high-energy and the inefficient petroleum energy desalination plant."</br>
</br>
</br>
Although in the oil rich Saudi, electricity generation through combustion was cheap, from an environmental and sustainability perspective, the cons of "oil exchange for water" outweighed the pros.</br>
</br>
And with this mixed energy desalination plant, the cost per ton would be lowered to 1.5 US dollar. This price was reasonable to Yerif.</br>
</br>
"What is the water price for your company?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Based on half year stats, in the Mecca area, on average it is 7 Rial per ton." Yerif said while giving it a thought.</br>
</br>
7 Riyal was equivalent to 1.9 US dollar.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen estimated while a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
"Then, are you interested in 1 US dollar per ton of fresh water?"</br>
</br>
Yerif was stunned when he heard Jiang Chen's offer to the point that he forgot to open his mouth when his beautiful Amira put a peeled grape near him.</br>
</br>
"1 US dollar per ton? Cost?"</br>
</br>
"The cost is going to be a bit lower, 1 US dollar is the price we give you," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Yerif was stunned. He immediately stood up, and walked to the window of the palace with his phone.</br>
</br>
"My friend, you always… amaze me. Ahem! Can I ask, what you have said is for real? Provide water to us at a price of 1 US dollar? This is incredible, please excuse my emtional outbreak."</br>
</br>
Yerif couldn't even articulate properly.</br>
</br>
Saudi had been subsiding their domestic gasoline, power, and hydro. Just take hydro for example, to allow the four million people in their capital Riyadh to drink clear and relatively cheap water, Saudi's Royal Family must subsidize a couple hundred million a year.</br>
</br>
While Saudi is indeed rich, who wouldn't want to save money?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's 1 US dollar price would not only alleviate the water shortage, it would also bring savings to them.</br>
</br>
"Of course it is true, truer than gold." Jiang Chen's smile was pleasant.</br>
</br>
Compared to the water supplying contract signed with CWW which was close to a benefit, the contract with the oil boss Saudi was the key! 1 US dollar price, even with one million tons of water supplies, it would be 15 million US dollar in profits per month.</br>
</br>
And the desalination technology he possessed could supply far more than one million ton per month! With the partnership with Saudi, they will evitably increase the contract because of the cheap price. And other countries who experienced similar water shortage would seek partnership seeing how Saudi enjoyed such cheap hydro.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could imagine the rich Arabians running at him while waving cash in their hands.</br>
</br>
"Also, what is the quality of the desalinated water? We won't feed our citizens water mixed with sand," Yerif asked another one of his concerns.</br>
</br>
Long term consumption of desalinated water was not beneficial to the health. If Future Group's desalinated water did not pass the quality test, Saudi's Royal Family would not withstand this. However, his concern was extraneous as the 22nd century PAC had a far stricter demands on quality than any country in this timeline.</br>
</br>
"Be assured, we'll finish the construction of the first desalination plant on Coro Island a month later. You can send a team to test our treated water. I can promise you one thing; our desalinated water is cleaner and healthier than any of the desalinated waters available.</br>
</br>
With how confident Jiang Chen was, Yerif was assured.</br>
</br>
He trusted Future Group's promise.</br>
</br>
"I will send people for a tour." Yerif paused for a moment as he hesitated. "Jiang Chen, we are friends right?"</br>
</br>
"Of course." Jiang Chen didn't know why he suddenly asked this.</br>
</br>
"Could you do me a favor?" Yerif whispered.</br>
</br>
"Of course. As long as I can help you," Jiang Chen said gladly.</br>
</br>
"For you it is not hard," Yerif coughed and lowered his voice, "I'll think of a way to stop the negotiation with Matrix and change it to an open bid. I hope you don't join our bid."</br>
</br>
"Don't bid?" Jiang Chen didn't understand why.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Yeriff nodded, "I will invite you to bid."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then instantly understood what he meant.</br>
</br>
Yerif was the Crown Prince, but there was more than one prince in Saudi and the old King loved to change THE Crown Prince. Therefore, a lot of people have their eyes on his position. While he was responsible for the cooperation between Matrix, another prince named Rashid initiated the talk.</br>
</br>
While the old King didn't say anything, he seemed to be pleased with Prince Rashid's performance.</br>
</br>
It made Yerif feel unsettled.</br>
</br>
"Haha, not a problem, Mr. Yerif, don't underestimate our friendship." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Thank you! You're my great brother!" Yerif said in joy and even used his broken Mandarin to say the last sentence.</br>
</br>
While his grammar required fixing, Jiang Chen grinned and chatted with him some more.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen, it was a small lfavor.</br>
</br>
If Yerif would not ascend to the crown, Future Group had nothing to lose. But if he did become the King, he would not forget Future Group's favor.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jean provided a complete desalination design to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Based on the actual conditions of Xin, Jiang Chen ultimately chose a mixed energy source desalination design. He assigned the unsophisticated parts to be manufactured by the factories in New Malaysia Special District, the more advance parts to be produced by the technology industrial park located on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
While the name of the park is technology industrial park, only Future Heavy Industries' factory is located there – the service robot assembling factory. A total of 400,000 "Xiao Lin" per month would step off the assembly line, be transported to port, and sold to the rest of the world.</br>
</br>
Currently, a new assembly line was added to the plant combined with the industrial 3D printer Jiang Chen brought back from the apocalypse to produce core desalination equipment parts.</br>
</br>
All the finished parts would be transported to the region east of Coro Island and assembled by the amphibious construction robots.</br>
</br>
Different from Penglai's construction project, the assembly was not disclosed to the public. Due to its small scale, it was not until the entire assembly was completed did the device float up and was hauled by a vessel to one hundred meters away from Coro Island's coast for docking…</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Noon. A sunny and cloudless sky.</br>
</br>
The leaves of the coconut trees swayed and cast its shadow. Washington Post's journalist Jim Calvin was resting relaxingly on the beach at the east coast of Coro Island, enjoying his rare vacation.</br>
</br>
The island was always filled with countless amount of news, and the people of Washington surprisingly were intrigued by the small island. Any reports put on the front page of the newspaper about Penglai would garner addition sales. Or rather, people purchased newspaper for the sake of seeing if Future Group created something new.</br>
</br>
When Jim finished writing a speculative piece of Penglai and sent to the headquarters, he also received an email stating his promotion. His manager wanted him to return to the headquarters to take on the role of chief editor. When Jim heard the news, he opened five bottles of champagne in joy.</br>
</br>
There was still five days left before he started in Washington again. He planned to use this time to relax and recharge.</br>
</br>
The tropical weather almost made people drowsy. Just as he was about to take nap in front of the steamy sea, shouting from the distance dispersed any of his weariness.</br>
</br>
"Jim, get up, there is something on the sea!" Just then, his girlfriend in bikini came running, put the shaved ice she just bought on the table, and woke him up by shaking on his arms.</br>
</br>
"What is it? Wait, are you sure you didn't just see a mirage?" While he didn't sound pleased, he still got up, and allowed his excited girlfriend to drag him onto the sandy hill not far away.</br>
</br>
His reporter instinct told him that something incredible just happened on the sea.</br>
</br>
</br>
The truth soon proved his speculation.</br>
</br>
They only ran halfway before a pitch black shadow surfaced on the sea.</br>
</br>
A metal floating island hauled by four vessels stopped at a distance not far away from the beach.</br>
</br>
Jim gradually slowed down. While still holding his girlfriend's hand, he stared at the sea blankly.</br>
</br>
Words of amazement of different languages flowed into his ears…</br>
</br>
"Dad, what is that?"</br>
</br>
"This is incredible! My phone, honey, where is my phone? I'm going to upload it on YouTube! Oh, sh*t, it is in my hand…"</br>
</br>
"I can bet you it must be Future Group again!"</br>
</br>
"No rush, dear, maybe we can purchase tickets and go sunbath up there. Remember to wear your new swimsuit…"</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the shouts from the crowd woke the dumbfounded Jim and his girlfriend up. The surface of the metal island began to expand, the airbags in the middle began to inflate, and the tubes located in the water started to submerge.</br>
</br>
"Jim, what is that?" Jenny holding onto her boyfriend's hand asked in disbelief.</br>
</br>
Just then, her boyfriend who always treated her nice forced his hand out of hers.</br>
</br>
"Phone… Dammit! Phone and camera are all in the bag! Wait for me here, Jenny, I will be back!"</br>
</br>
Looking at his girlfriend's shocked look, Jim shouted and dashed to the baggage storage…</br>
</br>
But Jim didn't end up filming the deployment of the giant.</br>
</br>
Under everyone's watch, the basketball court sized island expanded into the size of a football field.</br>
</br>
The rectangular design looked like the offshore rig used for oil and gas, the only difference was the unscientific size and the hundreds of graphene pipelines on its surface.</br>
</br>
Surrounding the metal island was stacks of floating pipelines. The pipelines directly extended into the bottom of the ocean and acted as the seawater collection unit for the desalination unit. They would crudely filter the collected seawater and sent the product through the graphene pipeline to the distillation equipment in the middle; the treated water would then be fed out through the outlet at the bottom of the platform.</br>
</br>
The left connection could be connected to power units for electricity and the equipment would only be operational once powered. The modular design meant that whether fire power or solar power, they could all be used to power the unit.</br>
</br>
The most critical aspect was the desalination equipment can be moved. If the current position was non-ideal or there was a typhoon warning, as long as the graphene cables connected to the bottom of the ocean floor were retracted, the major modules were taken apart, equipment could be hauled elsewhere for redeployment.</br>
</br>
Once the pipeline from land connected with the equipment, the "seawater desalination platform" could continuously feed the residents on ground fresh water.</br>
</br>
The desalination platform naturally would not be deployed in the tourism area. The reason it was deployed here was for an advertisement of the new equipment.</br>
</br>
"This is astonishing." On top of the Future Building, Yerif through binoculars gazed at the desalination platform and could not stop smiling.</br>
</br>
He originally planned to send his assistant, but because of the importance of this project, he personally made the trip to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
"We'll see a lot of similar comments on newspapers tomorrow." Beside him, Jiang Chen smiled. "So why don't we discuss something more interesting."</br>
</br>
"How much do you plan to sell that platform for?" Yerif's eyes were stuck in the binoculars as he said without turning his head.</br>
</br>
"We don't plan to sell." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Yerif finally moved his eyes off of the binoculars and looked at Jiang Chen, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Didn't we agree?" Jiang Chen smiled. "We'll provide you fresh water at a cost of 1 US dollar per ton."</br>
</br>
Compared with one and done type of deals, Jiang Chen liked long term business more. If Future Group controlled Saudi's hydro, they would not only gain financial benefits.</br>
</br>
Everyone depended on freshwater, especially people in the deserts.</br>
</br>
Once Future Group used the cheaper water to bankrupt other desalination plants, Future Group, with control of desalination plants, would control the lifeline of water shortage countries.</br>
</br>
By then, all the countries in the Gulf and along the coast of the Red Sea would depend on Future Group's water. By that time, they would hail Future Group as their king!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 665: Two Million Tons Order</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After an intense negotiation, Yerif finally reluctantly accepted Jiang Chen's proposal.</br>
</br>
The two went back into the building; Jiang Chen took him to his office. At the same time, Xia Shiyu placed the prepared agreement on Jiang Chen's table.</br>
</br>
No one was willing to have their drinking water be controlled by someone else, but they couldn't do anything about it since Future Group's price was too attractive!</br>
</br>
Saudi's currently desalinated water price was around 1.53 US dollar per ton and it was because of being a major oil producing country and hence a low fire power electricity price.</br>
</br>
Based on their agreement, Future Group would partner with Saudi Royal Family controlled Beach Seawater Desalination Company.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industrial's desalination platform would dock near the Red Sea coast while Saudi would complete the underwater pipelines. Jiang Chen would be responsible for opening the tap while Yerif would drag the tube over to connect the water and pay Jiang Chen 1 US dollar per cubic meter of water.</br>
</br>
In theory, with additional water collection modules around the platform and water desalination modules on the platform, a single platform could treatment four million tons of water per day!</br>
</br>
But the high water output naturally meant high energy consumption. But it was okay since Saudi's port was right beside the platform and the cost of fuel was low!</br>
</br>
Yerif promised Jiang Chen to transport cheap natural gas and fuel to the platform. Based on the 2 million ton of hydro supply per day, the price of every tonne of water could be compressed to 0.37 US dollar.</br>
</br>
The price was similar to underground treatment cost. The price was beyond belief.</br>
</br>
By then, the platform would provide Future Group an income of 1.2 million US dollar per day; 400 million US dollar per year.</br>
</br>
Saudi's Royal Family would save at least 600 million US dollar in cost related to subsidizing water. The originally intended new energy desalination plant built off the coast of Red Sea was canceled and resulted in a saving of construction investment of 1.5 billion US dollar.</br>
</br>
Yerif signed the contract in three days. With the contract, Yerif hopped on his plane in euphoria and eagerly returned to Saudi.</br>
</br>
He looked forward to his father's expression.</br>
</br>
While his younger brother brought Matrix and negotiated a 1.5 US dollar per cube of fresh water with a 1.5 billion US dollar construction fee, he silently brought back a contract of only 1 US dollar.</br>
</br>
He knew how much emphasis his father placed on the desalination project.</br>
</br>
[Haha, Rashid, my dear brother, just be your Arab Prince. The position of King should be given to someone with ability!]</br>
</br>
Regardless how ecstatic Yerif was on the plane, just as Jiang Chen stepped into the Future Building, the platform off of the east coast connected with CWW's pipeline and initiated its trial run.</br>
</br>
When the cheap water filled CWW's reservoir, CWW immediately executed Xin government's plan of reducing water prices.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on the original price, Xin's water price would be slashed in half.</br>
</br>
The news was spread through TV stations, newspapers, and the internet to all of Xin.</br>
</br>
"My God! Water prices have dropped!"</br>
</br>
"My family was considering buying some plastic barrels. With how high the price was, we were going to resort to purifying rainwater ourselves… Thank God, the price is finally going down!"</br>
</br>
"Did you see the platform? It said Future Heavy Industries!"</br>
</br>
"Praise Future Group, Praise Jiang Chen!"</br>
</br>
The entire country was in celebration for the reduction in hydro rate.</br>
</br>
Based on CWW's report, water consumption spiked by 35% on the day of and only returned to a reasonable level a week later.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Future Heavy Industries' desalination technology began to draw the attention of the world. It was not because of the cheap water or insane efficiency, but rather because of the futuristic deployment which left a deep impression on everyone.</br>
</br>
Someone captured the scene and uploaded it onto social media sites. On the first of uploading, the views broke the million mark!</br>
</br>
The netizens around the world was spamming in the comments, asking the person who uploaded the video which film it was from. Some of the netizens aware of the situation continuously clarified, "This is not a sci-fi film! It says 'Future Heavy Industrial' on there. Do you not know? Call your Xiao Lin over!"</br>
</br>
Washington Post first reported on the news, New York Time, Los Angles Time subsequently all cited it.</br>
</br>
Renowned journalist Jim Calvin who took part in a show with CBS used an exaggerative tone to describe what happened.</br>
</br>
"It was incredible. Have you seen Transformers? Of course, I'm not saying I saw Transformers, but the video that went viral! You absolutely could not imagine my expression then…"</br>
</br>
After a few days of celebration, Xin returned to peace.</br>
</br>
There was already good news from Saudi. Saudi's King was extremely pleased with the contract Yerif and Future Group signed and stated their welcoming attitude to the high tech corporation. Future Heavy Industrial started the production of the second desalination platform. The finished parts would be shipped to Saudi and stored at the port.</br>
</br>
All the parts were estimated to be completed by month-end. Future Group's construction boats will sail across the Gulf of Aden and enter the Red Sea region to complete the platform assembly. Compared with the one deployed off the east coast of Coro Island, the Saudi model had a higher production.</br>
</br>
To ensure production, Jiang Chen made a trip to the technology park on Ange Island to speak with Lin Zhengyang, the one responsible for Future Heavy Industrial's production.</br>
</br>
"This project is the marquee project for Future Heavy Industries in desalination. I need you to keep a close eye on the quality of every screw!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! Boss!" Lin Zhengyang responded in high spirit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patted him on the shoulder and signaled him to go back to his post.</br>
</br>
Just as he wanted to take a tour of the Xiao Lin production line, his phone began to ring.</br>
</br>
It was Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"What's up?" Jiang Chen picked up.</br>
</br>
"What the f*ck?"</br>
</br>
"'Blue Seagull' International Ocean Protection Committee released a statement on their site stating that our ocean exploration activity in the Pacific heavily disrupted the local ecosystem and sent a lawyer's letter to our group. They hope we can stop destroying the ocean habitat."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned.</br>
</br>
[Destroying the ocean habitat?]</br>
</br>
[What the fu*k?]</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"They're launching a class action suit against us in Xin?" Jiang Chen thought he heard wrong, so he repeated the question again.</br>
</br>
If they were suing him in Xin, he could think of a hundred ways Blue Seagull International Marine Life Protection Agency could lose. Suing him on his territory was asking for trouble.</br>
</br>
"They launched the class action suit on the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Of course, we can also refuse to respond, but this will impact our international reputation. They also wrote in their lawyers' letter that they reserve the right to organize protests. All in all, it's a headache to deal with this kind of non-profit organization…" Xia Shiyu's voice sounded defeated.</br>
</br>
"I'll head back right away. We'll talk soon." Jiang Chen hung up and headed out of the factory quickly.</br>
</br>
Unlike the International Court of Justice, not only can The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea accept cases between states, but it also accept cases between states and political entities and even individuals. However, such borderless tribunals often lacked binding power and are ignored by countries.</br>
</br>
Future Group had been brought to court by a lot of countries, but this was its first time in court with a non-profit organization.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen visited the official site of the International Marine Life Protection Agency on his phone. He first saw a giant poster at the top of the site. Underneath an image of the sea was a rotor of blades and a bloody dolphin along with a slogan on the bottom: Please stop hurting our friends!</br>
</br>
What made Jiang Chen exasperated was that all projects from the deployment of mining units to the construction of Penglai were equipped with sonar to remove any marine life. Their criticisms that lacked any factual basis were complete slander!</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the company, he immediately gunned for Xia Shiyu's office.</br>
</br>
"Actively respond to the lawsuit. Also, send our lawyers to sue them for slander in UA and demand compensation for economic damages!"</br>
</br>
"And investigate who's behind the slander. I want to see who's giving them directions!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't believe the slander was instigated by "Blue Seagull" just for the sake of environmental protection.</br>
</br>
Future Technology's subsidiary was located in Los Santos with a fairly friendly relationship with the State Justice System. As long as they managed their relations, it wouldn't be hard to win in court. He handed over the investigation to the Ghost Agents overseas.</br>
</br>
Surprisingly, before he sent anyone off on the mission, the people behind the scenes revealed themselves.</br>
</br>
A phone call came from B City, UA.</br>
</br>
"This is just a warning. Withdraw from the Saudi project." A male voice came from the other side.</br>
</br>
"A warning." Jiang Chen laughed, but his tone turned colder and he asked, "Are you from Matrix?"</br>
</br>
The man didn't deny nor agree. He just said, with a collected voice, "If it was any other business, you could use business strategies to win the project from us and we wouldn't say anything. But this project was conducted under directions from the Capital, so we won't just stop here."</br>
</br>
</br>
From his tone and choice of words, Jiang Chen detected arrogance and a curvature appeared on his mouth.</br>
</br>
[You expect Future Group to fold? In your dreams!]</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then I'm looking forward to your next move." Without feeling deterred, Jiang Chen didn't back down.</br>
</br>
"Arrogant."</br>
</br>
With just one word, the person on the other side hung up.</br>
</br>
The two sides were at an impasse; there was no need to negotiate further.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately ordered the Ghost Agents within UA's border to trace the phone call, and it was determined to be from a public phone booth in B City.</br>
</br>
When he obtained that information, he had to look through Matrix to determine the shareholders of the company. But since Matrix was a private company, it took some effort to acquire the information. It was Xie Lei who hacked Matrix's servers and obtained the information from an equity change agreement.</br>
</br>
All the evidence led to one name.</br>
</br>
The fifth largest consortium in UA – B City Consortium.</br>
</br>
Speaking of B City Consortium, it has a rich history. As one of the top ten consortia in UA, although it is less powerful than Morgan and Rockefeller, it is certainly the oldest one. It dates back to the 19th century when the Lovell, Lawrence, Adams, and Lodge families in the Boston area formed the B City Consortium with the emerging Kennedy family, possessing almost complete control of the entire North American textile industry. Their presence could be traced to the Civil War.</br>
</br>
Although their current influence has faded compared to before, its influence in UA can't be underestimated. The world famous Raytheon is one of its holdings. These large consorts that controlled UA are more or less inextricably linked to the interests of the Ministry of Defense.</br>
</br>
Since it is the B City Consortium that controlled Matrix, everything made sense. The Capital wanted to use the freshwater supply project to increase their control over Saudi. Since the dollar was tied to oil, the Capital still prioritized expanding their influence in the Middle East even when oil prices were so sluggish at the moment.</br>
</br>
And because of Future Group's intervention in the freshwater project, B City Consortium obviously wouldn't sit around with their business ruined.</br>
</br>
Just like they said, the class action suit from "Blue Seagull" was just a warning. B City Consortium would attack Future Group from multiple fields until Future Group could no longer withstand the losses and compromise on the not-so-profitable freshwater project.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wouldn't allow their desires to come true!</br>
</br>
Future Group would eventually be in a conflict of interest with the "ancient consortia." If he folded whenever there was a conflict, how could he do business in the future? Jiang Chen would not compromise, so he responded to B City Consortium's aggression with a firm stance.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Future Group had no subsidiary that was public, so B City Consortium's traditional financial attacks were futile against Future Group. However, they still managed to determine two attacking points, one was Future Group's most profitable tech business, and the other was marine life protection.</br>
</br>
On October 11th, the UA Department of Justice launched an anti-trust investigation against Future Group's subsidiary.</br>
</br>
At the same time, two "environmental advocates" forcefully boarded Future Mining's Pacific platform by boat, but they were quickly detained by Celestial Trade's security. UA's embassy in Xin immediately responded and demanded their release.</br>
</br>
B City Consortium started the fight with a hook and a straight punch to gain an advantage in the showdown, targeting Future Group's weaknesses.</br>
</br>
If UA's Department of Justice ultimately determined Future Technology was guilty in the anti-trust investigation, it would be a detrimental blow to the development of Future Technology's virtual reality market. It would set a precedent for other countries.</br>
</br>
Would Jiang Chen allow them to succeed?</br>
</br>
The answer was an obvious no!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 667"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 667: Retaliate</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Because of the importance of the class action suit, Jiang Chen gathered Future Technology's North American CEO and a lawyer from the legal team to conduct a virtual conference.</br>
</br>
At the very beginning, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"What's the probability of winning?"</br>
</br>
"Seventy percent! the UA's Justice Department lacks a factual claim. The precise definition of Phantom is 'high-end VR equipment.' Although it accounts for a large share of the UA market, it's far from enough to achieve a monopoly. Microsoft's HoloLens, Google Cardboard and other devices in the low-end market still occupy a significant market share. The key is that we don't use our advantages in the market to prevent other companies from entering the market," the lawyer replied with certainty.</br>
</br>
The law prohibited monopolies, meaning deliberately creating industry barriers to entry, monopolizing key resources, and eliminating competition. It was a procedural determination; the monopoly could result in market leadership, but market leadership didn't necessarily mean a monopoly.</br>
</br>
It was only a technological gap that prevented other firms from entering the market - Future Group hadn't used their strengths to thwart completion. Therefore, the UA Department of Justice's claim was far-fetched. Future Group's possibility of winning was high!</br>
</br>
The lawyer nodded and Jiang Chen then looked at Hermit.</br>
</br>
"Hermit, you're the CEO of the North American division. I have only one thing to tell you - prepare to cause a controversy. Seventy percent of UA citizens' smartphones have Future 1.0 installed. It's not only a gold mine but also our weapon! I need you to create an atmosphere where the UA Department of Justice prevents technological innovation out of protectionism and potentially accepts a bribe to launch an anti-trust investigation against Future Group."</br>
</br>
While pressure from public opinion wouldn't be enough to force its hand, it would be enough to make them pay a heavy price. The Department of Justice existed to serve the Capital. If Ms. Hill wanted to continue running the office, she had to remain cautious about this matter.</br>
</br>
"It's okay without evidence. We can use the army of the internet and a conspiracy theory!" Jiang Chen added.</br>
</br>
"I understand!" Hermit nodded.</br>
</br>
After he finished up, Jiang Chen rushed to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
On the island, he met with the two people detained for trespassing on the mining platform. Because of pressure from the UA Embassy, Celestial Trade didn't send the two of them to prison and instead brought them to the military base.</br>
</br>
They were a male and a female. The female looked young, like a university student. The male was older, around 30 years in age. His defined face was paired with glasses and a beard.</br>
</br>
Inside a dark room, they were looking at the soldiers with rifles outside. The male looked calm and seemed to be experienced with detainment, but the female looked inexperienced as she was shivering in a corner.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Katie, stay calm. They can't do anything to us. We're UA citizens. Just for the sake of saving her own face, Hill will get us out." Barney comforted his companion.</br>
</br>
"But they have guns…" Katie said, frightened.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry Miss Katie, we're not New Guinean cannibals. Just as the gentleman said, we won't do anything to you."</br>
</br>
A voice suddenly came from the door. The two people inside the darkroom immediately looked in that direction. The soldier in the hallway saluted and stepped aside. Barney recognized the person and immediately narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen! He came here personally.</br>
</br>
"We're the advocates of Blue Seagull! You heartless businessmen - you don't have the right to interfere with our just cause! I demand you let us go, or else…"</br>
</br>
"Or else our treatment of you will be made into a documentary and released on YouTube to tarnish our name?" Jiang Chen grinned. "Or else you plan to launch a massive protest and sue us for the falsified crime we didn't commit?"</br>
</br>
"They aren't falsified crimes! Your actions forced poor dolphins to leave their homes. It was all because of your irresponsible actions. Do you know what your actions will do to the ecosystem?!" Katie worked up her courage and berated Jiang Chen while staring him down.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Regardless if we committed a crime or not, you're not the police. And just seven hours ago, you trespassed on Future Mining's mining platform and disrupted our production. We're currently considering suing you for the crime of piracy! If the prosecution stands, you'll be facing a prison term between 10 to 15 years. I'm really curious - when you left the airport, didn't they remind you to follow the laws of the local government?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"You-you can't do that!" A hint of fear surfaced on Barney's face.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't look like he was willing to compromise with the embassy. This wasn't what Barney expected.</br>
</br>
And his companion, Miss Katie, was completely shocked. While she was a self-proclaimed activist, she never imagined sacrificing herself for the cause. When she heard she was facing ten years of prison time, tears burst out.</br>
</br>
"Of course we can do that." Jiang Chen said, emotionless. "You have the right to hire a lawyer to defend yourselves, but I guarantee you'l; lose."</br>
</br>
"Please don't do this! I'm still in college. I'll be expelled…" Katie grasped the bars at the window while crying in desperation.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't look at her but focused instead on Barney, who had a pale face.</br>
</br>
"But this doesn't have to be the way it ends."</br>
</br>
"What do you want me to do?" Barney glanced at Katie sobbing and spoke with difficulty.</br>
</br>
"Cooperate with us and restore our reputational damage," Jiang Chen snapped before two contracts appeared.</br>
</br>
Looking at the contracts on the table, Barney gulped and picked up one of the copies.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"You are Barney Baird, an internationally renowned photographer, chief editor of a humanities and social science magazine, and one of the key members of Blue Seagull. I heard you're great with photography? We'll provide the equipment here; just help me shoot a documentary. The name will be called 'A Lie'," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible!" Barney cried out emotionally.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him without emotion and said with an unnegotiable tone:</br>
</br>
"You only have two choices in front of you. Rot in prison or sign this document."</br>
</br>
Barney's face had no sign of life.</br>
</br>
"Barney, I beg you…" The pleading of his friend rang in his ears.</br>
</br>
"I just want to prove my innocence." Jiang Chen's expression didn't change.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Barney finally couldn't withstand the pressure and picked up the pen with shaking hands.</br>
</br>
When he signed his name, he collapsed onto the chair as if all his energy was drained away.</br>
</br>
As an executive in Blue Seagull, he was aware of the reason behind this defamatory campaign against Future Group. Although he didn't know who was behind it, he knew the individual behind it wasn't simple based on the unbelievable amount they were paid.</br>
</br>
That was why he was unwilling to sign.</br>
</br>
Doing all this for Mother Earth? Don't kid yourself! He knew better than anyone. From the beginning of the Penglai project, he closely monitored its impact on marine life! Just as Jiang Chen said, Future Group's sonar already removed the marine life outside of the construction radius. He even argued with the head of the organization over this.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen said, he didn't have much choice.</br>
</br>
"… If I sign, will you ensure my safety?"</br>
</br>
"Of course, but you probably won't be able to return to UA in the immediate future. Trust me, this is for your benefit." Jiang Chen collected the contracts, signaled the soldier to unlock the door, and smiled at him. "Our people will take you to a five-star hotel. Don't worry about the cost - I'll foot the bill."</br>
</br>
"Remember, you were never detained, not even for a minute!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 668: The Work of a Hacker</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just as the UA Department of Justice officially launched a court case against the State Court and sued Future Technology's UA subsidiary, Future Group sent a team of lawyers to the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea to actively respond to Blue Seagull's lawsuit.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Future Group hired a legal team to officially sue Blue Seagull's headquarters for slander because of the information published on its official site. It caused "detrimental damage" to Future Group's international reputation and Future Group demanded reparations of 1.7 million USD as well as immediately deleting the defamatory comments against Future Group.</br>
</br>
With the support of the B City Consortium, Blue Seagull definitely wouldn't stop and expressed that it was bizarre for Future Group to sue a non-profit organization. They also emphasized their stance on their official site on remaining firm against the capitalists! They also stated that Future Group had detained "peacefully protesting" members and demanded their immediate release.</br>
</br>
The UA Embassy also contacted Celestial Trade, but events took a different turn.</br>
</br>
When the UA Ambassador to Xin, Marchi Bocas, came to see Celestial Trade's CEO, Ivan, he was surprised to discover that the Blue Seagulls members hadn't received unjust treatment from Future Group but instead, had been welcomed by Jiang Chen?</br>
</br>
They appeared in front of the media and Barney accepted an interview from a reporter.</br>
</br>
"The rumors of being treated unfairly by Future Group were untrue. When Jiang Chen learned of Katie and my intentions, he personally met us and highly praised our efforts in protecting marine life…"</br>
</br>
Barney's mouth twitched and he hesitated.</br>
</br>
But since he was already standing on the opposing side of the B City Consortium and as he realized he couldn't afford to breach the contract signed with Jiang Chen, he took a breath and spoke into the mic in front of him.</br>
</br>
"With his assistance, I completed filming for our documentary… And the name of the documentary is called 'A Lie'."</br>
</br>
The crowd began to cause a commotion and the reporters, sensing major news, all bombarded Barney with a load of questions.</br>
</br>
Barney didn't respond to any questions.</br>
</br>
As per the agreement with Jiang Chen, he maintained an expression that showed he was lied to, and he criticized Blue Seagull for accepting bribes and slandering Future Group under Matrix's directions without any evidence. He claimed he was dragged into this disgusting business without being aware.</br>
</br>
The crowd became rattled.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Barney, is what you're saying true? Do you have evidence supporting your claim?"</br>
</br>
"What are the exact details? Please tell us! All the environmental advocates around the world will stand by your side!"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Barney, I want to ask if you've been threatened to say what you just said?"</br>
</br>
Barney raised his hand and held out three fingers in the face of the flood of questions from the media.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I can swear on my dignity that what I said is 100% true! No one threatened me. As you see, I'm safe. As for the evidence, it's all in the documentary and uploaded onto YouTube!"</br>
</br>
In the documentary named A Lie, the first thirty minutes documented the state of the ecosystem under Future Group's Penglai, Mining Platform, Desalination Platform, and the second half revealed the bribes between the Blue Seagull organization and Matrix, aiming directly at the Saudi freshwater project.</br>
</br>
The documentary led viewers from suspense to reflection to revealing the truth in front of the public.</br>
</br>
With promotion from Future Group, Barney's documentary caused a mass commotion on the web.</br>
</br>
Blue Seagull's president, Brent Lancy, had accepted a bribe of $2 million. Since he couldn't stand the pressure of public opinion, he was forced to resign. Matrix immediately came out with a press release. However, in the face of public opinion that already formed a perfect storm, their so-called clarification was insignificant.</br>
</br>
It could be foreseen that negative public opinion would cause a critical blow to Blue Seagull's reputation. Once a non-profit organization lost its credibility, it would completely lose its lifeline.</br>
</br>
Blue Seagull and Matrix were all just pawns; Jiang Chen knew the real opponent of Future Group was B City Consortium.</br>
</br>
After taking care of the two pawns, it was time for the real fight.</br>
</br>
While the media was criticizing Matrix, Xie Lei, in Europe, used the quantum computer on Coro Island to successful hack onto the server of First B City Bank.</br>
</br>
Their information security measures were praiseworthy, but with the deadly combination of a hacker and the quantum computer, there were no secrets in the digitalized era.</br>
</br>
Hundreds of thousands of client information were copied. Under Jiang Chen's directions, Xie Lei anonymously posted the information on social media sites in Iceland.</br>
</br>
This move caused an earthquake in the financial sector.</br>
</br>
First B City Bank's market cap took a dive by 8% that day and barely managed to stop the freefall with the efforts of B City Consortium. The release of client information was a massive scandal for any bank. Clients who had their privacy violated immediately jumped to action.</br>
</br>
Clients swarmed to the ATMs and desperately tried to cash out. Once a bank run started, even the most powerful banks couldn't stop the storm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted something more. He wanted to reduce all the saving accounts to a balance of zero. But unfortunately, Xie Lei helplessly told him that it wasn't within a hacker's capabilities.</br>
</br>
Only God had the power to do that.</br>
</br>
The hack was a direct blow to B City Consortium. Even as the consortium with the longest history, a direct hit to their core assets would hurt.</br>
</br>
After the event, analysts estimated that the information leak caused a direct loss of 3.7 billion USD to the B City Consortium with an indirect loss totaling 11.7 billion USD! A good brand would need one hundred years to develop, but it would only take a few days to completely ruin a brand.</br>
</br>
The leak even alerted the FBA. When they traced the attack to a foreign source, CIB entered the investigation as well.</br>
</br>
It scared Xie Lei to death.</br>
</br>
Although he received a few months' of military training, he would definitely lose to professional agents.</br>
</br>
But he wasn't too afraid that CIB would be able to track him down.</br>
</br>
With assistance from the quantum computer, he wiped his tracks. All IPs led to an internet café in Morocco at the edge of the Sahara desert. He didn't need to worry about being in the far Ber.</br>
</br>
While B City Consortium suspected the leak had something to do with Jiang Chen since he was in the tech business, they couldn't do anything about it without evidence.</br>
</br>
Just as B City Consortium was busy trying to put out the fire, Future Technology released an announcement.</br>
</br>
To better assist the Department of Justice's collection of evidence for its anti-trust investigation, Future Technology would temporarily suspend its service coverage to the 110 million users in UA. Future Technology continued to reiterate that they would actively cooperate with the Department of Justice's investigation and looked forward to the completion of the investigation so the subsidiary could return to normal service.</br>
</br>
WTF!?</br>
</br>
On the day of the announcement, the North American subsidiary CEO, Hermit, gave all employees a paid vacation and even took the executives on a paid vacation to Hawaii.</br>
</br>
But the UA netizens who saw the notice were completely shocked.</br>
</br>
Anti-trust investigation? Suspending service?</br>
</br>
WTF!?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 669: Suspending Service?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Under the user agreement, the Phantom helmet sold by Future Technology and the associated services such as Godly Land and virtual reality community were all online content provided by quantum computer servers.</br>
</br>
If Future Technology stopped providing virtual reality service, then the entire virtual reality network would be halted. Everyone who logged onto the Phantom would be staring at a white cube while faced with unusable applications.</br>
</br>
They couldn't even surf the web!</br>
</br>
If somebody wanted to restore the virtual reality network, they would have to get a quantum computer first!</br>
</br>
With a company like Future Technology that produced both the hardware and content, it was scary when the company decided to act ruthlessly. You're researching my equipment? Then I'll stop providing the content as well! It'll be available as soon as you're done the investigation.</br>
</br>
If Phantom could only be used to play games, Jiang Chen wouldn't dare to pull the plug. If it was just a console, it wouldn't be a big deal to live without it and wouldn't influence the country at all, but after a year of development, Phantom's functionality was no longer just a "console."</br>
</br>
Perhaps one year ago it was, but it definitely wasn't now.</br>
</br>
When the virtual community functionality was introduced half a year ago, the immersive virtual reality technology began to expand into people's social networks, personal lives, and even work. A lot of private enterprises used the chatroom function as a tool for remote conferences. A lot of educational institutions even used the virtual community as a tool for remote education…</br>
</br>
Just in a year, people were already accustomed to living with virtual life. People reserved their waking hours for their family and real-life friends and shifted their internet-surfing time to after they slept to connect their dreams with the virtual world. Once they woke up from their REM sleep the next morning, they would be ready to tackle the day again…</br>
</br>
Now that Future Technology announced the temporary suspension of the virtual reality service, it meant all people's previously-established habits would be broken.</br>
</br>
With the release of the news, UA netizens immediately became rattled.</br>
</br>
Without virtual reality, some people even developed amnesia - they felt something was missing during their sleep. Before, they could sleep with the press of a button. Now, they had to resort to old-fashioned methods of manually falling asleep on their beds. Some people who really couldn't sleep had to put on the helmet, press the button, and stare blankly at the white cube out of desperation.</br>
</br>
Life without virtual reality was torture!</br>
</br>
And the Department of Justice who launched the anti-trust investigation immediately became the public's target.</br>
</br>
"Fu*k the politics behind this!"</br>
</br>
"Get rid of protectionism, screw the capitalists! Give us virtual reality back!"</br>
</br>
"There's definitely some shady businesses behind this. Let me guess how much was paid to the Capital."</br>
</br>
</br>
The Capital desperately tried to explain to the public that the anti-trust investigation against Future Technology was within reason. However, Future Group's lawyer stated that an anti-trust investigation against a company formed less than two years ago with a product less than a year old was unprecedented.</br>
</br>
The legal representative Brown Kerning, responsible for the defense against the Department of Justice, sent out a tweet and mocked his opponent.</br>
</br>
"This is probably the most interesting case I've worked on in over ten years of working. My defendant didn't even manage to digest the market share, yet they're suspected of preventing other companies from entering the market?"</br>
</br>
The tweet led to tens of thousands of retweets and even led to heated debates on talk shows.</br>
</br>
Obviously, the UA public wasn't buying the anti-trust investigation.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the Department of Justice was withstanding a great amount of pressure to collect evidence and prepare for the prosecution.</br>
</br>
But before events developed further, with intentional guidance from Future Technology, disability organizations, Black rights activists, obesity patients and all kinds of people went on a massive protest.</br>
</br>
"Using Phantom, it was the first time I saw color in this world. Although I know it was fake, it couldn't feel more real to me. It was the first time I saw my wife. Although she wasn't as beautiful as I imagined, I still love her… Now with Phantom, I can only stare at a blank wall. Future Technology opened the window and also closed the window for their interests," a blind individual protested in front of the camera.</br>
</br>
"There's no racism in the virtual world. I can change myself at my own whim, but you took away my ability to do that, so I'm here protesting against you," an equality rights activist said.</br>
</br>
"Give virtual reality back to us! At least in the virtual world, no one cares about my weight nor does anyone call me fat behind my back! No one mocks me and says: 'Hey, Cook, have you been on a plane before? How many tickets did you need to buy?' This isn't funny!" A 400-pound, obese individual yelled in front of the Capital.</br>
</br>
In a country where political correctness was above all else, if a disabled person criticized the president, the president not only had to apologize, but even the media would continue the criticism. Some people even jokingly said that a lesbian, colored person had a higher chance of being hired because once rejected, the company would be suspected of discrimination.</br>
</br>
But needless to say, most people bought into it. Although it was far-fetched to unite virtual reality and discrimination, Future Group did an excellent job of driving public opinion.</br>
</br>
Political correctness took politics as hostage.</br>
</br>
With the one-sided public opinion, the Department of Justice had to withstand pressure from the Capital.</br>
</br>
Therefore, the Minister at the Department of Justice, Lincoln, had to put his differences aside and spoke with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The investigation is a separate thing. Can you resume service?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said with a serious face, "No! We're actively cooperating with your country's political system. Before the anti-trust issue is cleared from our name, we won't do anything that could tamper with the law!"</br>
</br>
The poor minister was about to cry as he explained: "The anti-trust investigation doesn't mean you can't operate; you just need to temporarily suspend the sales of Phantom in UA!"</br>
</br>
"No! Our virtual reality network is part of the technological services provided by Future Technology. To avoid interfering with the evidence-gathering process, we're willing to suspend our service to abide by the rules of the law!"</br>
</br>
Lincoln said with irritation, "What kind of logic is this? Who demanded you to do this?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said with a stern voice, "Don't be like this, Mr. Minster. We are a company and suspending service means we're losing profits. We feel more urgency than you for this incident to be resolved! We'll wait for the decision and I hope you can patiently wait for us to resume our service.</br>
</br>
Lincoln was dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
It was like the sun had risen in the west; since when did corporations ask government agencies to wait patiently? Weren't they supposed to be the ones who said that?</br>
</br>
As soon as Jiang Chen hung up, he couldn't hold his laughter in and burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"You're laughing? Now that Phantom sales have completely halted in UA, what are you going to do?" Xia Shiyu rolled her eyes at the hysterical Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry. It won't be long before sales explode." Jiang Chen made an explosion gesture and smiled at her. "The suspension of virtual reality service doesn't only put pressure on the Capital - it also serves as an advertisement for our product."</br>
</br>
"The cost is quite high."</br>
</br>
"What can you do? Sucks for us to fight B City Consortium."</br>
</br>
"I'm worried that if the Capital can withstand the pressure of the controversy and continue the anti-trust investigation to the end, we'll be the ones losing since they're a government agency and we're a for-profit company," Xia Shiyu hesitantly said.</br>
</br>
"That's impossible because B City Consortium can't withstand this anymore. They're the root of the anti-trust investigation. As long as they accept defeat, the Department of Justice won't persist," Jiang Chen said without hesitation</br>
</br>
He smiled and continued.</br>
</br>
"And the most critical thing is that our product is irreplaceable."</br>
</br>
Even if they temporarily lost some revenue, no one would be able to replace Future Technology.</br>
</br>
That was the trump card Jiang Chen was depending on!</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 670: Compromise?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
B City Consortium couldn't last much longer.</br>
</br>
It wasn't because they had no money. On the contrary, they were very rich and possessed wealth unimaginable by most people. Since the 1950s, they used scientific research from MIT to develop technology in emerging industries and transitioned from the textile industry to the fields of electronics, optics, radars, missiles and even aerospace. If their actual wealth was calculated, even Bill Gates' wealth tenfold would be no match. After all, Bill Gates was only one person and these consortia were controlled by more than one family.</br>
</br>
For this monstrous economic giant, the banking system wasn't their source of hematopoietic stem cells so to speak, but rather, it was their more important heart! If there were any problems with the heart, the massive financial and industrial system would face a risk to cash flow.</br>
</br>
When signs of a bank run appeared, the attack from B City Consortium immediately halted without any further moves. The anti-trust investigation had hurt Future Group indeed, but it didn't hurt as much as the hit to First B City Bank.</br>
</br>
The two opposing sides were like boxers in a ring. They knew they couldn't knock out their opponent with just one strike, so they had to balance the pros and cons for deciding if they should take the next swing.</br>
</br>
In a manor in the B City's rural area.</br>
</br>
The people inside the house controlled one-tenth of UA's power. The Lowell, Lawrence, Adams, Kennedy, and Lodge families were all gathered there. Among them were big capitalists, Federal Reserve shareholders, Democrat Senators...</br>
</br>
They had gathered together to protect their common interests.</br>
</br>
"This is infuriating! I can bet that the leak is their work!" John Lowell smashed his fist on the table while gritting his teeth.</br>
</br>
"I think so too, but we don't have any evidence. FBA has no leads either," Robert Adams said.</br>
</br>
"How did they do it? The information security system for First B City Bank was the work of Websense. If their hackers could infiltrate our system, then there's no reason they can't hack into the Capital." Mr. Lowell furrowed his brows.</br>
</br>
Since Raytheon invested $1.9 billion into Websense, B City Consortium's subsidiaries had been protected by this cyber-security company. Since the business involved the military industry, consortia servers suffered a lot of attacks every year, but no attack had ever been successful.</br>
</br>
"I'll notify the Capital," Adams said.</br>
</br>
"That's enough, my friends. We shouldn't be worried about the Capital right now. We should be worried about Future Group!" Lowell said with a headache.</br>
</br>
"We can't compromise on the Saudi freshwater project," Joseph Kennedy stated.</br>
</br>
"But our textile plant in Lone Star State requires cash. Raytheon's radar project in the Pacific and the helicopter deal with the Capital also needs funding." Lowell glanced at Joseph. "Although I know the water project is important to you, by the looks of it now… If we continue to wage a war against Future Group, the losses we'll suffer will be insufferable even if ultimately win."</br>
</br>
</br>
"I agree with Mr. Lowell's perspective." Robert Adams nodded.</br>
</br>
"I can't accept this." John Laurence shook his head. "If we compromise, where's our dignity?"</br>
</br>
"That's enough, Mr. Laurence. We are businessmen and it's just profits and losses after all. If you really can't accept this defeat, we can take care of them later. But right now, we should take it easy. At least in terms of information security, we must enhance our security!" Loki, who hadn't spoken this whole time, finally spoke up.</br>
</br>
"Let's follow tradition and decide by vote. To protect our eternal alliance, regardless of the choice we make, I'll contribute my efforts to the alliance even if it's a choice I'm unwilling to accept. Now… for those of you who agree to settle, please raise your hand." Laurence looked at the four people around the table and raised his hand.</br>
</br>
The vote was three to two.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Settlement accepted.</br>
</br>
"Who will contact them?" Although the decision of the consortium didn't fit with the interests of his family, John Kennedy didn't look too displeased.</br>
</br>
"I'll go." Loki looked around the table and said, "I'm the majority shareholder of First B City Bank, so it's best for me to go."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
While the consortia that controlled the vein of UA's economy had a fairly friendly relationship with each other, "friendship" didn't seem to apply in the business field. It was common for one's tragedy to turn into capitalization by others.</br>
</br>
When B City Bank was in the middle of their scandal, all major banks announced an upgrade in their security systems to ensure the privacy of each client. While their actions didn't look too great, the consortia couldn't do much more. Therefore, on the third day after cyber-security became the focus of discussion, the Federal Reserve stepped in.</br>
</br>
Based on the latest information from the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve injected 100 billion into First B City Bank to increase client confidence. At the same time, First B City Bank announced an upgrade to its security system and promised that a leak would never occur to recover some of their losses.</br>
</br>
Just as the Wall Street investors had trouble digesting the two major headlines: "First B City Bank client information leak" and "Future Technology's potential exit from UA," Jiang Chen, in the far west Pacific, seemed calm.</br>
</br>
Standing next to the launch site, Jiang Chen looked at the rocket launch taking off. As he watched the trail of smoke dissipating, a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
Now the total number of quantum communication satellites was twelve.</br>
</br>
"You still have time to enjoy the fireworks?" Natasha mocked him.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Looks like even Russia knows about our small conflict with B City Consortium." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Of course. You made the short list of top suspects for the CIB. They think it's you who hacked into First B City Bank and that your real identity should be an IT engineer who mastered information security."</br>
</br>
"That's a fascinating hypothesis, but unfortunately, I only barely passed the computer competency test." Jiang Chen laughed and dodged Natasha's question. "Let's not talk about this. What you think about our rocket launching technology?"</br>
</br>
Natasha's appearance at Celestial Trade's launch site wasn't out of personal reasons. Celestial Trade's rocket launch technology was already mature. To utilize its excessive launch capacity, Jiang Chen set his sights on Russia.</br>
</br>
Because of the reduced total budget and fluctuations in exchange rates, Russia was forced to reduce the International Space Station's maintenance costs by 30 billion Rupees. Since Russia was concerned with the high maintenance costs, Celestial Trade happened to have a solution.</br>
</br>
Not only could they make some changes to turn Celestial Trade's red bottom line around, but this could also be an opportunity to gain experience in supply transport to space stations.</br>
</br>
Why not?</br>
</br>
But Natasha's response surprised Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"If you're willing to sell the rocket engines, we can discuss. If you want to talk about contracting… my response might disappoint you." Natasha sighed and spread open her hands. "We won't contract this project out to foreign companies. There's no room for negotiation."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 671"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 671: Russia“s Interes</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The supplying mission to the International Space Station was both the international duty of the major aerospace powers and the perfect opportunity to develop the aerospace industry. Domestic aerospace companies could only develop new engines if they gained profit from the billion Rupee project.</br>
</br>
Contracting to Celestial Trade indeed could decrease the budget in this area, but it would be bad news for domestic aerospace companies. Since there were only so many launch planned for each year, other than SpaceX being able to profit from commercial launches, most aerospace depended on the national projects to survive.</br>
</br>
What Natasha said was also the message from Russia's leader.</br>
</br>
If Celestial Trade was willing to sell the rocket, Russia would be happy to purchase. But if Celestial Trade was only planning to take the contract, there was no point to discuss it further.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to hear my bid?" Jiang Chen said helplessly.</br>
</br>
Natasha shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Kremlin won't give it the okay, even if your price is tempting."</br>
</br>
It was hard.</br>
</br>
But Natasha' words were certainly not without reason. From a pure cost saving perspective, why wouldn't Russia just contract the project out to SpaceX? Falcon with the capability to reuse the first stage rocket could reduce the cost of missions to a terrifyingly small number.</br>
</br>
Even if this seemed to be without possibility, Jiang Chen was not the type to give up easily.</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, he said.</br>
</br>
"Do you really not want to discuss the price? I'm referring to the RM-320 rocket engine."</br>
</br>
"I said this… Wait, what did you say?!" Natasha suddenly froze. She stared at him in shock.</br>
</br>
Natasha soon hid away the shock on her face and looked him calmly and quickly articulated.</br>
</br>
"what do you want?"</br>
</br>
Based on the paper provided by Celestial Trade and the observation by Russia experts, RM-320 rocket engine's capability far exceeded Russia's most proud RD-180, even SpaceX's Merlin 1D engine could not fare against it.</br>
</br>
Combustion chamber that can withstand 500 atmospheres of pressure, a 1: 300 thrust to push ratio, and the cost of production only one-half of the Russian RD-180!</br>
</br>
Natasha didn't think Jiang Chen would agree to sell the engine, so she didn't even bother mentioning it.</br>
</br>
Joy came so unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes scanned across Natasha's face as he used a playful tone, "Take a guess?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the undisguised sight, Natasha turned, blushing. However, she quickly noticed the mockery inside his eyes and she responded by giving him a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"I don't know."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put up five fingers.</br>
</br>
"Five years of time. Over the five years, Russia's International Space Station supplying project will be contracted to Celestial Trade. Five years later, we'll sell RM-320 rocket engine's prototype and blueprints at market price to Russia."</br>
</br>
</br>
Five years of contract work in exchange for an outdated technology was too great of a value.</br>
</br>
As to why it is "outdated"? Because once space elevators are created, any rocket launching technology would become obsolete.</br>
</br>
Because of the existence of space elevator, the launch cost in the millions would be squeezed to a few hundred. This was the reason why launch vehicle technology was completely halted by the end of the 21st century.</br>
</br>
"… I can't give you a reply, I have to speak with my superior," Natasha said with difficulty.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen signaled her to go ahead.</br>
</br>
Natasha nodded, walked to the side, and called the KGB headquarter in the far away Moscow.</br>
</br>
The phone call lasted for a long time. Then her expression took a sudden turn as she walked beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Our superior hopes to speak with you."</br>
</br>
She passed the phone over and took two steps back.</br>
</br>
With the phone by his ear, before Jiang Chen spoke, he heard someone speak English with a heavy Russian accent.</br>
</br>
"At most three year."</br>
</br>
The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn't recall it.</br>
</br>
"Three years is too short."</br>
</br>
"We have to consider the evolution of technology."</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about that. Even if it is after eight years, RM-320 engine will remain the leader in the market," Jiang Chen said with certainty.</br>
</br>
The phone was silent for two seconds.</br>
</br>
"Three years. Three years you'll sell RM-320 rocket engine's technology to us. We'll contract you the supply mission at 40 billion Rupees for eight years."</br>
</br>
"Deal!" Jiang Chen agreed without any hesitation.</br>
</br>
Although his expression didn't change at all, he was laughing hard in his mind. It equated to a contract of 600 million USD a year. At most it will take him two years to create the space elevator. By then, the cost for a supply mission will be less than a million!</br>
</br>
It would be Rupee, not dollar.</br>
</br>
"Looks like we are in agreement." The voice on the other side seemed more relaxed when he heard Jiang Chen's confirmation without realizing he just got scammed.</br>
</br>
"I feel your voice is familiar. Before you hang up, could I ask who you are?" Jiang Chen asked joyously.</br>
</br>
"Our Miss Agent didn't tell you?"</br>
</br>
"She just said you were her superior." Jiang Chen suddenly realized something.</br>
</br>
Wait, Natasha used "we" and not "my".</br>
</br>
There was a short silence before a lighthearted response came from the other side.</br>
</br>
"You can call me Putin. If there is an opportunity, I welcome you to Moscow…"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen blanked out while still holding the phone.</br>
</br>
[Wait, I was doing business with Russia's President?!]</br>
</br>
[And I just scammed him?!]</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
With the successful launch of the 12th quantum satellite, Celestial Trade announced paid Wi-Fi coverage to Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Malaysia, and Moro. Based on the cooperation with the local telecommunication providers, any of the users who paid for the service could receive 12 hours of WI-FI trial time. After the expiry of the trial time, user could select different speed plans based on their geography.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade was currently engaged in discussion with UA, Canada, and France providers regarding a potential partnership with the plan to push Wi-Fi coverage globally.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the fight between Future Group and B City Consortium still persisted. But neither parties made a new move and they remained in a stalemate. The Department of Justice was still gathering evidence in anti-trust investigation while B City Consortium was busy putting out the fire at the bank.</br>
</br>
Problematically, Websense's response for the cyber security breach of First B City Bank was fully upgrading its firewall and specifically focusing on defence against hacker infiltration.</br>
</br>
Based on what Xie Lei said, the upgraded system was like an impenetrable barrel with all the previous holes filled in. Unless they could use an internal computer as a back door, even with the quantum computer's attack power, it would be nearly impossible to infiltrate remotely.</br>
</br>
The programmers they hired were not there to sit around.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Jean collected news regarding both companies and presented them to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The Federal Reserve injected 100 billion USD to First B City Bank. The Capital hosted a cyber security summit with top tech security firms. The area of financial security was the focus of the summit."</br>
</br>
"The Federal Reserve made a move. It looks like First B City Bank is now stabilized." Jiang Chen furrowed his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
Just as he was thinking about the next step, Xia Shiyu's called him.</br>
</br>
"Hello?"</br>
</br>
"Someone wants to see you in person."</br>
</br>
"Who is it?"</br>
</br>
"Carson Loki, the majority shareholder of First B City Bank."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't give Natasha a clear response in regards to the Russian president's invitation; he only stated that when the time was right, he would make a trip to Moscow. Restricted by Russia's economic situation, Future Group's development in Russia was limited. The sales of Phantom were incomparable to the popularity in Asia and North America.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen received a call from Xia Shiyu, he headed to the company.</br>
</br>
It was a representative from B City Consortium that has asked for a meeting, and his identity was not be underestimated.</br>
</br>
The two determined from their discussion that there was a high chance that the intention of the trip was to settle the feud.</br>
</br>
In the battle against Future Group, they were no longer willing to remain in a stalemate. They lost over 10 billion over a 1.5 billion dollar project.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen's side also suffered heavy losses. The most profitable Future Technology showing red on the bottom line was already a worrisome sign.</br>
</br>
But if this war persisted, B City Consortium would be the eventual loser. Even if the Federal Reserve assisted them, even if they upgraded their cybersecurity; Jiang Chen with the backup of the quantum computer would penetrate the wall eventually.</br>
</br>
The next morning, beside a Gulfstream G650 landed in Coro Island Airport and Jiang Chen met with Carson Loki, the majority shareholder of Frist B City Bank. Different from the other renowned financial tycoons, Jiang Chen never heard of his name before nor did he know anything about the Loki family.</br>
</br>
While they are one of the members that controlled the B City Consortium, their recognition was far less than the "cursed" Kennedy family or the Adams family that participated in the Declaration of Independence, but the mysterious Loki family still possessed a tremendous amount of power.</br>
</br>
He was not only the majority shareholder of the bank, but he was also one of the secret shareholders of the Federal Reserve. The Ghost Agent in UA had to do some work in order to gather this information.</br>
</br>
The kind-looking elder in a blue suit was far more powerful than he appeared.</br>
</br>
"It's nice to finally meet you in person. Mr. Jiang Chen looks much younger in person." Carson Loki walked forward and shook Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
Just from the smile on his face, it was impossible to imagine they were in amidst a bloody financial war.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Loki is flattering me."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was fathoming the purpose behind his personal visit while chatting with him in a lighthearted mood.</br>
</br>
Because Carson Loki was staying in the presidential suite in Sheraton inside the Heart of the Sea, Sheraton's limousine already arrived at the airport. When Mr. Loki arrived at the hotel, Jiang Chen asked Future Tourism's CEO Wei Yun to prepare a conference room.</br>
</br>
After half an hour, the two met inside the conference room.</br>
</br>
"In some areas, there might be some misunderstandings. And the purpose of my trip is to clarify our misunderstandings." Carson was straightforward.</br>
</br>
</br>
"For example?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"For example the freshwater project in Saudi caused us to have some differences, and the differences resulted in frictions in our other businesses." Carson paused and looked at Jiang Chen. "I will be straightforward. It is beneficial to no one to continue this stalemate. At this point, it is about who has the biggest loss, do you agree with my perspective?"</br>
</br>
"I concord with you, but it doesn't mean we will compromise. Future Group only promises to not use unethical tactics first."</br>
</br>
"Oh? So you're saying you are the person behind the information leak?" Carson laughed.</br>
</br>
"I never said that. Please don't twist my words, and please don't accuse without any evidence," Jiang Chen stated.</br>
</br>
Carson Loki gazed at Jiang Chen, and then paused.</br>
</br>
"We will discuss with the other shareholders in Matrix to withdraw from the freshwater project in Saudi."</br>
</br>
In terms of technology, Matrix already lost to Future Heavy Industrial. Withdraw or not, their odds of winning were low. Unless Saudi insisted on building their own treatment plant, their technology was unattractive.</br>
</br>
The favor lacked sincerity.</br>
</br>
"This was a wise choice. I want to say, however, the problem doesn't lie here." Jiang Chen shook his head with one hand on the table as he continued while staring into Carson's eyes. "Since you have the intention to settle, I will be straightforward as well. Stop any unethical tactics against Future Group and return to ethical competition."</br>
</br>
He paused, then said seriously.</br>
</br>
"Or else, we will continue to escalate our measures."</br>
</br>
Silence lasted for two minutes, Carson began to explain.</br>
</br>
"The anti-trust investigation against Future Technology has been in the agenda for a while. With the rise in the virtual reality network, UA will never rely its cybersecurity to a foreign company. We just brought the proposal ahead of the agenda."</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Then we express the deepest regret for the client information leak at First B City Bank. I heard UA received thousands of attacks from foreign IP addresses. I think this leak may be accidental."</br>
</br>
"Accidents may happen again."</br>
</br>
Carson was silent again. After a long moment. Then he used a calming tone.</br>
</br>
"We are here to reach an agreement, aren't we?"</br>
</br>
"If you're here to settle, then please bring out a proposal with some sincerity. Mr. Loki, I have to remind you that you started the war," Jiang Chen said fiercely.</br>
</br>
From the moment Blue Seagull directed its campaign against Future Group, the war was no longer limited between Matrix and Future Heavy Industrial. There was only one way to naturally end the war and that is to stop the attacks from both parties.</br>
</br>
The Department of Justice must stop the anti-trust investigation against Future Technology and Future Technology will cease the cyberattack against First B City Bank.</br>
</br>
Carson's finger gently tapped on the table and he said.</br>
</br>
"We can help you to throw the anti-trust investigation out of the court, but shouldn't you do something for our loss as well?"</br>
</br>
"Your recommendation is?"</br>
</br>
"Help us recover our credibility and market cap loss."</br>
</br>
"We're not the best in stock manipulation. I don't think I can do too much." Jiang Chen opened his hand.</br>
</br>
"It has nothing to be with the stock itself. There is a proverb in China. Out of blows friendship grows. Since continuing the fight no longer matches both of our interest, then there is only one option remaining. Are you interested in a strategic partnership with us?" Carson Loki smiled.</br>
</br>
Carson's proposal surprised Jiang Chen. B City Consortium was willing to set aside their differences and enter a strategic partnership with Future Group?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen contemplated for a long time.</br>
</br>
"Your proposal is extremely tempting. But I want to hear the details of this partnership."</br>
</br>
"I came prepared." The elder took out a document from his briefcase; his smile was bright.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scanned it through; his eyebrows rose.</br>
</br>
[Partnership? Interesting.]</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The next morning, despite an extra twenty thousand copies of the Wall Street Journal being printed, the shelf was cleared out immediately.</br>
</br>
The reason why was because of two names – Future Technology and First B City Bank.</br>
</br>
In the next while, the two names dominated the headlines of newspapers, magazines, websites and forums. The former was recently in turbulence due to the anti-trust scandal while the latter's stock price and client number plunged because of the client information leak.</br>
</br>
It was not difficult for people aware of the situation to draw connections.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries intervened in Saudi's freshwater project, but Matrix was controlled by First B City Bank and B City Scientific. Both companies were subsidiaries of B City Consortium. After considering all the players, the entire event became clear.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen touched the cake of B City Consortium, and B City Consortium bribed Blue Seagull to smudge the image of Future Group and that unfolded the economic war.</br>
</br>
An irresponsible hypothesis, based on the control of each consortium to the Capital, would be that it was highly likely that the anti-trust investigation against Future Technology was the work of B City Consortium. And the infiltration of First B City Bank's firewall was likely done by Future Technology, since they were the leader within the tech industry capable of artificial intelligence.</br>
</br>
But last night, both companies published the same announcement on their respective site stating a partnership in the virtual reality financial field to pave the road to virtual reality shopping. The information immediately defeated all the rumors and First B City Bank's shares spiked by 6% on the day.</br>
</br>
It was the first rebound the share experienced since the leak.</br>
</br>
Not only was VR + Finance an element, Future Heavy Industries will separate the production and distribution in the freshwater project to form the High Tech Freshwater Supply. The company was injected with 400 million US dollars with an equity swap of 19% in exchange for 20.8% of Matrix to replace the Loki family as the largest shareholder of Matrix. The two companies will develop synergies in its operations. Matrix will utilize its vast resources to gain clients while Future Heavy Industrial will digest the contracts.</br>
</br>
To Future Heavy Industries with only technology, an equity swap with Matrix was the perfect choice.</br>
</br>
At the same time, High Tech Freshwater Supply went public with First B City Bank as the sole book runner.</br>
</br>
The IPO of High Tech Freshwater Supply marked the first subsidiary of Future Group to go public. The Wall Street investors were full of expectations with analysts predicting the Saudi freshwater supply would generate at least 400 million US dollars in profits per year! Based on the large demand in the Middle East region, the number could more than likely double!</br>
</br>
Based on the a P/E ratio of 15 times, the company with only 400 million US dollars in equity could exceed a market cap of 6 billion US dollars and gear toward 10 billion in a year's time!</br>
</br>
</br>
The tremendous value naturally made the share the Wall Street darling.</br>
</br>
With the assistance of B City Consortium, the IPO process went smoothly. The previously tedious process was not a problem with the support of the consortium and the passion of the investors.</br>
</br>
As to why Jiang Chen suddenly changed his mind about going public, it was because of Carson Loki's words.</br>
</br>
They already reached an agreement on the partnership by then, but Jiang Chen was against going public from the start. The reason was simple; he firmly believed in the potential of the freshwater business. Future Group didn't lack money and hence didn't require going public to draw additional funds.</br>
</br>
"Saudi is UA's strategic ally, even if we are not here to intervene, your business won't be so smooth in the Red Sea."</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Because of UA's military presence in the Middle East." Carson smiled. "Mr. Jiang had done some business in Iraq, am I right?"</br>
</br>
"That's right." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
It was nothing worth disguising for. Anyone who bothered could trace his footsteps Iraq and Viet. Some intelligence agencies thought these experiences as the "organization's" way for Jiang Chen to grow. Because of these experiences, he was promoted to be the leader of the "organization".</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen saw CIB's analysis of him, he would probably start laughing.</br>
</br>
"Whether it is IS or other extremist organizations, they are more or less connected with us. This connection is not only demonstrated through the rifles and bullets in their hands, but it is also displayed through the control of Capital. In necessary times, they will help us eliminate people that shouldn't exist and provide an excuse for the unnecessary war."</br>
</br>
"I see what you mean." Jiang Chen nonchalantly opened his hands, "You mean I'll be afraid of pirates?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Carson shook his head, "Based on the Capital's report, out of all the dictators, you have the most powerful military force. But do you think Saudi would allow you to station a force in their sovereignty? Just because of a freshwater supply?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed. He finally understood what Carson meant.</br>
</br>
UA of course won't take any action, but they would permit pirates or other organizations to attack the freshwater platform. They could even secretly purchase the "souvenir" from them and research the remains.</br>
</br>
At this time, Celestial Trade would face an awkward situation. An international military mission not only tested for military prowess, but also diplomacy.</br>
</br>
"I don't understand , what does it have to do with going public?"</br>
</br>
"If we go public, even if only 10% of the shares are made public, it could eliminate the concern from the Capital."</br>
</br>
Carson used the word "we". After he signed the equity swap agreement, he became a shareholder of High Tech Freshwater and this proposal was from High Tech Freshwater's perspective.</br>
</br>
If the company did go public, the situation would be completely different. Even it was to protect the interest of the domestic investor, the Capital would remain cautious on making moves under the table.</br>
</br>
Future Group still controlled the company. Regardless from any perspective, going public in UA was a great choice for High Tech Freshwater. Jiang Chen agreed with the proposal and confirmed that 15% of the shares will be made public.</br>
</br>
After going public, the structure of the company was 70% controlled by Future Heavy Industrial, 15% owned by First B City Bank. Future Heavy Industrial still had an iron grasp on the company.</br>
</br>
Also, the IPO of the subsidiary would bring at least 1 billion US dollars in one time earning for Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, with the strategic partnership formed between Future Group and First B City Bank, Blue Seagull, as the pawn, was stuck in an awkward situation.</br>
</br>
Without the support, they could not even afford the lawsuit.</br>
</br>
Court fees for the international tribune and lawyer fees were not low since they were not charitable organizations. Even if Blue Seagull was not-for-profit, they still must pay for their bill. But Future Group wasn't looking to end the dispute soon as they dumped two trucks of files at the court. It looked like they were looking to fight a long and drawn out battle.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"After a week of investigation, we have determined that Future Technology's operation acted within the principle of a free market. The litigation against Future Technology will be thrown out in the next few days…" In front of the cameras, a Department of Justice spokesperson read out the words without any expression.</br>
</br>
The Capital who gave the go ahead to the investigation suddenly changed their mind, the Senators suddenly spoke out questioning the credibility of the investigation.</br>
</br>
The Minister of Justice almost wanted to puke blood because of his fury.</br>
</br>
M State wasthe home base for B City Consortium and everyone knew what this meant. What the Minister didn't understand was, if you first pushed for the anti-trust investigation, why did you change your mind all of it sudden?</br>
</br>
The Department of Justice could no longer withstand the immense pressure from the outraged public. The Capital demanded them to cease investigation immediately and solve any of the lingering problems. Now that even the fat nerds were criticizing the government for preventing them from searching for their true love in virtual reality…</br>
</br>
A fine would require evidence. And although it was not impossible to be somewhat reckless in a law-governed state, everyone still must play by the rules of the game. Just like Future Technology had stated, they didn't fit the definition of a monopoly by any means as they were just formed for less than two years.</br>
</br>
Since they couldn't be slapped with a fine, the litigation must be thrown out.</br>
</br>
On the night of the decision, Future Technology posted an announcement.</br>
</br>
"We welcome the correct decision made by the Department of Justice. Future Technology will abide with a fair and justice competitive spirit and operate without interfering with the principles of the market. From today on, the virtual reality network will return. Future Technology, proudly serving you!"</br>
</br>
The announcement erupted into waves of cheers on the Internet.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha! Godly Land is finally back online! I haven't played in a week!"</br>
</br>
"Our virtual reality is back. This is democratic freedom!"</br>
</br>
"Thank God. Amnesia is terrible. Although I don't wear the helmet every night, it feels like something was missing without being able to use the helmet."</br>
</br>
With the rumor of Future Technology exiting UA blown out of water and servers back online, Godly Land's concurrent user count broke the 100 million mark!</br>
</br>
While Microsoft and Google were envious with Future Technology's success, they must admit defeat. They previously optimistically thought the lawsuit would last for at least two years and they could use the time to break through the neural connection challenge to develop a replacement for Phantom and take over Future Technology's North America market. But who would have thought that the anti-trust investigation would end so swiftly and unexpectedly.</br>
</br>
While this anti-trust investigation ended, the influence of virtual reality alerted the Capital and strengthened UA's determination in the development of virtual reality technology.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Capital established a 400 million US dollar fund dedicated to the development of virtual reality in the military field. The ideal candidates for the fund were naturally the two home grown tech giants – Google and Microsoft.</br>
</br>
Not only UA, Nippon on the other side of the Pacific also announced that Mitsubishi and Sony will form a partnership in virtual reality to fund a 5 billion dollars of training equipment for the police and arms force.</br>
</br>
Although Hua didn't make a specific announcement, the Central Research Institute already listed the virtual reality project as a top research project.</br>
</br>
However, no country could make progress in the field of neural connection…</br>
</br>
From some elements, the withdrawal of the anti-trust investigation increased the countries' spending in virtual reality projects. No country would permit such an influential virtual reality network to be controlled in other people's hands.</br>
</br>
And Future Technology just needed to maintain the lead in technology to make the countries attempting to breakthrough unable to leave them.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Papua Island, New Malaysia Special District.</br>
</br>
Compared with the barrenness half a year ago, this area became the largest industrial park on Papua Island with the transformation brought by Future Group.</br>
</br>
Steel plants, aluminum plants, electronic manufacturing plants and other high contaminant plants sprouted up and completed Xin's environmental transition. At the same time, apartments, supermarkets, schools, bars, and other infrastructures also appeared that greatly improved the life of the Papua Island citizens.</br>
</br>
The parts of the robot, the base of Penglai, the battery of the electric vehicle… continuous amount of cargos transported from the port to Ange Island formed the bloodline to Jiang Chen's technology empire. The island no longer just housed Future Group's subsidiary, with the move of highly polluting industries from Ange Island to Papua Island, other Malaysia and New Guinea islands flooded in. This place became a hotbed of investment in South Asia.</br>
</br>
Future Group certainly benefited from the special district. The Malaysian and New Guinean government were all thankful for Future Group's decision to invest there. This was reflected from the economic policy that supported Future Group's continuous investment in this area and oppressive attitude against environmental organizations.</br>
</br>
Both country's government was desperate for Future Group to throw more money at the poorly developed Papua Island, how would they permit a small group of people's protest? High polluting industry drives the growth of GDP, in turn, attracting more investment which is a necessary step in the rise of a developing country.</br>
</br>
In less than a week after Future Technology and B City Consortium settled their differences, Jiang Chen took his private plane to the biggest island in the Pacific and arrived in his industrial park.</br>
</br>
It was his first visit since New Malaysia Specific District was formed.</br>
</br>
"On behalf of the special district's people, I welcome you, Mr. Jiang Chen." The governor of the special district Mackey extended his hand out from far out in the distance with a giant smile.</br>
</br>
Despite the specific district being built on the border along New Guinea and Malaysia, the administration of the specific district was handed to the more influential Malaysia.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Mackey." Jiang Chen shook his hand and small talked, before they both boarded Future Heavy Industrial's vehicle, headeing to the headquarter.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's visit here was not for travel.</br>
</br>
Mackey who sensed something was about to unfold attempted to find an answer from Jiang Chen indirectly, "Is Future Group making a new move?""If there is plan to build a high tech plant, could Future Group consider the special district first?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen just smiled without providing an explanation.</br>
</br>
Just two days ago, Future Group's material science lab, the graphene material research team led by Lu Yuan, discovered a major breakthrough in graphene application in the semiconductor industry which made graphene semiconductor a possibility.</br>
</br>
Of course, the major breakthrough in this short period of time was attributable to the resources gathered from the apocalypse. And in the production line of the virtual reality helmet, the graphene semiconductor was already used in the automated line. The information was just undisclosed to the public.</br>
</br>
Once graphene semiconductors were introduced, it would be a giant leap in the current semiconductor industry!</br>
</br>
Now, since Future Group introduced the graphene manufacturing technology, they naturally would not give up the giant market.</br>
</br>
Future Technology would not only be the Microsoft in the new era, its goal was also to be the Intel of the new era!</br>
</br>
It was time for a new king in the global semiconductor reign.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 675: The Beginning of the PM Era</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Future Group's repetitive appearances on the headlines made some media companies contemplate if they should seek advertisement fees from Future Group's boss.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen arrived on Papua Island, the world became unsettled because of another piece of news.</br>
</br>
UA, New York Times: "Future Heavy Industries announced that there has been a major breakthrough in the field of semiconductor graphene materials research, the 5nm curse that silicon chips cannot break through is expected to be easily solved. Before 2020, the world's electronics industry is expected to enter the PM Era! "(1nm = 1000pm)</br>
</br>
UK, The Guardian: "Incredible research results! Professor of materials science at Cambridge University states that Future Group perhaps will change our future again with technology."</br>
</br>
France, Le Monde: "Under the Future Group Materials Research Lab, Lu Yuan and other three scientists will be nominated for the Nobel Prize in 2018."</br>
</br>
Xiangjiang, South China Morning Post: "Talents flourishing from mainland; the exhausted Moore's Law could be kept alive by this man!"</br>
</br>
It is well known that conventional graphene has no bandgap, and its special corrugated valence band and conduction band are actually connected together, making it more like a metal than a semiconductor.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industrial announced that their researchers found that the silicon carbide can be used as raw material through a heat treatment to break it down and form a layer of graphene. This could allow the buffer layer graphene to form a monolithic with greater than 1.10ev.</br>
</br>
This is already very close to the 1.12ev silicon material, making graphene chips possible!</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industrial's significant breakthrough in graphene caught all the renowned reputable CPU developers and manufactures unexpectedly. The NASDAQ plummeted red at opening, causing despairing woes to the investors.</br>
</br>
As to the reason? It was obvious!</br>
</br>
Once the graphene semiconductor comes out, it will mean that the silicon chip will come to a complete end and it will only be a matter of time before it can be eliminated by a smaller graphene transistor. Just like a steam engine could be no match to a fast-moving internal combustion engine. It is the same.</br>
</br>
The investors are all cunning creatures. If other companies stated that they created global Wi-Fi, virtual reality, graphene semiconductor, they would scorn them, saying, "Do you think I'm a new investor? Don't use those scams to make me buy your shares."</br>
</br>
However, it was different for Future Group. All the projects they announced became reality.</br>
</br>
It was still undetermined if Intel and AMD will fall from grace like Kodak since Wall Street investors already dumped their shares.</br>
</br>
The trend line of Kodak was still a refreshing memory to investors. From February 1997 with a market cap of 31 billion to 2.1 billion on September 2011, the rollercoaster ride was even more exciting than the Shanghai Stock Exchange across the Pacific! (The Shanghai Stock Exchange is notorious for its unreasonable fluctuations.)</br>
</br>
</br>
With tech stocks bleeding red, what B City Consortium didn't expect was that B City Technology's stock price remained surprisingly strong. Future Group's subsidiary was still in the process for IPO, so investors could only release their passion on First B City Bank and B City Technology that formed a strategic partnership with Future Group. Although it was undetermined if they will work together in the graphene field, investing in itself is gambling right?</br>
</br>
If they made the right bet, it would be the next Intel!</br>
</br>
The unexpected joy caught Carson Loki off guard. Even John Lawson who opposed against working with Future Group in developing the North American market ended up being glad with the outcome of the result.</br>
</br>
Just as the world was debating Future Heavy Industries' major breakthrough in the field of graphene, Wall Street Journal dropped another heavy hitter.</br>
</br>
A senior patent official who chose to remain anonymous stated that Future Heavy Industries submitted over 2000 patent applications! From graphene transistors to the preparation of graphene chips, Future Heavy Industries with lightning speed swept the entire patent market clean.</br>
</br>
The Capital was joyous and shocked at the same time; joyous because Future Group finally agreed to submit their patents; shocked because they blocked any research potential for graphene semiconductors! DARPA's investment into material science went straight down the drain.</br>
</br>
They already put the results on the table and were now submitting for patent.</br>
</br>
In twenty years, any company that wishes to produce graphene semiconductors must pay a high royalty to Future Group.</br>
</br>
The decision to submit for patent was a well contemplated one by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Different from neural connection and mature artificial intelligence, graphene's technological bridge was not as insurmountable; just like Future Heavy Industrial's solid state lithium air battery. It won't take more than a few years before the technology would come out of the labs.</br>
</br>
Material Science Lab Doctor Lu Yuan agreed with Jiang Chen's perspective.</br>
</br>
He made optimistic judgments referencing to the papers published in international scholastic journals such as Nature and Science. Perhaps in 2020, graphene's industrial production would see a dramatic breakthrough.</br>
</br>
So, for the first time, the Future Group registered a total of 2,000 patents for graphene-related research through the International Patent Organization in a number of countries and set a patent barrier thicker than the Great Wall. They established the future of the monopoly of graphene chips.</br>
</br>
Of course, the registered patent was only for the product and not the production process.</br>
</br>
The difficulty in graphene research was precisely the production process and the manufacturing of the different types of graphene material's equipment. Without the key production technology, acquiring a graphene semiconductor sample could at most provide a thought process for the experiment, but it would be impossible to reverse engineer the production process.</br>
</br>
The production of the chip would be completed on Ange Island. Jiang Chen had no intention to build plants in other countries. Therefore, he didn't need to disclose the process in exchange for the protection of this intellectual property.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had two purposes during this visit to the special district.</br>
</br>
First, over half of BHP's 80 million tons of ores were consumed already. The construction of Penglai caused the price of iron and aluminum to climb. Luke was obviously not foolish and of course wouldn't continue to sign the agreement with Future Group.</br>
</br>
He was here to negotiate with BHP Group on the contract.</br>
</br>
Second, Jiang Chen was preparing to audit the production status of the district.</br>
</br>
The technological barrier of graphene chip was done being broken through; Future Group obviously won't just sell the chip. They will continue to develop the downstream industries from phones, tablets, to PCs!</br>
</br>
If Future Heavy Industries can't do it, he will purchase subsidiaries to do it!</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"I plan to invest 1 billion..." Jiang Chen thought the wording wasn't attractive enough, so he added, "Dollars."</br>
</br>
Mackey's eyes instantly turned red and his breathing quickened.</br>
</br>
"What do you need?!"</br>
</br>
One billion US dollars of investments would be a magnificent political achievement! He had been contemplating how to convince Future Group to increase their investment in the special district, throw more money at Papua Island, and improve locals' lives...</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen made the proposal himself.</br>
</br>
Of course, it could be related to the breakthrough in graphene!</br>
</br>
The thought of that alone made Mackey's eyes light up.</br>
</br>
He already made up his mind. Regardless of what Jiang Chen demanded, he would do his best to meet Jiang Chen's demands. He would do whatever needed to secure the 1 billion USD investment!</br>
</br>
"Future Group will acquire 11 companies around the world, organize the patent technology and reorganize into five subsidiaries. The five subsidiaries will produce exterior phone shells, Wi-Fi modules, screen driver chips, camera modules, graphene screens and other parts in New Malaysia Special District."</br>
</br>
"Future Group is planning to enter the cellphone industry?" Mackey asked.</br>
</br>
"That's right!" Jiang Chen smiled. "I'm pleased with the labor costs in the special district, so the new plants will be built here. We'll need your help in terms of the approval and taxation process."</br>
</br>
It was too restrictive to just stay in the phone industry; Future Heavy Industrial first planned to start with chip manufacturing before branching into the industry chain of phone and tablet production.</br>
</br>
"Haha, rest assured Mr. Jiang Chen. You're a friend of Papua Province - leave this to me! My assistant Monica will be at Future Heavy Industries this month. If you need any help, please let us know!" While trying to tone down his ecstatic mood, Mackey assured Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The fact that the world's first graphene semiconductor would be situated in the New Malaysia Special District was great news to Malaysia.</br>
</br>
The plant would attract a flock of electronic parts manufacturers interested in graphene technology to build plants in the special district. A one billion dollar investment wasn't much, but the domino effect of the investment would be astounding.</br>
</br>
While the Malaysian government daydreamed about becoming the graphene factory for the world, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
[You're out of your mind if you think the majority of the core products will be produced here?]</br>
</br>
The Malaysian workers only needed to stand beside special instruments along the production line to attach various components such as the CPU, baseband chip, radio frequency chip and power management chip produced from Ange Island Industrial Park.</br>
</br>
The core technology would be manufactured by workers on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
Of course, with the industrial capabilities of Ange Island, it was impossible to produce everything. The labor force in the special district was vast, and with a beneficial economic policy from the Malaysian government, it was the best for everyone to get a slice of the pie.</br>
</br>
</br>
Graphene displays and touch screens weren't difficult to produce. For cameras, Wi-Fi chips, and audio decoder chips, they didn't require a technological update for the time being. They could be built in the new special district or even outsourced to factories of businesses that invested in the special district.</br>
</br>
Everything would use graphene transistors manufactured on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
In his few days at the special district, Jiang Chen spent the majority of his time at Future Heavy Industrial's headquarters constantly in meetings to discuss acquisitions and restructuring.</br>
</br>
The meeting's materials and restructuring plan was Jean's responsibility. It had a focus on production efficiency which lightened his workload. For the role of an assistant, Jiang Chen gave her a score of 98.</br>
</br>
As for the two points deducted, one was because of her expressionless face, and the other was because she couldn't make coffee for him…</br>
</br>
But Ayesha perfectly made up for the missing two points.</br>
</br>
Strolling in the center of the New Malaysia Special District, Jiang Chen felt a wave of emotions flooding toward him as he gazed at the illuminated streets.</br>
</br>
Half a year ago, this place was a town on the border, fighting to cross the poverty line. With Future Group's presence, everything was different.</br>
</br>
Bundles of cash were thrown out, and an eight-lane highway connected the town straight to the harbor. More stacks of cash, roads, and apartments began to sprout.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly thought about Xiangjiang a thousand kilometers away. Before its rise, it was just a small fishing village.</br>
</br>
The special district was presently just like Xiangjiang from last century. Just standing on the strait, he could sense the propensity and growth in the air. If the special district became the second Xiangjiang one day, Future Group would become filthy rich.</br>
</br>
From walking to the headquarters building up to the strait, Jiang Chen hadn't set foot off his property yet.</br>
</br>
Future Group purchased ten square kilometers of land from the special district government for an extremely low price and handled 80% of infrastructure development.</br>
</br>
If the housing prices of the special district rose to half of Xiangjiang's prices, Future Heavy Industrial could easily be renamed Future Real Estate.</br>
</br>
It was too unromantic to think about this during break time. Jiang Chen intentionally cleared his agenda that day to take Ayesha around.</br>
</br>
Life was about more than just making money.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you busy today?" Ayesha held Jiang Chen's hand. She tilted her head while her sapphire eyes showed confusion.</br>
</br>
"Today is the weekend. It's okay to take a break." He smiled.</br>
</br>
He had been taking a "break" all year around. Or rather, working hard for one week was rare for him.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, just relax today then." She spoke gently.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tousled her hair, kissed her forehead, gazed at her blushed face, and sincerely said to her, "Thank you."</br>
</br>
"?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha's eyes displayed the confusion in her mind.</br>
</br>
"I live in two worlds with so many things to take care of. I just feel like I owe you—"</br>
</br>
Her soft finger stopped Jiang Chen from talking. Ayesha shook her head, and her gorgeous but icy face bloomed into a rare, bright smile.</br>
</br>
"Do you still remember the trip to the desert?"</br>
</br>
It was overreaching to say it was a trip.</br>
</br>
Gazing at the gentleness inside her sapphire eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly understood the words in her heart.</br>
</br>
"If you really want to talk about who owes whom, I owe you the entire world."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After spending an afternoon in the special district, the pair didn't return to the company after dinner, but instead, they went to the only five-star hotel in the area.</br>
</br>
It was a tender night.</br>
</br>
The next day, although he wanted to sleep in while hugging the adorable girl, he had to wake up early.</br>
</br>
Based on the schedule arranged by Jean, he would meet with BHP's representative regarding a contract extension for iron and aluminum ore.</br>
</br>
BHP's President Luke arrived at the special district and met Jiang Chen at the headquarters.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen certainly is ruthless. The development of Penglai was already on your desk when we met in Ber, right?"</br>
</br>
While Luke had a smile on his face, Jiang Chen could still hear the displeased tone in his voice.</br>
</br>
It was inevitable since Jiang Chen screwed him hard.</br>
</br>
An aircraft carrier could carry up to 100,000 tons. Penglai's consumption of steel and aluminum were equivalent to at least one hundred aircraft carriers. Imagine if UA announced construction plans for a hundred aircraft carriers - how would the iron and aluminum ore market turn out?</br>
</br>
Especially since Future Group never said they only planned to build just one Penglai. If Penglai became successful, a lot of countries might become interested in something similar. If Jiang Chen ever considered exporting this marine city, orders would flood Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
Hua would definitely be the biggest buyer.</br>
</br>
The reality was that compared to last year's downturn in the metal ore market, iron and aluminum ores, in both future and spot markets, showed more substantial rebounds. The 80 million tons of supply contracts Jiang Chen owned no doubt timed the market at the floor price with an additional 20% off the floor price.</br>
</br>
Luke had regretted signing the contract ever since but he couldn't do anything about it. In order to maintain the credibility of his group, BHP had to take the loss.</br>
</br>
While they agreed to take the loss, after supplying 40 million tons of ores to Future Group, if they wanted more, then that would be the time to talk about prices again!</br>
</br>
"With the increase in iron ore prices this year, the original price is no longer suitable."</br>
</br>
"How much are you planning to increase it by?" Jiang Chen eyed Luke with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Based on the current market price, we'll give you a 10% discount."</br>
</br>
"Based on the current market price? Do you think I don't know that you released a global iron ore production reduction report through the International Mining Alliance a week ago and raised the prices of iron and aluminum in future and spot markets?" Jiang Chen said with a grin.</br>
</br>
Based on Jean's data collection abilities, any published reports couldn't escape her grasp. After analyzing the information, it wasn't difficult to find the correlation.</br>
</br>
Luke's expression froze.</br>
</br>
He didn't think Jiang Chen, who was keen on the graphene market, would focus on the completely unrelated commodities market. Typically speaking, the International Mining Alliance report was only read by people within the industry, but to prepare for this negotiation, Jiang Chen did his homework well!</br>
</br>
</br>
"85% of the market price; I can't go any lower. It's impossible to supply the ores at last year's prices! If you agree now, we can sign the contract immediately," Luke said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"The Penglai City project has consumed a total of 19.9 million tons of steel and aluminum and most of the steel and aluminum were consumed during the post-war reconstruction of MLL Island and the development of the special district. We have five deposits on MLL Island with proven reserves of over 40 million tons of iron ore, but there's no mining plan yet. You don't have too much bargaining chips on the table. Do you understand what I mean?"</br>
</br>
Future Mining's main project was seabed mining and the main outputs were molybdenum, manganese, copper, nickel, cobalt and other metals. The gross margins for mining iron and aluminum ore were too low, so even if there were a handful of iron mines that came from the Moro government, Future Mining had no plans to mine the reserves.</br>
</br>
Luke's eyes narrowed. His fingers lightly tapped the table as she pondered how to close this deal. Jiang Chen was observing him with a smile and waiting for him to compromise.</br>
</br>
"You have iron reserves on MLL Island?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. They're also high-quality iron mines around 67-68%. Not only are there iron ores, but there are also two aluminum reserves." Jiang Chen smiled. "You should know. One year ago, with the constant conflict on the island, the investment environment was poor and the F government had no ability to develop the rich deposits. But now, the reserves are in our hands."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's message expressed two layers of meaning. The first layer: we have deposits. If your price is higher than our development costs then we won't dance with you! The second layer: Future Group is no longer the Future Group from last year - don't expect us to compromise from external pressure. If I can handle the B City Consortium, I can easily handle you as well.</br>
</br>
The silence persisted for a long time before Luke sighed.</br>
</br>
"A ragged colt may make a good horse (1)."</br>
</br>
"You know this Chinese proverb?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I just learned it recently; I only know a little." Luke dismissed the topic. "Let's not get off track. I have a proposal that suits both of our interests."</br>
</br>
"Let's hear it."</br>
</br>
"We have advantages in extraction, transportation, and management, and you already mentioned your advantages which are the resources on MLL Island and the influence in Moro. We could easily invest in a mining company in Moro with a 50% equity split. We'll provide the manpower and technology while you'll supply the reserves and be responsible for public relations. What do you think?" Luke leaned forward and lowered his voice.</br>
</br>
BHP could keep the price of ores low, but it was limited by import and export tariffs, tax collections, environmental protections, and so on. As a result, the gross profit of iron and aluminum ores had been stagnant. If Future Group could, by virtue of its influence, reduce taxes and fees for the production and export of minerals from MLL Island, BHP Mining had great room for profit even if it supplied cheap minerals to Future Group.</br>
</br>
"This is a great proposal." Jiang Chen's eyes lit up, intrigued by the idea.</br>
</br>
The iron and aluminum deposits had been stagnated since Future Mining didn't have additional resources to extract. This proposal was basically contracting the development to BHP Group while the two parties split the profits.</br>
</br>
But just as Luke thought they reached an agreement, Jiang Chen's tone took a huge turn: "But do you think your equity is too high?"</br>
</br>
[This bloodsucker!]</br>
</br>
Luke cursed in his mind, but his expression still remained calm as he debated with Jiang Chen. Finally, both parties settled on the agreement with Jiang Chen to supply 70 million USD and the reserves while BHP would invest 150 million USD. The equity proportion was 55% and 45%.</br>
</br>
That was Luke's bottom line.</br>
</br>
Printing out the contract required time, so both parties agreed to officially sign the contract the next day. But based on the two parties' reputations, it was unlikely that one party would back out of the deal. Therefore, the partnership between Future Mining and BHP had been secured.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sensed a vibration on his wrist.</br>
</br>
When Luke left, Jiang Chen pressed his watch and Jean's hologram appeared beside the table.</br>
</br>
"Is there something wrong?" Jiang Chen pleasantly spoke to Jean.</br>
</br>
Because Jean was taking the minutes for the meeting, Jiang Chen opened the voice recording function so Jean could hear their conversation.</br>
</br>
"I detected more advanced mining technology from the database; we could easily develop the resources by ourselves."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head at Jean's question with a smile. He casually stuffed the document into the drawer.</br>
</br>
"We can't make all the money in the world, and there's no purpose in doing that."</br>
</br>
"From an efficiency point of view, is there a problem with my proposal?" Jean asked.</br>
</br>
"Considering things from only an efficiency point of view is a problem in itself. Compared to extracting the last bit of profits, we can proactively gift out the profits and use this to chain more people to us in exchange for greater profits."</br>
</br>
"Greater profits? What's that?"</br>
</br>
"Regardless of what it is, it's definitely not the US dollar."</br>
</br>
(1) A ragged colt may make a good horse - A young person can still be impressive.</br>

</br>
Taking BHP Mining on as an ally was definitely beneficial for Future Group. These veteran European aristocrats shouldn't be underestimated in some areas. Even though they might not be able to defeat the financial conglomerates like Rockefeller and Morgan on Wall Street, they certainly could make a dent in fields such as commodities, automotive industry, etc...</br>
</br>
After the ore supply negotiations, Jiang Chen personally put Luke on the plane. It was good news that BHP reached an agreement on mineral resource development on MLL Island for Future Heavy Industries with a sustained increase in production capacity.</br>
</br>
The next day, just as Jiang Chen was going to return to Xin, Intel's people came looking for him.</br>
</br>
The person who came to visit was Bryant Kozic. Speaking of the "legendary" CEO, it was worth mentioning the prophecy he made three years ago. When he transitioned to being the CEO from COO, he was set to develop four core areas for Intel: PCs, data centers, mobiles, and chip manufacturing technology. He boldly predicted that after three years, major manufacturers would completely give up using their rival's Qualcomm ARM architecture and switch to Intel architecture.</br>
</br>
However, contrary to expectations, the Intel chip's horrific overheating made it suffer in the mobile device market and repeated failures to deliver their promises made them lose the competitive advantage.</br>
</br>
Intel also told investors it would develop SoCs (for both Modem and application processors) for low-, mid- and high-end smartphones and tablets, but Intel's failure to bring them to market on time meant the project was ultimately stifled.</br>
</br>
After billions of investments with ultimately no return, Intel tried to disguise the situation without providing investors with a proper explanation.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries' breakthrough in graphene materials made Intel both alarmed but also presented Kozic with an opportunity to turn the situation around. If Intel could shift to using graphene, they would have a chance at winning back the mobile market.</br>
</br>
"We look forward to receiving your company's license for a total of 271 patents on semiconductor graphene and graphene transistors at a reasonable price!" At the meeting, Kozic provided his request straightforwardly.</br>
</br>
He was ready to engage in "tug of war" negotiations with Future Group; he had packed five sets of clothes in his suitcase. Future Heavy Industries' massive international purchasing spree naturally caught Intel's attention. They were obviously preparing to enter the field of electronic equipment production!</br>
</br>
From this perspective, Future Heavy Industries would inevitably become their competitor. Obviously, it wouldn't be easy to reach an agreement in the licensing of patents.</br>
</br>
But Kozic also had his own trump card.</br>
</br>
If Future Heavy Industries intentionally refused to provide licensing rights, that would be a monopoly!</br>
</br>
But to Kozic's surprise again, Jiang Chen generously said, "No problem."</br>
</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"I said no problem. We can discuss this. Was there anything wrong with my grammar?"</br>
</br>
Kozic coughed.</br>
</br>
"I apologize, my mind just slipped."</br>
</br>
"What price do you think is reasonable?" Jiang Chen didn't mind and returned to the topic.</br>
</br>
"One hundred million US Dollar?" Kozic proposed a number.</br>
</br>
"We spent 2.1 billion US Dollar on the research of graphene. Isn't it unreasonable for you to purchase this with just 100 million US Dollar?" Jiang Chen lied without breaking a sweat at all.</br>
</br>
[2.1 billion my ass, the entire graphene production equipment cost a few hundred crystals at most.]</br>
</br>
But since he was the only one who could travel between the two worlds, he set the exchange rate himself.</br>
</br>
Kozic furrowed his brows because Jiang Chen gave him such a ridiculous price tag. However, there was nothing he could do since Future Group's research team was the first one to make the breakthrough. Based on Intel's research department, the completion of semiconductor-type graphene would least require two additional years at least.</br>
</br>
"Then what's your price?"</br>
</br>
"400 million US Dollar." Jiang Chen put up four fingers then he added, "Every year."</br>
</br>
"400 million each year! Are you crazy? Is your patent made out of diamonds?!" Kozic was enraged.</br>
</br>
"Graphene is much more expensive than diamonds in terms of economic value, of course." Jiang Chen smiled. "Think about it - how much did you spend on graphene research? How much money would you spend? Now, do you still think this licensing fee is expensive?"</br>
</br>
"This means that in the next 20 years, Intel would pay you a total of 8 billion US Dollar!"</br>
</br>
"So what? When Intel has annual profits of 20 billion, would they miss this money?" Jiang Chen shrugged. "Of course, it's okay if you disagree with the proposal. Qualcomm will come to chat with us by tomorrow at the latest…"</br>
</br>
Kozic, in pain, immediately said:</br>
</br>
"Deal!"</br>
</br>
Qualcomm was Intel's rival. If Qualcomm got an advantage, it would be disastrous for Intel's plan to conquer the mobile market! Kozic had to buy time for the Intel researchers, even if it was just a day. They had to develop a graphene chip based on Intel's architecture ahead of Qualcomm and send a straight punch to Qualcomm's mobile market shares.</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen said, 400 million was nothing for the enormous Intel.</br>
</br>
Sponsored by UA's largest Rockefeller Consortium, Intel was far richer than they appeared.</br>
</br>
After the negotiation, with the licensing agreement in hand, Kozic boarded the plane to return home. The moment Kozic left the special district, Qualcomm's representative arrived, planning to discuss the licensing agreement with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The negotiations with Qualcomm were completed on the same day. When Qualcomm's representative heard that Intel's representative was granted a patent license for 400 million US Dollar annually in patent fees, the representative didn't even blink an eye and agreed immediately. Jiang Chen was crying pitifully in his mind; based on how fast they made their decisions, he could've given them an even higher price!</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu was shocked with how fast Jiang Chen ended negotiations, so she called to express her concern.</br>
</br>
"If we want to enter the field of graphene chips, why not drag on the Intel and Qualcomm licensing negotiations for a few months? This would allow us to independently develop chips in the market to seize the first-mover advantage."</br>
</br>
"We've had the first opportunity for long enough; graphene chip samples and production line designs are now in the laboratory. Until the acquisition of the subsidiary is completed along with restructuring, we can't start production. I believe that even without our patent licensing, they won't stop borrowing our public information for technological research and development. After all, according to the anti-monopoly law, we have to provide licensing sooner or later. Since they won't have graphene chips tomorrow, it makes no difference when we grant them licensing."</br>
</br>
Future Group would be ahead of them in the graphene chip race regardless.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
[There's been a major breakthrough in semiconductor graphene materials. Future Heavy Industries will provide Intel, Qualcomm, and many other chip manufacturers with licensing agreements. Intel's CEO held a press conference stating that by early next year at the latest, Intel would be the first to use graphene chips. Analysts show that this use of graphene transistors is ahead of the expected date previously Intel set, two years ahead of the launch of 5-nanometer processing chips! ...]</br>
</br>
Inside the ancient manor, next to the antique tea table, an elderly man with completely white hair was reading the news and drinking tea.</br>
</br>
While all newspapers could now be read on phones and tablets, years of habits were hard to break.</br>
</br>
Right now, Liu Xiangguo's first son, Liu Yunzhong, was standing by the side. He wanted to say something but was reluctant to do so until he finally made up his mind and carefully said:</br>
</br>
"Dad, what do you think we lack compared to the big families in UA?"</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo didn't respond and continued to scan over the newspaper.</br>
</br>
Liu Yunzhong continued.</br>
</br>
"Why can't we control Future Group like the Rockefeller family in UA…"</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo eyed his son and scoffed before refocusing on the newspaper.</br>
</br>
"That's a very interesting statement. Then why don't you tell me - why don't we control Intel or purchase the entire Wall Street?"</br>
</br>
Liu Yunzhong's expression looked awkward.</br>
</br>
"It's pretty far away from us, right."</br>
</br>
[And we can't afford it.]</br>
</br>
"So that's why I'm saying the Wang family is moronic. Of course, I'm not talking about Little Wang - I'm referring to his little brother, Wang Linhua." Liu Xiangguo adjusted the reading glasses on his nose with his finger while he flipped to the next page. "Dehai was completely blinded by his family. Who didn't see the value of Future Technology? You'll take a bite when you see it? This is why I've been restricting the family from going into business. The land below us is the center of power of the republic!"</br>
</br>
Future Group's Hua business generated at least 200 million US dollar for the Liu family. Since it was operated by a subsidiary registered in Central America, the money was extremely clean. How many dividends could Linhua Group pay the Wang family? They indeed made some money from real estate, but what about now? Linhua Group was barely alive after two years of losses. The loan depended on the connection of Wang Dehai; what money did they have to pay dividends?</br>
</br>
Even the second child policy couldn't save the real estate bubble!</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo's shrewdness allowed him to understand the situation. The Liu family wouldn't touch the moneymaking business; instead, they focused all their efforts on preserving their present power. The people who required the convenience would naturally put money into their hands.</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo gently sighed.</br>
</br>
"If this company remains in Wanghai, he could still move up a level just from this achievement alone."</br>
</br>
</br>
Liu Yunzhong was completely shocked.</br>
</br>
Another level above the deputy state level? Wouldn't that be…</br>
</br>
"But unfortunately, the brighter Future Group's international performance, the more evidently blind Dehai was. He'll probably have to retire at the city secretary as a member of the Politburo position."</br>
</br>
Liu Xiangguo nonchalantly said while flipping another page.</br>
</br>
At the end of the page, Liu Xiangguo's finger froze.</br>
</br>
He threw the newspaper aside and the elder shakenly stood up. Liu Xiangguo stopped his son from helping him and gave him a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"I'm not old yet!"</br>
</br>
Liu Yunzhong watched his father walk outside in bewilderment. His thirty years of instinct told him that his father was…</br>
</br>
Happy?</br>
</br>
Liu Zhongguo walked to the table and picked up the newspaper. He was curious what his father read that made him so excited to leave the house.</br>
</br>
"An insider who declined to be named stated that Future Group made significant progress in graphene chip research. Currently, the 'Dragon Cavalry X1' graphene chip, 7nm, is only half the size of Intel's 'Xeon Phi'! However, its performance is up to 1.5 times the performance of Xeon Phi! The architecture used by Future Heavy Industrial was independently researched and developed... "</br>
</br>
Splash.</br>
</br>
The newspaper fell to the group and Liu Yunzhong's face shifted from stunned disbelief to uncontrollable ecstasy. Two keywords echoed in his mind like a curse.</br>
</br>
Ultra-chip! New architecture!</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
In early April, the UA Department of Commerce issued a public notice to block Intel's sale of Xeon chips to Tianhe II system upgrade to Hua National Supercomputing Center. The UA media later disclosed that the Department of Commerce issued an announcement in February saying that the Tianhe No. 2 system and the Tianhe No. 1 A system using Intel microprocessor chips were "believed to be used in nuclear explosion simulations," so the four Hua state institutions were included on the list of restricted exports.</br>
</br>
It was indeed disastrous news, but it offered hope for the rise of domestically-produced chips.</br>
</br>
This was undoubtedly bad news for the compradors, but from the rise of domestic chips, there was a greater significance. The 28nm process technology "Mars," developed by Feiteng, could replace imported chips such as the Xeon E5V2 and Phi… but it was still based on ARM architecture design and had to pay royalties to ARM.</br>
</br>
The news leak of the Dragon Cavalry X1 chip immediately attracted Hua's attention. Although the super-computer idling rate was very high in the state, it still offered great value to the field of scientific research. The key was that Tianhe No.2, leading the world computing list, could boost national confidence better than an Olympic gold medal!</br>
</br>
If what the insider said was true, the barrier to Hua's supercomputer development would be eliminated.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen previously planned for the news release of Dragon Cavalry X1 chip to be the next month, but it was leaked by his employee.</br>
</br>
When he thought it over, he immediately knew who was behind the problem.</br>
</br>
Therefore, after he returned to Coro Island, he went to see the director of the material science lab, Lu Yuan.</br>
</br>
As soon as Jiang Chen walked into the office, Lu Yuan lowered his head.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, I leaked the news."</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
"Because I still come from Hua." Lu Yuan's eyes were mixed with guilt, but there was no sense of regret at all. "I'm gracious for your support - without your data and equipment, I wouldn't be able to achieve my dreams of making a breakthrough in the graphene field and I wouldn't be named for the Noble Prize… But I know my home country needs it. I'm willing to accept punishment."</br>
</br>
He extended his hands and closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him, speechless.</br>
</br>
According to the confidentiality agreement, research progress was defined as Class B classified content. Under Xin law, leaking Class B secrets would lead to imprisonment for 17 years or more. However, as a former academician of the Academy of Sciences, Lu Yuan knew his country needed it. Therefore, when he had an interview with reporters about his Nobel Prize, he disclosed the news.</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Jiang Chen suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"I also have the same origin as you, so I understand your actions."</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan slowly opened his eyes with a look of disbelief.</br>
</br>
"But you should apologize to me because you overstepped your boundaries and acted as a CEO and spokesperson without my permission. If Hua needed this, Future Heavy Industries wouldn't be stingy with our technology, but I need an opportunity. Do you understand the word opportunity?"</br>
</br>
"I apologize."</br>
</br>
"I don't need your apology. I hope this will be the first and last time." Jiang Chen sternly looked at Lu Yuan before he turned around.</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan gratefully watched Jiang Chen's figure as he left.</br>
</br>
But what the old scientist didn't notice was that Jiang Chen had a faint smile when he turned around.</br>
</br>
He said a partnership required an opportunity.</br>
</br>
But after all the feuds that happened between them, he didn't plan to be proactive anymore.</br>
</br>
If people really needed this, they would come to him with a good attitude instead of Future Heavy Industries trying to the crowd pleaser. Dragon Calvary X1 Ultra-chip was designed for Hua's supercomputing institutions. The news would eventually be made public, whether Lu Yuan disclosed the information or not.</br>
</br>
He was debating who he should use to obscurely "leak" the information.</br>
</br>
But now, Lu Yuan's decision solved the problem for him.</br>
</br>
It wouldn't take long before Hua's representative would visit him on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 680: Breaking Embargo</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen expected, on the third day after news of Dragon Calvary X1 graphene chip was leaked, Hua sent representatives there. Led by an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of Loongson arrived at Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen met with the two representatives. He was surprised to see a familiar face.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see, Mr. Jiang." Liu Haotian shook Jiang Chen's hand with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Indeed, long time no see. The last time you were part of the concierge. Now, you've been promoted to a diplomat?" After letting his hand go, Jiang Chen looked over at the stranger.</br>
</br>
"This is Hu Weiwen, the CEO of Loongson." Liu Haotian courteously introduced the person behind him.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man at least twenty years older than Jiang Chen extended his hand first to express his sincerity.</br>
</br>
"I'm Wu Weiwen. I've long heard Mr. Jiang's name. Mr. Jiang is indeed as impressive as the rumors say."</br>
</br>
"You're flattering me." Jiang Chen smiled and welcomed the two men onto the vehicle.</br>
</br>
Liu Haotian looked at the vehicle and appeared somewhat shocked as he couldn't recognize the brand of the car. Jiang Chen seemed to have read his confusion. After the Celestial Trade Bodyguard opened the car door, he began to explain.</br>
</br>
"Luer S100, a pure electric vehicle with a solid-state lithium-air battery with a range of 500 km. Only 1000 units are available worldwide."</br>
</br>
Liu Haotian recalled the name Luer - it seemed to be an emerging European car company with a focus on purely electric vehicles. At the Ber auto show, it received 100 million US dollars in financing and secured battery orders from Future Heavy Industries. It performed slightly better compared to Tesla and was gunning for the top dog position in the new energy field.</br>
</br>
At present, Future Group invested 740 million US dollar on Coro Island to fully implement new energy vehicles. Three European car companies, such as Luer, had the privilege of sharing this policy, so it wasn't uncommon to see this brand of vehicle on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
"A range of 500 km? That's fantastic," Liu Haotian said enviously.</br>
</br>
It wasn't hard to tell he was a car fanatic.</br>
</br>
"Do you want one? I can gift you one." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"I'm okay. I'm afraid of accepting gifts." Liu Haotian quickly dismissed the idea.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't mention it further.</br>
</br>
Liu Haotian wasn't much older than him. To be able to act reserved at his age proved that either he didn't have a competitive mindset or he desired much greater things.</br>
</br>
Outside Future Building, Wu Weiwen envied the four-hundred-meter tall building with astonishment. If it was in Wanghai or Shangjing, it wouldn't be considered tall at all, but it had a different meaning standing on the Pacific Ring of Fire.</br>
</br>
This area was frequently affected by earthquakes, typhoons, and tsunamis. Building even a one-meter tall building here wasn't easier than building two meters in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Mr. Wu is intrigued by this building?"</br>
</br>
"The building's material must be impressive." Although Wu Weiwen didn't work in this field, he had a Ph.D. with a background in this area.</br>
</br>
"If you're interested, feel free to visit anytime." Jiang Chen led the two men into the conference room.</br>
</br>
The conference room was located on the middle floor of the building.</br>
</br>
The three of them sat around the table as Wu Weiwen got straight to the point.</br>
</br>
"I heard you have made significant progress in ultra-chip research. I wonder if this rumor is true?"</br>
</br>
"Of course," said Jiang Chen calmly. "In the graphene field, we're leading the world."</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen and Liu Haotian looked at each other and read the glee in each other's eyes.</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen contained his joy and looked sternly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The purpose of the trip was hopefully to establish a partnership with you in the field of graphene chips."</br>
</br>
"I, of course, welcome a partnership, but… why is Loongson here?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought Hua would be interested in the Dragon Calvary X1 chip and would provide Jiang Chen with a supply contract, but the situation was a bit different now that Loongson was there.</br>
</br>
"We hope to obtain the graphene chip and licensing rights to Dragon Calvary X1 architecture," Wu Weiwen answered.</br>
</br>
After UA embargoed its ultra-chip from Hua, developing a computer chip was put on the agenda. However, due to technical challenges, as well as compatibility difficulties and many other issues, Han-made chips still relied on ARM architecture.</br>
</br>
In terms of performance, although some domestic media exaggeratedly hyped Loongson as the best in the world, there was no market to prove it. However, the lack of market reaction proved that Loongson's performance wasn't as attractive as advertised. In actuality, whether it was Feiteng or Loongson, just from the chip manufacturing process, they were two generations behind Intel and other well-known international companies.</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen's visit this time was to obtain the authorization of graphene chips related to patents and he was also interested in the instruction set of Dragon Cavalry X1. The news revealed "Dragon X1's" mainstream chip architecture was completely different from X86, ARM, and MIPS.</br>
</br>
"There are no issues with granting you licensing for the graphene chip technology, but the instruction set is a bit troublesome." Jiang Chen's finger tapped the table and he looked at Wu Weiwen's nervous face. "After all, the Dragon Calvary X1 chip is still in the lab stage and hasn't entered the patent registration process yet. This includes the lix architecture designed by Future Technology."</br>
</br>
"What's the performance of the lix architecture?" Wu Weiwen immediately asked.</br>
</br>
"I am personally very pleased," said Jiang Chen with a smile. "In terms of the complexity of the instruction set, we may be leaner than ARM architecture, but we're in no way inferior to the performance of Intel's X86 architecture."</br>
</br>
He was still being conservative with that statement. In the apocalypse, lix architecture was the most widely used for graphene chips. It was one of the earliest forms of architecture, derived from the foundation framework. Jiang Chen intended to register 1000 patents; the current patent application documents were still being prepared.</br>
</br>
"What's the licensing price?"</br>
</br>
"Please don't rush, Mr. Wu Weiwen." Jiang Chen sighed. "We can't authorize a technology without being granted a patent."</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen's expression looked somewhat awkward as he realized he was being abrupt. However, the reason he was behaving so unsympathetically was simply because this was too important for Hua!</br>
</br>
"I suggest you purchase the Dragon Calvary X1. The ultra-chip's performance is far superior compared to Intel's Xeon Phi. If you order now, once we complete the registration process, you'll receive the first shipment."</br>
</br>
With a pause, Jiang Chen looked at Liu Haotian and said mockingly,</br>
</br>
"I can promise that this chip will help you dominate the supercomputer computation chart."</br>
</br>
This was directed to the people behind Liu Haotian.</br>
</br>
"The development of domestically produced chips is a guideline from the superiors. The ultra-chip embargo was a wake-up call for us and we had to have our own chip production capabilities." Liu Haotian shook his head. "Although your proposal is very attractive, we still favor Loongson and hope to gain the chip production technology."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Liu Haotian and Wu Weiwen speechlessly.</br>
</br>
[Even if I give you the instruction set, you might not be able to beat Intel! From research and development to self-production, how long do you plan on using silicon chips? We're a family! Even if I embargo everyone else, I won't embargo you!]</br>
</br>
"How about this - let's sign the Dragon Cavalry X1 Chip Supply Contract for 2 years. Next month, after we complete the patent registration for the lix architecture, let's talk about the lix architecture license. Developing this technology isn't a one-day event. You can first use our product then once you develop your own chip, we can discuss ending the contract?"</br>
</br>
Liu Haotian and Wu Weiwen exchanged looks before giving Jiang Chen a nod.</br>
</br>
"This proposal isn't bad. I'll have to seek approval from my superior."</br>
</br>
"Let's end our negotiation here today. I look forward to hearing good news," Jiang Chen stood up and said with a grin.</br>
</br>
[Once Hua's super-computer dominates the Top 500 chart and kicks other countries out of the Top 10, I don't think you'll have the guts to terminate the contract!]</br>
</br>
Dragon Calvary X1's purpose was to export since Xin wasn't consuming ultra-chips.</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
Because their technology was too inferior.</br>
</br>
Future Group's servers used quantum computers and had long abandoned outdated supercomputers.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Based on the contract, Future Heavy Industries would supply Hua's Ministry of Technology and Science one hundred thousand Dragon Calvary X1 Ultra-chips per month at a price of 400 US dollar per chip. The chip would be used by the supercomputing centers, universities, research agencies and completely replace Intel's Xeon Phi.</br>
</br>
The contract was set to begin in December.</br>
</br>
The 40 million first contract for Future Heavy Industries' graphene chip was indeed a pleasing result. With a contract, production must commence as well!</br>
</br>
Built by the construction robots inside Ange High Tech Park, a transistor manufacturing plant and a chip manufacturing center began to take their shape. All production equipment would be completed by the Institute's personnel and printed by the industrial-grade 3D printer.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries and Hua's contract made UA Department of Commerce dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
The previous embargo was to curtail Hua's supercomputer development, but based on the estimate made by experts, Tianhe No.2 replaced with Dragon Calvary X1's computation speed per second will exceed the previous peak and increase by a complete level!</br>
</br>
Dragon Calvary X1's production meant that the high-end ultra-chip controlled by UA will be broken. The countries and companies with embargo orders will have more choice than being limited to just Intel and Qualcomm.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the lix architecture's introduction meant that the supercomputer will no longer be dominated by X86. Future Heavy Industrial working with Future Technology will challenge Intel's firm grasp on the top-end chip market.</br>
</br>
Regardless what the Capital may think, Jiang Chen was in a pleasant mood.</br>
</br>
The engineering vessel that was pulling the desalination platform had already started its journey to the Gulf of Aden under the escort of the submarine and was scheduled to complete the escort when the Saudi Navy arrived at the entrance to the Gulf of Aden; Iron and aluminum ore negotiations ended on a positive note; Graphene introduction was complete to perfection. With so many positive news, this October marked a wonderful harvest for Future Group.</br>
</br>
Finally, before early November, the acquisition of the 11 subsidiaries completed the restructuring process, Future Heavy Industries' workforce doubled. Now the total number of employees of Future Heavy Industries exceeded 20,000, while the net profit also exceeded 15 billion US dollar. This marked Future Heavy Industries becoming the second most profitable company overtaking Future Biology in Future Group.</br>
</br>
With the prospect of the home robot and chip market, the number could exceed more than 100 billion!</br>
</br>
Compared to the stellar performance of Future Heavy Industries, Future Biology, Tourism, and the other subsidiaries that performed splendidly pale in comparison. Xin's monthly visitor exceeded the half million mark with an average spending of 975 US dollar per person. Future Tourism dominated the market at 40%. Future Biology's nutrient supply sale continued to climb and created a trend of healthy eating in the international market… which was complete contrary to the situation in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
</br>
Two years ago, in the fall that was beginning to cool off, Future Technology's Future 1.0 first caught the attention of the world.</br>
</br>
On this date worth celebrating, Jiang Chen brought his executives and outstanding employees of Future Group and hosted a celebration party on his private island to increase team cohesion and sense of belonging to the company.</br>
</br>
In order make the party classier, Jiang Chen called Robert developing in Los Santos and asked him to invite stars to the party.</br>
</br>
Based on the principle of not wasting any opportunity, Jiang Chen also asked him to bring his film crew to produce a documentary to highlight Future Group's culture. It would also serve as an advertisement for the beautiful Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
"I will give you 10 million if you help me invite the best film crew," Jiang Chen took a pause before he added, "This is the salary, the cost of filming will be calculated otherwise."</br>
</br>
"Oh, sh*t, are you trying to put the advertisement onto the big screen?" Robert was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Remember, it is a documentary, who said I'm making an advertisement! And we won't put it on the big screen, we'll use the online channel." Jiang Chen cursed at him, jokingly.</br>
</br>
Robert still had a fascination with the word "Sh*t". Now that he hasn't heard for so long, it felt great to hear it again.</br>
</br>
"Okay, buddy, leave this up to me. Thank god, this is not something dangerous. Also, you won't forget to invite your old friend to the party right?" Robert jokingly said.</br>
</br>
"Of course not. You're welcome to come! Also, bring Nick along." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
The party was just an idea in his head, but after he personally participated in the planning, he became more and more interested.</br>
</br>
The island was an uninhabited island located 170 nautical miles from Coro Island. The middle of the island was rich in vegetation while being surrounded by beaches on all four sides. Other than a wooden cabin on the island, there was no other extraneous structures.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen previously brought Ayesha and Xia Shiyu to this island, Natasha came along midway by a helicopter to join their vacation. Jiang Chen personally enjoyed the nature on this island and he was especially fond of that hot spring on the beach.</br>
</br>
Regretfully, he only visited the beautiful island once. When he gave it some thought, it was particularly wasteful.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen named the island Hot Spring Island and set the party location there.</br>
</br>
The cabin was too small? Jiang Chen invited BMA Contraction who he previously worked with and asked them to come with the best building plan for a hotel.</br>
</br>
There were not enough palm trees on the beach? They used the vessels of Celestial Trade and hauled hundreds of palm trees from other islands. With the guidance of professional gardener, they surrounded the island with trees. The vegetation in the middle was also fortunate to receive the scissors from the garden master and were decorated into a work of art.</br>
</br>
The planning of the party was contracted the world renowned party planning company – Party Life. When the company received the contract from Future Group, they put a great emphasis by sending out the renowned party planner Patrick Jarnell. The party master who planned Hollywood Red Carpets and famous celebrity parties planned everything to perfection.</br>
</br>
Of course, the cost was not cheap.</br>
</br>
But for Jiang Chen, it was too small of a bill to be bothered with.</br>
</br>
An estimate of over one thousand guests would be visiting the Hot Spring Island and security measures were also a top concern.</br>
</br>
Future Group has a lot of faithful allies, but also a lot of enemies.</br>
</br>
The security work was assigned to Celestial Trade National Security Department and Jiang Chen's Ghost Agents. The cooperation of both agencies will ensure absolute safety at the party.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 682: An Extravagant Party</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The party was set for November 15th.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't expect Robert to be able to invite Hollywood director Christopher Nolan. He vaguely recalled that the guy's salary for Interstellar was 20 million US dollar, how could he be interested in the 10 million US dollar business?</br>
</br>
Robert quickly answered his confusion.</br>
</br>
"Buddy, documentaries and movies are very different, especially if it is just filming for the party. Unless you want to film your corporate culture into Interstellar?"</br>
</br>
10 million, less than a month's production period, and no need to worry about box office sales, where could one find such an amazing task?</br>
</br>
Most importantly, he could gain a connection with Future Group…</br>
</br>
After half a month of preparation, the day of the party was finally here. Other than the executives and outstanding employees of Future Group, all of the major business partners of Future Group received an invitation.</br>
</br>
But the number of guests did surprise Jiang Chen, it far exceeded the 1000 guests expected and headed straight to 2000 people. Fortunately, the planner Jarnell was prepared and arranged for forty long tables and other amenities to be placed at the beach and supervised the chef team to prepare food and drink for the additional guests.</br>
</br>
Carmen Rothschild couldn't attend due to a matter he needed to attend to, but he still sent out a representative and brought a gift from the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
Other than Mr. Carmen who didn't attend, the top dogs of the party were B City Consortium's Carson Loki and Saudi Prince Yerif. Other than them, Future Biology's partner- Walmart's President, Future Heavy Industrial's partner – Lureka Automotive President, and the oldest son of the Liu family, renowned real estate businessman Mr. Chen… and hundreds of other businessmen attended.</br>
</br>
With so many reputable members attending, the party previously intended to be a celebration party took a "turn" and matched the high class party of the top echelons.</br>
</br>
Because the invitation permitted bringing at most three people, other than people being invited, many came with their friends "inviting themselves". They included famous businessmen, Hollywood stars, or elites of the society…</br>
</br>
They all desired to befriend the massive Future Group.</br>
</br>
Even if they couldn't gain a connection, they could use this opportunity to meet with people that could help with their business.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Melodious music twirled around the island and added more elegance to the beautiful island in the southern kingdom.</br>
</br>
At the most desolated corner of the party, Jiang Chen was planning to see Robert, but a swarm of people flooded him. This made him recall the birthday party Yerif hosted for his princess that he attended. He was sitting in the corner when the security of the party spoke with him.</br>
</br>
He faintly remembered that the security's name was Bruce, a mercenary from Blackwater International. The reason he talked to him was because he sensed a similar vibe.</br>
</br>
</br>
But now, even if he wanted to go to the washroom, there would be Hollywood stars in low-cut dresses attempting to encounter him.</br>
</br>
Reminiscing the past gave him a mixture of emotions.</br>
</br>
The group of people surrounded Jiang Chen in the middle. Jiang Chen maintained his smiled and acted in the most elegant manner in both speech and posture.</br>
</br>
The guests were all powerful and influential, if they came to greet him, he should treat them with respect.</br>
</br>
Other than the international businessmen whom he couldn't name, Jiang Chen could only name a few Hollywood stars. Although he always had difficulty remembering names, he could still match the name with the face for the films he enjoyed watching.</br>
</br>
For example, Jeremy Reiner, who played the role of Sergeant William James in the "Bomb Players" and who played the Hawk's Eye in "Captain America 3". Also the "Mission Impossible" series actor Tom Cruise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also considered a fan of the "Mission Impossible Series", he really didn't expect to meet his favorite actor this way.</br>
</br>
"Thank God."</br>
</br>
"You can thank him in person!"</br>
</br>
They exchanged lines and the two laughed. Jiang Chen and Tom Cruise fist pumped each other. This dialogue was from "Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol", so Jiang Chen remembered it vividly.</br>
</br>
"I didn't expect Mr. Jiang Chen to watch the movie I starred in." Tom laughed exposing his white teeth. Extending out his hand, he gave Jiang Chen a firm handshake.</br>
</br>
"I not only seen it, I'm also your fan" Jiang Chen used a half-joking tone.</br>
</br>
"My honor!" Deserving of being one of the best actors, Tom made a funny flattering look, immediately drawing the goodwill laughter from everyone around.</br>
</br>
At this time, a blonde beauty carrying champagne walked into the circle. She stood beside Jiang Chen and biting her lips slightly, she entered the conversation with gracefulness.</br>
</br>
"I do not know if I also have the honor to have starred in a movie Mr. Jiang has seen."</br>
</br>
A familiar face. Jiang Chen only examined her for half a second before he successfully matched her face.</br>
</br>
"Of course… I remember you are Hermione!"</br>
</br>
Emma Watson! Jiang Chen who grew up watching Harry Potter naturally recognized this face.</br>
</br>
On this topic, Miss Emma Watson is the ambassador for Future Biology's nutrient supply.</br>
</br>
"Correct!"</br>
</br>
She gently flipped up her curled hair, tiled her head, lifted her chin, and the standoffish vibe Emma Watson gave perfectly fitted with the mold of Hermione!</br>
</br>
Hmm, it was an odd way to say this, since she did play the role…</br>
</br>
"Oh! What a lucky guy! He received a kiss from Miss Jessica! I expressed my love with roses and a Ferrari but she won't even date me," a tall male enviously said.</br>
</br>
"It's only a peck, so what! Look, oh my, that's Oscar winner Jennifer Laurence! God, she is my idol!" The chubby man that came along exclaimed!</br>
</br>
"OH MY! It's true! She is here!" The tall guy looked over and jumped up in excitement.</br>
</br>
Just then, a middle-aged man who had been listening glared at the two who were indulging in the food and said expressionlessly, "What's exciting about this. This is a high class party. If Saudi's heir and B City Consortium are here, it is not odd for celebrities to come here…"</br>
</br>
The two didn't notice what he said. Another celebrity appeared and the tall male shouted to his friend.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen's charm is unbelievable!"</br>
</br>
"It is not Jiang Chen's charm, it is his money's charm. Without Future Group, he is nothing impressive…" The middle-aged male acted like he knew.</br>
</br>
The feeling of being overlooked was terrible. This time he raised his voice attempting to draw the attention of the two.</br>
</br>
An elder with champagne walked over before an intrigued expression appeared on his face. He stopped to interrupt.</br>
</br>
"Oh? I have a contrary opinion. I think without Jiang Chen, Future Group is nothing at all."</br>
</br>
"Foolish statement, I don't agree with your perspective. May I ask which company do you operate?" The middle-age man scorned in contempt.</br>
</br>
The old man thought for a moment and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"It is not convenient for me to say…"</br>
</br>
[Must be a random person that got in with their friend…]</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man was even more contempt. But he didn't realize that he was also not invited and came in because of his friend.</br>
</br>
But after he came in, he didn't manage to get to speak with Jiang Chen who was surrounded by the crowd. He didn't even manage to exchange business cards. Because of this, he was holding in some anger. He couldn't tell the brand of the suit the elder was wearing, so he thought it must be cheap…</br>
</br>
"Is it not convenient to say? It's okay, I have a tech company in Silicon Valley. I think I have some credibility in the tech field."</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man took out a business card from his pocket and put the card between his fingers in front of the elder.</br>
</br>
The elder scanned the address on the card and grinned, he didn't take the business card.</br>
</br>
"California Cosic Software Company? Interesting name."</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your compliment. We are in the process of our first round of financing. If we are successful, we will acquire 70 million in investment." The middle-aged man took back his card, his mouth formed a curvature.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? If we are just counting equity, First B City Bank is one of my assets," Carson Loki holding his champagne said while in thought.</br>
</br>
The business card didn't go back to his pocket, instead, it went into the champagne glass several inches out.</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man's wide open jaw could fit an entire egg as he just stared at the elder's face.</br>
</br>
"You, you are Carson Loki."</br>
</br>
[God, what did I just say to him!?]</br>
</br>
The middle-aged man's face turned pale white as he wanted to slap himself. He thought the elder looked familiar, but he didn't think he was Carson Loki.</br>
</br>
But Carson didn't bother with him and responded to his blank look with a procedural smile.</br>
</br>
"It is me. We only invest in companies with a future and don't participate in the operations of any company."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Meeting with VIPs, delivering speeches, coping with the compliments of the businessmen and celebrities, and being the host of the party; there were many things Jiang Chen must attend to.</br>
</br>
Despite it being busy, he didn't feel irritated at all.</br>
</br>
Why?</br>
</br>
Of course because…</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, allow me to introduce, this is my daughter Daisy. She has loved your culture from a very young age and views you as an idol. When she heard you were having a party, she begged me to bring her along." A Silicon Valley new energy automotive company president was keenly introducing his daughter.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, this is my business card. If you are interested in venture capital, please be sure to contact us, the Chicago Venture Company!"</br>
</br>
"I am the CEO of London Urban Construction Company. I heard that graphene can be used in the construction field. Is Mr. Jiang Chen interested? Here is my business card. We can invest together!"</br>
</br>
At this time, a blonde wearing a low-cut long dress with a gorgeous figure walked toward Jiang Chen. She leaned the champagne in her hand forward slightly and the bright red lip gloss reflected a seductive glow.</br>
</br>
"You can call me Scarlett, Mr. Jiang Chen. If you've seen The Avengers, you must have heard of my name."</br>
</br>
Scarlett's debut attracted a wave of whistles. The dream lover of countless men, dressed abnormally eye-catching today. In particular, the whiteness in front of her chest really made people think sensually.</br>
</br>
"Of course I have heard of Miss Johansson." Jiang Chen smiled and toasted with her.</br>
</br>
He certainly has heard the name, after all, she is the famous Black Widow. Not only have I heard your name, I have also seen your scandalous pictures…. Of course, Jiang Chen could think of the devilish words in his head.</br>
</br>
"You can call me Scarlett." Scarlett looked seductively at Jiang Chen while taking sips of the champagne.</br>
</br>
Because of the large number of guests, Jiang Chen didn't talk to the Hollywood Star for a long time. By procedure, Jiang Chen handed her a business card. After receiving his business card, Scarlett also gave out her own gift -</br>
</br>
An autograph sealed with a kiss.</br>
</br>
The back of the paper was written with the number 1071. Jiang Chen took a long time to realize that it was her room number at the Hot Spring Island Hotel?!</br>
</br>
What could the number on the back mean? The seduction is too obvious!</br>
</br>
Should he go or not?</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Five hours passed and Jiang Chen finally met with all the guests. In the cabin near the beach, he managed to find Robert and Nick. He enthusiastically dragged the two to the small bar by the beach, opened three bottles of champagne and drank with them while reminiscing the old times.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw Robert, he almost couldn't recognize him.</br>
</br>
Since last year's arms deal in South Africa, the two had not seen each other again. Compared to the original shrewd and capable appearance, he became chubbier. It was evident that his life in Hollywood has been great.</br>
</br>
</br>
The arms business was profitable, but the days as an arms merchant was not good.</br>
</br>
They not only brought death to war-torn areas, but walked on the knife's edge.</br>
</br>
Therefore, after being warned by the FBA, Robert decided to exit the business.</br>
</br>
Counting the money he made from Jiang Chen, he had over 100 million US dollar in assets. Although he wasn't in a great financial situation in the start with his overspending habit, the surprise hot box office in the movie he invested along with the last batch of arms being sold to Jiang Chen made him return to the life of a king.</br>
</br>
With money, he naturally didn't want to venture out anymore, and naturally he gained some weight.</br>
</br>
"Burp, sh*t, I sometimes feel like the world is too unfair. We are both rich, why did you not put on any weight, but I'm as fat as a pig now." Robert poured a cup for himself, shook his head, and sighed.</br>
</br>
"That's an exaggeration." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"You know me, buddy."</br>
</br>
"I mean, you are as fat as a bear now."</br>
</br>
"Sh*t!" Robert gave him the middle-finger while laughing.</br>
</br>
Nick was quiet as usual. The Slavic man just drank without participating much in the conversation.</br>
</br>
After several rounds, the topic changed from their life to the party.</br>
</br>
"Did you sense the passion from the Hollywood Superstars?" Robert had on a smirk.</br>
</br>
"Of course… but I don't understand why. I mean, I think they are overzealous?"</br>
</br>
"Because I released information on a paparazzi newspaper that the famous Hollywood director Christopher Nolan will shoot a documentary for the world's richest man. Future Group may enter Hollywood."</br>
</br>
[That's why so many male celebrities wanted to take photos with me. That's why so many females stars were flirting with me. It was Robert after all!]</br>
</br>
"That's fake news right?" Jiang Chen faceplamed.</br>
</br>
Future Group currently has no plan to enter Hollywood, at least for now.</br>
</br>
"I want to refer this as building up the hype." Robert exposed his teeth, but the smile still resembled a profiteer, "I took a year of time to figure out the inside-out of Hollywood. As long you use the media properly, even the worst film can have a one hundred million box office."</br>
</br>
"You're a genius. You're not realizing your potential by retiring too late." Jiang Chen said this heartfelt message.</br>
</br>
Robert shook his head, he took another sip of champagne and began to grin.</br>
</br>
"I spent thirty years making money I won't be able to spend in a life time, this is my value… This is some pretty good booze, where is it produced?"</br>
</br>
"Rothschild's gift."</br>
</br>
"Damn, I thought from the start you wouldn't be selling gold for your entire life, but I didn't expect to be so close with Rothschild already."</br>
</br>
"Haha, that's an exaggeration, we are just normal friends in the business world. On an other note, are you really not planning to un-retire? I still plan to go into the arms business."</br>
</br>
Robert burped and shook his hand, "Nope, I already made enough money and I don't want to suffer anymore. If I don't enjoy the money now, am I going to be doing philanthropy when I'm older?"</br>
</br>
"I see…" Jiang Chen felt it was a pity, but he accepted what Robert said.</br>
</br>
People have their own dreams and ambitions.</br>
</br>
"You should really enjoy your life now with money. We only really live in these thirty years. Investment in movies, sleeping with the Hollywood girls, play golf, sunbath on the beach… It is a waste to not enjoy it and just work. You have more money than me. You should know how to enjoy better than me." Robert full of alcohol patted Jiang Chen's shoulder and "educated" him.</br>
</br>
While his expression looked stern, Jiang Chen knew too well. When the not serious people become serious when drinking, that either means they are really drunk, or their words are from the bottom of their hearts.</br>
</br>
But to be honest, his proposal was really attractive.</br>
</br>
Especially to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem!"</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Coro Island, lab.</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan was organizing the experimental documents of the graphene materials.</br>
</br>
After saying goodbye to the scientist still working, he headed to the change room by the door.</br>
</br>
According to the laboratory's confidentiality system, any information after work hours must be archived in the designated area strictly in accordance with procedures. Going on and off work requires a security screening procedure with mobile phones, USBs, and all other electronic devices were restricted from entering and leaving the research site. Future Group's security measure for its research information was done to the extreme.</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan picked up his phone and headed to the parking lot.</br>
</br>
Just as he was about to start the car to go home, his phone vibrated.</br>
</br>
It was an email from his old friend.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Old Lu, the Noble Prize should be yours right?"</br>
</br>
Wang Botao, his university classmate from the same hometown. After graduation they both entered the Institute of Research in separate departments. Although Lu Yuan wasn't the most successful in the material science department, this friend of his always treated him well, and he has always been thankful.</br>
</br>
Even if he decided to leave in the end.</br>
</br>
A smile emerged on Lu Yuan's face. It would be untruthful to say he did not feel proud from his friend's compliment. He tapped a few times on the screen and send an message back.</br>
</br>
"I just got named, it is not determined yet."</br>
</br>
Beep-</br>
</br>
The message went through. Just as he was about to close his phone, his friend instantly replied.</br>
</br>
"I'm at the beach restaurant, the one by the west coast, want to have a drink with me?"</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan was surprised, he replied immediately.</br>
</br>
"You're in Xin?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. Do you not want to have a drink?"</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan's fingers hung in the air, after hesitating for a moment, he typed a few words on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Wait for me… if we are only having a drink."</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan drove to the west coast, parked the car, looked at the crowd of people, took a deep breath, and walked to the restaurant.</br>
</br>
Instinct told him that his old friend was not here just to catch up and must have other intentions. But even then, he should still meet him after he had traveled so far.</br>
</br>
Inside the restaurant, he scanned the crowded place before seeing his friend in the corner waving at him.</br>
</br>
Wang Botao patted him on the shoulder after they met and said joyously.</br>
</br>
"Haha, are you surprised to see me? Hello, please grab us two beers!"</br>
</br>
"This guy, why didn't you tell me you were going to come?" Lu Yuan complained to his friend after he sat across from him. Then he picked up the menu, "Dinner is on me, feel free."</br>
</br>
"No need, I already ordered everything. You're a busy person and it is great you still remember me, how could I let you treat me! Don't think about the bill, I already paid!" Wang Botao shook the bill in his hand and stuffed it into his pocket.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Who pays before eating!" Lu Yuan complained but had to settle.</br>
</br>
Quickly, the dishes began to arrive. After a few beers, the conservation began to flow. Since he remembered Jiang Chen's words at heart, Lu Yuan was afraid to drink too much. He did not mention anything related to his work and just chatted about his life.</br>
</br>
But to Lu Yuan's surprise, Wang Baotao didn't try to subtly ask about the graphene project. He really did look like he was here for fun and decided to catch up with his friend.</br>
</br>
Just as Lu Yuan felt relived at the fact that he no longer need to be bothered with how to reject his friend's request, Wang Baotao suddenly said.</br>
</br>
"Old Yuan."</br>
</br>
"Eh."</br>
</br>
"I always have been wondering that with the way I call you Old Yuan (Old Yuan in Chinese refers to be suffering from injustice), did I call all of your luck away?"</br>
</br>
"Why is that?" Lu Yuan took a sip.</br>
</br>
"When you were in the institute before, the director of your department always threw you the most difficult project. If you had any success, he always put his name at the front. If the project didn't have any results, then he used your name as a scapegoat…"</br>
</br>
"Sigh, let's not mention the things in the past, let it go!" Lu Yuan waved his hand in dismissal.</br>
</br>
After being named for the Nobel Prize, his mentality completely changed. The reason why he left was because of the injustice he received at the institute and he no longer wanted to be treated without any respect. So he decided to accept the olive branch from Future Group in the hope that he could make a name for himself and prove to the people that prevented him from being promoted his real worth.</br>
</br>
But when he knew that he was named for the Nobel Prize with countless media reporting him, he became peaceful.</br>
</br>
The feeling was as if he just ascended and everything that happened in that "small circle" no longer mattered.</br>
</br>
Then, Wang Baotao abruptly said.</br>
</br>
"Director Li has been put on leave."</br>
</br>
"Put on leave? Why?" Lu Yuan was shocked.</br>
</br>
"Dereliction of duty .This poor sucker's graduation thesis turned out to be a fraud, Commission for Discipline Inspection came in, and disciplined the no doers. This happened a few days ago." Wang Baotao smiled. "There is a sucker that followed Director Li who is found to have used the advantage of his position in exchange for favors. He is now in prison too. I remember that you didn't like both of them before.</br>
</br>
[Is that so?]</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan wanted to say something, but when he met his friend's grin, his words were stuck in his throat. After he chewed on the words for a bit, he said something else.</br>
</br>
"Is it because of me?"</br>
</br>
Wang Baotao didn't respond to the question, but instead looked seriously at him.</br>
</br>
"The Director of Material Science Institute position is now open. The country needs you."</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan got up, Wang Baotao dragged him down.</br>
</br>
"Don't leave just yet, just let me finish."</br>
</br>
"Old Wang, we are friends, I don't want you to be the lobbyist."</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan insisted on leaving, but Wang Baotao tightly held onto him.</br>
</br>
"Old Yuan, I agree that the institute has treated you unfairly on a lot of things! But please give us a chance to make it up to you! People at the top knew about what happened and the superior placed great emphasis on taking out the no doers inside the institute to clear your name! The people that took your results before will be punished. If you have anything, just tell us—"</br>
</br>
"Is it because I was named for the Nobel Prize that the superiors finally knew what happened?" Lu Yuan stared at him, coldly.</br>
</br>
Wang Baotao was speechless, then he finally said something.</br>
</br>
"… Why does that matter? It is the nature of the environment."</br>
</br>
"Of course it matters. I see arrogance."</br>
</br>
Wang Baotao's expression froze on his face and he awkwardly said, "You can't say that."</br>
</br>
"I'll repay kindness with kindness. If you mention this further, we can't be friends anymore."</br>
</br>
Lu Yuan broke free from his friend and headed for the door without turning his head.</br>
</br>
Walking on the edge of the Hot Springs Island beach, the evening breeze passed by, the coconut palm trees swayed with a sizzling sound.</br>
</br>
Stepping on the smooth sand, Jiang Chen held the phone while listening to the Ghost Agent's report.</br>
</br>
"… Lu Yuan's performance?"</br>
</br>
"Refused harshly." Zhu Yu replied.</br>
</br>
"Excellent." A smile emerged.</br>
</br>
[He didn't trust the wrong people.]</br>
</br>
Nobel Prize nomination and access to graphene technology, Han will without a doubt send people to persuade him to go back. However, he should know who gave him this honor.</br>
</br>
"How are we going to take care of Wang Baotao?"</br>
</br>
"Investigate his visa. Find a reason to deport him and put him on the blacklist," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
He was just a director from the institute and not a spy attempting to steal information. Based on the consideration of the two countries' diplomatic relationship, it was better to keep this toned down. A deportation would be enough to warn them.</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"… Future Group is dedicated to developing for the future. I want to say, future is not a noun, but a way of thinking. We have a flexible work environment and efficient work method. We value everyone's thoughts and we won't overlook anyone and any talent. If you're interested in becoming the future, please join us!"</br>
</br>
"Cut!"</br>
</br>
After the end of the interview, Jiang Chen was relived and looked to the directing Christopher Nolan; he changed from a serious to a lighthearted expression.</br>
</br>
"No good?"</br>
</br>
"No, this is perfect!" Christopher raised his thumb.</br>
</br>
In the documentary, Jiang Chen only appeared for five minutes. But to prepare for this five minutes, he took an hour of repeated attempts. It was no wonder Christopher won the best script at the Oscars and was a Golden Globe winning director. Not only did he possess a wild imagination, his strive for excellence was beyond strict.</br>
</br>
Even if Jiang Chen invested in the film, he didn't compromise on the quality.</br>
</br>
The documentary's duration totaled 70 minutes. 20 minutes of the lavishness of the celebration party, 40 minutes introducing the departments at Future Group and the day's work, and 10 minutes on the culture and belief of the firm.</br>
</br>
Even if it was just a documentary, Christopher managed to make it into a Hollywood film! Jiang Chen thought it was indeed worth the ten million when he saw the film.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also prepared fully for the promotion of the film.</br>
</br>
Other than Future Group's owned channel, he not only reached a promotion agreement with renowned video websites such as YouTube, he also rented the screens at Times Square for two weeks. The ten million dollar documentary… or advertisement would be played repetitively at the "World's Intersection" landmark.</br>
</br>
The effect of the promotion was obvious. Compared to the past year, Future Group's applicants increased substantially in November.</br>
</br>
The long term impact could not be deduced yet. However, with the passage of time, Future Group will continue to build its influence among the people. This branding effect will not only be reflected in the applicants' job choice, but also on the production selection from the consumers.</br>
</br>
In YouTube's comment section, some people did the math to see how much the documentary costed from filming to promotion; the number somehow reached 15 million USD!</br>
</br>
All the netizens cried "spoiled" with how much Future Group spent on a documentary.</br>
</br>
"Is there a point spending so much on a documentary?"</br>
</br>
"Damn, the single episode price has to be some form of record!"</br>
</br>
"Just give me the money instead. I can make one with ten thousand."</br>
</br>
"OP, do you think you are worth as much as Nolan?"</br>
</br>
"Wait, shouldn't we be focusing on Future Group in the documentary? Paid vacation, flexible work environment, generous compensation, real estate in Penglai after five years! … MY GOD, my job is sh*t in comparison!"</br>
</br>
</br>
"…"</br>
</br>
At the same time, a lot of newspapers and magazines were predicting if Future Group move meant they will be entering the entertainment industry. Virtual reality + movie? It would be a fantastic concept with investors all eyeing Warner Bros.</br>
</br>
With Nolan and Jiang Chen's personal relationship, if Future Group were to make a move, Warner Bros would most likely be a partner!"</br>
</br>
The day after the rumor, Warner Bro's parent company Times Warner's stock price spiked to a market cap of 62.7 billion USD. Wall Street analysts first introduced the effect as "Future Effect".</br>
</br>
Without the interference of a major capital or negative press, any company that has existing partnership or potential partnership with Future Group will push the company's stock price up 5-10 points.</br>
</br>
And this observation received agreement from Buffet. But the wise and shrewd investor stated, "I don't disagree with Future Group's new impact on the stock indices. We are in an evolutionary era with a tech giant rising, just like Cisco and Microsoft before. But I do have to warn everyone, investing based on hype is unwise…"</br>
</br>
Is Future Group interested in the entertainment industry?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't before, but after his discussion with Robert, he changed his mind.</br>
</br>
Future Group has neither background in film production nor experience in the entertainment industry, but they possess the most essential element of the entertainment industry.</br>
</br>
Channel!</br>
</br>
By the end of November, Phantom had over 600 million users worldwide. The lack of VR development experience by major corporations and combined with users concentrated on Future Technology's product…</br>
</br>
It would be waste if they didn't use the massive channel. Tencent had been developing a pan-entertainment strategy. However, Future Group can also do it, and do it better!</br>
</br>
On the fifth day after the completion of the documentary, Jiang Chen paid Nolan the ten million in salary. Before he took his team back to UA, Jiang Chen invited him for lunch.</br>
</br>
During lunch, Jiang Chen naturally led the conservation to Hollywood.</br>
</br>
"I have seen many movies but I don't know Hollywood too well, could Mr. Nolan give me an overview?"</br>
</br>
"Is Mr. Jiang Chen interested in investing in movies?" Nolan was elated.</br>
</br>
"The movie industry is one of the rings in our pan-entertainment strategy, and I'm personally interested in sci-fi films." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Warner Bros possess a wealth of scripts, actors and actresses, and directors. If you're interested, we can totally partner up in this area!" Nolan immediately began to sell his company.</br>
</br>
Warner Brother Entertainment is one of the largest movie and entertainment producers in the world. It's massive size meant that they didn't desperately need to search for investors. Christopher as the director who produced the legendary one billion dollar box office indeed wasn't relying on investors.</br>
</br>
Warner Brothers would love to utilize Future Group's promotion channel and the almost magical virtual reality system.</br>
</br>
If virtual reality could be used in special effect animation, or even movie production or film experience, it would completely change the movie industry. Warner Brothers, who will be the first producer to utilize virtual reality in his film, will make history!</br>
</br>
Nolan's eyes turned brighter the more he thought about it.</br>
</br>
The opportunity of a generation was within his grasp!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 686: VR + Movie</br>
</div></br>
</br>
What Jiang Chen said didn't fall short of Nolan's expectations.</br>
</br>
"Of course I'm interested, but we want to have some autonomy over the selection of the script and actors!"</br>
</br>
"Umm… you're planning to invite Warner Brothers to film another documentary for you?" Nolan's expression looked awkward.</br>
</br>
His hope was for Future Group to provide the channel and filming technology; he didn't plan on filming another "documentary." His company, Warner Brothers, definitely wouldn't agree unless Future Group offered enough to forget their dignity.</br>
</br>
"You misinterpreted me." Jiang Chen smiled. "The autonomy I'm referring to isn't deciding on the script, but we should both make the decision. In the filming of the movie, we plan to use virtual reality technology. But since this is the first time virtual reality technology is going to be used in movie filming, the script has to be stricter in order to demonstrate the powerful effects of the technology. We can't use the special effects of Interstellar to film Village Love Story (1) right?"</br>
</br>
[What's Village Love Story?]</br>
</br>
Nolan took some time to process and understood what Jiang Chen meant before he nodded.</br>
</br>
"I know what you mean. You can rest assured on this - Warner Brothers has a wealth of script resources. It's not difficult to select a quality sci-fi piece."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"I definitely trust your company's abilities, but while you work on the script, we'll provide some scripts for reference. The ultimate decision will be yours. You're the director after all, and I trust your abilities."</br>
</br>
"It's my honor then," Nolan joked.</br>
</br>
After the initial partnership was proposed, the details would be discussed by representatives sent from Warner Brothers.</br>
</br>
After saying goodbye, Jiang Chen headed straight to Future Building to see Xia Shiyu. He asked a question the moment he saw her.</br>
</br>
"How are our programmers-in-training doing?"</br>
</br>
As early as the second round of internal testing for Godly Land, Future Technology hired a group of programmers and animation artists to receive training at Future Group's headquarters on virtual reality programming and model building. The programmers in the apocalypse were lacking and the modern world couldn't always rely on the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
It was unpractical for less than one hundred programmers to provide services for billions of people.</br>
</br>
They have to learn how to fly eventually.</br>
</br>
"They mostly passed the technical training test. There are currently 31 people who are working in Future Technology and currently conducting maintenance for the virtual reality social media platform," Xia Shiyu replied.</br>
</br>
"Excellent. Select 50 people from our talent reserves and form Virtual Image Animation Production company!"</br>
</br>
"Animation production?" Xia Shiyu said, confused. "Are we trying to compete with Disney?"</br>
</br>
"No, our competition is Industrial Light &amp; Magic," said Jiang Chen with a smile. "Virtual Image's primary focus will be on VR film production, movie special effects, 3D animation, and game animation. The company will be a direct subsidiary of Future Group and the first project will be providing updates for Godly Land."</br>
</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
Godly Land's updates had always been provided by the mysterious "scientific research institution." It had been two years and Xia Shiyu hadn't even had a glimpse of that mysterious institution. It was impossible for her not to worry.</br>
</br>
Now that Future Group was rising internationally, if the mysterious "scientific research institution" suddenly stopped providing technical support for Future Group, the building would likely be on the brink of collapse.</br>
</br>
Therefore, to master independent programming, scientific and technological research, and developmental capabilities were the top priorities for Future Technology. Even though Jiang Chen repeatedly promised Xia Shiyu there would be no problems, relying solely on an organization she had never seen before was too risky from any perspective!</br>
</br>
After Xia Shiyu confirmed the focus of Virtual Image Animation Production Company, she immediately began working to establish the subsidiary.</br>
</br>
Her execution abilities had always been impeccable!</br>
</br>
On the second day, she finished drafting the operation plan and broke the subsidiary into five major functional departments making a total of 14 departments. She also selected the candidate for the CEO of the company.</br>
</br>
The plan was uploaded to Jean's Office on the company server and was audited by Jiang Chen's artificial intelligence assistant. The details were adjusted based on references from the apocalypse. Finally, Jiang Chen finalized the plan!</br>
</br>
Virtual Image, with 14 departments, didn't have just 50 people, but those 50 people made up the core technical team of the company! For the talents Future Group lacked, Jiang Chen used the simplest and most straightforward method.</br>
</br>
He solved it with money.</br>
</br>
They headhunted from Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Pixar and acquired small to mid-sized CG production companies with potential. With Future Group's strong funding, Virtual Image quickly formed a 300-person team.</br>
</br>
Their animation film with 100 million US dollars registered capital became a topic of interest in the industry.</br>
</br>
The second day after Virtual Image completed its structure, Warner Brothers' representatives arrived at Coro and participated in negotiations with Future Technology.</br>
</br>
This move certainly caught the attention of Hollywood reporters. The news of a potential partnership between Warner Brothers and Future Technology instantly made headlines across major news platforms and dominated both entertainment and business sections!</br>
</br>
The announcement published on Warner Brothers' site confirmed the validity of the speculations.</br>
</br>
The film was expected to use new VR film technology and would be led by famous director Christopher Nolan. People were all speculating about what kind of powerful film the partnership of a tech giant and entertainment conglomerate would bring to the movie addicts.</br>
</br>
Inside a movie forum, a sci-fi fan posted:</br>
</br>
"There's no need to guess - it must be a sci-fi! With Nolan's abilities combined with Future Technology's technology, it would be a waste not to film a sci-fi!"</br>
</br>
But most action film fanatics didn't like that idea.</br>
</br>
"That might not be the case. Since Hollywood's sci-fi only makes up a small portion of the market, perhaps Warner Bros will make Nolan do a DC movie. Batman Prequel X? Just the thought of it is amazing!"</br>
</br>
"Okay, I agree that VR is great for action films, but won't it be even better in a sci-fi film?! I saw the player-created Godly Land film - the effects were phenomenal!"</br>
</br>
"Are you sure you didn't mistake Nolan for Jackson?"</br>
</br>
Just as the movie fanatics were arguing, a message on Future 1.0 ended all discussion.</br>
</br>
It was a sci-fi film!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 687: Thank you for supporting me till the end</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On Academy Drive in San Fran, young and energized faces filled and crowded the street. On this lovely weekend, even the most hardworking students who spent the majority of their days inside the library and lab decided to spend some quality time with their friends outside.</br>
</br>
At a coffee shop at the corner of the street, a young-looking barista hustled between the coffee tables. Under his black hair was a clean and handsome face. His black pupils were profoundly unsuited to his age and had a deepness contrasting the brightness outside the window.</br>
</br>
His eyes quickly met with a pair of green eyes.</br>
</br>
"Do you have to leave?"</br>
</br>
Bathing in the sunshine scattered through the window, her blonde hair was bright. Her watery eyes expressed a longing for him to stay, but he couldn't respond to her message.</br>
</br>
Li Ming dodged her eyes, let out a sigh, and gently put the coffee cup on the table.</br>
</br>
"Sorry, Louise. Something happened to my family and they can no longer afford to support me studying aboard…"</br>
</br>
His father was a Doctor at the Han Academy of Science. His father's work inspired him from an early age and he possessed an extraordinary talent in science. He had always been interested in science. While reading relevant science books, he also wrote articles.</br>
</br>
After completing high school, he was admitted to San Fran State University from his excellent TOEFL and SAT scores and he majored in bioengineering. However, close to the end of graduation, bad news came from his family.</br>
</br>
Three years ago, to cover his expensive tuition, his father, who was humble and honest, collected a sum of money that shouldn't be collected and helped a person who shouldn't be helped… Normally speaking, it wasn't a big deal, but the person he got involved with was Director Li at the Material Science Research Institute.</br>
</br>
A week ago, the higher-ups suddenly ordered the Han Academy of Sciences to thoroughly investigate the rats in the system; Director Li was immediately sacked along with a large number of others. It seemed to be related to the Nobel Prize-winning nominee, which received scrutiny from the top and even alerted the Commission for Discipline Inspection.</br>
</br>
The original minor problems were magnified. If his mother hadn't used up their family savings, his father wouldn't just be facing an investigation but would already be thrown in jail. In order to settle the matter, the family spent six hundred thousand already.</br>
</br>
The family had no money to support him anymore...</br>
</br>
The eyes of the girl called Louise slowly became wet.</br>
</br>
"Are you going to give up three years of school and give up… on me?"</br>
</br>
Li Ming was afraid to meet her determined eyes. He quietly said,</br>
</br>
"Sorry, you're a good girl. I'm not good enough for you."</br>
</br>
Working part-time in the coffee shop wasn't enough to support him in his last year of school.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing his answer, the sadness in Louise's eyes was replaced by determination.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I don't need your apology!"</br>
</br>
Then she slapped a newspaper on the table and stared directly into Li Ming's eyes.</br>
</br>
"I already signed you up. I read the novels you wrote before - you have the ability to compete in this!"</br>
</br>
"This is...?" Li Ming paused for a second as he looked at the newspaper and read its headline.</br>
</br>
But what attracted him wasn't the headline; it was the following sentences.</br>
</br>
The deadline for submission is within one week with an unlimited number of words. Works that have been published are not excluded as long as proof of copyright is provided.</br>
</br>
Interested parties can submit their scripts on Future Technology's official site!&gt;</br>
</br>
[One million US dollars, if I have this money ...]</br>
</br>
Li Ming was moved by the opportunity, but he then shook his head.</br>
</br>
With such an attractive price, all the sci-fi authors around the world would try for it. He was just a casual writer. While he shared his work on sci-fi forums before and although he had published his work in magazines back home, he had no courage to compete in this world-class competition.</br>
</br>
Even if he did submit his work, it would be forgotten in the flood of submissions.</br>
</br>
"Are you just going to give up?" Louise gazed at him.</br>
</br>
"This isn't about giving up or not." Rather than gambling on the probability, it was better to buy the lottery.</br>
</br>
"So you're not willing to even try?"</br>
</br>
Her voice smashed the hesitation in Li Ming's chest.</br>
</br>
[That's right…]</br>
</br>
[Am I afraid to even try now?]</br>
</br>
[I arrogantly said that I want to become a world-famous writer, have my work translated into 12 languages, and stand proudly atop the Hugo Awards podium! Now, however, an opportunity is in front of me and in the face of an opportunity that may change my destiny, I don't have the courage to reach for it…]</br>
</br>
"I…"</br>
</br>
Louise watched him. She held his hand and gave him the courage through her warmth. "I saw your novel. It was the first time I was fascinated by science fiction. You know, I never read those types of stories before. "</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Looking back at her encouraging eyes, Li Ming's eyes no longer had any hesitation. A bright expression returned to his face and he dropped the tray in his arms.</br>
</br>
"Go now. I'll tell your boss that you quit."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Li Ming nodded sincerely and ran out.</br>
</br>
He only had one week, so every second was valuable. After he dashed back to his apartment, he slammed the door shut and locked himself in the small room. He dragged out a paper box from under his bed that held countless scripts he wrote before.</br>
</br>
There were short stories and long publications.</br>
</br>
He opened his computer, forced himself to enter "the zone" in the shortest amount of time, and placed the scripts in front of him.</br>
</br>
He knew if he submitted a casual script to the contest, he had no chance of winning at all. But were these scripts useless? No! It was because of these scripts that his perspective on sci-fi was consolidated. Every single word contained within these scripts were written with his heart. just like the bricks that built the skyscraper in his heart.</br>
</br>
In that week, he locked himself in his room. Aside from going to the washroom and eating, he didn't leave his room at all. His fingers typed furiously on his keyboard, leaving shadows behind. Without any other thought in his mind, he felt his mind was flowing.</br>
</br>
The scenes appeared in his stories before; now he just needed to piece them together into a complete picture.</br>
</br>
And gamble on his destiny.</br>
</br>
Finally, when the seventh ray of sunshine scattered through the blinds, he typed the last period, looked up with his panda-like eyes, and stared at the clock on the wall.</br>
</br>
Five hours left before the deadline. He did it!</br>
</br>
He copied and pasted the story before he clicked submit. 300 thousand words in a week far exceeded his limits, but when he managed to complete this feat, he only felt calm and at peace.</br>
</br>
"Name: Time Curtain</br>
</br>
"Submission Completed"</br>
</br>
Regardless of the outcome, he already exerted all his efforts. He just wanted to turn off the light and sleep.</br>
</br>
But before he could walk to the bed, he dozed off on the table…</br>
</br>
Two weeks of dreadful waiting.</br>
</br>
Finally, he received an email from Future Technology. With inexplicable and complicated emotions, he clicked on the email with trembling fingers.</br>
</br>
When he saw the first line of words on the email, his heartbeat stopped.</br>
</br>
His eyes teared up.</br>
</br>
His mother taught him from a young age that men shouldn't cry easily. But despite knowing that, tears uncontrollably rolled down and splashed onto the floor.</br>
</br>
He took out his phone and called Louise.</br>
</br>
"Meet me at the coffee shop… I have something I want to tell you in person."</br>
</br>
There was a long silence over the phone.</br>
</br>
"Wait for me."</br>
</br>
Louise hung up.</br>
</br>
He took a shower, changed into clean clothes, and his weariness was swept away. He pushed open the door and bathed under the bright sunshine once again. Under the blue sky and white clouds, it felt somewhat reminiscent to him. Everything on the street shifted from black and white to color; he saw the beauty of life again.</br>
</br>
He stopped a taxi.</br>
</br>
When he got into the taxi, he called his mother to tell her not to worry about his tuition. It wouldn't be much longer before he would receive a large sum of money. Not only could he afford his tuition and living expenses, but he could also send money home… [Don't worry, it wasn't unclean money. It was my reward.]</br>
</br>
The taxi stopped at the coffee shop.</br>
</br>
The moment he got out of the car, he saw a youthful and beautiful figure.</br>
</br>
Louise hopped on him and buried herself in his arms.</br>
</br>
"Don't say anything. If you have to leave… I'll go with you."</br>
</br>
"No, no need." Li Ming shook his head as he stared into her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Why?" Louise's eyes were immediately filled with tears of sorrow.</br>
</br>
"Because…" Suddenly, his face was covered with a beautiful smile. "I won!"</br>
</br>
The two tightly embraced each other. Tears rolled down, but they weren't out of sorrow.</br>
</br>
Thank you, thank you for supporting me till the end…</br>
</br>
"You bastard, I thought…" Louise punched him tearfully.</br>
</br>
Li Ming let her tears and fists hit him on the chest. Tears also rolled down his face, but he was smiling.</br>
</br>
"Future Technology invited us to the signing and ceremony on Coro Island. They'll provide us with the tickets. Louise, will you go with me?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, I will!"</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Future Technology's allure was indeed unprecedented. The company received 170281 scripts which were equivalent to the listings on some web novel sites.</br>
</br>
Of course, it wasn't just Future Technology's name - the one million in prizes also played a role.</br>
</br>
The massive number of documents meant it was impossible to manually complete the review process. It was time for Jiang Chen's "assistant".</br>
</br>
For Jean, there was no inherent difference between 170281 and 1782. The computation speed of the quantum computer could read through billions of words in an instant.</br>
</br>
The only problematic thing was that because she was just intermediate artificial intelligence, while she had the ability to think, she didn't possess any human emotions.</br>
</br>
Without emotions, she obviously wouldn't understand the beauty hidden inside the words and it would be impossible for her to rate the submissions. She could only filter the text based on the settings Jiang Chen set.</br>
</br>
Anything less than 100 thousand words were eliminated. It was too difficult to rewrite that into a script with a plot that could fill a three-hour film.</br>
</br>
Works over one million words were also removed. He was planning to make a movie, not a drama series.</br>
</br>
Works with more than 50 grammatical errors, awkward logic, and obvious plot holes were among the factors considered; only a few thousand works remained after that. Of course, there might've been gold dusted out along with the sand, but the quality of the remaining works would definitely be of higher quality.</br>
</br>
The first round of selections took five seconds, but the second round took two weeks!</br>
</br>
With Nolan's lead, Warner Brothers employees began to manually review the English. Chinese works were the responsibility of Future Group.</br>
</br>
In order to be fair and open, Warner Brothers invited the World Science Fiction Association, which was the sponsor of the Hugo Awards, to participate in the selection process. Of course, the opinions of the judges were only for reference and did not have a direct impact on the results of the selection process.</br>
</br>
After two weeks of selection.</br>
</br>
Finally, after much anticipation, Future Technology and Warner Brothers jointly announced their winners on the official website. All winners would be reimbursed for their airfare expenses to attend a grand award ceremony on Coro Island and sign with Future Technology.</br>
</br>
At the end of the ceremony, Jiang Chen went to see Nolan.</br>
</br>
A total of ten works were selected, but they still needed to discuss to select the top work.</br>
</br>
The entire event costed a total of 15 million US dollar to select the right screenplay. Future Technology's willingness to invest certainly made Mr. Nolan feel immense pressure. When they met, he said:</br>
</br>
"If we were just trying to create hype, didn't we invest too much?"</br>
</br>
"But from the results, our reward is satisfying, isn't it?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
</br>
Nolan revealed a helpless expression. "I can't disagree on that point, and on that point alone."</br>
</br>
In all the works submitted to Future Technology, there were pieces of some emerging writers as well as some novels that had been popular for a long time and had a high demand for an adaptation. Obviously, it wasn't only fans of science fiction films but science fiction writers' enthusiasm for this open contest was also frivolous.</br>
</br>
As they went through the list from the top, Jiang Chen exchanged opinions with Nolan, one by one.</br>
</br>
"What about 'Civilization' by Ian M. Banks? The most famous space opera science fiction in the 1980s."</br>
</br>
"It's too difficult to adapt a series of novels." Nolan shrugged bluntly.</br>
</br>
"Then what about the 'Dust in God's Eyes'? Larry Neven's story of the first contact between humans and extraterrestrial intelligent creatures is very interesting. The expedition team, composed of naval officers and soldiers, and businessmen and scientists, was also exciting. Their approach of: 'In the case of contact with nonhuman intelligent creatures, we must assume the other side is hostile' is also quite interesting."</br>
</br>
"That book is on my shortlist." Nolan laughed.</br>
</br>
"Haha, can you tell me about the lucky ones on your list?"</br>
</br>
"In addition to this, there's 'the Fire on the Abyss.' I used to discuss the possibility of adapting this science fiction masterpiece with my younger brother Jonathan, but we finally decided we couldn't film this.</br>
</br>
"Not possible to do it?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. The scale of the universe described in this book is too great. Three worlds and countless races - even Industrial Light and Magic can't recreate the essence of this work." Nolan looked at Jiang with eyes full of hope. "Could Virtual Image's VR imaging technology do it?"</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard Nolan's question, his mouth twitched.</br>
</br>
"There's no problem in theory, but three worlds ... the production cycle is probably going to be quite long."</br>
</br>
Nolan also knew his proposal was impossible, so he sighed.</br>
</br>
"That's really a pity ..."</br>
</br>
But when he went down the list, he stumbled on an unfamiliar name.</br>
</br>
"'Time Curtain' - what's this?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, this, ah, I was planning to recommend this to you," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Author ... Li Ming?" Christopher furrowed his brows as he had never heard of the name.</br>
</br>
Although the works weren't rigidly attached to the authors'names, since he never heard this name before, he instinctively donned his tinted glasses.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't mind and began to introduce the plot.</br>
</br>
"This book is on my list of candidates. Although the writing and character shaping aren't as carefully crafted, the depth of thought is unexpectedly at a masters level, and the point of view is also very fascinating. In 2070, the world's climate is no longer suitable for human survival, nor is the world's space weather. The International Astronautics Federation launched a colonization ship called 'Borderlands,' heading for Kepler 22b 600 lightyears away."</br>
</br>
"Because of the slow effects of the speed of light, when the Borderlands arrived on Kepler 22b, tens of thousands of years had passed since they left. When they entered this alien land, they discovered the ruins of human civilization and alien species. Evidence suggested that a second colonization ship was launched by the International Astronautic Federation a year after 2070. They just didn't know why they were ahead on the time scale and had long disappeared."</br>
</br>
"The extraterrestrial civilization on the planet was still in its infancy, but whether it was indigenous peoples who were enlightened by the remnants of human civilization or those who came from earth themselves wasn't known. What was even more interesting are the later stories. The conflicts and suspense are carefully orchestrated. I won't spoil things for you; you should read it yourself."</br>
</br>
"Just from your description, this story is certainly interesting. But how did you pick this book out of so many works?" Nolan asked.</br>
</br>
"I didn't choose this, but my assistant recommended it to me," Jiang replied.</br>
</br>
This confused Jiang Chen the most.</br>
</br>
What logic did Jean, without a concept of emotion or aesthetics, use to recommend him this piece? Jiang Chen asked Jean before, but Jean couldn't answer the question. She only used a vague and humane way to respond to the question: "Because it's interesting?"</br>
</br>
Although the theme was impressive, it wasn't stellar by definition. The concept of time wasn't a novel concept in the sci-fi world. While the topic escalated to a discussion of civilization, this point didn't add too much complexity.</br>
</br>
But after reading the work, Jiang Chen had to admit that Jean didn't lie to him; the work was indeed fascinating.</br>
</br>
"It's too early to make a decision. I'll go back, read this book and I'll give you a reply tomorrow." Then Nolan stood up and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I'm looking forward to your good news." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Nolan raised his eyebrows and jokingly whispered.</br>
</br>
"I've always been picky with the script."</br>
</br>
"Believe me, you'll love it."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 689: An Unexpected Visitor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It wasn't until three days later that Nolan gave Jiang Chen a reply.</br>
</br>
"I made my decision! Jonathan and I both felt the novel is spectacular, and he's already begun adapting the script. It's incredible that an unknown author could actually write such an amazing piece!"</br>
</br>
Jonathan was Christopher's younger brother, but he also a well-known Hollywood screenwriter. The movie "Momento" directed by Christopher was based on the short story "Memento Mori," written by Jonathan. In 2002, Jonathan also won the 74th Academy Awards best original screenwriter due to the movie. The adaptations of the script and his brother's film had a common denominator.</br>
</br>
Dark themes!</br>
</br>
Incredibly dark and depressing themes!</br>
</br>
Whether it was Dark Knight or Interstellar, dark themes ran through the films. It was because of the impact on viewers' minds that drew viewers into the world they created.</br>
</br>
While Jiang Chen was surprised by the contrasting attitude Nolan had for Time Curtain, he didn't probe further. Time Curtain was on his shortlist to begin with, and the fact that it was a Han work also made him pleased.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Virtual Image began to create VR scenes for Kepler 22b, Borderlands, and Aliens. Filming would be done in a VR environment and not the traditional "green screen" film set in which actors had to use their imaginations.</br>
</br>
Hans Zimmer was responsible for the soundtrack. He was the film score composer behind the masterpiece soundtracks of Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, and other well-known masterpieces. It would be his sixth collaboration with Nolan.</br>
</br>
While the cast hadn't been determined, the screenwriter, director, and soundtrack would use the original team from Interstellar.</br>
</br>
According to the contract signed between Warner Brothers and Future Technology, the film would be co-funded by both parties. It was expected that the adaptation of the script would be completed in mid-December, while filming would begin after Christmas.</br>
</br>
In the face of journalists and fanatical fans, Nolan made an announcement in front of the camera.</br>
</br>
"You probably haven't heard of the novel Time Curtain, but that's not relevant. You must've heard about me and my brother's names. Believe me, I won't let you down. I can't disclose the details of the film, but one thing I can tell you is that Virtual Image Company will create a universe for our movie!"</br>
</br>
The cheers of the crowd displayed the people's enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
For a joint investment blockbuster with Warner Brothers, Jiang Chen himself was full of expectations!</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Facts proved that entertainment news would always have more market than serious news.</br>
</br>
Before Christmas, the internet hotly debated which movie stars would star in Time Curtain. It got to the point that news of Future Heavy Industrial world's first supercomputer graphene chip outperforming Intel, and Qualcomm and other well-known international chip makers was ignored by the public.</br>
</br>
</br>
Perhaps the media and public were already accustomed to incredible outcomes from Future Group so it was no surprise they were leading the graphene chip race. Production quietly started, with the first batch of 100 thousand ultra-chips fitted onto the shipping vessel headed for the port of Wanghai.</br>
</br>
It wasn't until then that the Western media finally realized.</br>
</br>
The chip embargo that the UA imposed on Hua was thus silently broken.</br>
</br>
However, this infuriated Intel. When the UA Department of Commerce announced the embargo, Kozic expressed doubts that the embargo was simply meaningless; a unilateral embargo would only force Hua to independently develop ultra-chips as well as force Intel to lose Hua Supercomputer Center orders.</br>
</br>
And his concerns had become a reality.</br>
</br>
The Dragon Cavalry X1 ultra-chip not only broke the UA embargo but also ended the country's long-term dependence on the UA ultra-chip. At the same time, Future Heavy Industrial providing Godson Technology with the lix architecture would also completely change the bipolar pattern of the processor market dominated by x86, ARM architecture.</br>
</br>
In addition, according to rumors, after the Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou announced the operation efficiency of Tianhe No.2 after the "change core," the Dragon Calgary X1 immediately drew the attention of Switzerland. Currently, Future Heavy Industrial was negotiating with the Swiss National Supercomputer Center (CSCS) to provide orders for its creation of the fastest supercomputer center in Europe.</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industrial had begun to seize Intel's market share in Europe!</br>
</br>
Kozic, who just received the graphene technology patent license, began to feel uneasy again. If Intel didn't work hard, it was likely to face the same outcome as Kodak.</br>
</br>
A strong sense of urgency had given birth to newer technologies. In mid-December, Intel held a press conference announcing the first graphene chips based on X86-derived architecture would be used in PCs, smartphones, tablets, and other areas. The company also promised to investors that it would invest at least 1.5 billion USD in research and development of graphene chips by 2018.</br>
</br>
On the third day after Intel held its press conference, Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA, and other companies also held press conferences to publicize their research achievements on graphene chips.</br>
</br>
News commenters joked that these press briefings were simply unannounced shareholder meetings; they weren't meant to promote the product but to save the shaky prices.</br>
</br>
And that was indeed true.</br>
</br>
When investors saw the companies they invested in weren't letting research go down the drain, their mood began to stabilize as they stopped dumping stocks. Future Heavy Industrial's silence allowed investment expectations to rise and rising stock prices finally made the semiconductor chip makers relieved.</br>
</br>
Thank God, at least they could enjoy Christmas happily.</br>
</br>
Christmas was coming, and Coro Island was filled with the holiday spirit.</br>
</br>
Christmas trees stood in front of shops, and rattans and ribbons hung around houses as decorations. There were girls in short skirts everywhere on the streets.</br>
</br>
Because of its history as a British colony, Christmas was an important holiday only second to the Lunar New Year on this island. It was one of the statutory holidays for Xin.</br>
</br>
However, due to the weather, it was impossible to see an authentic Santa Claus on the island. If someone was wearing a big red jacket, he would certainly get heat stroke.</br>
</br>
On Coro Island, where every season is summer, snow was just an unrealistic fantasy.</br>
</br>
Right now, at the mansion on the southernmost tip of the island, it was filled with the same festive spirit. With the help of drones, Ayesha, wearing just a short Christmas skirt, was busy decorating every corner of the house.</br>
</br>
Compared to the holiday itself, she enjoyed "dressing up" the house more. Jiang Chen's joy was watching her change into the short skirt and tank top.</br>
</br>
"No… Uh, wait till I finish decorating the house?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha held onto the ladder while she buried her red face into the soft decorations hung on the Christmas tree. She gently bit her lips while she begged with a quiet voice.</br>
</br>
But she didn't realize her gentle voice didn't sound sincere at all.</br>
</br>
At least in Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
"I'll help you in a bit."</br>
</br>
"No..."</br>
</br>
Ayesha put the decorations on the top of the ladder and closed her eyes. Her long eyelashes trembled with her heartbeat. Looking at her timid expression, Jiang Chen began to make his move with a smirk.</br>
</br>
But just as he was about to –</br>
</br>
Dingdong.</br>
</br>
The sound of a bell came from the living room.</br>
</br>
"Someone's here."</br>
</br>
Ayesha blushed, jumped off the ladder, and ran to the bedroom.</br>
</br>
She'd would rather kill herself than allow Natasha or Xia Shiyu to see her clothes.</br>
</br>
Seeing as there was a guest, Jiang Chen had to stop and walk downstairs.</br>
</br>
But just as he was passing by the window, he saw someone he didn't expect through the window.</br>
</br>
Hermione… Emma Watson?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 690: Emma“s Reques</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Emma Watson had deliberately put on light makeup. She had on a white dress and stylish beach sandals; she looked dignified but also had the sharpness of a Queen. With her red lips, she looked playful and enchanting. However, when she pressed the doorbell, her expression wasn't as calm as Hermione, but it was somewhat unnatural and anxious.</br>
</br>
Yes, people always associated her with Hermione.</br>
</br>
If she starred in any movie, most people would never say "Look, that's Emma Watson's movie!" Instead, they would say, "Look, the actress is Hermione!"</br>
</br>
Emma became famous from a young age, but like all the other Harry Potter teens, she didn't have a lot of spectacular roles outside of the series.</br>
</br>
For her, her entire life was destined to be bound to Hermione Granger. By the age of 10, she defeated thousands of girls of her age and won the role of Hermione. Given the immense influence of the movie series "Harry Potter," it was no exaggeration to say that she would have a hard time shaping the stage for her acting career beyond the "Hermione Granger" character for a long time.</br>
</br>
For an actor, this weakness was fatal.</br>
</br>
However, the partnership between Future Group and Warner Brothers allowed her to see hope.</br>
</br>
Now, the outside world was heatedly debating the movie which would be using VR technology for the first time and which lucky actors and actresses would be selected.</br>
</br>
Warner Brothers had a lot of actors and everyone wanted the opportunity. Emma was only one of many. While she had a good reputation, she hadn't won an Oscar and couldn't be called a premier Hollywood movie star.</br>
</br>
It was difficult to compete for the role with her peers.</br>
</br>
But she still had a fighting chance.</br>
</br>
Given her partnership with Future Biology on nutrient supply endorsements, if Future Group put in a recommendation, Warner Brothers would seriously consider the proposal by their partner. Although she had no chance of being the protagonist in a nearly 100 million USD investment production, she could still compete for a supporting role.</br>
</br>
Yesterday, her agent talked to her, hoping she could get this opportunity. Her agent even hinted that she should take the initiative to talk to Jiang Chen about it...</br>
</br>
[God, this is crazy!]</br>
</br>
As someone with high self-esteem, this was a request that was simply unacceptable to her. She had always tried to take on the role of an empowered woman and spoke about political correctness.</br>
</br>
Just as her thoughts were running wild, the screen at the door lit up.</br>
</br>
"Can I help you?" Jiang Chen pleasantly asked.</br>
</br>
She took a deep breath, adjusted her mood, and smiled at Jiang Chen on the screen.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to invite me in?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put on a face of sudden realization and gave her a friendly smile.</br>
</br>
"My mistake."</br>
</br>
With a clanking sound, the metal gate opened.</br>
</br>
Emma looked at the opened gate, took a breath again, and walked inside.</br>
</br>
</br>
After walking on the paved marble footpath, Emma was prepared to knock on the door, but the door opened.</br>
</br>
A beautiful girl opened the door. She had slightly curly hair and a pair of sapphire eyes.</br>
</br>
"Hello, I'm Emma Watson ..."</br>
</br>
"Ayesha." The girl blinked her eyes. After she introduced myself, she turned around. "Please come with me, master will be waiting in the living room."</br>
</br>
Although she had met Jiang Chen at the party and knew about his easy-going character, she felt a little nervous sitting on the couch across from him.</br>
</br>
The girl named Ayesha was pouring a cup of black tea for her. After thanking Ayesha, she gently took a sip and looked at Jiang Chen. However, when she and Jiang Chen sat face to face, she blanked out and forgot the speech she originally prepared.</br>
</br>
"Is the tea good?" Jiang Chen smiled and asked to resolve her awkwardness.</br>
</br>
Emma nodded quickly and said: "Very tasty."</br>
</br>
"I think Miss Emma certainly isn't here to drink afternoon tea with me. What can I do for you?"</br>
</br>
She had her hands tightly intertwined together and her thumbs twisted on her knees. Finally, she made up her mind; Emma confidently looked at Jiang Chen and made her request.</br>
</br>
"I hope to participate in Time Curtain."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at her, somewhat puzzled. He opened his hands and said:</br>
</br>
"Future Group's Virtual Image is only responsible for providing technical support and does not participate in the filming of Time Curtain. If I remember correctly, the screening should be in Los Santos."</br>
</br>
"I participated in the screening a few days ago."</br>
</br>
"Oh? The result?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No news yet," Emma said, embarrassed.</br>
</br>
Instead of answering her request, Jiang Chen's next question appeared irrelevant.</br>
</br>
"Have you read the book yet?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Emma nodded.</br>
</br>
Future Technology had bought the "Time Curtain" copyright from Li Ming; the digital book could now be downloaded from Future Technology's site and could be read online.</br>
</br>
"Then in your opinion, which character in the book is most suitable for you?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I screened for the deputy captain, but there were many people competing for this role, and I'm afraid I'll lose ..."</br>
</br>
She didn't go to Warner Brothers but instead came to see the partner of Warner Brothers, which was certainly suspicious-looking. For someone of such high self-esteem, making such a request was really difficult.</br>
</br>
But when she realized that this character was critical to her acting career, she spoke in a sincere tone.</br>
</br>
"I hope you can help me."</br>
</br>
Clever, wise, courageous, egalitarian, native of England - a lot qualities in one character. The deputy captain named Jennifer could be said to be tailor-made for Emma. Jiang Chen, who grew up watching "Harry Potter," was also very interested to see "Hermione" appearing in his own investment.</br>
</br>
But he didn't expect the dignified "Miss Hermione" would lower her head and ask him for a favor. Could what the media suggested - that her activist image was only a facade - be true?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Emma, intrigued.</br>
</br>
Don't be mistaken, he had no ill-thoughts; he was just being playful!</br>
</br>
"How do you want me to help you?"</br>
</br>
Emma's pretty face turned a dark red, and even her eyes tensed up.</br>
</br>
"I…"</br>
</br>
"I?" Jiang Chen knowingly asked.</br>
</br>
"I want you to help me convince Nolan to select me to take the role of deputy captain in the film." She quickly articulated a sentence she never would've said before. She wanted to find a hole in the ground and bury herself inside.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Emma, half-smiling.</br>
</br>
"What about the other actors competing fairly? Last time I heard from Nolan, he said Kristen Stewart, who played Bella in Twilight, also screened for this role."</br>
</br>
"There's rarely fair competition in Hollywood screenings unless it's for a supporting role," Emma whispered defiantly.</br>
</br>
It was obvious that she wasn't used to asking for favors.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Miss Emma wants to use my connections?"</br>
</br>
Emma's face was so red that it looked like blood was about to drip out. Her bitten lips almost looked bruised.</br>
</br>
"I can help you," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Eh?"</br>
</br>
Emma was shocked.</br>
</br>
She originally thought Jiang Chen would make some inappropriate demands and she was about to just walk out. But Jiang Chen's words surprised her. Without any conditions, he agreed to help her.</br>
</br>
Seeing Emma's shock, Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Do you have any questions?"</br>
</br>
"No." Emma shook her head quickly.</br>
</br>
After a short pause, she whispered.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"No problem." Jiang Chen smiled. "Since you signed a long term endorsement deal with Future Biology, increasing your influence will also help us. And I'm personally looking forward to your performance."</br>
</br>
Her anxiety and tension suddenly disappeared. A confident smile returned to Emma's face.</br>
</br>
"I won't let you down."</br>
</br>
From her pressing the doorbell till now, it was the first time Jiang Chen was able to see a shadow of Hermione.</br>
</br>
When Emma left, Jiang Chen saw Ayesha looking at him intriguingly. He tousled her hair.</br>
</br>
"What are you thinking?"</br>
</br>
"That's strange." Ayesha tilted her head while she enjoyed Jiang Chen's massage.</br>
</br>
"Strange?"</br>
</br>
"You didn't make any demands."</br>
</br>
"… Am I that type of person?" Jiang Chen gave Ayesha a hard stare as he grunted.</br>
</br>
[I'm not that sick-minded, am I?]</br>
</br>
[Although I agree, it's a tempting proposal.]</br>
</br>
At the same time, Emma turned around at the gate and whispered to herself.</br>
</br>
"What a strange person."</br>
</br>
She shook her head, stopped a taxi, and disappeared at the end of the street.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
Emma's request made Jiang Chen realize the problem with selecting roles for the movie.</br>
</br>
With the thought that it was no different suggesting one or two people, when Jiang Chen called Nolan, he mentioned the name Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
"There is no problem with Miss Watson, her performance and acting skills are excellent. Kristen and she are both one of the best candidates for Captain Jennifer. Since it is your side's request, giving her the role is no problem. Just ... who is Liu Yao?" Nolan frowned.</br>
</br>
"It's my friend. If it is convenient, just give her a minor role."</br>
</br>
"Does she have experience in acting?" Nolan worriedly asked.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, she is quite famous in Han. Her acting skills are great."</br>
</br>
"Then no problem, we'll provide her with a screening opportunity. But if she is not selected…"</br>
</br>
"It's okay if she is not selected; just give her a screening opportunity. If she doesn't fit, just replace her with someone else, no need to be concerned of my side," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Nolan nodded.</br>
</br>
He was mostly worried about Jiang Chen forcefully demanding a role for her. It would be unpleasant for both sides if he had to change the person, therefore, he warned Jiang Chen beforehand.</br>
</br>
"I'm very picky about my role selection, tell her to be prepared."</br>
</br>
"No problem."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hung up the phone before he called Liu Yao.</br>
</br>
"Hello? Do you miss me?"</br>
</br>
"I miss you so much! Why did you remember to call me?" Liu Yao said joyfully.</br>
</br>
"I can't call you if I don't have anything to do?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Of course not."</br>
</br>
"Are you going to be free any time soon?"</br>
</br>
"Fortunately, I just finished a movie and I'm now in my free period. My agent is helping me to contact the next movie and this time she recommended I try to challenge the female lead role."</br>
</br>
"Female lead... ah... pity," Jiang Chen regretfully said, "I helped you contact a movie, but unfortunately is only a supporting role. Forget about it."</br>
</br>
Liu Yao paused for a moment.</br>
</br>
"A supporting role? Wait, which movie is it?"</br>
</br>
"I think the name is… Time Curtain?"</br>
</br>
Time Curtain!?</br>
</br>
Liu Yao was astonishment.</br>
</br>
Of course she had heard the name before, it was the movie co-filmed by Warner Brothers and Future Technology! The film was based on a novel by a Han writer. Any novel who received international awards would be highly portrayed in the country.</br>
</br>
Participating in this film will without a doubt help her acting career greatly.</br>
</br>
She just didn't think Jiang Chen would remember her for such an important movie…</br>
</br>
[I'm only a mistress…]</br>
</br>
"Are you not interested? Then I will give the role to someone else."</br>
</br>
"Hello! Screw you… Don't bully me!" Tears rolled down to her smiling lips. She rubbed her eyes and coyly said.</br>
</br>
The voice was trembling because of her emotions.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I will stop teasing you. I already mentioned this to the director. Go buy a ticket to Los Santos and go screen at Warner Brothers."</br>
</br>
</br>
"I love you so much, mua!"</br>
</br>
"Don't be so happy yet, I'm only here to provide the opportunity. It is up to you to see if you can grasp onto the opportunity." Jiang Chen smiled, "Nolan is very picky with the acting of his cast. It is ultimately up to you to see if you can become a world class premier movie star."</br>
</br>
Although Liu Yao became popular in Ma Dongmei's Brother a year ago, her popularity remained domestic. As a star that just entered the scene, her international presence was minimal.</br>
</br>
It was a great opportunity for her to enter Hollywood through Time Curtain.</br>
</br>
It was up to herself to see how well she could act in the supporting role.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Movie related tasks were put aside for now.</br>
</br>
During the afternoon, Doctor Amos called and invited Jiang Chen to his lab stating he wanted to display his newest research achievement.</br>
</br>
Arriving at Future Building, Jiang Chen took the elevator to the first floor.</br>
</br>
Doctor Amos' daughter opened the door for him; that blonde loli afraid of strangers. But this time she didn't just run back to her father and instead, took him to the lab.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because Jiang Chen often visited, she was used to the uncle…</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen knew that the loli already viewed him as an uncle, he would certainly have a mixture of emotions.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen pushed opened the door, he saw Doctor Amos working on the back of a robot's brain with a precise welding torch.</br>
</br>
Amos, who sensed Jiang Chen's presence, didn't turn his head. He closed the torch and connected the wires to the head before he started to ramble.</br>
</br>
"Whoever invented the graphene chip is a genius! I installed Dragon Calvary X1 on the robot, take a guess what happened? Millian, go back to your room."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
The little loli nodded sensibly. She threw her squirrel-tail like ponytails and ran outside of the lab.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the layout of the lab before he focused on the robot brain on the table.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
Amos typed on the keyboard and inputted a few commands on the computer.</br>
</br>
"An even more powerful robot!"</br>
</br>
"… Can I interpret you as saying bullsh*t?" Jiang Chen looked at him, speechless.</br>
</br>
Even as an outsider, Jiang Chen knew that using a ultra-chip on the robot is equal to changing a CPU for the robot which meant a more powerful computational power.</br>
</br>
"No, no, no," Amos grinned, his eyes were replaced with zealous light as he pointed at the Phantom Helmet on the side, "Put on the helmet and try, I promise you will be astonished with what you will see!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him with skepticism and picked up the helmet.</br>
</br>
Doctor Amos owned Future Technology's highest S level technology permission which includes neural connection, the artificial intelligence database, seabed mining, and other non-public technology. Other people may not be able to open and modify the Phantom, but he could redesign one with the equipment in the lab.</br>
</br>
But the cost of peaking at the technology a century ahead was that he must live under the monitor of a Ghost Agent for the rest of his life. Every message he sends and receives must be audited by Jean…</br>
</br>
He lost all of his privacy and freedom.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not afraid that he would hurt him, he just didn't understand what he wanted to say.</br>
</br>
"Put it on and try." Amos rushed in excitement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hesitantly put on the helmet and pressed the on switch for the helmet.</br>
</br>
Then, he opened his eyes…</br>
</br>
The scene before him was astonishing.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 692: Neural Connection</br>
</div></br>
</br>
For the people of the 21st century, the real world and virtual world were only defined by a thin line. This was especially true after the introduction of virtual reality helmets.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen brought Doctor Amos' research work and paper back to the apocalypse and handed it to Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin opened her digitalized eyes and used ten minutes to digest the content of the paper, then she sighed.</br>
</br>
"Regardless of the era, there will always be geniuses."</br>
</br>
"What do you think about this paper… and the technology?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It's perfect."</br>
</br>
Even Lin Lin, who did not have the most humble attitude, praised the technology.</br>
</br>
As to what happened when Jiang Chen put on the helmet, let's set the time back by two hours.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
No, precisely speaking, the robot's head on the table opened its eyes.</br>
</br>
He saw Doctor Amos, himself with the helmet, the mirror in front of him, and himself in the mirror.</br>
</br>
"Neural connection! And the more advanced spiritual connection! Don't you think it is fascinating? God. I feel like I'm a wizard from the Middle Age that could implant a person's soul into a doll…"</br>
</br>
"This is truly fascinating… could you deactivate this state for me?"</br>
</br>
The speaker and not his vocal cord made the sound, it was a magical experience. But even then, the empty feeling below his neck made him feel extremely uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, this thing won't last long." Amos opened his hands and shrugged.</br>
</br>
The voice died down and Jiang Chen's vision was cutout with his consciousness returning to his body, he took off the helmet on his head. He threw the helmet aside and immediately asked.</br>
</br>
"What is going on here?"</br>
</br>
"Because of the large amount of data that must be processed, even Dragon Calvary X1 could only last half a minute. I considered using my design to increase the efficiency of the processing, but it is not my field of expertise. Perhaps it is more feasible to simplify the code of the operating system to increase the efficiency…" Amos let out a sigh.</br>
</br>
Doctor Amos clearly didn't realize what kind of terrifying technology he created.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was uncertain if the technology existed in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Therefore, he brought Amos' research work and paper back to the apocalypse to see Lin Lin.</br>
</br>
But the response he received made him even more stunned.</br>
</br>
"In my memory, the technology didn't even exist before the war. As you should know, the Scientific Ethics Committee conducts technical reviews of all research institutes, if any of which is proven to be anti-human or may be used as 'low-cost terror attacks' research would been banned, such as antimatter or digitalized humans... They are just like medieval magistrates, except that the Bible is a universally recognized universal value. "</br>
</br>
Lin Lin then took a moment to think before she continued.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Transcribing your mind onto the circuit board obviously has violated the relevant regulations and will surely be stopped when it is discovered ... Of course, this is not absolute. My father, for example, started with support from a PAC Consortium and started an inhumane research project. Perhaps it might be stored in a non-public lab?"</br>
</br>
According to Lin Lin's introduction, the principle of Doctor Amos's research results was actually very simple.</br>
</br>
Most Phantom Helmets used Xin's quantum computer as processor with itself only as a "modem" for both neural and electrical signals. In theory, as long one gained the access right to change the helmet operating system, it is not impossible to use other supercomputers as a server.</br>
</br>
Based on this theory, Doctor Amos used the chip of the robot to act as the "server" for the Phantom Helmet. The Phantom will read the signal sent out by the human brain and return to the ultra-chip on the robot's brain while accepting the feedback from the chip and sending back to the human brain.</br>
</br>
Regular chips definitely can't process such a large amount of information, but the ultra-chip can.</br>
</br>
Precisely speaking, Dragon Calvary X1 can!</br>
</br>
While it sounded simple on paper, there were many difficulties in the execution. Therefore, Doctor Amos received praise from Lin Lin despite never having met him before just because of the execution. While he was standing on the giant's shoulder, he saw the scenery even the giant has never seen before.</br>
</br>
Just wear a helmet, keep the signal connection, and one could survive in the form of a robot. Only limited by technical problems, the Dragon Cavalry X1 ultra-chip also couldn't process for a long time. Perhaps when the Dragon Cavalry XN is released could the problem be solved.</br>
</br>
However, this problem was actually nothing for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After all, the gap between the apocalypse and the modern world, even an ordinary home computer processor computing efficiency was far superior than the super-chip Dragon Cavalry X1.</br>
</br>
Did Jiang Chen know clearly the implication of this technology?</br>
</br>
Disabilities, aging, and terminally ill people could wear their helmets or put their brains more directly into the culture tank as long as their brains are intact and live in this world with their digitalized bodies. As long as the signal is good, people who are physically deficient can even be healthier than normal people!</br>
</br>
High-risk, high-intensity work can be done by the robot, but the direct manipulation of the human brain makes the robot equipped with human resilience and creativity. Robots that connect their mind to their circuit boards will have a much broader application prospect than robots that are good at repetitive operations!</br>
</br>
Not only in civil areas but also war applications!</br>
</br>
Imagine that a paratrooper is not a flesh-and-blood human, but a robot warrior controlled by a "helmet player." They are not afraid of bullets, nor do they even fear death itself. They could rampage in the battlefield covered by heavy artillery... Of course, perhaps an EMP or wide-area electromagnetic shielding can make them break down as electronic warfare is their weakness. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why soldiers of the flesh were not replaced by drones even in the Third World War.</br>
</br>
Of course, the technology was still in its infancy. It was still far from allowing humans to control robots like the way they control their body, there was a long way to go. And this route may not be shorter than the warp engine Jiang Lin was still working on.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the modern world, he came to see Doctor Amos again and put ten chips inside a metal box in his hands.</br>
</br>
Amos looked at Jiang Chen, puzzled.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"A chip that is superior to the Dragon Calvary X1 in every aspect; it is still in its testing phase," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Testing phase… is this useable?"</br>
</br>
"Why don't you try? I can guarantee you one point; that is that the computation efficiency of this chip is at least ten times the Dragon Calvary X1."</br>
</br>
It was the chip for the Reptile drone after all. It was superior both in the chip process technology and design. It was at least ten generations ahead of the early 21st century graphene chips.</br>
</br>
Amos stared at Jiang Chen in bewilderment as he exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"God… how much more stuff do you have?"</br>
</br>
"I don't how as much good stuff as God has, but I still have more. Do you want to know where the chip is from?" Jiang Chen looked at him with a grin.</br>
</br>
Amos shook his head with determination.</br>
</br>
"No need, I feel like if I know about this secret, I probably won't be able to leave this basement."</br>
</br>
A wise choice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and didn't continue with the topic. He patted him on the shoulder.</br>
</br>
"If you used all the chips, report it to through Jean and someone will send you more chips. I have confidence in you. I also believe this technology will change the world!"</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 693: Christmas Eve and Vodka</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Fortunately, Jiang Chen headed out so Ayesha could finish decorating before Christmas Eve. If he was around to make a "mess", perhaps the decorations wouldn't be up until tomorrow morning. During the evening, Natasha and Xia Shiyu simultaneously showed up at Jiang Chen's place.</br>
</br>
"My parents don't celebrate Christmas… And umm, it is a statuary holiday at work, and I have nothing to do. Therefore, I'm here," Xia Shiyu at door, with gifts in her hands, said embarrassedly.</br>
</br>
"Don't look at me, I don't have anything on me. If you don't trust me, search for yourself." Natasha raised her eyebrows at Ayesha, fully alerted.</br>
</br>
Because of the two girls' visit, the empty mansion became more lively.</br>
</br>
Normally, only Ayesha and Jiang Chen stayed there and the two happened to be the quiet type, therefore the massive mansion was always quiet. While Xia Shiyu was not as serious when she is not at work, she was not the vocal type either.</br>
</br>
Luckily, Natasha was there. While her careless attitude doesn't mesh too well with Ayesha, she was a great person after all.</br>
</br>
On the table was golden roasted turkey, strawberry and mango fruit cake, marzipan, apple pie, cranberry sauce… just looking at it would make people hungry.</br>
</br>
The four sat around the table, chatted, and ate.</br>
</br>
When they finished half the turkey, Natasha suddenly turned her head and ran into the kitchen; she then came out with a bottle of alcohol.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen saw the bottle and his eyebrows twitched in pain.</br>
</br>
Diva Vodka, known as "the world's most attractive vodka". It is priced at between 100,000 and 1,000,000 US Dollar, depending on the level of luxury of the packaging, its year of origin, and its production origin. The alcohol brewing process was also extremely cool. It was first filtered with ice, and then filtered with the Nordic birch charcoal, and finally filtered through precious stones and semi-precious stones, known as the "triple distillation."</br>
</br>
And the erected glistening "Swarovski Crystal Wand" at the center of the bottle indicated that this bottle clearly belonging to the 1 million dollar category.</br>
</br>
The bottle was a gift from Carmen Rothschild, but Jiang Chen was unwilling to bring it out during this party, and instead kept it as a collectable inside his fridge. It was not because of the money, but rather how difficult it was to obtain one.</br>
</br>
"Russia's Christmas Party is a Vodka party. Have a shot?" Natasha opened the bottle and the room was filled with a rich aroma of alcohol.</br>
</br>
"What does Christmas have to do with drinking?" Jiang Chen scorned.</br>
</br>
Despite his scorn, he still extended his cup.</br>
</br>
"Haha, you're welcome." Natasha grinned and poured everyone a shot.</br>
</br>
"Don't you think it is odd to say you're welcome to the owner of the bottle?" Jiang Chen sniffed the rich birch aroma and took a sip. When the sweet alcohol rolled down this throat, his eyes lit up.</br>
</br>
</br>
Great stuff!</br>
</br>
… Uhhh.</br>
</br>
Fine, he couldn't taste the difference between this and Baijiu.</br>
</br>
On the contrary, Natasha finished the cup as if she was drinking water and poured herself another cup.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly learned...</br>
</br>
Vodka was not something one savored, but something one chugged!</br>
</br>
…But then, why was it sold at the same price as wine!</br>
</br>
While he cursed in his mind, Jiang Chen raised his cup, asking Natasha to pour him another one.</br>
</br>
Ayesha looked at the cup in front of her with hesitation. Although she followed Jiang Chen's non-religious belief, she still remained cautious with alcohol.</br>
</br>
The clear alcohol was like the devil's eyes, pristine but filled with lust.</br>
</br>
But when she saw Natasha down a drink and her proactive sight, the girl couldn't withstand it anymore. It was only in front of Jiang Chen did she not want to lose anymore, especially to Natasha who was the "same kind".</br>
</br>
Therefore, Ayesha expressionlessly held onto the cup, withstood the pungent smell of alcohol, and downed the drink.</br>
</br>
The burning sensation rolled from her throat down into her stomach. It was her first time drinking such high percentage alcohol and tears almost came out of her eyes.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu covered her mouth and giggled; Natasha who saw her pretending to be tough just burst out laughing.</br>
</br>
"Cough, cough, cough!" Natasha couldn't hold it down anymore. She held her burning throat and ran to the kitchen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stared at Natasha while the latter just pretended to be innocent while rolling her eyes. She didn't look apologetic at all.</br>
</br>
When Ayesha return to the table, she didn't touch the alcohol anymore. Regardless of how Natasha "provoked" her, she just ignored her.</br>
</br>
Everyone has their weaknesses.</br>
</br>
The small interruption didn't interfere with the mood at the table, or rather, it made the four closer. The saying that three women make for a great show seems true and it was the first time Jiang Chen witnessed it. Even the quiet Ayesha and the standoffish Xia Shiyu began to make conservation under the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
They surprisingly shared a similar interest.</br>
</br>
Clothes.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, Jiang Chen didn't know anything about this at all. Therefore, he dumbfounded realized that he was the "outcast", unable to join their conversation. But since he was drinking while watching three beauties chat, it was a delightful experience.</br>
</br>
Natasha had the most fun drinking.</br>
</br>
After a few shots of vodka, her golden hair got stuck to her forehead by the clear sweat drops. Her white shirt began to be stained and it revealed her bra underneath. Jiang Chen who sat across from her didn't know where he should focus his eyes.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's alcohol tolerance was only mediocre. After being drunk the last time at the company gathering, she decided to drink more cautiously. Whenever she drank, she at most limited herself to three drinks. But for some reason today, perhaps because of the atmosphere, or perhaps the alcohol Natasha raided out of Jiang Chen's fridge was all ridiculously expensive, she decided to have a few more drinks.</br>
</br>
Compared to the boldness of Natasha, Xia Shiyu's gestures were decorated with the elegance of the oriental beauty. The pupils intoxicated by the alcohol cast over a sparkling mist, and the blush on her face was redder.</br>
</br>
Even if she was still proper, she was charming.</br>
</br>
To be honest, looking at the three beauties in front of his eyes, Jiang Chen who was somewhat drunk almost couldn't contain himself. He just had to keep drinking shot by shot, but he didn't know if drinking now would be helpful.</br>
</br>
When the clock struck twelve, no one had the energy left to sing Christmas songs.</br>
</br>
Finally, other than Ayesha, the three all had their heads on the table.</br>
</br>
The girl helplessly sighed and cleaned up the mess by herself before moving Xia Shiyu and Natasha to the guest rooms.</br>
</br>
It took Ayesha quite an effort to move Natasha. When she was carrying her, Natasha kissed her. The shy girl instantly turned red and tossed Natasha on the bed, infuriated. She then threw a blanket on her before escaping from the room.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was next.</br>
</br>
Ayesha gently put him on her shoulder. She felt the warmth behind her bum and the warm breaths that whispered into her ear. Her face was even burning hotter than when she drank the alcohol.</br>
</br>
When they went upstairs, she didn't go to the bedroom. Instead, she directly went to the washroom at the end of the hall…</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 694: The $8 Billion Christmas Gif</br>
</div></br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen and the girls were completely drunk, Wall Street across the planet was having a pleasant day. Investors all gathered inside the stock exchange. Excited smiles were the common theme on everyone's face. Needlessly to think, the happy people all received an early Christmas gift.</br>
</br>
They bought the stock of High Tech Freshwater!</br>
</br>
While the phone could be used to track the real-time quotas of the stock market, the lucky ones all wanted to be at the scene to experience the exciting moment.</br>
</br>
Finally, in the investors' highly anticipated debut, the logo and the name of High Tech Freshwater appeared on the big screen, signaling its listing!</br>
</br>
With B City Consortium handling the initial public offering, High Tech Freshwater's road to becoming public was far smoother than expected. With a total market cap of 7.14 billion US Dollar, High Tech Freshwater issued 50 million shares at 20 US Dollar per share with a circulation market capitalization of 1 billion US Dollar, accounting for 14% of the total share capital.</br>
</br>
At the opening moment, the volume actually turned empty for a second.</br>
</br>
Listing prices went all the way up; the stock price went up two percent, directly to 20.4 US Dollar, before high volumes appeared. Short-term shock adjustments and the difficult to suppress stock price began its ascension which made many investors directly orgasm in excitement...</br>
</br>
Freshwater supply orders from Saudi totaling more than 400 million US Dollar each year, as well as the ongoing fresh water supply negotiation in the UAE. Under such positive and favorable conditions, it would be hard for High Tech Freshwater's stock price to be low.</br>
</br>
Because of Christmas Eve, the stock exchange in accordance with 1:00 pm EST closed 3 hours in advance. When investors were still struggling to get out of the stock exchange building, High Tech Freshwater's price closed at 23.4 US Dollar.</br>
</br>
The first day gain of 17% was definitely a miracle in the history of the market.</br>
</br>
It must be mentioned that regardless of the color of the ups and downs or anything else, other than the Wanghai Stock Exchange which was the "most regulated in the world", any new issuance of shares would most likely experience a plunge. Other than the Wanghai market, this phenomenon was true across the globe, especially for NASDAQ.</br>
</br>
Think when CIC invested in Blackstone, think about the original Alibaba, and then think about the past few years if you bought Facebook, Zynga, or Groupon at the time of listing, the first two years you may have lost quite a bit.</br>
</br>
Market value exceeded 6 billion US Dollar without suspense, then it exceeded the 8 billion mark, and moved toward 9 billion.</br>
</br>
To put it into another perspective, just as Ayesha was helping Jiang Chen into the shower, his assets skyrocketed by more than six billion U.S. dollars.</br>
</br>
However, it was not until the next morning, when Jiang Chen woke up from the gentleness and looked at his phone did he learn this fact.</br>
</br>
</br>
Even if his assets exceeded one hundred billion already, his eyebrows still twitched.</br>
</br>
No wonder so many Hua companies did everything to get into the Wall Street market, the money making speed was ridiculous!</br>
</br>
After Christmas ends, Lunar New Year would be in another one and a half months. The festive mood on the streets did not decline the slightest. Many shops chose to keep up the Christmas decorations until a few days before replacing them with blessing words and couplets of the Lunar New Year; this scene can be considered unique to Xin.</br>
</br>
This highlighted the cultural inclusiveness of this country.</br>
</br>
After Christmas, the immigration wave once again erupted in the country.</br>
</br>
Immigration was nothing new for this island of booming economic growth. The Han cultural circle and the loose government were particularly attractive to the Han people. As of December, the population of Xin had exceeded the 150,000 mark and had been moving toward 200,000 without losing momentum.</br>
</br>
Walking through Coro Island, it was impossible to link it with the "small fishing village" it was from two years ago.</br>
</br>
The only thing that surprised Jiang Chen was that the source of this wave of immigration was not from Han but from Europe. And among the immigrants, they were mostly Germans.</br>
</br>
Some time ago he was busy so he didn't pay much attention to international news. It seemed that something big and unexpected happened somewhere he didn't know.</br>
</br>
After he phoned Xie Lei who was studying in Frankberg and after confirming the safety of both her brother and sister, Jiang Chen also asked about the situation in Frankberg.</br>
</br>
According to Xie Lei, since last year's attack, the patriotic souls finally woke up. Frankberg went through a series of incidents, such as the early election which resulted in their leader's resignation and the New Choice Party taking power. The European consortium also announced in November the founding of the Refugee Relief Foundation, which announced that it would "properly settle" its refugees by building hundreds of refugee camps in the forests south of the Alta region, in the far north of Norway, and in Finland.</br>
</br>
Of course, Norway and Finland will receive a sum of money every year as compensation, and the money will be paid by the relief fund.</br>
</br>
The refugee accommodation was not as smooth as imagined. No one was willing to be sent to cold forests; they would rather be on the streets. At least it was warmer on the streets. Incited by the extremists lurking among the refugees, the whole of Europe was now a mess.</br>
</br>
Protest, riot, resistance, and suppression...</br>
</br>
The only difference was that the EU's extremely united on this issue, a rare sight.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard the news, he just shook his head.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, standing on the divergent point of history, Rothschild once made a move.</br>
</br>
The situation reminded him of the party he hosted on Hot Spring Island, Carmen Rothschild, unfortunately, was absent due to conflicting schedules. However, he sent his butler with a gift of apology. Now looking back, he was indeed plotting some event.</br>
</br>
But even if Jiang Chen knew this, he didn't have the interest to be bothered by the chaos on the other side of the planet. BHP Group's minerals were all overseas. No matter how chaotic Europe was, the cooperation with Future Mining would not be affected.</br>
</br>
And from a sole interest point of view, this immigration wave was still favorable for Xin. In particular, most immigrants from Germany have a relatively high level of education and would fill the country's demand for teachers, doctors, and senior workers.</br>
</br>
The only problematic element was that the influx of a large number of immigrants and tourists led to an increasing crowdedness of Pannu Islands.</br>
</br>
Although the urbanization in the recent two years had improved the problem of residential land shortages, with the continuous influx of immigrants, how to change more high-density residential areas without sacrificing ecological landscape had become a headache for urban construction agencies.</br>
</br>
Currently, at the instigation of Jiang Chen, the presidential palace had temporarily tightened its immigration policy.</br>
</br>
Zhang Yaping stood in front of the media and promised to those who submitted immigration applications that they would relax immigration policies and the issuance of labor visas after the completion of Penglai.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 695: Too Obvious</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen has never been someone that treated other unfairly, he at most is someone without boundaries at times.</br>
</br>
At least he thought of himself this way all along.</br>
</br>
He spent a happy Christmas Eve and Christmas with Ayesha. Then, on the night of Christmas Eve, he returned to the apocalypse with Ayesha's hand-made fruit pudding and turkey.</br>
</br>
Even with the unbelievable amount of wealth, he had never forgotten this mansion. His subordinates once proposed to rebuild this mansion since the building had been bathed in the nuclear explosion. However, even if the radioactive dust had been cleared, the cracks on the walls were still hard to cover up.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen decisively rejected the idea.</br>
</br>
For him, this place offered a lot more sentimental value; it was not just a place for sleeping.</br>
</br>
"Hum! It's so delicious! How is this made? The perfect blend of mango and strawberry flavor… this is amazing!" The little hand held the fork and her white hair shook. Lin Lin's red and black eyes were filled with happiness.</br>
</br>
[You're only eating a pudding… No need to act like you're orgasming!]</br>
</br>
But from the scene, both Lin Lin and Tingting in her body appreciated Ayesha's cooking skills.</br>
</br>
"Brother, brother Jiang Chen." Pulling on Jiang Chen's clothing, Yao Yao timidly said.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Jiang Chen looked at Yao Yao with a smile and asked,</br>
</br>
"That ... that girl named Ayesha, is her cooking skills better than mine?"</br>
</br>
Yao Yao asked a difficult question to answer, just like girls who always loved to ask, "Who is prettier, her or me?" It was the same for this question, "Who's cooking is better?" It seemed Jiang Chen could only say that each person has her advantages and disadvantages. However, of course, he wasn't going to say the foolish truth.</br>
</br>
"Of course Yao Yao's is better," Jiang Chen used his hand and rubbed the little girl's head with a smile. "Yao Yao's cooking is the best. "</br>
</br>
It was a reaction Jiang Chen didn't expect as Yao Yao didn't respond with a smile, but instead, she started to blush. Although the joy could be seen in her big eyes, Jiang Chen thought something felt odd.</br>
</br>
Sun Xiaorou was still grinning when she elegantly sent the soft pudding into her even softer lips.</br>
</br>
"Sister, a powerful enemy has appeared."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm!"</br>
</br>
"Hmmm? Is sister not jealous?" Sun Xiaorou turned her head and looked at Sun Jiao who was busy working on the turkey.</br>
</br>
"Humph, I'm already used to how perverted this guy is!" Then, Sun Jiao gave Jiang Chen a dirty stare.</br>
</br>
Even with the stare, Xiaorou on the side could still read the gentleness hidden in her sister's eyes.</br>
</br>
After the delicious dinner, havoc filled the table.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen cleaned up with the girls, it was already getting late. Yao Yao and Lin Lin went to shower and rest.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen's Christmas Eve with Sun Jiao and Xiaorou had just begun…</br>
</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen returned to the modern world, it was already the second day after Christmas.</br>
</br>
Carson Loki called him to congratulate him on the successful public offering of High Tech Freshwater.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Mr. Jiang Chen, your assets under your name ballooned once again. I wish you a Merry Christmas on behalf of all the Wall Street investors!"</br>
</br>
The call should have arrived two days ago, but Jiang Chen didn't manage to pick up then as he was in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
"Thank you," Jiang Chen pleasantly responded.</br>
</br>
"If you have any plans to IPO your subsidiaries, please contact us!"</br>
</br>
"Haha, yes, if there is any." Jiang Chen selectively ignored Carson's attempt to gain information from him.</br>
</br>
While B City Consortium was an ally, Jiang Chen never considered them to be the trustworthy type. The high valuation of the company meant that there must be institutions pushing for the price. And the institution most likely to do that was B City Consortium.</br>
</br>
And there were two reasons why.</br>
</br>
One was because of the shares held by Carson Loki.</br>
</br>
Two was because B City Consortium wanted to promise a giant cake to convince Future Group to be "cake chefs" together and bring more cakes to the stock exchange. The more subsidiaries that go public in the UA, the more there are to gain by B City Consortium, and the more assured the Capital would feel toward Future Group.</br>
</br>
But Carson's expectation was destined to fall short.</br>
</br>
The subsidiary going public did make Future Group taste the sweetness, but it was not sweet enough for Jiang Chen to completely "faint" from it.</br>
</br>
He must admit that public listing's one-time gains are really attractive; a second to earn money that could only be made in 20 years, but Jiang Chen never expected to rely on this to make money. High Tech Freshwater going public was only a decision made after weighing the pros and cons. After all, the Gulf of Aden was next to Somalia and Celestial Trade temporarily do not have the overseas troops to exert diplomatic influence.</br>
</br>
It was also unnecessary.</br>
</br>
For the B City consortium and Wall Street's attempt, Jiang Chen could only describe it in two words.</br>
</br>
Too obvious.</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen took a trip to New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
As the population of Coro Island surged, the number of employees in Celestial Trade expanded several times. The expansion of the business from pure military contractors to aerospace and telecommunications fields plagiarized Raytheon's development model.</br>
</br>
New Moon Island has the most powerful military force of Xin and was the strongest card in Jiang Chen's hands. From the initial scale of more than 100 people, it has now grown to 3,000. One in five of the employees were office and logistics personnel, and the remainder were war machines!</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen stepped onto the Island, Ivan was waiting for him at the port.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't make any stop and directly headed to the middle of the island.</br>
</br>
Lying there was a spacious warehouse and at the same time the entrance to New Moon Island's underground arsenal. The location was used to store weapons that must be kept confidential, such as the Power Armor.</br>
</br>
Since the Moro War and the undersea missile silo demonstration, an eye has grown above the head of New Moon Island. Jiang Chen simply collected the topographic data of New Moon Island and submitted it to the architects of the apocalypse. Their "professional ability test" was to design a reconstruction program, and then mobilize the engineering robots to carry out the underground arsenal expansion.</br>
</br>
The design would be based on the specifications of the fallout shelter. Jiang Chen not only brought the new equipment training ground down deep into the ground, but an L-shaped underwater harbor was also built that could allow submarines to dock. The waters around New Moon Island was shallow, but fortunately, there was a fault leading to the deep sea. Just on the fault's side walls, amphibious construction robots opened up an exit for small and medium-sized submarines such as the Water Droplet.</br>
</br>
The project, which took five months, was completed around October that year. At that time, Jiang Chen was in the apocalypse and did not visit after the completion of construction. Now, the underground training facilities have been put into operation.</br>
</br>
Such as the Power Armor.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 696: Level Four Warning</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The boss possessed many secrets.</br>
</br>
The longer he followed Jiang Chen, the more Ivan felt that way.</br>
</br>
His ability to occupy that position proved he is a smart man. His intelligence wasn't just mere cleverness and knowing a couple tricks but rather, he was skilled and above all, he knew what to do and what not to do.</br>
</br>
Really smart people often didn't ask too many questions.</br>
</br>
In the bullet-proof glass isolated training grounds, the big giant in steel armor carried out a series of tactical moves as instructed by the experimenter; including launching heat-seeking bombs, performing evasive emergency moves, releasing machine guns at targets... and so on.</br>
</br>
The elites of Celestial Trade were qualified as pilots of the Power Armor. Their loyalty and combat effectiveness had to go through rigorous assessment procedures.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw the giant on the training grounds shredding a Hummer with its hands, he nodded with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
"It's almost a war machine... no matter how many times I look at it, the T-3's combat power is so astonishing," Ivan exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"It's a war machine." Jiang Chen watched the giant withstood the explosion of the RPG with its front-mounted armor. He narrowed his eyes and spoke with a smile.</br>
</br>
It has high mobility, high defense, and the ability to cross the nuclear radiation zone...</br>
</br>
In infantry warfare, this type of individual armor has almost no opponent.</br>
</br>
"How many people in the force have received power armor training?"</br>
</br>
"A total of twenty people."</br>
</br>
"Not enough." Jiang Chen shook his head. "We need at least a hundred people prepared. Go work on this and select eighty more people to receive the training."</br>
</br>
"But there are only five Power Armors on the island, and even training is done in rotations. If we expand our numbers, we won't have the equipment to support it," Ivan said with a troubled look.</br>
</br>
"Not to worry. Tomorrow, I'll make someone send a hundred units over," Jiang Chen said casually</br>
</br>
"One hundred units! Don't they have an extremely slow production time?!" Ivan said with shock.</br>
</br>
When he first started Power Armor training, he made an application to Jiang Chen and hoped to receive a few more Power Armors for the force. It was really troublesome for four people to use one unit for training. However, the application of equipment was rejected by Jiang Chen, stating that the output was too low.</br>
</br>
Now, Jiang Chen just promised to bring a hundred units over, so how could Ivan not be shocked?</br>
</br>
Don't they have an extremely slow production time?</br>
</br>
"The output can be changed, and now the output increased." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
In the apocalypse, after conquering Hongcheng, NAC's commercial route to the heartland began to open. As the labor force and material input increased, productivity would naturally go up. The original monthly output of Power Armor was only 5-10 units, but it had now been raised to around 30.</br>
</br>
</br>
As the situation stabilized, the NAC didn't need so many Power Armors, but the orders hadn't stopped. This batch of extra units was naturally moved to the modern world by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was ready to leave, Ivan suddenly asked.</br>
</br>
"Are there plans for military operations again?"</br>
</br>
"No, what happened?" Jiang Chen turned around to ask.</br>
</br>
"Seeing as you're expanding the force, I thought you are ready to fight again." Ivan laughed.</br>
</br>
"They are produced just in case for unexpected times—"</br>
</br>
Before he could finish his sentence, an alarm began to ring in the arsenal. Soldiers on duty raced out from the barracks, kinetic skeletons were put on, and they gathered in an open space.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Ivan.</br>
</br>
Looking in the direction of the alarm, Ivan's eyes turned sharp. "Level Four Warning. Let me go see what happened."</br>
</br>
He didn't show the slightest complacency even with the lowest level alarm.</br>
</br>
"I'll go too."</br>
</br>
Since Jiang Chen had nothing to do, he followed behind Ivan to the direction of the open ground.</br>
</br>
The alarm didn't disrupt the order of the facility. Aside from the twenty soldiers gathered together, everyone continued with their routines. Only Level One warnings signaling war required the mobilization of all combat units. This Level Four Warning was nothing more than the discovery of smuggling ships on the radar or the discovery of rescue signals within controlled water. Only the on-duty rapid response force would be mobilized.</br>
</br>
Following Ivan into the command center, the Chief of Staff briefly described the situation.</br>
</br>
"Three hundred nautical miles north of the New Moon Island in public waters, we received a distress signal from a civil vessel, but it was quickly interrupted. The target area has no storms or other meteorological disasters. The target is suspected to have been captured by pirates. Rapid response forces have been prepared. Aurora-20 has taken off for the target waters, and Black Hawk Helicopter will take off in 2 minutes."</br>
</br>
"Life signal?"</br>
</br>
"Weak," Chief of Staff said solemnly.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Luxury and comfort - this was the Royal Caribbean cruise.</br>
</br>
For a 10,000 US Dollar ticket from Sri Lanka, they would go across the Bay of Bengal, float across the Strait of Malacca, dock in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore before eventually sailing to Wanghai. Passengers were the rich and famous as well as elites from all walks of life. After all, the people who could afford the cost had to be middle class at least.</br>
</br>
In the corner of the cruise ship, two men sat at a beach table.</br>
</br>
From the arrogant look on his face, a man in a suit seemed to be powerful. Behind him were two bodyguards standing still wearing sunglasses. The person sitting opposite him was a bit strange not because of the lack of bodyguards, but due to the felt hat on his head.</br>
</br>
The hat looked obtrusive no matter the angle.</br>
</br>
The male in the suit frowned and thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhu Tianyou, thank you for your appointment. I'm Tanaka Yoshinobu, this is my business card." Tanaka smiled and handed over the card in his hand.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou didn't take his business card. He eyed his bodyguard and the bodyguard took the business card.</br>
</br>
"People who know me know that I don't appreciate doing business while on vacation," Zhu Tianyou leaned in his chair and crossed his right leg on his left knee. "...But I'm very interested in your proposal. I, however, am curious. Ten tons of salt - can you really take it all?</br>
</br>
The salt he referred to, of course, didn't refer to eating salt.</br>
</br>
It was a hallucinogen with a component of methadone known as "bath salts."</br>
</br>
"Please rest assured, Mr. Zhu." Tanaka smiled. "We recently received a 'donation' and we have ample money on hand."</br>
</br>
Zhu Youtian glanced at him then he habitually swept around his surroundings.</br>
</br>
He wasn't interested in the "donation" of Tanaka mentioned nor was not he interested in knowing where he was selling it to.</br>
</br>
Of course, if it was shipped to Yoto, he would consider giving him a discount.</br>
</br>
"The rule on the streets is money in one hand, goods in the other. You can determine the location of trade, but it must be within Ethiopian borders." Zhu Tianyou leaned in his chair while twisting the ring on his thumb.</br>
</br>
The main component of bath salts was MDPV, a chemical mainly found in Arabian tea.</br>
</br>
Ethiopia was one of its main producing areas.</br>
</br>
"No problem. Ten tons of salt. What is Mr. Zhu's offer?" Tanaka nodded with a grin.</br>
</br>
"Three million."</br>
</br>
"...Japanese Yen?"</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou burst out laughing. From Tanaka's embarrassed look, he already knew he couldn't afford it.</br>
</br>
"I thought this was going to be a deal, but it turned out to be a poor man."</br>
</br>
The buyer had no money, so the deal naturally fell apart. Zhu Tianyou stood up and was prepared to leave. If this was elsewhere, he might've considered chopping two fingers off of the person who wasted his time, but on this cruise ship, he didn't want to cause trouble.</br>
</br>
"Can you lower the price?" Tanaka didn't get up and tried to convince him.</br>
</br>
"How much money do you have?" Zhu Tianyou stopped and looked at him with a dubious smile.</br>
</br>
"5 million Japanese Yen."</br>
</br>
"No need to speak further."</br>
</br>
"That's really regrettable then." Tanaka shook his head. His smiling expression didn't change. "It seems I have to handle things myself."</br>
</br>
The same time he said that he put his finger on his cap.</br>
</br>
For some reason, Zhu Tianyou began to feel a strange sense of alertness…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 697"/>

<div class="caption">Chapter 697: 100% Human</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Drowsily, Zhu Tianyou gradually regained his consciousness.</br>
</br>
His body was restrained, his limbs were firmly restrained, and two steel rods were also tied to his back. He tried to move, but he couldn't. He couldn't even bend his knees nor sit up.</br>
</br>
His suit was still on him, and his back felt wet. There was a dripping sound.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou opened his heavy eyelids and began to observe his surroundings.</br>
</br>
In the pitch black cabin, he could make out that he was in a bathtub and the tap was dripping. Beside it… a grinning face was watching him.</br>
</br>
"Oh, you're awake?"</br>
</br>
The annoying flat cap!</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou stared at Tanaka in horror as if he had just seen a ghost. He wanted to say something, but only a muffled noise came out as his taped mouth couldn't articulate a single word.</br>
</br>
"Oh, I almost forgot - you can't speak now."</br>
</br>
Tanaka ripped off the tape on his mouth and threw the crumpled tape into the garbage.</br>
</br>
"Are you a human or a ghost?"</br>
</br>
[Impossible, his heartbeat and pulse disappeared - how could he still be alive?!] Zhu Tianyou frantically thought in his mind.</br>
</br>
"100% human, you and I." He shrugged. His body leaned closer to the bathtub and he stared at the horror in Zhu Tianyou's eyes. With a smile, he said, "Mr. Zhu, will you cooperate with me?"</br>
</br>
After his initial fear, Zhu Tianyou had already calmed down.</br>
</br>
From the Golden Crescent to the Gulf of Aden, he traveled extensively in Western Asia for many years. He wasn't a simple character himself. At the moment, his mind turned fast, trying to determine the person in front of him was a killer hired by the enemy or a kidnapper looking for riches.</br>
</br>
If it was the former, this guy wouldn't talk much nonsense. If it was the latter… some money should suffice.</br>
</br>
An Interpol officer? By this person's means, it didn't look like it...</br>
</br>
"How much do you want?" Zhu Tianyou slowly said.</br>
</br>
"I don't want money; I only need ten tons of salt." Tanaka smiled and shook his head, extending a finger.</br>
</br>
"You let me go and I'll give it to you."</br>
</br>
When Tanaka heard Zhu Tianyou's words, it seemed like he heard a funny joke and he began to chuckle.</br>
</br>
On his face flashed a hint of irritation as Zhu Tianyou fiercely said, "You don't believe me? When I say it, I mean it. I never broke a promise."</br>
</br>
"I never trust anyone." Tanaka laughed.</br>
</br>
"Then you tell me what to do. Even though you want the salt, I can't make it magically appear!"</br>
</br>
"It's easy - tell me your where your 'tea garden' and 'chemical plants' are and I'll get it myself."</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou looked at Tanaka as if he was watching an insane lunatic.</br>
</br>
His salt factory was located on the border between Somalia and Ethiopia. Not only were hundreds of armed personnel stationed there, but the place was protected by local militants. Even the Marines wouldn't dare to enter the tea plantation and drug factory without extensive planning.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, the confidence in Tanaka's eyes made him feel a little puzzled.</br>
</br>
"What? Mr. Zhu isn't willing?" Tanaka grinned as he asked.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou didn't speak and hesitated in his mind.</br>
</br>
Tanaka smiled and didn't speak. He stretched out his hand and opened the tap above Zhu Tianyou's head.</br>
</br>
Splash—</br>
</br>
The original dripping of water droplets instantly turned into a water column. The water level in the bathtub began to rise, and Zhu Tianyou's originally calm eyes finally panicked. When the cold sensation touched his ear, his calm face completely collapsed!</br>
</br>
"I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Turn off the water!" Zhu Tianyou shouted and desperately tried to raise his chin while using the corner of his eyes to look at the clear surface of the water.</br>
</br>
The pouring water column stopped and returned to slowly falling water droplets.</br>
</br>
Tanaka smiled and looked at him.</br>
</br>
"You can start."</br>
</br>
The ticking sound of water was like the sound of a clock, beating a horrifying rhythm.</br>
</br>
[Fu*k, if you want to die, I'll help you!]</br>
</br>
Zhu Youtian's eyes turned sharp.</br>
</br>
"If I tell you, will you let me go?"</br>
</br>
Tanaka reached for the tap.</br>
</br>
"Don't! Don't I'll tell you! The tea plantation is in the mountainous area south of Kraft in Ethiopia! Go ten kilometers further to the disputed Ethiopian border and go to the area controlled by the Hudur local warlords. If you ask the locals for Mr. Zhu's salt plant, the locals will take you there!"</br>
</br>
"I need a specific location." Tanaka picked up a tablet from the table next to him and placed it in front of Zhu Tianyou. He took a stylus and stuffed it in Zhu Tianyou's mouth. "Point to it."</br>
</br>
He bit the stylus like candy. Zhu Tianyou desperately tried to raise his head and pointed to two spots on the enlarged map then spat out the pen. He looked at Tanaka and said fiercely, "I already told you the location. Can you let me go now?"</br>
</br>
After being a tycoon for so many years, he had never fallen so hard like this.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou already made up his mind. If he escaped from this man's hands, he would catch this guy, use the cruelest means to torture him, and make him regret living in this world!</br>
</br>
But he still didn't understand why someone with a stopped pulse and heartbeat could suddenly come back alive.</br>
</br>
"When did I say I would let you go?" Tanaka said with the same grin.</br>
</br>
"You! You lied to me!" Zhu Tianyou's eyes widened and he looked at Tanaka in horror.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Zhu can rest assured that your salt factory will prosper in my hands." Having said that, Tanaka stood up and opened the tap to the max.</br>
</br>
Splash—</br>
</br>
"No! I beg you! Please don't kill me! I-I have 200 million USD in my Swiss Bank account! I'll give everything to you! If I die, you won't get this money!"</br>
</br>
The sound reverberated in the empty cabin, but Tanaka didn't show any signs of turning back. It was as if Zhu Tianyou didn't offer 200 million USD but 200 million sheets of toilet paper.</br>
</br>
As he cried in despair, the door of the cabin was slammed shut.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou desperately lifted his chin, trying to prevent the water from covering his face, but his angled nose made the water rush into his nostrils and almost choked him.</br>
</br>
He was unable to shout after the water entered his mouth.</br>
</br>
The tip of the water immersed his nose. He couldn't breathe.</br>
</br>
He desperately struggled to get out of the bathtub, but the rope was too tight and the steel behind him locked him to the bottom of the tub. No matter how he twisted like a worm, he was unable to lift his head out of the water.</br>
</br>
His consciousness began to diminish; he had no strength left to struggle. He powerlessly sank in the water.</br>
</br>
Vaguely, he heard the sound of gunshots, explosions, and something being kicked open, but he had no ability to distinguish what it was...</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 698: Boarding the Cruise</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In public waters, the Royal Caribbean Cruise broke through the tide.</br>
</br>
Not far away, two Black Hawk Helicopters approached the target, slowing their flight speed and remaining parallel with the cruise ship. At the moment, Jiang Chen was sitting in a helicopter looking out the window at the cruise ship when his brows furrowed.</br>
</br>
Blood.</br>
</br>
There was blood everywhere…</br>
</br>
On a white painted wall, the vivid red was so obvious. Looking around, he saw that all the waiters and visitors, aside from the living dead, were all dead.</br>
</br>
City K.</br>
</br>
"God ..." A droplet of sweat rolled down Ivan's forehead. He opened his mouth, clearly uncomfortable.</br>
</br>
Even though he was used to hell from the civil war in Veit, he couldn't remain indifferent to what was going on even though he had been to City K. The soldiers seated in the helicopter all had stunned expressions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was fairly normal. After all, this scene wasn't too out of place in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
From his position, he could clearly see a beautiful woman wearing a bikini, dangling half her head and staring at the sea blankly. There was also a man with an exposed stomach, lying on the ground. And also…</br>
</br>
"We might be in trouble."</br>
</br>
"Do you want to hand things over to UN?" Ivan looked to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The radio life signal detection device found signs of human life in all corners of the cruise - it was present in bars, kitchens, and some rooms. Like the T-virus in City K, not all people were infected once, and many people became zombies only after their second infection.</br>
</br>
Of course, there were always the unfortunate ones who couldn't become zombies even after their second infection. Those people tended to become zombies' food, dying from zombies by being torn into pieces agonizingly.</br>
</br>
"Board," Jiang Chen said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"But ..." Ivan's expression was hesitant.</br>
</br>
"Firing approved."</br>
</br>
After taking a deep breath, Ivan nodded.</br>
</br>
"Understood."</br>
</br>
Up until now, the UN still hadn't drawn a conclusion on the infectious events that erupted in City K. The fact that the shooting of zombies didn't constitute a "crime against humanity" remained vague under international law.</br>
</br>
No one wanted to bear the name of the executioner. No one wanted to have an "antidote" that could cure the infection eventually in the future as they would be tried by the families of the deceased and the International Court of Justice.</br>
</br>
But now, there was no time to think.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to know why an infection broke out on the cruise ship. Kurofune, who had been silent for nearly a year, surfaced again. He couldn't miss this opportunity. What's more - the uniqueness of Kurofune meant it would be inconvenient for it to be disclosed to the United Nations.</br>
</br>
His intention was to collect all the clues and destroy them before they were handed to the United Nations.</br>
</br>
</br>
Of course, fighting videos were essential.</br>
</br>
The two Black Hawks descended in tandem and dropped ropes from the hatches on the sides. Hooks hung on the ropes, and a total of twelve heavily-armed soldiers slid down to the open swimming pool. After the sudden appearance of these living creatures, the zombies shifted their blank gazes in their direction.</br>
</br>
The soldier taking the lead took a deep breath, made two hand gestures to his comrades behind him, quickly lifted his muzzle and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Fire!"</br>
</br>
An orange-yellow light flashed and rifle bullets rang out on the cruise ship's deck.</br>
</br>
"Roar!!!"</br>
</br>
Howling, the zombies rushed toward the landing soldiers. The two Black Hawks adjusted their angles, the gunners fixed their grenade launchers on the steel staircase providing access to the deck, and pulled the trigger.</br>
</br>
Boom—</br>
</br>
Steel fragments mixed with flesh filled the air. The staircase was blown into iron slags. The zombies fell back down in an attempt to rush from the bottom floor to the deck. Under cover, the soldiers landing on the deck were divided into two teams and quickly rushed to the stairs.</br>
</br>
Under the protection of kinetic skeletons, zombie teeth and claws didn't pose a threat to the Celestial Trade soldiers. The residual T virus wasn't a threat at all to those who injected the E-grade genetic vaccine.</br>
</br>
Team A headed to the captain's room and team B began to rescue survivors.</br>
</br>
Because of the nature of the incident, the Level Four warning was upgraded to a Level Two warning. Celestial Trade Marines were onboard a small landing ship to provide reinforcements. Jiang Chen glanced at the cruise ship under thick smoke and took the combat video tablet from Ivan.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Garrett, a former UA Marine Corps soldier, previously served in Iraq. Like most comrades, he chose to join a private military contractor after retiring. Originally, he considered Blackwater and Trefoil Jungle, but he chose Celestial Trade in the end.</br>
</br>
He really didn't want to go back to the god-forbidden place known as Iraq. His dream was to live the rest of his life on the picturesque West Pacific Island and risk his life for Wall Street tycoons and "gardeners" living in the White House.</br>
</br>
What's more, his salary from Celestial Trade wasn't low, and after retiring, there would also be a generous pension.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, reality seemed to differ slightly from his ideal. He not only didn't get any rest, but at the beginning of the year, he was fighting a modern war? He was also then airdropped into zombie-filled Kejia for "peacekeeping"?</br>
</br>
Was this really a military contractor?</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the income Celestial Trade provided was great, the high-tech equipment offered great protection, and the military casualty rate was also shockingly low. Sometimes, he couldn't help thinking that the kinetic skeleton he was wearing was far superior to the one from DARPA's lab.</br>
</br>
DARPA was known as the the UA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as S.H.I.E.L.D. From the Internet to the GPS, they were behind all the technical innovations.</br>
</br>
Since he had excellent combat qualities, he was incorporated into the Celestial Trade Rapid Reaction Force after the Moro War. Originally, he thought his days would be more leisurely, but he ended being unlucky once again.</br>
</br>
Those damn zombies.</br>
</br>
Hell, where did they come from?</br>
</br>
He crossed the red-carpeted hallway and made it into the hall entrance. The captain's room was located on the top floor just above the lobby. The power system hadn't been interrupted, and the shortest distance to get to the captain's room was by the elevator. After confirming the route from his helmet screen, Garrett gestured at his comrades to prepare to break in.</br>
</br>
His kinetic skeleton activated, and his kick directly busted open the metal gate of the lobby, sending the zombies behind the door flying.</br>
</br>
Garret directly smashed a zombie's brain. Without any hesitation, he raised his rifle and pressed the trigger along with his comrades who broke into the two sides of the door.</br>
</br>
"Bang-"</br>
</br>
Bullets shredded the wooden decorations and zombie flesh. Pieces scattered the empty lobby. As seen from the clothes strewn about, a ball was underway when the infection broke out. Halfway through the ball, the singing stopped abruptly, and the men and women on the dance floor began to bite each other...</br>
</br>
He felt nauseated thinking about that alone.</br>
</br>
Zombies continued to rush at them, and the fire network formed by the group of six gradually began to lose its effectiveness.</br>
</br>
Garrett fiercely gestured to his comrade, Norman, the main gunner. He understood and took out a grenade launcher from his backpack and launched a grenade at a zombie-dense spot.</br>
</br>
Boom, ten zombies exploded. The ones who didn't die but lost their arms and legs fell to the ground and twitched.</br>
</br>
Then five rounds of grenades flew out and the dense crowd of zombies was gone.</br>
</br>
Garrett and others at the door kept firing and quickly cleared the area</br>
</br>
"Area cleared."</br>
</br>
Relieved, Garrett lowered his rifle.</br>
</br>
But just then, an intermittent call for help came from the corner of the hall.</br>
</br>
"Help... help me..."</br>
</br>
Norman had just dropped the grenade launcher and he immediately lifted the assault rifle in his hands.</br>
</br>
"It's survivors."</br>
</br>
"Maybe they're infected."</br>
</br>
"Rescue?"</br>
</br>
Garrett was silent for two seconds.</br>
</br>
"... Is the battle recorder open?"</br>
</br>
"It's open."</br>
</br>
"Let's rescue... I'll go."</br>
</br>
Garrett signaled his comrades to remain cautious then he lowered his muzzle, wary of the undead zombies.</br>
</br>
As it turned out, his instincts were correct.</br>
</br>
As he crossed the room, a hand dangled on the ground, and a creeping zombie suddenly awakened and bit his leg. Garrett reacted quickly, lifting his right foot directly over the blood-stained mouth. He then stepped on its face and smushed it into ketchup.</br>
</br>
As he watched the red and white mixture, Garrett's eyebrows twitched.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful stomp." Bill whistled.</br>
</br>
"I think the captain needs to apply to the company to get some reimbursement to cover the psychiatrist's bill." Norman squeezed his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
"Shut up!"</br>
</br>
Garret kicked that corpse while cursing, suppressing the strong discomfort in his mind. He jogged toward the direction of the person seeking help.</br>
</br>
"OK, you'll be fine..."</br>
</br>
He flipped over a table fallen in the corner, and Garrett's expression suddenly froze.</br>
</br>
It was a body that obviously didn't belong to a living person and a cellphone stuck behind the long table with C4s...</br>
</br>
It wasn't a call for help; it was a recorded message</br>
</br>
"Lie down!"</br>
</br>
As he roared, he jumped to the ground. At the same time, he felt a hot air wave smashing into his back...</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Dust exploded, covering the entire hall.</br>
</br>
It was more than just one long table - almost one-third of the long tables were mounted with cigarette-box-sized C4s hidden by tablecloths, almost impossible to notice.</br>
</br>
The bombs were hidden earlier, originally intended to be used for retreat by Tanaka. He didn't expect Celestial Trade to actually receive the cruise ship's distress signal and quickly dispatch a rescue force.</br>
</br>
He thought, at best, he would encounter Country F's Coastal Guards.</br>
</br>
Standing on the floor just above the hall, Tanaka shook his head, throwing away the detonator. A rare smile-less expression appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
After a while, he looked at the dust downstairs and said to himself.</br>
</br>
"I thought I could take at least two with me, but I didn't even manage to take one…"</br>
</br>
He threw the rifle down to the dance floor, pulled a lighter from his pocket, and lit himself a cigarette.</br>
</br>
He blew out a smoke ring and sighed.</br>
</br>
"Another waste of life."</br>
</br>
The cigarette slipped to the ground, the flames suddenly rose, and instantly ignited the floor covered with gasoline.</br>
</br>
The burning flames reached his pants. With a smile, Tanaka removed his flat cap and was incinerated in the rising flames…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 699: Permission to Arres</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The power system was interrupted and the hall plunged into darkness. The only thing visible was the flames burning on the platform just above the hall. Burning droplets dripped from the edge of the platform continuously and the burning thick smoke gathered above like heavy clouds.</br>
</br>
*Cough cough...* Norman pushed down the stone slab on his chest and stood up with his rifle.</br>
</br>
The polyethylene bullet-proof plate on his chest was cracked and pressed against his ribcage. He called out the hologram screen and deactivated the front armor. He heard the sound of air being filled as he ripped off the armor in front of his chest.</br>
</br>
Dust was everywhere.</br>
</br>
"Garrett!"</br>
</br>
Norman who regained his breath, opened his helmet mask and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Damn! Bill!"</br>
</br>
"Cough, I'm not dead. I'm here."</br>
</br>
The sound came from the radio channel.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the sound, Norman immediately turned on his tactical flashlight, searched around, and soon saw a hand sticking up in the gravel pile.</br>
</br>
Norman ran to it with his rifle. He moved the stone pressed against Bill and pulled him out of the rubble. Under the driving force of the kinetic skeleton, this weight was nothing at all.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, my leg would've been gone if I was there a bit longer." As he collapsed by the side, Bill gritted his teeth and extracted his deformed right leg armor.</br>
</br>
Then Norman rescued three other comrades one after the other, but he didn't find his captain Garret.</br>
</br>
"Garrett! Damnit, where are you?!"</br>
</br>
The life signal detection device was on the captain who happened to be missing. Norman anxiously scanned the captain's previous position, but the blast had already sent Garret to God-knew-where. Not to mention he could be dead or alive!</br>
</br>
"What about the mission?"</br>
</br>
"Bill, you go with Sean and Freddy to the captain's room. Jim and I will stay here to search for the captain!"</br>
</br>
"Okay!" Bill nodded and gestured to his comrades.</br>
</br>
"Wait!"</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
"Be careful." Norman looked at him in the eyes and said seriously, "Our enemies aren't just zombies."</br>
</br>
A few figures suddenly dashed in from the entrance. Norman, Bill, and others immediately raised their rifles.</br>
</br>
Both teams aimed at each other.</br>
</br>
Tactical flashlights under the muzzle forced him to narrow his eyes; he couldn't see who was at the door.</br>
</br>
Just then, a hoarse voice entered the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"Friendly."</br>
</br>
Norman was taken aback. He immediately confirmed the presence of green dots on the map then lowered the rifle in his hands.</br>
</br>
It seemed that after the explosion, they were in a coma for some time, and at this time, the reinforcements arrived.</br>
</br>
From the digital camouflage kinetic skeleton, the other team was indeed the Marines, the primary task unit of Celestial Trade. Norman, like Captain Garrett, was transferred from the Marines to the Rapid Response Force, so they were on familiar terms.</br>
</br>
</br>
But what he hadn't expected was an unexpected person behind the force.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen!</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade's boss! Why would he show up here?</br>
</br>
Soldiers entering the hall divided into two teams - a team to open the life detection device to join the search and rescue work, and the other team stayed by Jiang Chen's side.</br>
</br>
Under the protection of more than a dozen Marines, Jiang Chen walked up to Norman.</br>
</br>
Norman put down his rifle, stood up straight and saluted.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen glanced at the fragments around the place and asked in a deep and concerned tone.</br>
</br>
"We broke into the hall and cleared the zombies. The captain heard a cry for help and walked over, but someone detonated a bomb," Norman immediately reported.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and remained silent, but he looked directly above the hall platform.</br>
</br>
The interior decorations were ignited and the fire had begun to spread. Even across a distance of ten meters, he could still clearly feel the rising heat waves.</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed, shook his head and said to himself.</br>
</br>
"It seems my approach was too merciful."</br>
</br>
"Sir?" Norman asked with confusion.</br>
</br>
"Nothing. I just think that treating some villains should be like treating zombies. Before they cause any more harm, shoot them, regardless of the consequences, and make their heartbeats stop... Sergeant Norman, do you agree with me?"</br>
</br>
All along, Jiang Chen hadn't cared too much about the Kurofune. Or, even if he cared, he didn't invest too much energy to investigate.</br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical was a Nippon-owned company and was a reputable firm in the country. However, there was a high risk of executing military operations in developed countries, not to mention that FBA and CIB had been involved in the investigation. So, Jiang Chen also didn't concern himself with it. He sent a Ghost Agent, but he didn't authorize her to execute a capture, or infiltrate and carry out other illegal espionage activities. Instead, he simply wanted her to gather intelligence…</br>
</br>
Originally, he thought "Kurofune" would be restrained by the Nippon government to some extent, but he was wrong.</br>
</br>
Although affiliated with the government, they obviously didn't completely listen to the government.</br>
</br>
After all, counting on a bunch of terrorists who wanted to destroy humans was impractical from any perspective.</br>
</br>
Soon, the Marines dragged Garrett out from the rubble.</br>
</br>
"Still alive?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"His life signal is active, but it's weak and he needs urgent medical treatment," replied the soldier who carried the stretcher.</br>
</br>
"Go quickly."</br>
</br>
"ROGER!"</br>
</br>
The fire was spreading ablaze, and the soldiers beside Jiang Chen stepped forward and whispered to him.</br>
</br>
"The fire is out of control, Commander, please retreat."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and said nothing. He turned and left.</br>
</br>
Escorted by a soldier, Jiang Chen returned to the helicopter. Looking at the cruise ship, the fire had spread to the middle of the cruise ship. The cruise ship was like an alcohol lamp floating on the high sea.</br>
</br>
Two hundred survivors curled up on the deck of the rescue boat with no joy of survival on their faces - there was only deep horror.</br>
</br>
Three thousand tourists in total, who had bought tickets to enjoy the holidays, hadn't expected such hellish terror to break out on the Pacific Ocean on this beautiful day.</br>
</br>
A child wailed to his mother, a man gently patted a woman's back and said words that couldn't even comfort himself. Medical staff on the deck traversed throughout the crowd, checking their bodies and injecting Future Biology's anti-T virus vaccine...</br>
</br>
The evacuation was successful; some were wounded, but no one was fatally hurt.</br>
</br>
The worst off was Sergeant Garrett - the explosion damaged his spine. He would probably have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair…</br>
</br>
The fire was becoming more ferocious. Once it reached the fuel tank, the cruise ship was likely to explode. In order to prevent themselves from being affected, the helicopters and rescue boat evacuated immediately.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked expressionlessly at the cruise ship disappearing. Just then, his phone suddenly rang.</br>
</br>
He picked up.</br>
</br>
"Hey."</br>
</br>
"Among the survivors was a man called Zhu Tianyou. When we found him, he was being tied up in a bathtub full of water. When he was rescued, he was unconscious. We suspected he might be associated with this terrorist attack, so he's under intensive care and being monitored by our medical staff. "</br>
</br>
"You did well. Send him to New Moon Island, and I will personally ask him."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
After he hung up the phone, Jiang Chen called Ayesha.</br>
</br>
"Order the Ghost Agents to go to Nippon. Within a week, I'd like to see the President of Takeda Pharmaceutical appearing in the interrogation room on New Moon Island."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 700: Do you want to seek revenge?</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In Coro Island hospital, Garrett stared at the ceiling in a daze.</br>
</br>
He was under thirty years old, but the doctor told him he would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He had seen the diagnosis and also signed on it, but he couldn't accept the facts.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade had excellent welfare. If he lost his ability to work due to work-related injuries, not only would he receive a large sum of discharge funds, but the rest of his life would be guaranteed by Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
However, no amount of money could make him smile.</br>
</br>
He would rather not have the money if he could have his health back...</br>
</br>
But he knew it was impossible. With present-day medical conditions, it simply wasn't enough to cure his injury.</br>
</br>
The door opened and an unexpected person appeared at the door.</br>
</br>
Garrett nodded.</br>
</br>
"Forgive me for not saluting. you. It's a miracle I can still joke with you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and went to the bed.</br>
</br>
"You can still joke; looks like you're in a good mood."</br>
</br>
Garrett shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No, this isn't a joke. I'm telling the truth."</br>
</br>
"I know." Jiang Chen nodded and looked at the flowers on the nightstand. "Has your wife been here?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Garrett replied.</br>
</br>
"I'm really sorry about your injury ..."</br>
</br>
"No, you don't need to be sorry." Garrett shook his head. "Thanks to the kinetic skeleton's protection, I'm still lying here, staring blankly."</br>
</br>
Looking at his legs, Jiang Chen pondered for a moment and suddenly said, "Do you want to seek revenge?"</br>
</br>
"Revenge?"</br>
</br>
"Well, against those who took your legs."</br>
</br>
Garrett laughed with self-mockery and shook his head, "You're joking with me again. I can't even walk out of bed, let alone seek revenge; I have to rely on my nurse to help me eat dinner."</br>
</br>
"What if I say ... I have a way to help you stand up?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Garrett was astonished.</br>
</br>
He wanted to say that was impossible, but he suddenly remembered his commander's other identity.</br>
</br>
President of Future Group!</br>
</br>
There was no such thing as "impossible" to Future Group. Whether it was artificial intelligence or virtual reality or graphene, they always created unbelievable miracles in front of people's own eyes.</br>
</br>
If that was Jiang Chen's promise, perhaps it would come true!</br>
</br>
Garrett gulped and prepared to speak.</br>
</br>
"But I have to remind you that the operation has a 10% success rate and we'll have to replace your entire damaged spine with titanium then install a special electronic neuron module. I guarantee that even with tranquilizers, this surgery will be extremely painful. "</br>
</br>
The success rate was 40%, but the pain would be real. After all, it was an operation done on the nerves. Jiang Chen wanted to know Garrett's limits, so he deliberately exaggerated the failure rate of the surgery.</br>
</br>
Garrett took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen originally thought he would be afraid; Jiang Chen didn't think he still had the energy left in him to joke.</br>
</br>
"Will I become Captain America?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was stunned by the question then he pleasantly laughed.</br>
</br>
"Of course not. Maybe you'll be stronger than him."</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Garrett agreed to surgery, which was also expected by Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After the conversation, he signed a confidentiality agreement.</br>
</br>
For whatever reason, the contents of the surgery couldn't be divulged, and the ability mustn't be used for unlawful conduct. The order of the organization had to be obeyed unconditionally and so on. The doctor would implant a slavery chip in his spine at the time of the operation. If he was guilty of betrayal, the slavery chip would blow up his spine's main control system and change him back into a crippled person.</br>
</br>
After the agreement was signed, he would be scheduled to be discharged and transferred to the New Moon Island underground facility, where the surgeon responsible for the enslaved chip implementation would undertake the spinal nerve replacement surgery.</br>
</br>
Even though Jiang Chen acquired some medical equipment for the surgery from the apocalypse, the mortality rate of the operation was still high under modern world medical conditions. However, while he was being taken to the hospital, Garrett's expression was unusually calm.</br>
</br>
He would rather die on the operating table than sit in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</br>
</br>
Even that meant that from now on, he would wear a "dog chain," do some dirty work for Jiang Chen and carry out more dangerous tasks than ever before.</br>
</br>
Luckily, the operation was very successful.</br>
</br>
The surgery not only replaced his spine but also replaced the bones in his limbs.</br>
</br>
Now, even without relying on the kinetic skeleton, he could bend a steel plate and pick up a car. He had a 6-inch graphene circuit board, integrated retinal imaging, radio life signal detection devices, UAV control components, and motion signal modems implanted in the posterior cranium.</br>
</br>
Intuitively speaking, as long he had a rifle, he could easily take on a team if both sides had no support on the battlefield.</br>
</br>
The environment would make no difference.</br>
</br>
At the same time Garrett's operation was completed, Jiang Chen saw Zhu Tianyou, who regained his consciousness in a ward on New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou made out the person visiting him and looked surprised.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
"Do you know me?" Jiang Chen looked at Zhu Tianyou unexpectedly and asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Who in this world doesn't know you?" Zhu Tianyou smiled feebly.</br>
</br>
"Drug lords also read the newspaper?"</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou's expression didn't change.</br>
</br>
"It seems nothing can blind Mr. Jiang's eyes."</br>
</br>
"The Xiangjiang government asked me about you and I told them you weren't on the list of survivors," Jiang said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"What do you need me to do?" Zhu Tianyou's eyes closed and he spoke with straightforwardness.</br>
</br>
"Do you know this person?" Jiang Chen took the tablet from the bodyguard and threw it on Zhu Tianyou's bed.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou opened his eyes and glanced at the screen. His face instantly changed and he squeezed out a few words from his clenched teeth.</br>
</br>
"I would recognize him even if he turned into ashes."</br>
</br>
"Tell me what you know," said Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"He tied me in the bathtub, turned on the tap and drowned me," Zhu Tianyou said with hatred.</br>
</br>
"Reason?"</br>
</br>
He hesitated, but with a sigh, he honestly confessed.</br>
</br>
"At that time, we were talking about business on the deck and he proposed to buy ten tons of salt from me."</br>
</br>
"Salt?" Jiang frowned.</br>
</br>
"Bath Salt, a kind of drug extracted from Arabian tea." Zhu Tianyou looked at Jiang Chen, paused for a moment then said, "But then I realized he only had 5 million Yen, not even enough for a fraction, so the deal fell apart."</br>
</br>
When he said this, Zhu Tianyou's face looked like he had just seen a ghost.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen asked quietly.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou took a deep breath to force himself to calm down.</br>
</br>
"Then... he took off his hat, and the whole person fell on the table. No breathing, no heartbeat, no pulse, dead! Yes, I thought he was dead, but a strange thing happened next!"</br>
</br>
"What strange thing?"</br>
</br>
"Someone died on board. It was definitely a nuisance for someone to die on board, especially since my identity is rather special. In order to prevent trouble, I asked my two bodyguards to pick him up, pretending he was drunk. Then they dragged him to the end of the boat and dropped him into the sea. As for myself, I returned to the room."</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou's face turned paler.</br>
</br>
"In the room, he was sitting in a chair and smiling at me..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was deep in thought.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, Tanaka was still alive and hadn't died on the plane. The infection was also his responsibility. The problem laid in that hat - the hat was like a switch. He would die after it was removed.</br>
</br>
The problem was that Tanaka seemed to have more than "one life."</br>
</br>
How did he do it?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen furrowed.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

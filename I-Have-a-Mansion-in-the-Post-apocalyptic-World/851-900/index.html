<div class="caption">Chapter 851: New TransAsia</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"This is a document sent by the Nobel Committee. This is sent by the International Biological Certification Alliance," As Zhang Yapin went through the pile, he picked up some of the letters from the stack of files on the table and pulled them aside. "...and these."</br>
</br>
"My assistant will pick up these documents after." Jiang Chen looked at the documents with disdain. Afraid of trouble, he didn't flip through them. "Today I'm here not to deal with these troublesome trifles."</br>
</br>
"What else?" Zhang Yaping put his hand on his head, visibly annoyed, feeling a headache.</br>
</br>
"Well, something else," said Jiang Chen as he took out an envelope from his suit and put it on the table. With a reserved smile, he said, "Looks like I have to trouble you again."</br>
</br>
Looking at the two dark circles on his eyes, Jiang Chen, who continued to trouble others, was rather embarrassed and felt guilty.</br>
</br>
"It's okay. I'm used to it." Zhang Yaping sighed and picked up the letter. He scanned through the lines and he began to look intrigued. "New TransAsia Economic and Trade Cooperation Organization? I remember Asia has an ASEAN. There is also a Wanghai Economic Cooperation Organization. Why do we have to set up a separate one?"</br>
</br>
"Because our influence is growing. If New TransAsia Economic and Trade Cooperation Organization are established, we can draw at least three members. That is, Moro, Malaysia, and Country F." Jiang Chen smiled and called out a map from his watch to draw a red circle on the map of Asia. "Compared with ASEAN, New TransAsia will focus more on economic cooperation. We will work together in international trade, labor and environment, intellectual property rights, tariffs, and other issues."</br>
</br>
As long as they exerted enough influence in the economy, influencing other areas wouldn't be too far away.</br>
</br>
"We already have three partners. How many countries will join next will have to rely on your diplomatic means," Jiang Chen said to Zhang Yaping.</br>
</br>
"Diplomacy…?" Zhang Yaping pushed up his glasses and thought for a moment. "The key point is what can we offer as a bargaining chip to convince other Asian countries to join New TransAsia that we have established? If it is just an unfulfilled promise, even the most clever diplomat will not achieve any results."</br>
</br>
"There are two chips; technology, and the Xin Reserve," Jiang Chen said with confidence.</br>
</br>
"Technology? Xin Reserve?" Zhang Yaping frowned and repeated in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Our neighboring countries have abundant natural resources and labor resources, but their technologies are generally lagging behind. I believe that with the use of technology as bait, they definitely will be tempted." Jiang Chen smiled. "So, we can use this as the entry point, persuade them to join our New TransAsia."</br>
</br>
"Will you take out the technology and share it with them?" Zhang Yaping looked at Jiang Chen without a word. He was very clear about the extent to which the Future Group's secrecy on technology was achieved.</br>
</br>
</br>
"On a limited level," Jiang Chen said with a smile. "Take this for example, with growing demand and wider application of graphene materials, the production capability of New Malaysia Special District is absolutely not enough to meet the demand. We can share technology that is not sensitive, and then use their labor force to earn profits for us, while focusing on higher-level interests..."</br>
</br>
"What about the Xin Reserve?"</br>
</br>
"The Xin Reserve can provide investment for members of the New TransAsia," said Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"...I remember that the Xin Reserve's main funding comes from Future Bank. Do you have that much money? This kind of investment at the national level will not just be in the range of 10 to 20 billion," Zhang Yaping questioned.</br>
</br>
"We may only have 10 to 20 billion now, but it doesn't mean that we will only have this much next year. Imagine the sky above us. The resources there are unlimited. By next year, I promise you, whether it's the Dollar or the Yuan, they will all become a figure for Future Group." Jiang Chen explained with confidence.</br>
</br>
Looking at the confident smile on his face, Zhang Yaping shrugged, said nothing, and put away the letter.</br>
</br>
"Well, since you've said that, then... I'll probably be able to arrange some time next week. The first stop will be Malaysia."</br>
</br>
"There is no rush at all even if you visited at the end of the year. I am looking forward to hearing good news from you." Jiang Chen smiled and got up. "What we are willing to give if they cooperate is in that letter. You and your advisor should discuss it and draft a plan."</br>
</br>
"I thought you would put a specific plan on my desk," Zhang Yaping said while feeling speechless.</br>
</br>
Although he had predicted that Jiang Chen would certainly toss the burden on him, he never thought that the New TransAsia proposed by this guy didn't even have a specific implementation plan. It was not wiping his butt for him, it was sh*tting for him!</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, this thing can be thought out slowly. I will send the President of the Xin Reserve to discuss things with you, and the economic consultants of Future Group think tank. We have many talents in the economic field, but we are lacking relatively in the political area. So I say no hurry, this thing should be discussed with everyone." With an irresponsible laugh, Jiang Chen bid farewell.</br>
</br>
After leaving the Presidential Palace, Jiang Chen sat in his Lamborghini.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who waited in the car, took off her sunglasses, casually hung it on her collar, and started the car.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going?"</br>
</br>
"To the port."</br>
</br>
"Not going to the company today?"</br>
</br>
"No. Take me to the headquarters of the Ghost Agents. I have something to do," Jiang Chen said while checking the time on his watch.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Ghost Agents were headquartered on a small island 100 kilometers from Coro Island, where the first group of agents was trained. The mansion in the center of the island was originally Jiang Chen's private property but was later converted into a training facility for the training of this special force that directly reported to him.</br>
</br>
With the expansion of influence, Ghost Agents were now no longer obtaining new blood from online recruitment. Instead, they recruited through charitable organizations supported by Future Group that shelter orphans who had become homeless in war-torn regions around the world.</br>
</br>
The orphans that were selected were often 13 to 15 years old. This was the age group most easily influenced. They would receive semi-brainwashing education with the help of the AI program and forget about the teaching of their faith. This would ensure that without the slavery chip, they would offer their most loyal support to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
This practice may be inhumane. But from a different perspective, without the help of Future Group, they may have died in a more tragic way from war or hunger.</br>
</br>
After all, Future Group was an enterprise, not a charitable organization.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only promised that Ghost Agents can retire at the age of 30. After the age of 30, they can choose to retire or to transfer to office jobs and leave their former field agent life. Genetic vaccine made their lifespan longer than ordinary people for about twenty years. From the perspective of equivalent exchange, what they sacrificed was equal or more than what they had gained.</br>
</br>

<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 852: Ghost Island</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Since being established as a training base for Ghost Agents, the island was removed from the official map of Xin and given a new name - Ghost Island.</br>
</br>
The name certainly fitted with its current identity.</br>
</br>
The nearby sea was classified as a military restricted zone. No one except authorized personnel could approach in the 20 kilometers vicinity of the island. Those who were allowed to enter and leave the island without authorization are only Jiang Chen and Ayesha. Ayesha was the chief instructor and the Minister of Intelligence.</br>
</br>
At noon, a Blackhawk helicopter soared from the horizon and landed on the helicopter pad.</br>
</br>
The blond female instructor wearing a kinetic skeleton stepped forward and confirmed the identity of the two. She then stood firm and saluted, before taking them to the training facilities in the center of the island.</br>
</br>
Along the way, Jiang Chen saw many exotic faces. They mainly came from Eastern Europe and the Middle East, currently in the midst of unrest, and some from Asia. In addition to the necessary skills be an agent, the educational programs on the Phantom helmets there would also teach them basic knowledge including language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.</br>
</br>
When the three walked along the edge of the training ground, the instructors and young trainees saluted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that the pairs of young eyes all flashed with gratitude and adoration.</br>
</br>
Apart from being relieved, it did make him feel somewhat unpleasant.</br>
</br>
Other than paying money to "buy" them, he thought he has done nothing worthy of their worship. The reason why they developed this kind of thinking was only that the education program in the Phantom has subtly influenced them, and it was Future Group who rescued them from the chaos of the war.</br>
</br>
Of course, ignoring his guilty conscience of influencing the girls, Jiang Chen felt fantastic being praised by so many beautiful women.</br>
</br>
Because of their genes, and after more than two years of conditioning, these previously young and malnourished girls transformed into women with perfect figures. The tight lines under the military green shirt showed their vitality and youth. The most exciting thing was that even if he made an inappropriate request to call one of them into his room, no one would resist, instead, wholeheartedly...</br>
</br>
Under Ayesha's puzzled eyes, Jiang Chen suddenly coughed and dispelled the unhealthy thoughts in his mind.</br>
</br>
Decency was still necessary.</br>
</br>
On the way, Jiang Chen learned that the blond female instructor named was Betty. She was one of the first Ghost Agents personally trained by Ayesha.</br>
</br>
Now, she was twenty-one years old and she was from Eastern Europe. She was a tall and cheerful girl. However, due to her tall stature, she was not suitable for fieldwork and instead became responsible for training Ghost Agents on Ghost Island</br>
</br>
Under instructors Betty's lead, Jiang Chen and Ayesha came to the filing room on the ground floor of the mansion. A commercial quantum computer that served as a server for more than 500 Phantom helmets was located there.</br>
</br>
</br>
Through the double inspection of iris and fingerprint, Jiang Chen obtained the authority of the quantum computer.</br>
</br>
Then he took out a thumb-sized USB from his pocket and inserted it into the slot of the server.</br>
</br>
Soon, a series of progress bars displayed on the holographic screen to complete the installation of the program.</br>
</br>
"This is?" Betty asked.</br>
</br>
"This is a new training program. Ghost Agents will be equipped with new equipment. I need you to have a preview on the helmet beforehand." Jiang Chen's fingers clicked a few times on the holographic screen and then closed the operating authority.</br>
</br>
[New equipment?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's words shocked the blonde instructor.</br>
</br>
The "invisibility clothing" that could make someone disappear out of thin air was already shocking enough to the world. Now the president just told her that the Ghost Agents would now be equpped with even newer technology? How advanced could it be?</br>
</br>
However, this suspense did not last for too long. The first shipment of several pieces of equipment was already in the Blackhawk helicopter.</br>
</br>
These "new weapons" were nothing more than the Python drones and Reptile robots that were captured from Lin Chaoen in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
One was a high-load low-altitude attack drone, and the other was a fully armed mobile ammunition platform. On the training ground, Jiang Chen ordered Ayesha to demonstrate to these Ghost Agents how to control these powerful support weapons through the wristwatch and destroy soft and hard ground targets.</br>
</br>
If a Hummingbird drone, only capable of carrying 60 rounds of small bullets, was considered a "mosquito", then the Python could be considered a ferocious eagle. As for the Reptile robot that used firearms and grenade launchers to unleash destruction, it was, without doubt, a "Demolition Expert". Not only was it an efficient killer against soft targets, but it could also tear the bunker apart, and even threaten armored units at close range!</br>
</br>
After seeing such powerful weapons, the trainees and instructors in the training field all popped their eyes wide open.</br>
</br>
After recovering from the shock, Betty expressed her confusion.</br>
</br>
"Do we really need these weapons?"</br>
</br>
With such a fearsome weapon, for agents who mainly engage in intelligence gathering and investigations, they offered little practical value. Additionally, the Python drone's size was at least dozens of times that of a Hummingbird and almost half the height of an average person. It was not convenient to carry.</br>
</br>
As for the Reptile robot, just looking at the bazooka set at the top of the "turtle shell", would definitely be better fitted for the battlefield.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen's reply was very concise and clear.</br>
</br>
"We can use it."</br>
</br>
Seeing Betty still not understand his intention, Jiang Chen explained.</br>
</br>
"In the future, the work of Ghost Agents will not only be limited to infiltration and intelligence gathering. Collaboration with Sea Lions Special Forces to decapitate and destroy ground facilities will also be tasks that you may handle. For those who are good at concealment and infiltration, they are more suitable to use support weapons to provide aid to the Sea Lions engaging from the front."</br>
</br>
Betty nodded, but she then hesitantly asked.</br>
</br>
"I have another question. I don't know if it's convenient to ask?"</br>
</br>
"No need to worry, please go ahead."</br>
</br>
"Are we… going to war again?" Betty asked carefully.</br>
</br>
Hearing this question, Jiang Chen laughed and said in a sly voice.</br>
</br>
"War? The war has already begun."</br>
</br>
Yes, the war with the Freemasonry began long ago.</br>
</br>
The civil war in Madagascar was reaching its tipping point, and it was almost ready to close the net.</br>
</br>
After this would be Turkey, Ukraine, followed by Europe. Celestial Trade would extend its tentacles to the world and completely overwhelm the Freemasonry's living space. In order to avoid escalating the situation, he would try to avoid launching a large-scale war. Instead, he would use these agents and special forces as much as possible to surgically remove the forces of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
After presenting new equipment to these future agents, Jiang Chen went on to examine their training and ate dinner with the orphans on the island. Before the sun was about to disappear from the horizon, Jiang Chen with Ayesha returned to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
After returning to the mansion, Jiang Chen took a shower and was preparing to spend some intimate moments with the lovely Ayesha, when his watch suddenly shook. Lin Lin's call request came over from the apocalypse, saying that she had news to share and for him to hurry back.</br>
</br>
Upon seeing this, Jiang Chen had to regretfully cancel his plan and traveled back to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>

</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the black "storage tank" in the backyard of the mansion as well as the intricately entangled pipelines, Jiang Chen questioned.</br>
</br>
"The essence of science and technology!" Lin Lin raised her chest. Her mouth turned into a crescent moon as she proudly announced.</br>
</br>
"Speak English..." Jiang Chen facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"In a nutshell, it is a magnetic confinement device used to store antimatter—"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin didn't even finish speaking when Jiang Chen subconsciously took a step back.</br>
</br>
[WHAT? Antimatter this size?]</br>
</br>
"In the tank... everything is antimatter?"</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen's expression, Lin Lin burst out laughing, waving her hand.</br>
</br>
"No, there is only 0.1 milligram of antimatter in the middle. However, it must be stored with such a large magnetic confinement device."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing Lin Lin's explanation, Jiang Chen felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Dozens of milligrams of antimatter could be used as fuel and propel a spacecraft to Mars in six weeks. One kilogram of antimatter exposed to the air could blow up the entire Earth. One ton of antimatter could make the Earth the second largest asteroid belt in the solar system.</br>
</br>
It was not unreasonable for the Science and Ethics Committee of this timeline to ban the development of antimatter. The material was too dangerous on Earth. Everyone may explode together because of an experimental accident</br>
</br>
However, it amazed Jiang Chen that 0.1 milligram of antimatter was stored in such a large storage tank. After all, the gift given to him by the Remnants of the Void was only the size of the bottle.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Lin Lin read what Jiang Chen was thinking as she coughed to hide her embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Ahem. After all, our research on antimatter is only in the very beginning stages. They should have easier access to antimatter in the void compared to us."</br>
</br>
"Why?" Jiang Chen asked curiously.</br>
</br>
"There is an argument that the void itself does not have the concept of space. The positive and negative substances that exist in it cannot pass through the specific medium interface... It is very troublesome to explain. It is as if we want to find a drop of water in a desert without an oasis while they are on the beach; their left hand is holding the sand while their right hold is holding the water. Of course, this is only a theory. After all, people who entered the void cannot come back," Lin Lin explained.</br>
</br>
"I see... But what can this 0.1 milligram of antimatter do?"</br>
</br>
"It can't do anything." Lin Lin shook her head and said with repentance, "The manufacturing process of antimatter is not difficult. In the 21st century, trace amounts of antimatter can be observed through the Large Hadron Collider. It is just that the antimatter particle exists for a very short amount of time. There is no way to save it in the universe filled with positive matter. After analyzing the void technology, this magnetic confinement device I designed can store antimatter in small quantities, but I can't think of the usage of this stuff other than bombs. It is also inappropriate to use it for bombs as the cost is more than a thousand times that of an equivalent bomb."</br>
</br>
</br>
"This storage… Hmm, what is the TNT equivalency of the magnetic confinement device?" Jiang Chen asked, pointing to the tank.</br>
</br>
"According to the energy equation, one gram of antimatter annihilation releases energy equivalent to three nuclear bombs. The actual killing effect may exceed tennuclear bombs." Lin Lin quickly gave an answer.</br>
</br>
The antimatter destruction power of one gram was only equivalent to three nuclear bombs. Considering the cost of production, this 0.1 milligram of antimatter really did not offer practical value. However, as a scientific area in its infancy, this result was pleasing.</br>
</br>
In order to reward Lin Lin's efforts, Jiang Chen brought her three boxes of pudding created from the hands of a Belgian pastry master. Looking at Lin Lin's joyous face as she embraced the boxes and ran to the kitchen, a smile emerged from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
As usual, Yao Yao made a tableful of dishes. Most of the fresh vegetables on the table came from the farms in Garden of Eden, while roast turkey and pork came from Earth. Now that life in the apocalypse under NAC had gradually improved, the time spent eating canned food was not missed.</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the grayish-yellow radiation cloud in the sky, and the destroyed streets outside the window, just around this table, there was no feeling of the apocalypse at all.</br>
</br>
Five people surrounded the dining table and happily enjoyed a sumptuous lunch. They chatted about the funny things that happened around the base and all the way to Yizhou Island that was still under development. After the Mud Crabs crisis ceased to exist, the crab eggs and crab roe flew into Wanghai in the form of specialty products, and they were well received by restaurants in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
The visionary businessman even opened a cannery and made these crab roes into delicious canned goods and sold them farther away.</br>
</br>
As they chattered, the topic changed into the modern world.</br>
</br>
When they heard that Future Group led by Jiang Chen was actually controlling three countries, the eyes of Sun Jiao, Yao Yao, Xiaorou, and Lin Lin all sparkled. It would be great to see the other side, but unfortunately the interdimensional study of the moving living had no progress at all.</br>
</br>
But everyone knew that there will be a day.</br>
</br>
After the meal, Jiang Chen went to the office and found Han Junhua, who was dealing with military affairs.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation in the north?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua's open mouth stopped moving as she opened a holographic screen to lock on the map the Hanzhong area of northern Hua. Jiang Chen looked at the name of the Northern Alliance Area and narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"I remember they are located in Lanzhou?"</br>
</br>
"A year ago in Lanzhou," added Han Junhua. After a pause, she continued, "Since last year, they have been migrating south. Under the leadership of the new commander, they wiped out the zombie and mutants in the Hanzhong region. Then they gradually migrated the population of the Northern Alliance Area, setting up settlements along this tributary of the Yangtze River."</br>
</br>
"Why are they doing this?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"We sent out Aurora-20s to survey the target area, but we did not gather any useful intelligence. They used air defense missiles to force away our fighter. From any point of view, they are acting in a very unfriendly manner," said Han Junhua.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen once again set his sights on the map.</br>
</br>
Migration meant giving up years of development. Whether it was arable land or city walls, the price they paid was quite high. He was curious as to what was forcing the "country" that first established order to abandon the land.</br>
</br>
However, there were more real problems now that he must face.</br>
</br>
If the Northern Alliance Area had already relocated to the Hanzhong area, if they took a ship and sailed down the Yangtze River, they could easily reach Wu City. From there, the next stop would be Hongcheng, the outpost of NAC in the east.</br>
</br>
The series of actions of the Northern Alliance Area in Hongcheng already alerted him.</br>
</br>
Preparing for the worst, chances were that they had long set their crosshair on Wanghai. When the coup d'etat occurred in the Sixth Street, the image brought by the Dark Red Chamber of Commerce was a declaration of war on the survivors of Wanghai several years ago.</br>
</br>
In that video, the commander of the Northern Alliance Area also seemed to mention the word "treasure." The head of the Dark Red Chamber of Commerce interpreted it as the wreckage of the God's Cane, but it turned out to be false. After NAC regained control of the city center of Wanghai from the mutants, it did not find anything that could be considered a "treasure".</br>
</br>
"Have you ever tried to get our pilots to avoid Hanzhong and fly directly to Lanzhou? I'm curious what happened to cause hundreds of thousands of people to migrate southward," Jiang Chen replied.</br>
</br>
"Of course, but from the air, our pilots did not collect too much useful information," Han Junhua replied.</br>
</br>
"I see..." Jiang Chen slowly started to frown as he thought.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 854: The Growing Colony</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The best option was to improve their defensive efforts.</br>
</br>
The deterrent power of the Aurora-20s in the modern world did not apply to the Northern Alliance Area. Although Aurora-20s did not detect the presence of fighter aircrafts that belonged to Northern Alliance Area, those who inherited Pan-Asia Cooperation Technology such as ground-based air defense missiles and laser air defense weapons could be deadly threats to Aurora-20s with.</br>
</br>
If a war would break out, the outcome of the war would undoubtedly be decided on land.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stayed for three days in the apocalypse and then returned to the present world.</br>
</br>
This time he brought back ten new Aurora-20s from the Sixth Street Military Factory and the new K1 kinetic skeleton production line built by Zhao Group.</br>
</br>
The kinetic skeleton previously was produced by the Sixth Street and Jiang Chen acted as the transporter to move the supplies to the modern world. However, now that the apocalypse must bear the pressure of the Northern Alliance Area, it would be stretched thin to also spare capacity to serve the modern world.</br>
</br>
Now Future Military was capable of scaling production and was fully capable of integrating this production line. Following the Hummingbird drone, another set of 22nd-century arms production lines settled on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
The whole set-up was tens of thousands of square meters in size. Jiang Chen chose Coconut Island where he docked the Droplet as a "transportation warehouse". After transferring all the equipment to the island, Jiang Chen called a transport ship of from Celestial Trade, dispatched a frigate to escort the ship, and transported every single screw to Ange Island.</br>
</br>
</br>
There was a clear bottleneck in the development of the industry due to manpower and resources in the apocalypse. However, this bottleneck did not exist for Future Group. Future Mining sent a continuous stream of ores to New Malaysia Special District, which was processed to steel there and transported to Ange Island. Future Military further treated the steel and refined it into C Grade steel and pour it into molds.</br>
</br>
The more sophisticated the internal structure was, the easier it was to be completed by the factory on Ange Island.</br>
</br>
All the kinetic skeleton outputted not only could fill the gap in the current expansion of the Foreign Corps in equipment but also could, in turn, meet the needs of the three major Corps of NAC in the apocalypse. Because there had been no war for a long time, the adoption of the kinetic skeleton of the several Corps in the apocalypse was not as high as the modern world.</br>
</br>
Though this situation may change very soon.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Two weeks passed since the beginning of the moon colonization project. From the images transmitted from the Moon, Guanghan City had already taken shape.</br>
</br>
Several barracks were placed on the edge of the crater. The colonists who wore spacesuits placed solar power generators on the open space. Before nuclear fusion generators were sent to Guanghan City, they could only rely on solar energy to maintain the operations of the colony.</br>
</br>
The mining stations were not far away from where the moon ice was being drilled and there was also a moon ore mine.</br>
</br>
Moon ice was one of the sources of the colony's drinking water and was also the main source of the colony's oxygen. The oxygen tanks carried on the spacecraft only could support the twenty-four colonists for a week, and in the following hours, all the oxygen would be obtained by the electrolysis of water.</br>
</br>
From the current point of view, it was the cheapest way to obtain oxygen. 1 liter of water that undergoes electrolysis could generate 0.623 cubic meters of oxygen and 1.25 cubic meters of hydrogen. Based on the oxygen content of 15% in air, the amount of pure oxygen consumed per person per day was only 0.5 cubic meters under normal atmospheric pressure. As for the by-product hydrogen, it was stored in a special container, and the carbon dioxide produced by their respiration could used to generate methanol and a small amount of water under the high-temperature catalyst.</br>
</br>
Methanol was used in production as an industrial raw material.</br>
</br>
As a result, a simple cycle was formed.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen sent them to the Moon, not just for them to figure out how to live. Every day, in addition to driving a lunar rover to explore the mines and maintain these facilities, they also shouldered the task of assisting ground scientists in carrying out scientific research.</br>
</br>
And in all scientific research projects, the most critical step was the collection of helium-3!</br>
</br>
The small mine site being built on the moon burdened this important responsibility.</br>
</br>
Since there was no global "dipole magnetic field" protection on the moon, solar winds containing carbon, nitrogen, and rare gas ions such as helium, neon, argon, and krypton could bombard the moon's surface, and enter moon soil particles, making the soil contain quite a lot of helium-3.</br>
</br>
As for the value of this energy, a set of data directly explained it. One kilogram of helium-3, if used to generate electricity, could produce 19 megawatts of energy; enough to light Moscow for six years. Only ten tons of helium-3 was needed for the electricity generation to be enough to power China for an entire year.</br>
</br>
In addition, for each ton of helium-3 extracted from the soil, 6,300 tons of hydrogen, 70 tons of nitrogen, and 1,600 tons of carbon were obtained. However, compared with the value of the former, the value of these by-products was negligible.</br>
</br>
The Moon soil itself was also rich in aluminum, iron, magnesium, titanium and other rare earth metal minerals.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen already possessed the nuclear fusion power generation technology. The power source of Penglai was the nuclear fusion generator from Yizhou Island in the apocalypse and several storage tanks of helium-3. What he needed next was to know how he could efficiently extract helium-3 from the Moon.</br>
</br>
It was one of the main tasks of these colonial pioneers and researchers.</br>
</br>
So far, the 24 colonies on the Moon cost Jiang Chen one billion Xin New Dollar.</br>
</br>
However, the money sepnt would be worth it.</br>
</br>
After the video ended, Kelvin spoke with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"NASA hopes that we can publicize the living condition of the colonists and share the investigation of the Moon. They're willing to exchange this information with us for files that have not yet been disclosed to the United Nations."</br>
</br>
"Is that intelligence very important? I mean theirs." Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Kelvin thought for a moment.</br>
</br>
"Not very important, NASA officials disclosed that the unpublished files are mainly about the analysis of KREEP rock and the distribution of helium-3 reservoir in the Moon soil. Our researchers are also studying these things, but we just don't how far they are."</br>
</br>
"There is no need to exchange information with them. I believe that you will be in front of them in no time." Jiang Chen paused and then continued, "but the life of the colonists can be shared. After all, this is part of the propaganda. There are rumors on the Internet that is attacking us for using the astronauts as test rats. Are they dead now? Shooting a short video of their lives is a powerful counterattack! As for what content can be disclosed and what must be kept confidential, I think you should know."</br>
</br>
"You can be rest assured." Kelvin nodded.</br>
</br>
After giving him directions, Jiang Chen was preparing to leave. However, Kelvin stopped him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around.</br>
</br>
"What else?"</br>
</br>
"There is one more thing. Two days ago, our Space Launch Center received a visit request from the United Kingdom,"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
"Visit request? Don't we receive a stack of those every day?"</br>
</br>
"This person is a bit special. I couldn't directly refuse and must consult your opinion," Kelvin said cautiously.</br>
</br>
"Who? Is it the Queen of England?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"No, it's Hawking."</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 855: The Scholar in a Wheelchair</br>
</div></br>
</br>
At Coro International Airport, Jiang Chen met one of the greatest modern physicists in the world, the wheelchair professor, Hawking.</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, his appearance was different from the widely circulated image of being on a wheelchair. He was being pushed forward by his assistant and a Phantom helmet was on his head.</br>
</br>
"It's nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen. I wonder if there is any way you can make a small crack on the helmet? Wearing a helmet and using the electronic sound synthesis tool makes me feel a lot better. The doctor even said that I could live for two more years, but I can't see anything this way."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a second to process the information and then laughed.</br>
</br>
"I will ask my scientists to investigate this issue. It shouldn't be too difficult."</br>
</br>
"Thank you so much," the electronic voice responded.</br>
</br>
Given the influence of Hawking in the scientific community, Jiang Chen did not reject his request to visit the Space Launch Center. In a sense, he was more representative of the academic world than the researchers sent by NASA.</br>
</br>
Of course, he still knew what could be displayed and what couldn't be displayed.</br>
</br>
The ship arrived at the island where the launch center was located. A Celestial Trade bodyguard replaced his assistant's job and pushed the wheelchair next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"This is our launch site. The Celestial 4 is launched from here. That side is used to launch other types of rockets. We recently had some frequent space activities. There is basically a launch mission every other week." Jiang Chen introduced him while bringing him into the launch center.</br>
</br>
</br>
"An enviable budget," Hawking exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"That's because I didn't spend the taxpayer's money, and only my own money." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Entering the launch center, Kelvin welcomed them and took them to the ground command center responsible for the colony of Guanghan City. There, more than 50 personnel were busy at the computers with their tasks at hand.</br>
</br>
Hawking let the person pushing his wheelchair to take off his helmet. He didn't want to talk at the moment; he just wanted to see what this place looked like.</br>
</br>
Kelvin walked to a computer and touched several buttons on the screen. Soon, a hologram projected in front of everyone. The image came from Guanghan, 384,400 km away.</br>
</br>
"Here is the colony of Guanghan. What's the order, Commander." An astronaut appeared in the camera and asked Kelvin.</br>
</br>
"Report on the status of supplies."</br>
</br>
"Okay, just a second..."</br>
</br>
After listening to the astronaut' report on the oxygen, drinking water, collection of moon soil and other materials, with the help of Celestial Trade bodyguard, Hawking put on the Phantom helmet again and sincerely said.</br>
</br>
"I saw the future."</br>
</br>
"It is a privilege to receive this honor," Jiang Chen humbly responded.</br>
</br>
After a pause, Hawking continued.</br>
</br>
"Humans can't place all of our eggs in one basket, so they can't place all of the bets on one planet. I said this long ago, but unfortunately neither the British nor the UA government took this seriously. Spending taxpayers' money in Iraq is always much better than throwing it in the space without a future. Even if everyone knows it, the future will be there. History is always strikingly similar; Columbus also lobbied Britain, France, Italy, and Portugal. It's amazing that Icarus's paradox not only applies to businesses, but it also applies to some superpowers as well."</br>
</br>
"But in front of you is also a businessman," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
"But you are still very young and being young is always good." With that synthetic voice, Hawking said something ambiguous and difficult to interpret.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen couldn't stay there for too long. There was still a meeting on VRcity that he needed to attend to in the afternoon at Future Group. After leaving the task of hosting Hawking to Kelvin, Jiang Chen was preparing to leave the space launch center when his eyes suddenly stopped on Hawking's wheelchair.</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem?"</br>
</br>
Hawking had noticed his gaze as his helmet already off. With his finger tapping on the keyboard of the armrest, he asked Jiang Chen in the electronic voice.</br>
</br>
"One thing," Jiang Chen nodded, grinning at the old man, "I have a proposal. However, I don't know if you would be interested?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At the same time, a special hearing was being held in the Congress Building in Capital, UA.</br>
</br>
"...We must restart the Apollo Program immediately! Celestial Trade has already begun its colonization of the Moon. We have led the world for more than half a century, but now we are behind them. For the great UA people, this is unacceptable!"</br>
</br>
Standing in front of the hearing, NASA's Head Charles Bolden spoke passionately to the members of the hearing and tried to convince them to restart the Apollo Program. However, the Congress members in the hearings showed a lack of interest. Some people played with their pens, some people looked at Bolden with one eyebrow raised, and others simply turned to the next page in the document.</br>
</br>
Since 1972, NASA's has not received any sort of budget increase, but its budget was reduced by about 75% and has remained so for more than forty years. Unlike the Kennedy era, when NASA only needed to use one sentence—"The Soviet is also doing this!" for a large budget to be approved immediately. It was not a hassle at all.</br>
</br>
Now, the president gave the go ahead, and as long as the Congress was willing to allocate the budget, the Apollo Program could be restarted. However, what made Bolden desperate was that Congress was not interested in the free land 384,400 km away.</br>
</br>
"The UA people will view this as unacceptable? Why do I feel that there are plenty of people who have signed up to be a Celestial Trade astronaut?" One lawmaker smiled.</br>
</br>
"Do you think this is right?" Bolden retorted back.</br>
</br>
"What is wrong about it," said the Congress member who was sitting in the middle. He tapped on the book. "I need you to tell me what benefits the Apollo Program can give us other than boosting national confidence."</br>
</br>
Bolden was silent, he could only squeeze out a sentence after a long pause.</br>
</br>
"...Not all benefits can be seen."</br>
</br>
Several members smiled at each other and the Congress member at the top shrugged.</br>
</br>
"But only the visible benefits can convince taxpayers to pay the money."</br>
</br>
After the hearing ended, Bolden returned to NASA's office and slammed the prepared document onto the table.</br>
</br>
"The Congress is discussing raising the budget for research and development of new anti-ballistic missile systems and anti-EMP weapons. This is an even more urgent issue. The odds of convincing them is almost zero." The assistant followed in said while closing the door.</br>
</br>
"What did Hill mean?" Bolden said irritably.</br>
</br>
"She may have just given us an empty promise." The assistant with a bitter smile said.</br>
</br>
But then, the door was suddenly pushed open, and a NASA employee came in and put a newspaper on his desk. He was visibly excitedly.</br>
</br>
"Look at this! There is this!"</br>
</br>
Borden with a frown took the newspaper. When he saw the red circled text, his eyes widened.</br>
</br>
They just!</br>
</br>
Wait!</br>
</br>
His eyes lit up. He then snatched the newspaper and quickly rushed out the door.</br>
</br>
"Where are you going?"</br>
</br>
"The Capitol! Our opportunity is here!"</br>
</br>
Leaving the dumbfounded two confused in the office, Bolden disappeared.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 856: Nothing is Impossible</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The originally dull weekend was ignited with a video released by Celestial.</br>
</br>
A thirty-minute documentary journaled the living conditions of twenty-four astronauts in space. Including how they collected Moon ice, how they produced oxygen through electrolysis of water, how they extracted of rare earth elements from Moon soil, how they used the lunar rover to explore giant craters, how they were building the lunar greenhouse still under construction, and so on.</br>
</br>
Since the controlled fusion technology remained confidential, the documentary did not explain the other uses of the collection of soil, the excuse was the collection of rare earth resources.</br>
</br>
The person responsible for the filming work was an astronaut named Li Fang. Before joining the space colonization program and subsequently receiving training to become an astronaut, she worked as a reporter at Coro Island Radio and Television Station. When they received the task of filming a documentary from the ground command center, she immediately volunteered. While she filmed, she provided vivid descriptions.</br>
</br>
"Look at the big shack behind me. That is our lunar greenhouse. Although we have to get food through monthly supply rockets now, we'll be able to eat potatoes from the Moon in about three months. Jim, who cares for these potatoes, said that the mashed potatoes on the Moon will be very tasty and I've already drooling at the thought."</br>
</br>
At the end of the documentary, the young lady ended with a propaganda message.</br>
</br>
"If you, like me, love space, then join us in our great colonial cause!"</br>
</br>
There was no need for her to publicize it. After seeing such a novel Moon life, a "space fever" spread all over the world. Curiosity was always the driving force behind the exploration of human beings. When space, something beyond the imagination, was within reach, even people who were totally uninterested in the aerospace industry were driven by their emotions and developed an interest in colonizing the moon.</br>
</br>
Prior to this, the rumors that the 24 astronauts turned into space junk faded with the release of this documentary. They not only survived on the Moon but now they started to grow space crops!</br>
</br>
Just the day after the video was uploaded to the official website, the UA citizens who saw the dawn on the Moon went onto the Capitol's website and sent a petition to restart the Apollo Program. According to regulations, when the number of signatures exceeded 100,000, the Capitol must respond.</br>
</br>
It took only 24 hours and the number of petitioners already exceeded 100,000.</br>
</br>
Out of necessity, Hill had to deliver a message in front of the media and say that she would discuss with the Congress about the feasibility of restarting the Apollo Program. However, she also stressed that even if the Apollo Program was restarted, the UA could not emulate Celestial Trade's Moon mission in the short term.</br>
</br>
However, at the end of her speech, she also subtly criticized Celestial Trade's space project.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Celestial Trade has spent tens of billions of dollars on this space colonization plan. They spent one to two years of NASA's budget in half a year. They spent their own money, so I cannot criticize them. However, as the president, I will not squander taxpayer's money on a project that currently seems meaningless. Instead of colonizing the moon, we might as well go colonize the Sonora Desert."</br>
</br>
The Sonora Desert was a large desert at the junction of the UA and Mexico. No one other than smugglers entered the life forbidden zone. Her words were nothing more than mocking that Celestial Trade had spent money on meaningless projects.</br>
</br>
But no matter what, the 30-minute video completely ignited people's desire in exploring the universe.</br>
</br>
Just three days after the release of the video, Celestial Trade received more space volunteer applications than the sum of the past two months!</br>
</br>
The more exciting news had yet to come.</br>
</br>
Shortly after the documentary was released, Hawking published a message on his personal social media account, saying that he had already immigrated to Xin. He also resigned from Cambridge University as a professor and would serve as a professor of physics at Coro University. In addition, he joined Celestial Trade as a consultant in the "space colonization" project.</br>
</br>
Stephen William Hawking, a name that was not just renowned in the scientific community. This man suffering from ALS, who could only move his eyes and three fingers, was able to prove the singularity theorem of the general theory of relativity and the black hole area theorem. He proposed the theory of black hole evaporation and made considerable contributions to a unified Einstein's theory of relativity and Planck's quantum mechanics.</br>
</br>
He was the pride of modern British physics.</br>
</br>
Now, however, the pride of the British suddenly announced the change of nationality after a visit to Xin. This move made British Prime Minister Teresa May and the Queen of England shocked.</br>
</br>
When asked by media reporters why he made such a choice, Hawking's answer was quite frank.</br>
</br>
Although it was still the cold reply of electronic sounds, the reporters at the interview felt his truest feelings.</br>
</br>
"Science is borderless, and scientists are also borderless. In my later years, I saw the hope of humans migrating to space. Now I hope to be closer to my own dreams and use my shallow knowledge to contribute a little for this dream. I hope you don't over interpret my decision. This is just an old man who hopes to use his own way to complete the last journey of his life."</br>
</br>
However, for this great scientist, British Prime Minister Theresa May even visited Coro Island personally, hoping to change his mind.</br>
</br>
"There are many ways to realize your dreams. The ESA has recently also been discussing a moon landing program with a plan to establish a European colony on the Moon in 2030 - New Amsterdam. We need your help."</br>
</br>
May, not minding that Jiang Chen was on the side, directly extended her invitation to Hawking who had changed his nationality.</br>
</br>
However, Hawking's answer was very direct.</br>
</br>
"As long as you are still discussing, that will never be the result."</br>
</br>
Teresa May was stunned. After a moment of silence, she couldn't stop herself from asking</br>
</br>
"Excuse me for asking, but what did Future Group promise you that you made your mind to stay here."</br>
</br>
When he heard this question, Hawking squeezed out a smile with his stiff muscles and his three fingers typed on the keyboard.</br>
</br>
"He promised to help me stand up."</br>
</br>
Stand up?</br>
</br>
Teresa was stunned, then anger appeared on her face as she looked at Jiang Chen standing next to her.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, deceiving an old man is not a gentleman's move."</br>
</br>
"Deceiving?" Jiang Chen laughed. "If I said I will help him stand up, I will definitely help him stand up."</br>
</br>
"Is it true? As far as I know, ALS is an incurable disease. Modern medicine can't solve this problem at all. And you said that you can cure Mr. Hawking's illness. Isn't this fraud?" Teresa narrowed her eyes as her wrinkles squeezed together.</br>
</br>
The Prime Minister who succeeded Cameron resembled the "Iron Lady" Thatcher's demeanor, but Jiang Chen, who had long been accustomed to power, was able to respond to the pressure.</br>
</br>
"Modern medical treatment can't cure it, but it doesn't mean that Future Biology can't cure the disease." Jiang Chen smiled. "Don't forget, the T virus vaccine that saved the world was developed by our research institution."</br>
</br>
After listening to this sentence, Theresa stared at him.</br>
</br>
"You mean Future Group has already found a cure for ALS? How is this possible..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen confidently responded with a definitive tone.</br>
</br>
"For Future Group, nothing is impossible."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 857: Conquering a Medical Challenge</br>
</div></br>
</br>
ASL, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was the scientific name for a "degenerative disease." After suffering from this disease, there were hopes of early treatment, but once in the later stages, the probability of recovering from clinical treatment was almost zero. In Hawking's situation, what modern medicine could do was only control the patient's condition.</br>
</br>
However, with 22nd-century technology, there was no difficulty in treating this condition.</br>
</br>
In the apocalypse, medical technology was quite developed on the timeline. Before the war, almost 90% of the incurable diseases could be treated. ASL was one of the conditions no longer incurable.</br>
</br>
The easiest way to treat ASL would be to use the smart medical chamber Jiang Chen brought back to cure Ayesha. No matter how severe the muscle tissue experiences necrosis, atrophy, or other symptoms, with enough time and nutrient fluid, it could be effectively treated. As for accumulated neurotoxic substances and glutamic acid that accumulates between nerve cells, it could be cured by an injection of a special drug.</br>
</br>
With medical experts in the apocalypse, it would not be a difficult task to prepare these drugs.</br>
</br>
With complicated emotions, the British Prime Minister left Xin and ended her three-day diplomatic visit.</br>
</br>
Before receiving treatment, Hawking asked Jiang Chen a very interesting question.</br>
</br>
"Before I receive treatment, can I take the liberty to ask a question?"</br>
</br>
"If you plan to ask me if the operation will be painful, my answer is no," Jiang Chen replied comically.</br>
</br>
"It has nothing to do with me. What I want to ask is about the homework you assigned to the students two weeks ago."</br>
</br>
"Oh? The master of cosmology is also interested?" Jiang Chen looked at the old man in surprise.</br>
</br>
"I'm just curious. Have you guys discovered something?"</br>
</br>
The cloudy eyes seemed to possess a penetrating insight into the universe and pierced directly into Jiang Chen's soul.</br>
</br>
"Why do you think so?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"Because the number of rockets you have launched in the past few years is equal to the sum of NASA's launches over the past decade or so." Hawking hit the keyboard with his trembling fingers. "With such frequent space activities, you definitely can discover something."</br>
</br>
"Has NASA discovered anything in the past few decades?" Jiang Chen asked in turn.</br>
</br>
Hawking was silent for a moment. Then he began tapping his fingers on the keyboard.</br>
</br>
"They have never answered this question directly, but I'm sure they have discovered something. You can pay attention to Area 51, which is not just a federal military base."</br>
</br>
For details of Area 51, Hawking did not elaborate. Obviously, as a scholar, he wouldn't know too much intelligence.</br>
</br>
At the end of the meeting, Jiang Chen abruptly asked.</br>
</br>
"If there is an extraterrestrial civilization and they also know that we are here, do you think they will be hostile?"</br>
</br>
</br>
Hawking replied with his keyboard.</br>
</br>
"If you watched my lecture, then you should know very clearly. I never doubted this point."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and extended his hand.</br>
</br>
"It's a privilege that we share the same opinion."</br>
</br>
"...I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand now."</br>
</br>
It was mid-October. Inside Coro Hospital, a subsidiary of Future Biology, and accompanied by his three children from Britain, Hawking entered the operating room and was placed in a medical cabin with the help of a team of medical staff.</br>
</br>
Considering that all his body muscles have shrunk to a very serious degree, the repair time may be extensive. The news of Future Biology conquering the challenging ALS received wide attention from the international community.</br>
</br>
Any incurable disease that could be cured was incalculable progress in the medical research field.</br>
</br>
Even if the occurrence of ALS was not high, international medical organizations still displayed strong interests.</br>
</br>
However, similar to previous occasions, Future Biology did not disclose how to treat this terminal illness, but generalized the treatment process to the two steps of "muscle tissue repair and neuron repair". The international medical community had no solution to Future Biology's "stinginess." After all, Future Group was a company rather than a scholar institution. Even if it discovered something, it wouldn't publish a journal on the SCI.</br>
</br>
In fact, this time it wasn't Jiang Chen's ignorance, but he really could not explain it clearly.</br>
</br>
The nutrient fluid used in the smart medical chamber could accelerate the repair of necrotic cells under special electromagnetic effect. If the medical experts in the apocalypse explained it, they could potentially offer a good explanation. However, for Jiang Chen, a clear outsider of the field; he could only use this general explanation.</br>
</br>
Anyway, the treatment process was foolproof. Two nurses put the patient inside and then remember to change the nutrient fluid regularly. The process was almost like a washing machine.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Shortly after the news of Hawking's new nationality proliferated, countries also made subtle adjustments in their policies regarding the Moon.</br>
</br>
The first was the UA. As the first and only country to send humans to the Moon, Celestial Trade was ahead of them in establishing a colony which clearly triggered the nation.</br>
</br>
After many rounds of discussions, NASA finally persuaded Congress to give them a ten billion dollar budget. The Capital announced the restart of the Apollo Program, and the NASA would work with SpaceX to re-explore the moon. Many tech companies, including Google, would also participate in the project and share the 10 billion USD national budget.</br>
</br>
The European Space Agency did not lag behind and announced that it would hold a meeting in Darmstadt, Germany to discuss the establishment of a moon landing plan as soon as possible. However, no agreement was reached among countries on who should pay. Although ESA and the European were not linked, the UK after Brexit showed little interest in the initiative. After wealthy Britain left, relying solely on the finances of France and Germany was difficult to squeeze ten billion Euros into the aerospace project.</br>
</br>
The Director of ESA called for private companies to invest in the project. However, given the uncertain commercial outlook, the investors' interest was still unclear.</br>
</br>
Then followed by Hua, the success of the ChangE Series rockets also gave confidence in moon landings. Shortly after ESA convened a meeting, the mysterious authorities (1) announced a new aerospace white paper and incorporated the manned Moon landing plan into the national space strategy. It was expected that the first manned Moon landing craft would be launched in 2030.</br>
</br>
On the Russian side, due to the lack of funding, they didn't make any changes to their program. However, Kremlin said that if conditions permit, it would change the existing space program and incorporate moon landing into the Russian space activities.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not feel threatened by the aggregated countries.</br>
</br>
Even with the technology of Celestial Trade, he also spent a lot of money in space before he arrived at this stage. Perhaps the UA was the most hopeful second country to achieve moon colonization. But by that day, colonies and mines of Celestial Trade would already be all over the moon.</br>
</br>
Even if they wanted to colonize, would they still have a place to settle?</br>
</br>
(1) Mysterious Authorities – A satirical noun. There are many authorities that have jurisdictions over unexpected areas. It is almost impossible to see a clear governance structure in China.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 858: Gambling Contrac</br>
</div></br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen had expected, after coming home from work one day, Natasha wanted to speak to him.</br>
</br>
"The Kremlin hopes that you can fulfill the original contract ahead of schedule. As compensation, we are willing to buy five RM-320 rocket engines at twice the price."</br>
</br>
After Celestial Trade received Russia's contract to supply the International Space Station, Jiang Chen reached an agreement with Russia to sell the RM-320 rocket engine used on Celestial 1 at reasonable prices several years later.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen originally was planning to wait until 10 years later before fulfilling the agreement. However, seeing that all the countries in the world were preparing to reach the Moon , Russia couldn't just sit on the sideline. With a tight budget, they couldn't afford to invest too much money in developing more advanced rocket engines, so it was natural that the Kremlin thought of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The RM-320 engine was no longer used by Celestial Trade. Although it marked the top technical jewel of the apocalypse's rocket, it was the product of nearly 50 years of almost zero rocket development. After the birth of space elevators, no one developed the troublesome and high-cost rocket engines. Instead, they devoted all their energy to missiles and spacecraft engines.</br>
</br>
But this didn't mean it was technically impossible to improve the engine.</br>
</br>
After integrating some of the pre-war technology, the apocalypse scientists made improvements on the RM-320 rocket engine and developed a more advanced RM-400—which was exactly what Celestial Trade used for its Moon landing.</br>
</br>
From this perspective, it didn't seem to be an issue to sell RM-320 engines to Russia. However, taking into account his strategic needs, Jiang Chen hoped that Russia could focus on Eastern Europe instead of a gradually escalating space race.</br>
</br>
So, after organizing his thoughts, Jiang Chen shrugged and replied.</br>
</br>
"There are only two years left before 2020. Can't you wait?"</br>
</br>
"Time doesn't wait and the technology will be outdated. Under the current international environment, who knows if your RM-320 will still be leading the space race in 2020?" Natasha rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed when he heard the question.</br>
</br>
Even with a decade, SpaceX's Falcon series wouldn't catch up to the RM-320.</br>
</br>
"How about this. I promise that before the end of 2020, the performance of RM-320 will still be leading."</br>
</br>
"What if it's not?" Natasha said.</br>
</br>
"Then I will not sell it and give it to you for free." Jiang Chen smiled confidently.</br>
</br>
Natasha thought for a moment and nodded.</br>
</br>
"In this case... there should be no problem. Then I will reply to the Kremlin."</br>
</br>
"Wait."</br>
</br>
Natasha, who was preparing to get up, sat back down.</br>
</br>
"What else?"</br>
</br>
"Since it is a gambling contract, then whether win or lose, there should be a prize," Jiang Chen said. "If I win, and no rocket engine is superior to the RM-320 in terms of performance by the end of 2020, what do you plan to pay? "</br>
</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's words, Natasha's lips closed together and her long curved legs crossed together</br>
</br>
"Oh? What do you want?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and proposed.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
With a gambling contract, Natasha left Jiangchen's mansio. Although it was already eight o'clock in the evening, the embassy did not close for the day. To be honest, Natasha had more than enough credentials to serve as an emissary through her repeated effort in reaching agreements with Future Group.</br>
</br>
However, for some odd reasons, she did not seem to have any plans for promotion.</br>
</br>
At noon the following day, Russia delivered four new Guardian-class frigates to Celestial Trade. This 500 million US Dollar military sales were paid with Xin New Dollar. Due to the astonishing success of the Moon colonization program and the end to the region conflict with Moro securing the victory, the Xin New Dollar showed a trend of continued strength in the foreign exchange market, and the exchange rate against the US Dollar had risen to 1:1.2.</br>
</br>
Although the rising exchange rate didn't benefit exports, many industries of Future Group were unique and without competition. In addition, an increase in the exchange rate meant that Xin's import prices were cheaper, and it would help Xin's companies to invest overseas and expand their influence on the international economy.</br>
</br>
The four Guardian-class frigates were sent to Coconut Island. The engineering robots would equip them with Type-50 J-model electromagnetic pulse cannons. Counting two ships and two submarines that were previously purchased from Russia, Celestial Navy already owned six frigates, more than sufficient to form an attacking formation with maneuverability and firepower.</br>
</br>
In addition, the shipyard of Future Military was built on Ange Island, and orders for the first destroyer had been issued. Soon after, Celestial Trade would list its own produced warships and use its own gunboats to defend its sovereignty.</br>
</br>
After the completion of the handover ceremony, Jiang Chen returned to Coro Island. When he noticed the time, he headed to the Future Building.</br>
</br>
After Xia Shiyu reported on the company's most recent progress, Ivan's phone call followed.</br>
</br>
Touching the screen and picking up the phone, Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?"</br>
</br>
"It's related to Madagascar." Ivan replied. "At present, Madagascar's government forces, with the help of the foreign troops we dispatched, are already besieging Arrow and the rebels trapped in the Bezaha area in the southern part of the island. President Bernard called us half an hour ago and hoped that we could cooperate with the government forces in the final attack on the besieged rebels."</br>
</br>
Ivan paused and waited for Jiang Chen's instructions.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's index finger gently tapped the table and debated.</br>
</br>
As early as Celestial Trade's soldiers landed on Madagascar, the outcome of the war had already been decided. No matter how the former President La Jonah fought together with Arrow, he could not escape the end of this demise.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen did not order the Foreign Corps to eliminate the enemy immediately, but instead dragged the war out for as long as possible.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's approach was the exact same as that of the Moro Independent War. Only when Madagascar owed enough money would the government be more obedient. Rather than forcing Celestial Trade to intervene on the island, he hoped to be greeted as a savior.</br>
</br>
What's more, dragging this war on had also consumed the strength of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
However, the Jews seem to have given up this chess piece. Originally, they were sending more mercenaries to Madagascar. Now, even the transporting of supplies became more cautious. The turmoil in Eastern Europe has left them with no energy for the southernmost island of Africa.</br>
</br>
Obviously, from the perspective of the Freemasonry, the threat from Russia was far greater than that of Future Group, a multi-national company.</br>
</br>
"Send our Aurora-20s and finish this mess." After a long pause, Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 859"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 859: Since Then</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On October 21, Aurora-20s arrived in Madagascar and launched a 24-hour airstrike on the rebels defending the Bezaha area.</br>
</br>
The next day early in the morning, with the cooperation of the Celestial Trade Foreign Corps, Madagascar's 5,000 government soldiers launched their final offensive attack against the rebels supporting former President La Jonah.</br>
</br>
The result was no suspense. More than 3,000 rebel soldiers and 571 mercenaries from Europe were killed, 81 went missing, and the wounded surrendered. In an underground bunker, Foreign Corps soldiers captured the former President La Jonah.</br>
</br>
Arrow's current President and Chief Instructor Diarra was also captured at the scene. After consultation with the Madagascar government, Diarra was secretly extradited to Xin, while La Jonah was handed over to military court.</br>
</br>
On the same night, Madagascar's President Bernard made a speech to the nation and announced that with the help of Celestial Trade, the civil war that lasted several months had ended. Arrow's assets in Madagascar would be confiscated and former President La Jonah would be sentenced to death and executed at the end of the month.</br>
</br>
After the rebels surrendered, the French side proposed to Madagascar with the hope to send the captive "European citizens" back home. However, under the instruction of Jiang Chen, Bernard rejected this proposal and responded that human rights are absolutely not a reason for contempt of the law. No matter what the purpose was for the Europeans involved in the rebel forces, they must face allegations of murder and war crimes. Only those who deemed not guilty would be released from prison.</br>
</br>
Madagascar was not planning to release anyone.</br>
</br>
The purpose of Jiang Chen's plan was to use these prisoners of war to put pressure on the European government and the politicians under the control of Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After Arrow's President Diarra was extradited to Xin, he was immediately transported secretly to the New Moon Island military base. Jiang Chen made a personal "visit".</br>
</br>
In the prison-like dark house, the man with a pale expression was sitting on a chair. The suit he was wearing was the same one he wore when he was caught. There was a golden ring on the table. The gold-engraved pattern depicted the number 30.</br>
</br>
In the Freemasonry, the highest level was level 33; level 30 was a prominent figure in the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat from the window across and smiled at him.</br>
</br>
"It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Diarra. I know you won't be familiar with my face. I heard that you have a bad habit that when you plan for a mission, you like to stick the photo of the target with a dagger on the map. "</br>
</br>
Diarra laughed wryly.</br>
</br>
"Just shoot me, why are you wasting time on a dead person?"</br>
</br>
If he was arrested by the Madagascar government, he would still have hopes of living. When he learned that he was extradited to Xin, his last traces of hope disappeared.</br>
</br>
</br>
"We have a lot to talk about. Let's start from two years ago." After a pause, Jiang Chen smiled, "Do you remember the first kidnapping mission against me?"</br>
</br>
Earlier, Country F had planned a kidnapping operation against Jiang Chen and hired Arrow. Nearly a dozen police officers were killed on duty and Ayesha was also wounded. It was at that time that Jiang Chen made up his mind to build an intelligence organization.</br>
</br>
Diarra did not speak and looked at Jiang Chen silently.</br>
</br>
"After thinking carefully, it seems that during the internal testing of the Phantom Helmet, unidentified armed forces penetrated the training facilities... but they were discovered by our people." Jiang Chen looked at Diarra. "I'm curious, when did you guys begin to monitor me?"</br>
</br>
"You mean the Freemasonry?" Diarra grinned.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Why should I tell you?" Diarra ridiculed.</br>
</br>
"Just because I can let you live," Jiang Chen leaned back in his chair, fingers crossed before him, and stared at his eyes. "I can also make you die."</br>
</br>
Diarra's throat moved, but his eyes did not waver.</br>
</br>
"I know what you are worrying about. If you confess to me, your family in Europe may suffer unexpected events." Here, Jiang Chen sat up from his chair, approached the glass partition, lowered his voice, and said in a tone with deeper meaning embedded in his voice, "But I don't know if you thought about it. Since the Freemasonry can make your family suffer an unexpected accident, then why can't I do the same thing?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not intend to use family as a threat. However, Diarra was likely to become a breakthrough point to take down the Freemasonry, so he did not use the simple but brutal truth-telling serum; he intended to convince him to join his side.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gestured to the bodyguard next to him. A photo was placed on the table between the two.</br>
</br>
"It's your wife and your two daughters. They are beautiful, aren't they?"</br>
</br>
When he saw the photo, Diarra's eyes suddenly turned red, and the armrests shook violent. He stared at Jiang Chen, squeezing a few words from his grinding teeth.</br>
</br>
"You…"</br>
</br>
"I am a monster, I know what you want to say." Jiang Chen's expression remained unchanged, "but you are not qualified to say this to me. In an old Chinese saying, you and I have no grudge between us, but why are you always on my butt?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was also infuriated.</br>
</br>
Starting with the Antarctic mission, the Freemasonry became unscrupulous against him and his group. As he said, those two shared no grudges, but the Freemasonry followed him like flies.</br>
</br>
[The Golden Apple? Hell, they really thought that stuff could communicate with the future?]</br>
</br>
Diarra's tense body suddenly relaxed. He suddenly started laughing and said in a slightly calmer tone.</br>
</br>
"You asked me before. When did we start monitor you?"</br>
</br>
"Yes," Jiang Chen replied.</br>
</br>
"Future 1.0." Diarra tossed a name that surprised Jiang Chen, and grinned. "When you introduced the concept of artificial intelligence, we noticed your company and you."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen had no response, Diarra raised an eyebrow. Iis it very unexpected?"</br>
</br>
"It's really unexpected." Jiang Chen nodded. "I thought that you began to keep an eye on us from the coup on Pannu Islands. I didn't expect that you would have monitored me since then. But you haven't answered me yet. Is the reason behind monitoring me just because of the Golden Apple?"</br>
</br>
Apart from the accidents, Jiang Chen was also secretly curious.</br>
</br>
He was aware of this kind of intelligence. His position in the Freemasonry should not be low.</br>
</br>
"It wasn't because of the Golden Apple. We just thought that you are worth investing. But after a series of moves by you, we suspected that the Golden Apple was on you." As he spoke, Diarra started to laugh again. "And we were right, it was really on you."</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen wanted to say that what he achieved today was not because of the Golden Apple.</br>
</br>
"The Gatekeeper will end you."</br>
</br>
"I have been waiting for him for a long time," Jiang Chen looked at his watch, shrugged and said, "However, I still haven't seen him yet."</br>
</br>
"It won't be long. Believe me." Diarra laughed unnaturally and then gazed at Jiang Chen's watch. "It seems to be time."</br>
</br>
"Time?" Jiang Chen frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen saw a rush of blood oozing out from Diarra's mouth and dripping on his pants.</br>
</br>
His rolled pupils were covered with daunting crimson lines…</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 860: Something More Valuable</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The bodyguard beside Jiang Chen immediately kicked open the door to the interrogation room and rushed in. However, when the military doctor arrived, Diarra's heart had stopped beating.</br>
</br>
"Died of heart failure... We found a drug containing propafenone and metoprolol tartrate in his home in Madagascar. According to the autopsy report, he had stopped using the drug for two weeks."</br>
</br>
At noon the next day, in the mansion's office, Ayesha reported on Diarra's autopsy report.</br>
</br>
"I see. It's a pity." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Originally, Jiang Chen hoped to develop Diarra as an insider for Celestial Trade. He would use the slavery chip to monitor him, return him to Europe through the form of interest exchange, and collect intelligence of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
It would be great to determine the whereabouts of Carmen or the other level 33 members.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Aisha quietly interrupted his thinking.</br>
</br>
"Should we do it?"</br>
</br>
A photo fell gently on the table. The blonde woman in the photo had a bright smile on, along with her two daughters. This photo was taken in Munich, Germany. It was Diarra's wife and daughters whom Jiang Chen previously threatened.</br>
</br>
After a long moment of silence, Jiang Chen sighed and shook his head.</br>
</br>
"It's not necessary...He has already passed away."</br>
</br>
Ayesha nodded, smiled, and gently replied.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Good news came from the Moon colony. The moon mining station succeeded in extracting 100 gram of helium 3 from the soil, and the cost converted was only 11,000 Xin New Dollar.</br>
</br>
To feel how low this cost is, simply reference the tritium that could be also be used for nuclear fusion. As a nuclear material that can be collected from Earth, the price of tritium was more than 10,000 US Dollar per gram. Because most of the tritium was produced in UA, the amount of tritium the UA permits for annual export was only about one kilogram, and the main purpose other than industrial and experimental use was to manufacture neutron bombs.</br>
</br>
Helium-3 did not produce neutrons in the fusion process. It only produced protons that were not radioactive, and it would not produce the radiation people feared. It was a clean energy source. From this perspective, the price of helium 3 should only be more expensive than tritium, and it should be much more expensive!</br>
</br>
With a solution to the energy problem, many more issues would be resolved immediately.</br>
</br>
After the completion of the space elevator and the introduction of super long-distance wireless power transmission technology, the new round of energy revolution would be led by Future Group. The world officially entered a new "electricity era."</br>
</br>
With the advancement made on the Moon set aside, after the end of the civil war in Madagascar and President Bernard taking care of the country domestic affairs, his first stop for diplomatic visits was Xin. After the meeting with Xin's president, Zhang Yaping, the new president made a low-key visit to Jiang Chen's mansion to meet the country's behind-the-scenes controller.</br>
</br>
</br>
With an entire drone attack group acting as his security guard, Jiang Chen's mansion was definitely one of the safest places in the world.</br>
</br>
The accompanying bodyguard stayed at the door. Bernard and his assistant entered the mansion. He immediately extended his hand with a smile when he saw Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen, on behalf of the people of Madagascar, I would like to offer you the highest respect!"</br>
</br>
"You're flattering me." Jiang Chen smiled and shook his hand. "Welcome to my house, Mr. President."</br>
</br>
It was still during working hours, so only Jiang Chen and Ayesha were in the mansion.</br>
</br>
After Bernard was invited to take a seat, Jiang Chen sat across from him. Ayesha made black tea for them and then quietly left the living room.</br>
</br>
Without a lot of small talks, Bernard explained the intention of the visit.</br>
</br>
"The La Jonah rebels have been annihilated. When is your party prepared to withdraw from Madagascar?"</br>
</br>
From Bernard's cautious expression, Jiang Chen wanted to laugh but instead, he took a sip of the tea.</br>
</br>
"You can, at any time, see when you plan to end their employment."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen was easy to talk to, Bernard and his assistant all sighed in relief.</br>
</br>
At present, Celestial Trade's Foreign Corps on Madagascar totaled 3,000, and there were also more than ten armored vehicles, tanks, and other military vehicles. It was no exaggeration to say that this 3,000-strong force completely surpassed the military power of Madagascar.</br>
</br>
With a gunpowder barrel in the country, how could he not be worried as the president?</br>
</br>
Before arriving, Bernard wondered how he would convince Jiang Chen if he did not plan to withdraw from Madagascar. But now it seemed that these concerns were extraneous.</br>
</br>
But were the concerns extraneous?</br>
</br>
What he did not notice was that Jiang Chen had a faint smile on his face.</br>
</br>
"Then, before we withdraw, let's settle your debt."</br>
</br>
"Debt?" Bernard muttered.</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, who had previously left the living room, brought back a document.</br>
</br>
After roughly glancing at the cover of the document, Jiang Chen rubbed Ayesha's head with a smile. The latter closed her eyes with happiness and left the living room again contentedly.</br>
</br>
"The employment cost of Celestial Trade, as well as the previously delivered arms to your force, and the secret agreement signed on behalf of your party by the former President who suffered an unfortunate fate. All the expenses are on here. You can go through it first."</br>
</br>
Whether it was reorganizing the army or running for president, the amount of money spent was not a small sum. What's more, they didn't have a choice at the time, even though Jiang Chen's side was raising the price, they could only swallow and accept.</br>
</br>
However, Bernard's brow was twitching when he saw the 11 billion US Dollar bill.</br>
</br>
Madagascar's GDP was only around 10 billion US Dollar a year. Where could he find the money?</br>
</br>
With the tightening fiscal, he wished to borrow from Future Bank.</br>
</br>
"This agreement..."</br>
</br>
"The signature is there. If you doubt it, you can test the fingerprint on it." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"We don't have much money at all." His words didn't come out fluent at all.</br>
</br>
However, he couldn't dare to say he was not repaying. Debt defaults would immediately make the already deteriorating investment environment immediately drop to freezing point. If a country could easy forfeit its debt burden, it would be completely isolated by international capital.</br>
</br>
Bernard could not help but curse at the assassinated former president. However, cursing a dead person could not solve the problem of the alive.</br>
</br>
"I didn't ask you to pay back the money immediately." Jiang Chen looked at Bernard, who could not articulate at the moment, then he continued, "Moreover, I'm more interested in more valuable things you have."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With a complex expression, Bernard and his assistant left Jiang Chen's mansion.</br>
</br>
Madagascar had just gotten rid of Arrow, but then the country soon welcomed Celestial Trade into its backyard. He didn't know what this would mean for his country; whether it was a blessing or a curse to his motherland. It was difficult for the new present to accept the girm reality.</br>
</br>
The former president's assassination was quite sudden. The former party leader left no useful information, and the position of vice president was like a mascot. If it wasn't for the death of the president, he wouldn't be able to sit in this seat.</br>
</br>
Madagascar's post-war recovery required help from Future Group. Even if he didn't want private armed forces to continue to proliferate in the country, he had to make compromises on this issue.</br>
</br>
According to his agreement with Jiang Chen, Future Bank would provide 2 billion Xin New Dollar in loans to the Madagascar government. In addition to the mines promised to Future Group, Future Mining would also have priority mining rights in its domestic mines. In addition, Celestial Trade would establish five military bases with a force of 200 in Madagascar and be able to legally employ locals to join the Foreign Corps.</br>
</br>
On the plane returning to Madagascar, Bernard pinched his sore eyebrows.</br>
</br>
He was now worried about how to convince his people to allow Celestial Trade to establish military bases in Madagascar. Fortunately, Future Group promised it would help shift public opinion, so it shouldn't be too difficult…</br>
</br>
In the basement of Future Building, inside Amos's laboratory, the blonde girl led Jiang Chen to Dr. Amos, who was testing the robot in the laboratory.</br>
</br>
Amos was sitting in a chair with an improved Phantom helmet on his head. On the opposite side, there was a "water tank" 100 square meters in size separated by graphene partitions. A robot no different from the human body floated in a water tank. A string of air bubbles was ejected through the joints, surrounding a satellite floating in the center. It was performing a series of difficult and complex movements.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw Amos last time, he asked Amos to develop a neural access robot designed specifically for use in space, with the goal to replace the need for astronauts to enter a vacuum environment to perform dangerous work. Unexpectedly, his progress was so fast that he created a prototype in less than three months.</br>
</br>
The robot in the tank looked in his direction.</br>
</br>
After realizing that Jiang Chen had arrived, the floating robot quickly stopped moving. About two or three seconds later, Amos, sitting in a chair, disconnected the nerves connected to the robot and took off his helmet.</br>
</br>
With the helmet aside, Amos rubbed his daughter's hair, allowed her to go play on the side, then looked at Jiang Chen with a grin.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"Absolutely amazing..." Jiang Chen could offer nothing but praise to him.</br>
</br>
</br>
Once these robots became available, the construction speed of the space elevator would undoubtedly be much faster! Humans could get tired and must eat and drink, but machines would only require charging. It was no exaggeration to say that the construction speed would more than double if a floating charging station was placed next to the construction site in outer space.</br>
</br>
"Produced at scale, the unit price of each robot is 1 to 1.5 million Xin New Dollar, and it's about the same price as a spacesuit. With just a little training, anyone can use these fun toys." Amos smiled.</br>
</br>
"Can I try it?" Jiang Chen looked at the robot in the tank and eagerly asked.</br>
</br>
"Of course." Amos got up from his chair and gestured toward the helmet on the table.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stepped forward and put it on his head.</br>
</br>
"The connection password is 1452. To start, just say 'connect' or 'start.' A holographic interface will appear on your retina. Focus on the options and wait 3 seconds for it to finish loading. After that, special function operations can be performed."</br>
</br>
After listening to Dr. Amos's explanation, Jiang Chen repositioned himself into a comfortable position. He cleared his throat then said, "Connect!"</br>
</br>
It was similar to how the Phantom started, but it didn't connect to the virtual reality network. Instead, he switched to the robot's field of view. Jiang Chen looked at the robot's arm through its electronic eyes and looked around again, feeling a difficult-to-restrain excitement.</br>
</br>
Through the holographic interface in his field of vision, Jiang Chen saw his heart rate and the secretion of hormones such as insulin, adrenal glands. This was meant to determine if the previous body suffered from hunger or other physiological effects.</br>
</br>
The button in the upper right corner was a shutdown option. After focusing on the button for 3 seconds, the neural bridging mode would be disconnected. Compared to the previous model that had to be disconnected with the help of others, this design was undoubtedly more user-friendly.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened his mouth and merely wanted to ask: "How do I control the propulsion of the joints?" However, no sound came out.</br>
</br>
Instead, what he wanted to say was delivered as text and sent to a computer outside the tank.</br>
</br>
"This is one of the difficulties of the neural bridging technology." Amos helplessly opened his hands and explained to Jiang Chen, "It's as if I put a pair of wings behind you, but if you can't understand how to use the wings. They'll only be used as a decoration."</br>
</br>
"What does that mean?" Jiang Chen moved around in the water tank, trying hard to imagine the propulsion in his joints, but no matter how he tried, the stream wouldn't come out.</br>
</br>
"Literally," Amos sighed. "The core that controls this mechanical body is still your brain. But you lack something in your body; it's impossible for your brain to understand this situation without training for an extended period of time."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave up trying to focus on the exit option and ended the neural bridging state.</br>
</br>
He removed the helmet and set it aside. He then massaged his somewhat swollen brain and casually asked Amos, "... Well, let me ask, how long did it take you to smoothly control this robot?"</br>
</br>
"About two weeks? After all, my brain is a bit more powerful than the average person." Amos laughed without the slightest humility and picked up the helmet. "By the way, using this device for the first time puts a big load on your brain. If you feel tired now, I suggest you go home and sleep."</br>
</br>
After Amos listened to Jiang Chen's opinion, the neural bridging robot destined for space activities was eventually given a name of "Pioneer" and would be produced by Future Heavy Industries. At the same time, the space launch center would assign 100 people to the astronaut training center to be trained on this groundbreaking invention</br>
</br>
After returning to the office to make arrangements for production, Jiang Chen was yawning continuously and decided to give himself the rest of the day off.</br>
</br>
Ayesha was driving. Jiang Chen was just about to doze off before a call disturbed his nap.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 862: Silicon Valley“s Invitation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Since major technological breakthroughs in graphene materials, phone screens, regardless of the technology, were replaced with graphene, and the chips also gradually transitioned from silicon-based chips to graphene chips. It was at this time that people fully realized how profitable Future Group would be from leading this materials science revolution.</br>
</br>
80% of the world's supply of graphene materials came from New Malaysia Special District, from Future Group's graphene factories. Especially for high-strength graphene and semiconductor-type graphene materials, Future Group, which held the core technology, almost monopolized the entire supply market and controlled the undisputable pricing power.</br>
</br>
Even Future Technology's competitors, Apple, Samsung, and other electronics manufacturers, had to admit that their own technology was inferior. They used graphene screens produced by Future Heavy Industries and the Dark Blue M1 chips.</br>
</br>
However, after obtaining a technical license from Future Group, Intel also subsequently developed a graphene chip to stop the downward pressure on the plunging stock prices. However, people with a clear read on the situation saw the technological gap between this rushed semi-finished product and the Dark Blue M1.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that the most unbearable loss of the European embargo against Future Group was the losses suffered in the electronics industry. Although the European Union seemed to have selectively forgotten about graphene and didn't impose any penalty on the graphene materials exported by Future Group to Europe, Future Group unilaterally announced that it would terminate the supply of graphene to European companies.</br>
</br>
This dealt a heavy blow to the supercomputer centers in Switzerland and other countries, as well as the European semiconductor companies that were already lagging behind Silicon Valley. If they wished to purchase Future chips, they had to purchase the chips at high prices through offshore dealers registered in Sweden, Norway, and Britain.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that with the increasing popularity of graphene materials, Future Group's control of the global electronics industry also became more pronounced. The reason why UA didn't target Future Group was partly because of the coalition formed with the WASP consortium. On the other hand, they were concerned about the impact on Silicon Valley from the price fluctuations of graphene.</br>
</br>
80% of the world's graphene materials came from Future Group, and 60% were sold to Silicon Valley. Hastily disturbing the status quo offered no benefits for anyone.</br>
</br>
If Intel could replace Future Group and solve the technical problems of graphene semiconductors and high-strength graphene materials, based on the tendency of the UA Department of Commerce, it would've launched a double counter investigation already.</br>
</br>
The phone call was from Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who just stepped out of the door, immediately went back.</br>
</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen opened the door, Xia Shiyu put down the pen in her hand and said apologetically, "Sorry, I didn't know you left work already. Do you want something to drink? I'll make you something."</br>
</br>
"Water is fine...Yawn... Get me a coffee - a mocha please."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted water, but his yawn changed his mind.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded and went to the coffee machine to help Jiang Chen and herself to two mochas. She then brought them back and sat down.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Sniffing the fragrance of the cocoa beans, Jiang Chen suddenly felt his sleepiness disappearing.</br>
</br>
"No problem...when did you sleep last night? Why are you so sleepy?" she asked out of concern.</br>
</br>
"Oh, maybe I slept a bit late last night." Because it was too cumbersome to explain, Jiang Chen followed along with the conversation.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen yawned again.</br>
</br>
For some reason, when she heard that Jiang Chen slept late, Xia Shiyu's face suddenly blushed and she gave him a hard stare.</br>
</br>
"Mind… Mind…"</br>
</br>
"Mind?" With an eyebrow raised, Jiang Chen was confused.</br>
</br>
"Mind your body, and learn to control it." Xia Shiyu coughed then looked away as she finally spat out the words stuck in her throat.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned at her face.</br>
</br>
He would never get bored with her "not frank" look, no matter how many times he saw it.</br>
</br>
"Why are you staring at me?!" Xian Shiyu stared at Jiang Chen back, stood up and walked toward her desk.</br>
</br>
[It's not like you will lose anything.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen scoffed in his mind.</br>
</br>
Holding a stack of documents, Xia Shiyu tossed them on the coffee table after she returned and sat back on the couch. Judging by her serious expression, she had switched back to work mode. Jiang Chen's grin also disappeared after he glanced at the documents. He forced away the sleepiness in his mind and put on a serious attitude.</br>
</br>
"Silicon Valley Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Summit?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Xia Shiyu nodded. "It's the largest and highest-profile technology event in Silicon Valley. It's also an international professional conference in the technology field. We received an invitation. What do you think?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen picked up the documents and scanned through them.</br>
</br>
It wasn't a small summit. Although the organizers and participants were all American companies in the beginning, the influence of later summits gradually spread to Asia. The areas covered included mobile internet, cloud technology, big data, games, smart hardware (home, internet of things, robots and wearable devices, etc.), education, medical care, and low-carbon, representing the frontiers of Silicon Valley.</br>
</br>
The conference was held every autumn. Each time it was held, it attracted a large number of tech leaders from Hua, the UA, and the Asia Pacific region. These included over 1500 tech companies from Hua and the UA, over 1000 Fortune 500 executives, over 20,000 professionals, and more than 120 media outlets from different parts of the world.</br>
</br>
The 16th summit was held in Shangjing, and this time, it was going to be held in the Santa Clara Convention Center in Silicon Valley.</br>
</br>
The UA's invitation to Future Group to attend the meeting was undoubtedly a signal for peace. There was no need to be concerned about their intentions.</br>
</br>
As long as missile silos existed for one day, no matter how much the FBA and the CIB hated him, they wouldn't dare to allow accidents to happen to him on The UA soil. The situation in City M proved that in the 21st century, a more effective and terrifying force than nuclear weapons could destroy a civilization. Its name was an electromagnetic pulse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was considering what benefits this visit would bring him.</br>
</br>
"The organizers are looking forward to our arrival. The UA Department of Commerce also hopes that we will cooperate more closely with Silicon Valley in graphene and artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, companies will also display the results of their research and explore business cooperation and investments at the summit. At present, we possess a very high market share in the graphene field, but the total value of the graphene market is still seriously undervalued. Through this summit, we can promote our products to more companies." While Jiang Chen was weighing his decision, Xia Shiyu further explained the significance of this summit.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded then closed the documents.</br>
</br>
"I'll head back and prepare. It's October 31st, right? When should we arrive?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took an extra few seconds to process.</br>
</br>
"Wait, you're going to go personally?"</br>
</br>
"What's the alternative?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 863: Long-distance Wireless Power Transmission</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu originally planned to attend this summit by herself. As the executive of Future Group, she could indeed represent Future Group to some extent. The reason why she made this decision was mainly out of concern for Jiang Chen's safety.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen spent a lot of effort to finally persuade and reassure Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
His business was all over the UA, but he hadn't visited yet.</br>
</br>
In addition, Cali, where Silicon Valley was located, was just next to Nevada. He also planned to "visit" the mysterious Area 51 to see what the UA people were actually studying.</br>
</br>
Before flying to Cali, good news came from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen requested Beluga Station to search for long-distance wireless power transmission equipment and there was finally progress. Wu Yue, who was stationed at the Sixth Street, conveyed some news to Chu Nan which was fed back to Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
When Sun Jiao told Jiang Chen the good news, Jiang Chen immediately returned to the apocalypse to meet with Wu Yue.</br>
</br>
In front of the warehouse on the Sixth Street, the guard in a kinetic skeleton saluted him and opened the iron gate.</br>
</br>
With a dry splash of air, Jiang Chen walked into a bright warehouse and soon saw Wu Yue standing on a platform along with scientists from Camp 27, who were busy studying around the platform.</br>
</br>
"We meet again, Mr. General."</br>
</br>
Wu Yue came forward and shook Jiang Chen's hand tightly.</br>
</br>
"Long time no see." Jiang Chen grinned and let go of his hand. "I didn't expect that after so long, you'd still be the representative here."</br>
</br>
"Surprised?" Wu Yue shrugged and laughed.</br>
</br>
"No, I'm just curious as to why you didn't get promoted yet. Let's not talk about this anymore. Where is it?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked around but didn't see what he wished to see in the warehouse.</br>
</br>
Wu Yue stomped his feet.</br>
</br>
"It's just under our feet."</br>
</br>
Slightly surprised, Jiang Chen looked down.</br>
</br>
At a closer look, this hexagonal platform was indeed special.</br>
</br>
On the black painted shell, scale-like little bumps about the size of a thumb were visible. They were neatly arranged into a net and covered the hexagonal platform.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't expect that this hexagonal platform occupying a thousand square meters on the ground was actually a part of the long-distance wireless power transmission equipment.</br>
</br>
"How does this stuff work? Can you show it to me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen casually stepped on the surface of the platform. Other than the surface material feeling very soft, he didn't see anything else special about it.</br>
</br>
"This thing works in outer space. It can't be used in the atmosphere." Wu Yue shook his head and pointed his fingers at the scientists who belonged to NAC. "You can ask your subordinates how it works. I don't know much about it. Well… let's settle the bill first."</br>
</br>
A bright and friendly smile appeared on his face.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't waste any time. He tapped the wristwatch, pulled out the data cord, linked directly to his EP, and transferred 10,000 credits to his account. Seeing that string of zeros, Wu Yue's smile was even brighter. He bowed to Jiang Chen respectfully and left the warehouse.</br>
</br>
With 10,000 credits, the purchasing power was equivalent to 100,000 crystals. It was enough for Beluga Station to purchase a whole month's worth of supplies from the Sixth Street. If they worked with merchants, it would take four trips to Japan to make the same amount.</br>
</br>
Helping the NAC military's government salvage equipment before the war was a great job for the Beluga Station.</br>
</br>
After Wu Yue left, Jiang Chen called a scientist busy on the computer next to the platform and asked him how to use the device.</br>
</br>
The scientist named Luo Yong was excited when the general asked him. He laid down his work and took Jiang Chen straight to the front of an instrument at the corner of the warehouse. The iron box looked like a closet and there was a transparent acrylic tube about one meter long.</br>
</br>
"This is a device that simulates wireless power transmission in outer space. Electric energy is converted into a laser beam that carries energy at pole A and converts it into electricity at pole B. Now the glass tube is pumped into an approximately vacuum state to prevent the loss of the transmission laser in the form of heat energy." Luo Yong explained the science behind the technology to Jiang Chen using layman terms. He reached out, turned on the holographic screen and pressed the start button.</br>
</br>
His fingers tapped a few times, set the transmission power, and one end of the glass tube began to illuminate. The power indicator began to jump and eventually stopped at 21 kiloWatt.</br>
</br>
In an instant, the blue laser filled the entire vacuum tube, just like flowing liquid - bright but not blinding. At the same time, the number on the indicator that measured the other pole of the vacuum tube, also began to increase. When the surging laser stabilized, this number eventually stopped at 20.997 kiloWatt.</br>
</br>
Considering that this one-meter-long distance only had a 0.014 percent electrical energy loss, it was quite astonishing. Different from traditional power transmission methods, under ideal conditions, this laser transmission didn't need to utilize a medium, so there was no power loss due to resistance or heat.</br>
</br>
As long as the medium on the optical path was as small as possible and the beam was concentrated as much as possible, the electric energy could be transmitted stably from one pole to the other, even through millions of kilometers with negligible energy lost.</br>
</br>
At that time, the helium 3 mined from the Moon wouldn't need to be transported to Earth via a spacecraft, and it would be directly converted into electricity on the Moon's fusion power station then directly "fired" from the end of the space elevator in outer space. After being converted back into electrical energy, the superconductor line would transmit to the power grid on the surface of the Earth.</br>
</br>
"Because of the acrylic glass, we can observe the laser beam with the naked eye. Although it looks very mild, it's also a form of power loss, but in the actual universe, this beam is invisible. Only in regions close to the Earth, or in the presence of dust or water molecules, can blue, tubular beams be observed."</br>
</br>
While describing the science to Jiang Chen, Wu Yue turned off the device.</br>
</br>
"If a spacecraft passes this laser beam, isn't it dangerous?" Jiang Chen suddenly thought of a very serious problem.</br>
</br>
[Tens or even hundreds of millions of megawatts of electricity would be converted into lasers. This would be a Moon-based laser turret! If the middle of this light path passed through any spacecrafts or rockets, it would cook them into molten iron.]</br>
</br>
Also, if this laser accidentally went off target and was directed at the Earth...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was a bit afraid that he could accidentally make a hole in the atmosphere.</br>
</br>
"This concern is redundant." Luo Yong laughed. "Generally speaking, the light path will be marked on the navigator of the spacecraft. No spacecraft will approach the area. It's just like we won't go touching high-voltage poles with a ladder for fun."</br>
</br>
"Then what if the laser misses?" Jiang Chen persisted.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 864"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 864: Recently at the Sixth Stree</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen always asked questions that were tricky and difficult to explain. This unpleasant habit made Luo Yang screaming on the inside, but he must keep a patient appearence.</br>
</br>
[What do we do if it hits the Earth?]</br>
</br>
In his opinion, it wasn't a problem at all.</br>
</br>
"Nothing, the atmosphere's appetite is much larger than we imagine it to be." Luo Yang shrugged and replied, "The wavelength of the laser is quite short. Particles in the air will block the laser, scatter it around, and eventually, it will be absorbed by the ozone layer. Unlike a light beam emitted by a laser pistol, you can view the transmission laser as a type of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than ultraviolet light. This type of energy is more easily absorbed by the atmosphere, so the environmental impact on the Earth would be quite minor."</br>
</br>
While he mentioned this point, Luo Yong paused and said half-jokingly, "Taking 10,000 steps back, the space elevators are usually built out on the open sea. Even if there's a small angle deviation in the optical path of the transmission laser, there's a high probability that it will only hit the sea. It's almost impossible to strike landmasses."</br>
</br>
Under the control of a quantum computer, it was almost impossible for a laser beam to miss the thousand square meter hexagonal platform. According to data provided by Luo Yang, from the period between 2050 to 2150, there were only four power transmission path failures between the Earth and Moon.</br>
</br>
Four failures in one hundred years - this probability was already quite low, and the economic loss caused by each failure was only the power lost in the atmosphere, and the nuclear fusion cores consumed by ground facilities in the event of large-scale power outages.</br>
</br>
After being educated by the scientist, Jiang Chen circled around the long-distance power transmission equipment a few times and finally left the warehouse feeling satisfied.</br>
</br>
Before coming, he thought long-distance power transmission in the 22nd century was similar to Tesla's proposed Wardenclyffe Tower project. They were going to build an electric tower that resembled a radio tower, except it wouldn't be used to transmit information; it would transmit energy.</br>
</br>
As long as it was on Earth, without new electric poles, only a "radio"-like device would be needed, no matter how far it could connect to the power grid.</br>
</br>
However, when Jiang Chen proposed this concept, he realized the scientists were struggling hard not to laugh and they explained to him that the concept wasn't possible. Moreover, Tesla also existed on the timeline of the apocalypse, but it wasn't Morgan Consortium who provided the funding for the Wardenclyffe Tower.</br>
</br>
"Constrained by the technological level of the current era, Tesla created his wireless transmission system by coil coupling. In his algorithm, ground, water, air, and the ionosphere don't absorb electromagnetic waves, so the transmission efficiency is certainly much higher than the resistance of the wires. However, in reality, this is impossible."</br>
</br>
</br>
"To be honest, Tesla isn't a reliable genius. Of course, I don't deny his contribution to alternating currents, his Nobel Prize, or his many contributions. It's just that many of the concepts he proposed were too... Well, science fiction, including his super weapon 'Deadlight' which was proved to be just a charged particle beam. But this is the reason why he was admired by everyone. After all, compared to old pedagogy, ordinary people generally prefer elaborate theories. It's like conspiracy theories are always more widespread than news."</br>
</br>
In other words, if his invention was so magical, the Morgan Consortium never would've stopped funding him.</br>
</br>
After leaving the warehouse, Jiang Chen didn't return to the mansion. Instead, he accompanied the guards and toured around the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
It was nearing the end of October. The dry and cold air iconic to the end of the fall was lingering.</br>
</br>
Winter in the wasteland was much longer than in the modern world, and it was much colder and deadlier.</br>
</br>
Even in the southern region, snow would start to fall in Wanghai in a month at most.</br>
</br>
Since the control of the city center was regained and the mutant nests and zombies were cleared, the city was no longer threatened. The walls that surrounded the Outer Circle of the Sixth Street was still preserved, but compared to its original purpose, the wall now served more as a symbol.</br>
</br>
The survivors built houses outside the walls, and the half-collapsed buildings were also used. After a few repairs, they became the homes of survivor families and groups.</br>
</br>
Almost all survivors of Suhang Province migrated to the Sixth Street or Jia City, also under the jurisdiction of NAC. Excluding the colonial cities of Hongcheng and Yizhou, the total population of NAC already exceeded 300,000. On the streets of Sixth Street, it was more crowded compared to a year ago.</br>
</br>
On the road leading to the market, vehicles transporting food passed by frequently. Merchants from afar often chose to do one last haul before winter, pull Chinese cabbage from the Garden of Eden to the more southern area of Fuzhou, and take their crystals to comfortably spend winters at the local survivor settlements. After the spring, they would bring back local products and return to Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
Because of the existence of NAC, Wanghai had become a trading hub connecting the north and south.</br>
</br>
For some unknown reason, based on what Chu Nan said, the number of merchants from the north decreased significantly compared to previous years. The military government sent a team of Hunter Corps to explore the area around Shangjing, but the scouts who had yet to return.</br>
</br>
However, there were only a few possible reasons for the decrease.</br>
</br>
If it wasn't the weather, they must've had a hard time dealing with mutants, or they encountered gangs in a certain place that blocked their way.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen exclaimed from the industrial zone to the market because every time he returned, he would discover something new in this place. In his memory, the robot ramen noodle shop on the corner was gone and was replaced by a neon bar. The small vendors all disappeared and were replaced by the same shops as the Inner Circle.</br>
</br>
The abundance of materials brought economic prosperity.</br>
</br>
According to Lin Lin, the second Garden of Eden was under construction. After the success of the previous Garden of Eden, the construction of the new one was faster. When the second Garden of Eden was completed, NAC's food would achieve self-sufficiency without any need for exports.</br>
</br>
By that time, Jiang Chen could get rid of the title "food transporter."</br>
</br>
In any case, he was also the president of a world-class company and a warlord with control of a sizable territory. A trip to the secret warehouse to transport hundreds of tons of food every month was unfitting for his status.</br>
</br>
Every week, adding some vegetables from the bottom of the sea to the refrigerator in his own mansion was enough to demonstrate his status as a "great family man."</br>
</br>
Whether it was the taste or texture, the vegetables produced by Xin Ocean Agriculture were very popular among the ladies.</br>
</br>
At the dinner table, watching Sun Jiao and Lin Lin gobble down the food while Yao Yao and Xiaorou took small bites every time made Jiang Chen feel sincerely happy.</br>
</br>
After all the crises in Wanghai City were eliminated, that was one of the main driving forces for him to return to the apocalypse every week…</br>

</br>
Jiang Chen left the Sixth Street by helicopter and returned to Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
He went to the community center and spoke with Wang Qing to gain an understanding of the base's supply reserves. He then asked Han Junhua about the deployment on the front line and whether any new moves had been made by the Northern Alliance Area. Finally, Jiang Chen went to the software development department to check on the department's new game. After he completed all these stops, he left the community center and returned to the mansion.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao was cooking lunch.</br>
</br>
The little Loli in an apron prepared a table full of dishes.</br>
</br>
Whether it was the tender trotters or the fish that had a delicious color, the food all radiated with an appetizing odor. Lin Lin, who was already at the table, had flashing eyes emitting a hungry light. Her chopsticks were already raised and ready to conquer the food.</br>
</br>
After seeing the dishes, Jiang Chen took out two bottles of cold beer from the refrigerator.</br>
</br>
One bottle for himself, and the other bottle for Xiaorou. Sun Jiao never acted appropriately after drinking. She was self-aware and remained loyal to Coke. As for the lovely Yao Yao, Jiang Chen prepared some coconut milk from Coro Island, which was one of her favorite drinks.</br>
</br>
The family ate lunch and chatted about Penglai being built by Jiang Chen in the modern world.</br>
</br>
"Is it a city floating on the ocean? That's unimaginable... Can you build one in the apocalypse?" Sun Jiao took a swig of her Coke then said enviously.</br>
</br>
"There were still a lot of marine cities before the war... but most of them sunk." In the end, Yao Yao's tone was mixed with nostalgia.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao, who lived before the war, was no stranger to the concept of marine cities, but with her current life now, she rarely recalled her life from before the war. The same was true of Lin Lin, who was still fixated on eating her food, even though she took part in the design of Penglai. When Jiang Chen praised Penglai, she just pouted then licked the grease off her lips.</br>
</br>
"Technically feasible, but there's absolutely no need for one here. If I get a chance, I'll definitely take you to see it over there." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"That sounds so good," Sun Xiaorou sighed, full of hope, one hand holding her chin. She murmured, "I just don't know when that day will come."</br>
</br>
"There will be such a day." Jiang Chen promised.</br>
</br>
At that moment, Lin Lin, who was devouring the food, suddenly raised her head. She swallowed down the food in her mouth and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Oh, one thing I almost forgot to tell you."</br>
</br>
"You probably forgot already... What is it?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Her little eyebrows raised and her red and black colored eyes narrowed. Lin Lin proudly raised her chest and dropped a heavy bomb on the table.</br>
</br>
"I made progress on my research in performing interdimensional travel with living creatures."</br>
</br>
</br>
After lunch, nobody touched the plates on the table.</br>
</br>
Not only Jiang Chen, but even Sun Jiao, Xiaorou, Yao Yao all squeezed into Lin Lin's laboratory and fixated on Lin Lin, who was calibrating the instrument.</br>
</br>
"Don't look at me like this, I... I'll get nervous. I'll just mention in advance that after all, it hasn't been tested yet. In theory, it should be feasible. But I'll only find out after the experiment," Lin Lin muttered in a quiet voice. Her fingertips typed on the holographic screen rapidly and she opened several instruments set up in the lab. "Right, how big is your storage dimension now?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's question made Jiang Chen think for a moment. He hadn't thought about this for a long time.</br>
</br>
"It's very big... wait for me to take a look." Jiang Chen closed his eyes and sank his consciousness into the spherical universe.</br>
</br>
This feeling was quite wonderful. Although it was dark, he could clearly perceive the presence of every object in it, and he could use invisible "hands" to fiddle with their positions. The boundary of the universe was an invisible "wall" consisting of pure gravity. There was no substance behind the "wall," and there wasn't even a concept of space.</br>
</br>
It was troublesome to measure the size of this space. Although he had absolute control over all substances in the dimension, he couldn't change much about the space itself.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, he had those invisible "hands" to help. Using manipulation, Jiang Chen arranged the things stored in the storage dimension like Lego to form a crooked line through the center of the spherical universe.</br>
</br>
A proud smile appeared on his face, but his expression suddenly turned awkward.</br>
</br>
[How do I measure this without a ruler?]</br>
</br>
After a long time, Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
The work just made him feel slightly dizzy. Using the invisible hands consumed the energy stored in the bracelet.</br>
</br>
"The radius is approximately 20 meters. Hmm, perhaps 15 meters… It's around the size of a small house." Jiang Chen vaguely described it.</br>
</br>
"How big is a small house? Stupid." Lin Lin mocked him and sighed. Holding a test tube containing an unknown liquid, she approached a cylindrical instrument.</br>
</br>
A small opening in the center of the cylinder perfectly fitted the test tube. White mist rose from the small opening, and it seemed that the temperature inside was quite low.</br>
</br>
"Low-temperature hibernation?" Sun Xiaorou tilted her head.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but no." Lin Lin gave an ambiguous answer. She inserted the test tube into the cylinder, closed the cap, then knocked on the cylinder. "Throw this into your storage space. If I'm correct, it should work."</br>
</br>
"Throw this entire thing in?"</br>
</br>
"Yes, this entire thing." Lin Lin nodded.</br>
</br>
The girls' eyes all concentrated on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Being watched with so much eagerness, Jiang Chen awkwardly touched his nose then put his hand on the cylinder.</br>
</br>
In just the blink of an eye, the one-person-tall cylinder disappeared.</br>
</br>
He looked at Lin Lin and asked, "That's it? Then?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin, holding her small chin, thought carefully. "Directly ... no, first, travel back to your side, then come back and spit it out from the storage dimension."</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's voice had just faded when Jiang Chen disappeared from the room.</br>
</br>
Two minutes later, he appeared in the laboratory again. He lifted his hand, and the cylindrical machine reappeared in the laboratory.</br>
</br>
Yao Yao blinked blankly and still didn't understand what the experiment was all about. Sun Jiao and Xiaorou were also the same, looking at Lin Lin, Jiang Chen and the cylinder at the center of the laboratory in bewilderment.</br>
</br>
Without a care for Jiang Chen, after seeing the cylinder, Lin Lin immediately stepped forward to open the device and took out the test tube. She walked to a microscope, made a temporary slide, and observed it under the microscope.</br>
</br>
Two seconds later, Lin Ling's face turned ecstatic.</br>
</br>
"It's a success!"</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 866: This Year“s Winter Arrived Earlier</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The frost, like sharp knives wrapped in snow and ice, gusted through the faces that had long been frozen and numb. The blanketing snow slowly added more and more pressure on their backpacks. They had 50 kilometers to go before they could reach the outpost in Hanzhong, and there was no time for them to rest.</br>
</br>
The sentry wearing a winter suit walked beside the queue and looked at the white wilderness with a guarded look and his muzzle. The machine gunners who sat on top of the armored vehicles breathed out white mist as they leaned against their machine guns to kill time.</br>
</br>
They were an army that belonged to the Northern Alliance Area.</br>
</br>
Standing behind them were survivors from the Northern Alliance Area, the last group of people to migrate from Lanzhou to Hanzhong.</br>
</br>
Unlike Wanghai, winter had arrived more than a month earlier not just because of the latitude, but more because of radiation clouds covering the sky. Radiation dust weaved together like a quilt. Their effect wasn't keeping the soldiers warm but reflecting sunlight back into space.</br>
</br>
This year was extremely abnormal. Even for the northwest region, this year's winter came much earlier than previous years.</br>
</br>
However, for the wasteland, abnormality itself was the norm.</br>
</br>
People might feel desperate, but they would never be surprised.</br>
</br>
After harvesting the last batch of mutated fruit, the group of people had to travel through the heavy snow to Hanzhong. A lot of people might die there, but if they didn't go, many more were going to die.</br>
</br>
Unlike Wanghai, there weren't many types of zombies there, but many powerful and deceiving mutants haunted this region. And even in the winter, the hungry mutants never hibernated; they lurked in the dark corners, quietly waiting for feasts of blood.</br>
</br>
For example, the mutated wolves attacked like a gust of wind with claws faster than bullets, the only remains of their victims were often only broken bones. A single migrant group once encountered them. Although everyone had guns, no one survived.</br>
</br>
Even if the army ran into these fast and powerful creatures, it would still be quite a headache.</br>
</br>
In order to reduce survivor casualties, the commander of the Northern Alliance ordered the use of valuable nuclear fusion cores and artillery shells by armored troops to escort the migrating survivors.</br>
</br>
Although they inherited armored forces from the pre-war regime, it was regrettable that the lack of resources made it difficult for them to resume industrial production. They could only alleviate the supply pressure of the tens of thousands of troops through resource recovery and the production of small workshops.</br>
</br>
The situation they faced was even worse than that of Sixth Street three years ago. After all, NATO's Marine Corps had never been to the northwest region of NAC. There was almost no battlefield there, and there weren't many resources worth recycling.</br>
</br>
</br>
Each round of heavy machine guns was precious to them.</br>
</br>
An assault vehicle in snow camouflage approached from behind. When the assault vehicle passed by, although the soldiers didn't stop, they raised their hands to perform a PAC salute and offered their leaders the highest respect.</br>
</br>
In the back of the assault vehicle, a fierce-looking man looked at the map without saying a word.</br>
</br>
His name was Wei Bian. After Jiang Beihai, he served as the commander of the Northern Alliance Area. His position was similar to that of NAC's General. Sitting next to him was his assistant, Deputy Commander of Luo Xugang. These were the last survivors to migrate to Hanzhong and were also the last survivor group to move from Lanzhou.</br>
</br>
When they withdrew, the city left behind had only broken walls and roaming beasts. Perhaps in a few hundred years, ivy would drill through the stone cracks in the cement pavement and sprout new shoots from the dead wood. It would naturally use its own methods to erase evidence of human existence and dye the earth with its original color--</br>
</br>
Barbaric and without order.</br>
</br>
"This year's snow is earlier than usual." Luo Xugang, who was sitting in the front, sighed and shook the cigar that was about to burn up.</br>
</br>
"Yes," Wei Bian replied without much emotion.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to die of the cold." Lu Xugang glanced at the commander from the corner of his eye. When the last trace of nicotine on the cigarette butt was burnt, he squished the cigar into the ashtray.</br>
</br>
"Should I turn up the air conditioner?"</br>
</br>
"No, no, I meant a different sense of cold." Luo Xugang waved his hand, and his coarse fingers took out another cigarette from his pocket and put it into his mouth.</br>
</br>
"You're smoking away your health."</br>
</br>
As if he heard something funny, Luo Xugang suddenly laughed and blew out a smoke ring. "Fu*k health."</br>
</br>
Wei Bian didn't respond; his furrowed eyes still remained on the paper map.</br>
</br>
Silence ensued in the vehicle for a long time with only the sound of wheels rolling over the snow. Luo Xugang opened his eyes and silently smoked his cigarette rolled from the mutated tobacco and felt the spicy taste inside his nasal cavity. He didn't know when it started, but only this feeling gave him a sense of being alive.</br>
</br>
Very abruptly, Luo Xugang broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"Our time is limited."</br>
</br>
However, Wei Bian had the same indifferent expression.</br>
</br>
"I know."</br>
</br>
"I heard there's a rising power called NAC in Wanghai. The full name seems to be the New Asia Cooperation."</br>
</br>
"I've heard about them."</br>
</br>
"Those little guys seem to be sent by them. Although our missiles can handle them, they're always a problem... Do we really want to fight them?" Luo Xugang scratched his head.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Silence resumed.</br>
</br>
After a long while, Luo Xugang, holding his cigarette, was still the one who broke the silence.</br>
</br>
"I'm really envious of you."</br>
</br>
When Wei Bian heard that, his eyes left the map for the first time, and he gazed through the window to the white wilderness.</br>
</br>
There, a sentry discovered the mutant wolves lurking in the snow, and he immediately lifted his rifle. Soon, blood splattered onto the pristine snow, but when he pulled out the dagger and stepped forward to dig for the crystal, three more wolves leaped out...</br>
</br>
The gunfire was loud but soon stopped.</br>
</br>
The medics took the dying sentry to the truck, but unable to save him, he quickly ended up in a body bag. The bodies of the four wolves were tossed onto trucks equipped with organic converters. After digging up the crystals, they would be refined into nutrient supply. The team didn't stop from beginning to end. The survivors who passed through the bloodstained ground didn't look away from the road under their feet for a second.</br>
</br>
It seemed that nothing happened there.</br>
</br>
Nature had already decided who would die and who would survive.</br>
</br>
"You won't be envious." Wei Bian's eyes refocused on the map as he spoke without emotion.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"It's a success!"</br>
</br>
The cells in the test tube were still alive!</br>
</br>
There were cheers from the ladies in the laboratory.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard Lin Lin say this sentence, he didn't know what to do to describe the excitement in his heart.</br>
</br>
According to Lin Lin, she dropped 20 milliliter of test solution mixed with human tissue cells into the test tube before placing the test tube in the freezer. After placing the test tube in a special freezer and simulating a hibernation environment, the living cells in the test tube successfully survived through the entropy reduction step when crossing through the "dimensions."</br>
</br>
The key to transporting living creatures lay in antimatter!</br>
</br>
Lin Lin explained the reason with a lot of mathematics and physics formulas. However, Jiang Chen was lost from the first step and didn't understand what she was saying. Even though he repeatedly asked her to explain the principles in common language, she just knocked on the whiteboard helplessly, tossed away the marker in her hand, and looked at Jiang Chen with care in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Just give up."</br>
</br>
At the same time, snowflakes were falling down.</br>
</br>
"It's already snowing?" Sun Jiao looked out the window.</br>
</br>
"Does it usually snow at this time of year?" With the topic changed, Jiang Chen also glanced out the window.</br>
</br>
"It usually snows in November," Yao Yao quietly whispered.</br>
</br>
"It seems that this year's winter arrived earlier." Sun Xiaorou sighed.</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 867: War Preparation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Although it was only possible to transport 20 millilitre of test solution, it was already a breakthrough for the problem that had no solution.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen believed that as long as the experiment continued, the problem of interdimensional travel would be solved sooner or later!</br>
</br>
The crux of the problem was that transporting 20 millilitre of the test solution consumed 0.01 milligram of antimatter. These antimatter substances were almost everything Lin Lin collected.</br>
</br>
According to Lin Lin, it was easier to collect antimatter in space because there would be much less material interference than on Earth. However, it was very difficult to carry out space activities in the apocalypse. Space debris in outer space had almost formed an asteroid belt that orbited the Earth at a terrifying speed.</br>
</br>
Construction of an antimatter collection space station on the other side might be a good choice, but from a technical point of view, it seemed quite unrealistic.</br>
</br>
But anyway, it was a good start.</br>
</br>
Perhaps as the study continued, Lin Lin could find more convenient ways that consumed less antimatter to achieve transporting living creatures between the modern world and the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
In order to celebrate this success, Jiang Chen returned to the modern world and asked the dessert chef at the top floor of the Future Building to personally make a 12-inch indulgent pudding cake, which he brought to the apocalypse for Lin Lin as a reward. The excited Lin Lin almost jumped on the cake.</br>
</br>
A party was held in the evening. Jiang Chen only remembered he drank a lot of alcohol and didn't remember anything that happened after that.</br>
</br>
It was snowing.</br>
</br>
This year's winter was earlier than in previous years. The snow fell from the previous afternoon until morning the next day.</br>
</br>
Just overnight, the entire city was covered in a layer of silver foundation. Although it was only a thin layer on the ground, people could already smell the nuclear winter from the air and started preparing for the toughest season.</br>
</br>
There was a shortage of cabbage and potatoes in the farmers' market on Sixth Street. In order to stabilize prices, Jiang Chen had to shoulder his responsibility as the "food transporter" once again and transported 300 tons of rice and 150 tons of cabbage and potatoes to the apocalypse to stabilize market demand.</br>
</br>
The merchants stationed on Sixth Street left the market at the earliest date and headed south. They had to transport their expensive food to areas further south before the snow blocked the roads.</br>
</br>
NAC's patrol team also changed their equipment and began to don their winter clothes and drag out the snowmobiles to the damaged streets as they began to patrol NAC territory. The soldiers already completed a ten-kilometer run. They were now entering the training ground with rifles and began live firing exercises under the direction of instructors.</br>
</br>
After emptying a clip, the soldiers would then go to the cafeteria to eat. After half an hour of rest, their training continued.</br>
</br>
</br>
Everyone at Fishbone base lived a fulfilling life, except for the general who "lived lavishly and scandalously". He didn't wake up from the tenderness of the sisters until the Sun was directly over his head.</br>
</br>
Planting gentle kisses on Sun Jiao and Xiaorou's foreheads, Jiang Chen covered the two sisters with the blanket, put on some clothes and walked out of the house.</br>
</br>
There were two days left before he flew to the UA. It would be inconvenient to return to the apocalypse there. He planned to see what he needed to do and finish all the work before leaving.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen pushed open the door of the command center, Han Junhua was sitting at the table studying the map. Judging by the coffee that no longer emitted white steam, she must've been there for a long time.</br>
</br>
"The last batch of survivors have already made their way. If they didn't stop at the halfway point, they're now estimated to be in Hanzhong. According to the information gathered by the pilots, the Northern Alliance Area has a combat capability between 100,000 and 300,000 soldiers, equipped with pre-war armor and air defense vehicles."</br>
</br>
"100,000 to 300,000? The margin of error is that big?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
"Our planes can't get too close. They used air-defense missiles to force away our fighters." Han Junhua gently swiped on the holographic map and opened a window in front of Jiang Chen. "The red zone box was the no-fly zone delineated by the air defense missile."</br>
</br>
From Hanzhong to Ankang, they were all enveloped in the air defense missile warning zone of the Northern Alliance Area.</br>
</br>
"I still don't understand why they're migrating. If they're expanding, why should they abandon their base in Lanzhou?" Jiang Chen looked at the mark on the map in Hanzhong and he couldn't be any more clueless.</br>
</br>
According to merchants from the Northern Alliance Area, it seemed that the military organization named the gendarmerie had political power and implemented a similar military-political-management model as the NAC.</br>
</br>
Not only that, but over the past 20 years, the local survivors already developed a large number of farmland and settlements, planted mutated fruits, shell bullets, and a genetically modified plant that resembled potatoes with a poorer taste.</br>
</br>
[From this point of view, they shouldn't be facing a severe survival crisis.]</br>
</br>
[But why are they so fixated to the south?]</br>
</br>
"The specific reasons are only clear to them. There isn't much opportunity for merchants from the Northern Alliance Area to come into contact with survivors. All trade is done directly with the gendarmerie. They don't trust outsiders very much. We have no way of communicating with them." Han Junhua shook her head.</br>
</br>
"If we go to war, who do you think has better odds?" Jiang Chen spoke after a moment of thought.</br>
</br>
"They have a large amount of PAC pre-war marine equipment, but we have the resources advantage." Here, Han Junhua's beautiful eyebrows wrinkled slightly. She put her hand against her chin, deep in thought before she finally replied, "Perhaps it'll be a brutal battle, but we're unlikely to lose."</br>
</br>
Even if they used five Tigers IIs to take down one Wanderer Tank, the odds of winning would still tilt toward NAC. As long as the Type-50 Electromagnetic Pulse Cannon could rip through their armor, Jiang Chen felt there was no reason to make him lose.</br>
</br>
However, there was one point Han Junhua didn't consider. NAC wasn't only advantaged in terms of resources, but it was backed by a world of resources. The assembly plant of the kinetic skeleton had been completed on Ange Island. Within a few months, Jiang Chen could bring over tens of thousands of kinetic skeletons to equip every NAC soldier.</br>
</br>
Even now, the monthly production of the K1 Kinetic Skeleton on Sixth Street didn't exceed 500.</br>
</br>
After considering Han Junhua's opinions, Jiang Chen revised the conscription bill. From next month until March next year, two thousand people were to be recruited each month from the NAC jurisdiction to train at Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the three major corps were expanded to three armies containing division-size combat groups. Each division had 2,000 personnel with no upper limit on the number of divisions in each army. With the current force, each army was formed by only four divisions. Based on the number of soldiers now, there was still a large discrepancy between NAC and the Northern Alliance Area 's power.</br>
</br>
But victory was never decided by the number of people alone.</br>
</br>
If they compared industrial and logistics capabilities, then even ten Northern Alliances would be no match against the invincible NAC.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Although it was already winter in Wanghai, the modern world Coro Island was still beautiful and lovely.</br>
</br>
With the Sun just above the horizon, the sea breeze gently swayed the palm tree leaves and danced with the people swimming in the ocean tide. With the breeze, bursts of playfulness and laughter drifted in the distance. Although he couldn't understand the language, Jiang Chen always felt at peace upon hearing this sound.</br>
</br>
They applied for the runway at Los Santos International Airport. Tomorrow, he would fly to the UA.</br>
</br>
This morning, he returned from the apocalypse and spent the whole day at home, making final preparations for the trip. After dinner, he thought he should change his mood, so he decided to put on some sportswear and headed outside.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen only intended to run a few laps around the park in the community, but with his body condition, he didn't feel any weariness from just jogging a few kilometers. Halfway through the jog, he ran a little farther than before and got on the road at the edge of the beach.</br>
</br>
On Coro Island alone, there were as many as 500,000 to 600,000 visitors that stayed at any-given-time. Looking at people who were having fun on the beach, Jiang Chen always felt a sense of satisfaction of being the king of the island.</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, laughing and driving this weird idea out of his head, he wiped his sweat with the towel on his shoulders. He wondered if it was time to head back, but he happened to see a familar face also on the road.</br>
</br>
It was Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
She was wearing a white tracksuit set. Her hair was tied into a refreshing ponytail which wobbled like a squirrel's tail with her running rhythm.</br>
</br>
When she saw Jiang Chen, she waved and jogged over.</br>
</br>
"What a rare sight. Are you in the habit of running at night?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said: "It's usually in the morning, unless I wake up late. Want to run together?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded and ran naturally beside Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen planned to go back, but he started running alongside Xia Shiyu. But what he didn't know was that when he ran into her, she was almost done her jog as well. When he invited her to accompany him, she somehow agreed.</br>
</br>
They ran for an hour.</br>
</br>
What made Xia Shiyu curious was that from his appearance, Jiang Chen didn't look like someone who worked out often. But during this one hour jog, he didn't even sweat that much. It was her who ended up being gassed and asked to rest for a while.</br>
</br>
They happened to stop near Jiang Chen's mansion.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu took a shower in his bathroom.</br>
</br>
Ayesha walked into the bathroom with clean clothes and took away their sweaty clothes to be laundered. When she walked by Jiang Chen, she gave Xia Shiyu an odd thumbs up.</br>
</br>
Drying off her wet hair, Xia Shiyu, dressed in pajamas, pushed open the frosted glass door, slightly embarrassed.</br>
</br>
"Do you have any casual clothes I can borrow? ... I can't wear this outside."</br>
</br>
</br>
Ayesha said: "It's almost nine o'clock. Stay here for the night."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha helplessly.</br>
</br>
This little girl occasionally would decide to do superfluous things.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's cheeks turned red and she was just ready to decline when she heard the invitation.</br>
</br>
Just then, Natasha pushed open the door and walked in. After walking up the stairs, her eyes locked withXia Shiyu's eyes.</br>
</br>
Seeing someone she didn't expect, Xia Shiyu took a second to process who it was.</br>
</br>
"Why...are you here?"</br>
</br>
"Because I didn't manage to rent a place. Since there happened to be a spare room here, I stayed." Then Natasha smiled slyly and mocked Xiao Shiyu. "What's wrong? Are you jealous?"</br>
</br>
The flush extended from her cheeks to her neck. However, Xia Shiyu's stubborn expression meant she wasn't going to admit this point.</br>
</br>
Natasha didn't wait for her to answer. Humming a Russian song, she went into the bathroom. Since she just returned from the embassy, she was planning to take a shower and change into some loose pajamas to rest.</br>
</br>
Silence lingered at the stairs.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was about to ask if Xia Shiyu needed him to drive her back to her apartment, Xia Shiyu moved her stiff neck and looked at him.</br>
</br>
"In the future..."</br>
</br>
"In the future?"</br>
</br>
"I'm also going to live here."</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu squeezed this sentence out of her lips, she seemed to have exhausted all her strength. Jiang Chen completely froze in place as the information processed through his head.</br>
</br>
[What the heck just happened?]</br>
</br>
It was a 13-hour flight from Coro Island to Los Santos, and the time difference was 16 hours.</br>
</br>
At 6 o'clock Los Santos time, a white Gulfstream private jet landed on the runway of Los Santos International Airport slowly. Six black cars stopped on the runway. Officials and bodyguards in suits quietly waited for the plane to land.</br>
</br>
Accompanied by Xia Shiyu, Jiang Chen walked off the plane.</br>
</br>
Behind him was a Ghost Agent named Zhu Yu and six Celestial Trade bodyguards in suits.</br>
</br>
Although Ayesha strongly requested to accompany him, it was better for her to remain in the rear, considering her identity as the Ghost Chief Instructor. Also, if any incidents happened to Jiang Chen, she would be the one who pressed the launch button for the missile.</br>
</br>
After seeing Jiang Chen, Lawrence, who had waited for a long time, took off his sunglasses and extended his hand in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen. You must've met me before, but I guess you've already forgot me. Allow me to introduce myself-"</br>
</br>
"Nice to see you again, Mr. Lawrence," Jiang Chen said, holding Lawrence's hand with a grin.</br>
</br>
Lawrence stopped. He obviously didn't expect Jiang Chen to remember him.</br>
</br>
"Your memory is amazing..."</br>
</br>
"I'm also amazed that the FBA is actually responsible for my safety?" Jiang Chen looked at the two bodyguards behind him wearing sunglasses and said in a mocking tone.</br>
</br>
"That's right. Your security level is just behind that of a fat man sixty years ago. By the way, his name was Khrushchev. Ahem, allow me to introduce you. This is the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Pritzker. You may have engaged in a lawsuit against each other, but I hope you don't mind." Lawrence introduced Jiang Chen to the official next to him.</br>
</br>
The so-called lawsuit naturally referred to the anti-trust investigation that caused a sensation in the UA and resulted in the interruption of the Phantom helmet service.</br>
</br>
"It's an hour to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen." Pritzker extended his hand. His hooked nose looked aggressive, but his voice sounded mild.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Pritzker." Jiang Chen smiled and shook his hand.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen expected, the UA placed great importance on his safety. No matter how much of a headache those dozens of intercontinental missiles gave them, they couldn't do anything against him here, nor would they allow anyone to do anything to him here.</br>
</br>
If something happened to this guy, those missiles definitely wouldn't keep the peace under the sea; they would fall on this soil.</br>
</br>
By then, the entire continent would have to return to the Stone Age.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 869: Arrving in Los Santos</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen left the airport with Lawrence and the others through a special terminal.</br>
</br>
The UA certainly did take his safety to heart, and there wasn't the slightest news of his visit to Los Santos released. Otherwise, if nothing else, the airport entrance would've definitely been blocked by a large group of technology enthusiasts and reporters lurking around.</br>
</br>
Phantom helmets had been incorporated into the lives of UA citizens. The influence had already surpassed Google, Microsoft, and Apple's. Although the Capital was constantly having a headache over young people's reliance on Future Group's products, some things just couldn't be resolved by thinking.</br>
</br>
Especially in a country who voted for their president.</br>
</br>
Regardless how much money consortiums paid for publicity, the final outcome of the election still depended on the ballots cast.</br>
</br>
For various reasons, Jiang Chen didn't sit in the same car as Mr. Pritzker but he sat beside Lawrence. Judging by their conversation, the former FBA agent appeared to be doing quite well and had climbed into a senior position.</br>
</br>
Although the encounter between the two wasn't friendly, they got along well surprisingly. Lawrence repeatedly emphasized several security precautions to Jiang Chen such as avoiding straying too far from the vehicle when going out and not panicking in the event of an emergency because a whole squad of Seals would ensure his safety in the periphery. Unless it was a last resort, he was not to let the girl agent shoot...</br>
</br>
"How's my old friend Robert doing?"</br>
</br>
"He went from being an arms dealer to a big director, but the nature of a b*stard won't change."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and didn't respond.</br>
</br>
But really, compared to those politicians excellent at dodging questions, he preferred to spend time with more direct people. Although they were more vulgar, at least they didn't annoy him.</br>
</br>
When the fleet arrived at a bridge, there was a traffic jam.</br>
</br>
It seemed there was a protest in front of them; people were holding green signs and shouting gibberish slogans.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen vaguely heard a guy using a megaphone and shouting a mouthful of broken English: "We refuse to work the arranged work and we didn't come to work. We're Hill's guests!"</br>
</br>
"We need more vines and camels in the zoo! Not pandas or alpacas!"</br>
</br>
"Supermarkets aren't allowed to sell pork!"</br>
</br>
"Beef too!" It seemed that the "Indians" wearing turbans were also part of the protest, but no one noticed.</br>
</br>
"What kind of degenerate manages this city? I'm protesting against the mayor of Los Santos! The mayor of Los Santos must resign!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Perhaps this situation was too common; pedestrians walking around calmly watched them raising their placards and shouting slogans. Other than media reporters who wanted headlines, only a few people with travel bags took pictures.</br>
</br>
"And they are?" Jiang Chen asked slyly.</br>
</br>
</br>
"The 'guests' invited by the old lady with menstrual problems; there are probably also a few who just wants to make trouble. Ignore them; we'll change lanes." Lawrence cursed, closed the window, and turned the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
According to traffic rules, temporary lane changes weren't allowed, but the FBA car wasn't the same as the average car. This kind of privilege was common in any country, especially for special personnel.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of that, what's the relationship between the mayor of Los Santos and the supermarket?" Jiang Chen gloated while laughing.</br>
</br>
There wasn't much trouble in Xin. Almost all villains went out of business since police drones were popularized from Penglai to Coro. Even transnational criminal gangs quieted down.</br>
</br>
As for protests or riots?</br>
</br>
All were deported and went back to where they came from!</br>
</br>
"There's no relationship, but some people live like dogs. There's no contribution from this group - they steal your things, like locusts leaching from you, but they also act like they're vulnerable. If there's one less piece of meat in their lunch box, they'll shamelessly pose as the victims and demand you must change things. If they encounter the slightest obstacle, they'll put on a thuggish appearance and use their shallow intelligence and vulgar language to show how shameless and ugly they are." Lawrence honked his horn and stopped in front of the red light.</br>
</br>
"Is it really okay to say this?" Jiang Chen glanced at him.</br>
</br>
"I'm not the president. I don't care about some ballots," Lawrence groaned. "I really don't understand why I didn't vote for Donny."</br>
</br>
After a short silence, Lawrence felt he might have gone over the line and added with a moderate tone, "Okay, I admit that not all refugees are like this... At least some people are still aware that it's not right for them to do this."</br>
</br>
"There are many people like this, anywhere. Just get used to it." Jiang Chen comforted him.</br>
</br>
However, just as he said that, a "BOOM" rang out in the near distance. There were screams and cries, burglar alarms began to ring, and chaos filled the entire street, but the FBA official was rather calm.</br>
</br>
He seemed to be used to it.</br>
</br>
Lawrence stepped on the brakes, buried his face between his fingers and sighed out of exhaustion then picked up the intercom on the side.</br>
</br>
"Carl, Jess, you go over there and analyze the situation. At least keep the situation under control then hand things over to the Los Santos police."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
Lawrence continued driving after he ended the communication.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen asked: "What happened on the other side?"</br>
</br>
Lawrence scoffed, "Somebody hid a bomb in his clothes? Or in a car? Who knows? Anyway, I only know that where there are refugees, there will be terrorist attacks. If we suspect it will happen, then it will happen. That's Murphy's Law."</br>
</br>
The fleet soon arrived at the Xin Embassy. The Ambassador of Xin had long been waiting and welcomed Jiang Chen and Mr. Pritzker, the Minister of Commerce from the Capital. Here, Jiang Chen also saw the mayor of Los Santos, the governor of Calif, and city officials.</br>
</br>
Although the welcome ceremony wasn't grand by any means, the officials who came to greet him were definitely at the national level.</br>
</br>
After meeting all the eager officials, Jiang Chen went to his accommodations with Sun Yongcheng, the Xin Ambassador in Los Santos.</br>
</br>
At the embassy, Jiang Chen's security work was under the responsibility of Celestial Trade. Outside of the embassy, the FBA was responsible for his safety. In fact, in the beginning, the UA recommended he stay at a place like the Hilton Hotel. However, when he thought of being under the watch of FBA even in his sleep, Jiang Chen felt uncomfortable, so he declined this proposal and chose the Xin Embassy.</br>
</br>
Before Jiang Chen entered the room he was staying at, Zhu Yu remembered Ayesha's words and walked into the room with anti-reconnaissance equipment to conduct a full-scale inspection to ensure there were no devices such as a wire-tapper or pinhole camera.</br>
</br>
After throwing his suit on a hanger, Jiang Chen rested on the big bed for a while then went out to find Xia Shiyu, who was organizing her clothes.</br>
</br>
Considering how busy she looked, Jiang Chen couldn't help laughing.</br>
</br>
"Why don't you just ask the embassy staff to help you?"</br>
</br>
"I'm more used to organizing my own belongings. Right, there's a party tonight. Are you not going to rest a bit first? After all, that was a 13-hour flight." Xia Shiyu gently combed her hair then neatly put her clothes inside the wardrobe.</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to go?" Jiang Chen asked with some regret.</br>
</br>
"I won't. That kind of occasion...I'm not very good in those situations. And for Silicon Valley's Summit, I still have some work to do," Xia Shiyu said as she pushed up her glasses.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"Not at all." Xia Shiyu smiled.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was an illusion or perhaps not, but Jiang Chen felt that Xia Shiyu loved to smile more than before, and her distant attitude was no longer so distant anymore.</br>
</br>
Could it be because of that night...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen thought about that and his face began to burn. He coughed a few times to push the thought out of his head.</br>
</br>
However, there was one thing Jiang Chen was wondering about. In the car that night, they were already at that stage. However, Xia Shiyu seemed to pretend that nothing happened before. It was like she had forgotten everything since she never mentioned it.</br>
</br>
Was it really because she was drunk?</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 870: Governor“s Party</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the evening, Governor Jerry Brown invited Jiang Chen to the governor's residence along with Richard Fox, Vice President of Warner Bros., and elites from all industries in Los Santos.</br>
</br>
For the wealthiest man in the world on the Forbes list with wealth enough to match a nation, Jiang Chen naturally became the central figure at the banquet. Everyone around him was either envious, jealous, or friendly. Many entrepreneurs who wished to establish a connection with Future Group did all they could to befriend him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen never thought that he would embark on the UA in such a stance, but when this day came, he didn't feel too surprised.</br>
</br>
"Welcome to the UA, Mr. Jiang Chen. This is the wealthy's paradise. You will love it here." Mr. Fox smiled and lifted his champagne, gently toasting with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
For Warner Bros. and the only virtual image production company – Virtual Image's co-produced "The Time Curtain," Mr. Fox, as one of the shareholders, had high hopes. The film was in its final stage and would hit the screens by January of next year at the latest.</br>
</br>
Major movie critics' websites all gave quite optimistic forecasts for this next-generation film. After all, it would be the first film produced using VR technology. Even just for this novelty, the box office would not perform poorly</br>
</br>
"If you are referring to Mr. Brown's party." Jiang Chen laughed and drank the glass of champagne.</br>
</br>
At this time, the governor and a middle-aged man in a suit came to their side.</br>
</br>
Brown with a shaved head asked Jiang Chen with a smile, "Are you pleased with the drink?"</br>
</br>
"Very pleased. Thank you for your hospitality." Jiang Chen replied courteously.</br>
</br>
"Haha, thank you for your compliment. Please allow me to introduce this gentleman. This is Andi Giannini, the sponsor of this banquet," Brown smiled and told Jiang Chen about the middle-aged man standing next to him. "Chairman of Bank of America, and a major shareholder of Pacific Insurance."</br>
</br>
"It's too boring to write your business on your business card. I'd rather others refer to me as a golfer." Andi grinned and rolled his eyes, extending his hand to Jiang Chen. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that Mr. Fox, a shareholder of Warner Bros., appeared to be rather restrained.</br>
</br>
"My pleasure, Mr. Giannini." Jiang Chen took his hand.</br>
</br>
To be honest, this last name was quite a mouthful. He almost bit his tongue the first time he said it.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen was no stranger to this last name.</br>
</br>
After all, before coming to the UA, he had done enough homework.</br>
</br>
Bank of America was the centerpiece of the Cali consortium. Its predecessor was the bank founded by the descendant of Italian immigrants, A.P. Giannini in the early 20th century. The Giannini standing in front him was one of individual that possessed the real powers of the UA. In this country dominated by Wall Street, the capitalists were the people that controlled the nation. Although the status of the Cali consortium was slightly inferior to that of the consortium on the east, its accumulated wealth in the past 100 years still could not be underestimated.</br>
</br>
</br>
Many people knew that Los Santos in Cali was renowned for its film industry, but few people knew that Cali was also the largest arms production base in the UA. Including the famous Lockheed and Northrop Grumman, the nation's largest and second-largest arms companies belonged to this family. Although the shares were also diluted by other consortium, their status as military overlords remained untouchable.</br>
</br>
The banquet this scale was definitely not possible to be funded by the state government's vault. Disregarding everything else, just the champagnes on the table all came from famous Italian wineries. The expense of the alcohol would cost more than hundreds of thousands of dollars. If journalists knew that the governor took the taxpayer's money to party, the media would pounce on it immediately.</br>
</br>
However, the party being sponsored by the Giannini family also showed that the relationship between the governor and the Cali Consortium was not shallow.</br>
</br>
It could even be said that the party itself was held based on the directions of this important figure.</br>
</br>
The two chatted casually and made no mention about business. Giannini seemed to be very interested in golf. When Jiang Chen mentioned that he owned a golf course at the foot of Mount Fuji, his eyes lit up and he said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen is certainly confident having dared to buy at the dip during the Yoto Crisis. If I have the opportunity to go to Yoto, I must check your golf course out."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not believe that he was the only one who divided up the assets of Nippon at that time. The consortium on the west coast had always been interested in the affairs of East Asia and it would be impossible for them to let such a good opportunity pass. Although it was certainly a gamble, a few billion was nothing for a consortium this size.</br>
</br>
"Haha, I look forward to your arrival," Jiang Chen responded courteously.</br>
</br>
The small talk lasted for about ten minutes. The governor and Mr. Fox left one after another and joined other circles with champagne. Mr. Giannini, however, finally began talking about "business".</br>
</br>
"I've heard... Mr. Jiang has had some frictions with the Freemasonry. I don't know if it is true or not?"</br>
</br>
After asking this, Giannini seemed to feel that it was not appropriate to ask such a question directly, so he added another sentence.</br>
</br>
"Of course, I didn't mean to offend. Our ancestors came from Italy. Although the Giannini family is no longer within the WASP faction, we also have reservations ."</br>
</br>
"Frictions, of course, and not small frictions either. If Mr. Giannini has read the news, you will certainly know about this." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Giannini smiled and did not respond.</br>
</br>
Of course, he had read the news, and he obviously knew about the public events. It was just that the meaning was completely different when the parties involved directly speak of it. Because their assets were mostly located on the west coast, the Giannini family was far from the Capital, the economic and political center of the UA. In the view of the Eastern Consortium, they were more like the "rich landlords" of the countryside than their competition.</br>
</br>
It was also the reason for the gradual decline of the Cali Consortium. It was now almost ranked at the end of the top ten consortiums in the UA. If it weren't for the behemoth known as the Bank of America, the Texas Consortium that emerged after World War II could even stand toe-to-toe with them.</br>
</br>
This sense of alienation from the mainstream world made the Giannini family quite restless and this was also the reason as to why they were keen to invest in Asia. If they couldn't go eastward, they must at least find a way out in the west.</br>
</br>
The friction between Future Group and Freemasonry made them see opportunities.</br>
</br>
If the Freemasonry was to fall, the Freemasonry headed by Goldman Sachs would face liquidation, and the situation of the Wall Street divided by the two would completely change. This would undoubtedly be a rare opportunity for the West Coast Consortium away from the center of power.</br>
</br>
Of course, all this was based on the premise that the Future Group would be the eventual victor.</br>
</br>
Andi Giannini was convinced. With his foresight, he thought that this young man would be worthy of his chips on the table.</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 871"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 871: Unexpected Trouble</br>
</div></br>
</br>
However, when Giannini prepared to discuss some business matters with Jiang Chen, the party was suddenly interrupted by a rude knocking sound.</br>
</br>
The melodious music in the hall stopped and two men in suits came in, and their expression was clearly unfriendly.</br>
</br>
The original lively party suddenly quieted down.</br>
</br>
Seeing the people that came in, Governor Brown frowned and walked toward the two men in suits. Jiang Chen noticed that behind the two men, Lawrence also followed them, and he was clearly displeased.</br>
</br>
Although he was unhappy, Brown in a gentle tone asked, "What's wrong, Mr. Steven, this is my party. All the invited guests are law-abiding citizens. Or is the terrorist attack from the morning parade in front of the bridge causing you a headache so that you want to have a drink or two at my place."</br>
</br>
"Law-abiding? Is that right?" The man known as Steven scoffed coldly as he gazed at the governor's mansion's hall with a hawk-like look. He then locked onto Jiang Chen, and his eyes began to narrow. "You are Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
The organization of the intelligence department was somewhat unique. CIB and FBA both directly served the National Security Council of the UA. The chairman of the National Security Council was also served by the current UA president, so the CIB possessed a strong national sense of pride and acted completely independent of the state government.</br>
</br>
It was precisely for this reason that Steven could care less about this governor.</br>
</br>
"Yes, what's the matter?" Jiang Chen said pleasantly while putting his glass aside.</br>
</br>
"Our agents discovered something interesting in Ukraine. As you know, the Russians have been doing little tricks there recently, or to put it more straightforward, it is an illegal invasion. According to Ukrainian government soldiers, the Russian soldiers who disguised themselves as militants use a weapon that can paralyze electronic devices."</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry; I don't understand what you said," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
He noticed that Zhu Yu, in a brown suit, was already standing by the door with her hand in her pocket.</br>
</br>
Of course, she wasn't trying to draw a gun, but if this Mr. Steven made an offensive move, there were a hundred ways the Ghost Agent could lay him on the ground.</br>
</br>
"Is it true? I think your company is an expert in EMP weapons. It should be very clear what this means." Steven sneered.</br>
</br>
The guests attending the banquet all looked in their direction with interest.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed and helplessly shrugged.</br>
</br>
"Only relying on the EMP feature to determine that the weapons are coming from the hands of Future Group, isn't this too arbitrary? What about the Ukrainian militants and government forces who are armed with M4 rifles? Or are they actually special forces sent by the UA?"</br>
</br>
Steven's tone began to sound threatening. "I hope you bring a cooperative attitude. I'm not kidding with you."</br>
</br>
</br>
"So, what are you going to do to get me to cooperate, for someone who is not a UA citizen?" Jiang Chen shrugged and said with a careless smile.</br>
</br>
At this point, the tension had already escalated to its peak.</br>
</br>
Brown was annoyed. He didn't care if there was an EMP in a Ukrainian town tens of thousands of kilometers away. He only cared about how many dollars he could bring to Cali and how many jobs he could create.</br>
</br>
It was no exaggeration to say that as long as Jiang Chen and anyone there made a deal, it would give him great help in the next governor election.</br>
</br>
However, it was a pity that this party went down the drain.</br>
</br>
As he prepared to speak, Lawrence, who had been standing in the doorway, spoke first. With his colleague belonging to different departments, he used a rare aggressive tone.</br>
</br>
"Enough, Mr. Steven. Jiang Chen is a guest of the Capital, not your suspect. Everything has to be done according to procedures. If there is no procedure, why do we need the Capital and Constitution?"</br>
</br>
Steven then said word by word, "In the interest of national security, there is a special case for everything. And I'm not interrogating. I just hope he can cooperate with the investigation."</br>
</br>
Lawrence stared at him and said without hesitation. "But the FBA is responsible for his safety. If you don't understand the word national security, then ask your boss. At least receive permission first."</br>
</br>
Lawrence sealed Steven's mouth.</br>
</br>
As he suspected, Steven's action was unauthorized.</br>
</br>
However, even within the FBA, Jiang Chen's security level was strictly confidential information. It was understandable that Steven, who had no knowledge of the situation, would be unaware. After all, he was assigned as a commissioner on Ukrainian affairs. When he learned that Jiang Chen, who might be involved in the matter, would visit Los Santos, he flew from the Capital right away.</br>
</br>
He didn't even ask his boss.</br>
</br>
"Ah, Mr. Steven, say hello to Mr. Naomi for me." Giannini gently coughed.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed that Steven's shoulders turned stiff all of a sudden.</br>
</br>
Naomi was likely his top boss. Judging from his rude demeanor to Lawrence, his rank was at least a rank above an agent in CIB. In this case, Mr. Naomi should be the director or deputy director.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the strength of the Cali Consortium really cannot be underestimated.</br>
</br>
In the end, under the pressure by the countless stares, Steven gestured to the assistant next to him and chose to leave for now.</br>
</br>
However, before he left, he left a sentence. "I will find evidence."</br>
</br>
[Evidence?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen almost laughed out loud.</br>
</br>
[What if he collected evidence?]</br>
</br>
[Can the UA give him a sentence?]</br>
</br>
[The agent is probably the kind of "newcomer" who got promoted too fast and is eager to do something to prove his worthiness in his new position. However, such thoughts are often quite dangerous, especially for people who work in dangerous industries.]</br>
</br>
In contrast, Lawrence, the old fox, would never make such frivolity.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't think Mr. Steven could cause him any trouble. He looked at him with a smile. "Please."</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry for this small interruption," Brown walked to Jiang Chen with a glass of champagne and said in an apologetic tone.</br>
</br>
"No worries, I can pretend that it was a great standup comedy." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by friendly laughter, Zhu Yu nodded to Jiang Chen and withdrew from the hall after Lawrence left and closed the door of the hall. The melodious music continued again.</br>
</br>
However, after the interruption, everyone's interest was reduced to the minimum. Even though the Governor was very good at communication, he used all his effort to barely manage to keep the party going to the end. Because of the sudden visit by the CIB, the well-planned party was completely ruined.</br>
</br>
Not only was the governor irritated, but so was Andi Giannini.</br>
</br>
The CIB people not only ruined his mood but also ruined his business.</br>
</br>
Originally intending to discuss cooperation with Jiang Chen, he swallowed everything back down.</br>
</br>
After such an unpleasant event, who would still have the mood to discuss business?</br>
</br>
However, Giannini did not mind too much. After all, Jiang Chen was staying in Los Santos for a while. He still had many opportunities.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 872: Late Night Cha</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In addition to the gentleman named Giannini with a difficult last name, Jiang Chen also met many other interesting people at the party.</br>
</br>
There were entrepreneurs who spared no effort to sell their companies, entrepreneurs who desperately tried to pitch their business ideas, and Hollywood actresses who were simply selling themselves.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, It's an honor to meet you. This is my business card. I don't know if you are interested in financial products. You know, the richer you're, the more you'll not let your wealth shrink. I happen to be in this business."</br>
</br>
[Haha, I already have my own bank. Do I really need to buy "financial products" from you?]</br>
</br>
"...I'm the chairman of Kandal Material. This is my business card. I don't know if your company is interested in nanoceramics? We have made amazing technological breakthroughs in the related fields of nanoceramics, but only slightly lacking in funding. If you are interested, I'm willing to sell 50% of the shares."</br>
</br>
Of course, he was interested, but these types of companies not only existed in Cali, but many were also already listed on NASDAQ. Other than hyping up the concept to fool investors' money, Jiang Chen really didn't believe these "technology companies" could create something amazing.</br>
</br>
"My name is Angelina Jolie. May I have the honor of having a drink with you?"</br>
</br>
The dress with an exposed cleavage worn by the Hollywood sexy goddess perfectly showed her graceful body, especially with the almost obvious seduction in her gesture ... if it were not for the fact Jiang Chen wasn't interested in older women, he probably wouldn't be able to control himself.</br>
</br>
Worth mentioning, for the name Angelina Jolie, Jiang Chen's only impression was the female tiger in Kungfu Panda. But he heard that Jolie was famous in Hollywood's social circle. There must be countless "silent men who support her", a successful woman (1). Jiang Chen had a drink with her before he went and socialized with other people.</br>
</br>
The party soon came to an end and the guests began to leave. As they left, they all said their goodbyes to the host, Mr. Brown.</br>
</br>
After bidding farewell with Brown, Jiang Chen stepped out of the governor's residence. At this time, he noticed that the chick who tried to flirt with him was holding another old man's hand and went inside a classical black car. Seeing this scene, he shook his head while laughing.</br>
</br>
Hollywood is a paradise for rich people. No truer words have been said.</br>
</br>
"Which one do you fancy?"</br>
</br>
Andi Giannini smiled and walked to his side.</br>
</br>
"Haha, no one." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"What a waste. I bet that if you just point your finger, they'll send themselves over," Giannini squeezed his eyebrows and said.</br>
</br>
It was exaggerated, but it sounded nice.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and did not continue on this topic.</br>
</br>
Somewhat abruptly, Giannini changed into a serious tone.</br>
</br>
</br>
"The Russian issue is quite sensitive in UA politics. If you plan to use the power of the WASP Consortium to defeat the Freemasonry, it is best to pay attention and control the distance between Russia. Wall Street rarely comes together unless the country faces a common crisis."</br>
</br>
Giannini's words were a reminder without any malicious intention.</br>
</br>
However, even without his reminders, Jiang Chen could feel the swing in attitude of the WASP Consortium.</br>
</br>
In European affairs, it completely stayed out of the mess. In the UA, it has no intention of cooperating with Future Group in suppressing the Freemasonry. It only took a defensive posture and protected Future Group's assets from the Freemasonry controlled political power.</br>
</br>
It seemed to also be the case during World War II.</br>
</br>
Even though the conflict between Morgan-led WASP and the Jewish Consortium comprised of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers reached an irreconcilable degree, the Jews used the concentration camps story to win the sympathy of the mainstream media and dismembered Rockefeller's push for Roosevelt to the president's position. The WASP Consortium, which had allegedly provided funds for Hitler, also halted the move that went against the historical trend.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for your advice, I will consider it carefully," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
As for the result of consideration, it would depend on the circumstances.</br>
</br>
After bidding farewell with Giannini, Jiang Chen went straight to Lawrence, who was waiting at the door.</br>
</br>
"Give me some time."</br>
</br>
Afterward, Jiang Chen gestured to Zhu Yu and took her to a slightly distant position.</br>
</br>
"Is the car ready?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, of course, didn't ask about the car to return to the embassy. After all, the FBA was responsible for that. This trip to the UA was not just about going to the Silicon Valley Summit, but also "visiting" the mysterious Area 51.</br>
</br>
Since it was Hawking's proposal, there must be something interesting to be found there.</br>
</br>
"It is ready, just in the garage two streets opposite the embassy. The coordinates have been sent to your map."</br>
</br>
Compared to Ayesha, the girl almost had the word vigilant written on her face. Although Jiang Chen wanted to tell her to relax and not be so nervous, thinking about it, maybe it was her habit, so he did not make any remarks.</br>
</br>
"Thank you." Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"The CIB's people seem to be monitoring you... Should we go instead?" Zhu Yu asked hesitantly.</br>
</br>
"This is indeed a problem, but it is not enough to adjust our plans."</br>
</br>
After exchanging some more words with his subordinate, Jiang Chen walked to the FBA car.</br>
</br>
Although fame has many benefits, the fun is also much less. With his identity now, it would be nearly impossible to visit the west coast night scene. However, with the thought in his mind, Jiang Chen asked Lawrence to take a longer detour, passing through several bustling streets on the coast, and hurriedly enjoying the beautiful night view of Los Santos.</br>
</br>
After returning to the embassy, Jiang Chen took a shower and didn't go to bed right away. Instead, he began to browse the web.</br>
</br>
He planned to visit Nevada next door in a few days. Because it was an arrangement outside the itinerary and must remain a secret, flying, therefore, was not an option. This meant that he must drive five or six hours through the desert.</br>
</br>
If he didn't study the map beforehand, he would definitely run into trouble.</br>
</br>
After doing some preparation work, Jiang Chen learned about the route and let out a yawn. It was getting late. As he was preparing to turn off the lights, he heard knocking on his door.</br>
</br>
Turning off the holographic map, Jiang Chen called out, "Please come in."</br>
</br>
The door opened, watching Xia Shiyu coming in, Jiang Chen sat up from the bed.</br>
</br>
"So late, what's the matter?"</br>
</br>
"There are a few things." Xia Shiyu shook a few documents in her hand. "I have the company information provided by the summit host. There are several companies with good investment potential. I think we can consider owning a controlling stake or direct buy them. Also, about tomorrow's itinerary... Are you going to sleep?"</br>
</br>
(1) There is an idiom in China that goes by "For every successful man, there is a woman who quietly supports him".</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Not yet, I just showered. Feel free to sit anywhere," Jiang Chen replied with a smile.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu nodded and didn't think much. She sat down next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
She was in a simple dress shirt. Her aura carried a faint jasmine fragrance. Jiang Chen's heartbeat accelerated out of courtesy as he stared at her red cheeks hidden behind her luscious hair, but he quickly focused back on the task at hand.</br>
</br>
There was obviously something necessary to discuss if she came for a visit this late. If he had other thoughts, it would be too impolite.</br>
</br>
Perhaps she smelled the alcohol from Jiang Chen's breath. Xia Shiyu sniffed and frowned a little. When she opened the document, she nonchalantly asked, "Did you drink?"</br>
</br>
"Is the smell that strong?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen blew into his hand.</br>
</br>
There was some smell, but it was not as strong as he thought.</br>
</br>
Many people toasted him at the party. Although they didn't drink spirits such as brandy or whiskey, champagne could also be intoxicating.</br>
</br>
"Not a big deal, it just that there is an important meeting tomorrow. I suggest that it is better to drink less before going to bed," said Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"I can't spit it out can I." Jiang Chen made a helpless expression and took the documents from her hands. He saw the places marked with red. "What are these?"</br>
</br>
"A list. It contains technology companies with potential in Silicon Valley, and they all have a scale of less than 10 million US Dollar. Taking into account the company's strategic needs in the future, if we want to further develop the North American market, we must consider working with local companies."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen glanced through the list.</br>
</br>
The list only contained the main business areas of each company, but also indicated the ownership structure, operating conditions, assets... Xia Shiyu had even given a clear valuation for every company's purchase price.</br>
</br>
She was very meticulous in this task.</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
"This is my job." It was her usual answer. Xia Shiyu used her hand to put a few fallen strands of hair behind her ear. "The scope of Summit is very broad, but there are only three focuses that we need to focus on. Smart health, new materials, and cloud technology. Of course, this is just my opinion. If you have other ideas, we should discuss in advance."</br>
</br>
"I share the same thought as you." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
In addition to the aerospace project, the strategy of Future Group was focused on developing in these three directions.</br>
</br>
New material was a no-brainer, with the focus of course on graphene-based materials. Developing diversified graphene materials to cater to different market needs was the current focus of Future Group's materials science laboratory. In addition to semiconductor-type graphene materials used in electronic devices, high-strength graphene had also been used to a certain extent in the fields of construction and ship building.</br>
</br>
</br>
The smart health market was also quite large. The current Beta-4 Medical Drone investment in Penglai made good progress. It could measure body temperature, conduct saliva analysis, detect iris and perform other convenient functions through the infrared sensors. It could also treat some minor cold and non-severe bruises. It was a great tool that benefited society in a country that required booking a doctor's appointment in advance!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was even considering whether to install medical modules on home robots. After all, the size of a robot could carry more medical equipment, and for a middle-class family, it would not be difficult to afford a private doctor at 20,000 US Dollar.</br>
</br>
As for cloud technology, it was mainly related to quantum computers of Future Group. Since the acquisition of the manufacturing technology of the commercial quantum computers, the Sixth Street factory produced a number of quantum computers and was brought to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
Now the number of quantum computers held by Future Group had far exceeded its own needs. Quantum satellites could be used to sell cloud-based technology to other companies that have a superior cost-effectiveness far beyond supercomputer centers.</br>
</br>
According to Xia Shiyu's proposal, Future Group could acquire several medium-sized companies on the West Coast. Its business scope could include smart health, graphene, and information service-related companies. They could use UA's hands to do business with UA citizens and reduce the federal government's vigilance.</br>
</br>
After all, no country would want to see its domestic market share divided by foreigners.</br>
</br>
Especially healthcare and information security, two issues often hyped up at presidential elections shows that the federal government places great emphasize on these.</br>
</br>
The greater the importance of these issues, the more cautious against outsiders. So, Future Group must look for partners that are smart enough at this high-profile event.</br>
</br>
The list provided by Xia Shiyu has clearly listed companies with acquisition potential, and the valuations were all between 1 million US Dollar to 20 million US Dollar. Future Group's liquidity could more than cover the acquisitions. Jiang Chen just briefly scanned the document and nodded to the proposal.</br>
</br>
The only trouble was whether the Department of Commerce would interfere.</br>
</br>
In the UA, when Hua companies had repeatedly run into a wall, it was one percent related to this annoying organization. For example, Huawei's acquisition of 3Leaf, a small technology company, was abruptly terminated by the Foreign Investment Committee on the ground that "Huawei may be associated with the military."</br>
</br>
Although Xin's threat was far less, from the start of the anti-trust investigation, the Department of Commerce was an old rival of Future Group.</br>
</br>
On the second day of Jiang Chen's trip, he was visiting Mr. Pritzker, who had traveled from the Capital to Los Santos.</br>
</br>
His own opinion dictated whether the acquisitions of Future Group in the Summit could proceed smoothly.</br>
</br>
The next day, Jiang Chen met in a hotel with Mr. Pritzker who was preparing for the Summit. This time, more than 500+ Hua companies would attend. Pritzker represented not only the Department of Commerce, but also the UA's cooperative attitude and the Capital's intent.</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Jiang Chen", although Pritzker had said the same words at the airport, he had a smile and greeted Jiang Chen. "How are you enjoying Los Santos? Do you enjoy the place?"</br>
</br>
"Very pleased, just a little restricted," Jiang Chen scoffed.</br>
</br>
"After all, for your safety, we have to be careful." After Pritzker invited Jiang Chen to take a seat, he asked his assistant to pour two cups of coffee. "I don't know what brought you here?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was direct. He took out a document from his briefcase and placed it on the table.</br>
</br>
"The organizer of the Summit provided us with a list of companies that are participating as well as the main focus of each company. We selected a number of companies with potential from this list through our own channels. You know what I mean. I intend to acquire them."</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Pritzker's eyes suddenly narrowed and gently said in a tone with a deeper layer of meaning.</br>
</br>
"Oh?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 874"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 874: Stalled Negotiation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gently pushed the document in front of Pritzker.</br>
</br>
Pritzker leaned forward and glanced through the document. When he saw the long list of names, his eyebrows twitched and he started the conversation with a nonchalant tone.</br>
</br>
"These companies... are you planning to buy them all?"</br>
</br>
"Of course not, even with the financial power of Future Group, it's impossible to buy all of the companies on this document." Jiang Chen dismissed the idea and said, "We just have the intention. But you know, we have to play by the rules of the game."</br>
</br>
"The rules of the game? That's the Foreign Investment Commission's job. The Ministry of Commence doesn't have control over this." Pritzker shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Pritzker, let's be straightforward or else it'll only be a waste of time for both of us. You have invited us to come here, surely not just to let Future Group go through a series of events and to develop closer cooperation with Silicon Valley for an hour at the opening ceremony, right?" Jiang Chen opened his hands, then gently tapped the document on the table. "My sincerity is already on the table. I hope to see your sincerity now."</br>
</br>
Although the Foreign Investment Commission involved eight administrative departments and seven Capital institutions, if there was disagreement, the president would still need to go through with arbitration. However, as long as it did not involve the national defense production capacity of the nation, reselling of military technology to specific countries, or influencing the leading technological position in national security, the final decision would be made only by the Ministry of Commerce.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who had done enough homework beforehand, was keenly aware that Pritzker was evading this topic.</br>
</br>
This also showed indirectly, the Ministry of Commerce had the intention to intervene to begin with.</br>
</br>
Pritzker did not give an answer. His finger tapped on the arm of the chair, and silence continued for a while between the two. Jiang Chen was not in a hurry. He had all morning to solve this problem.</br>
</br>
The young assistant brought coffee for both of them and Jiang Chen touched the cup to sense the temperature.</br>
</br>
At this point, Pritzker finally spoke and said softly.</br>
</br>
"The Capital is very happy to see your company cooperate with Silicon Valley companies, but for your company's actions to turn these technology companies into your companies... I am afraid that no matter who is the president, no one will think this as a positive matter."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was not surprised.</br>
</br>
It would be better to say that for the veteran Minister of Commerce to put the issue on the table and not divert the question, it was already a win.</br>
</br>
As long as they were willing to negotiate, it showed that there was still the possibility of agreement between the two parties.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and pushed his own chips onto the negotiating table.</br>
</br>
</br>
"As you know, there are more than 1,000+ UA companies and 500+ Hua companies."</br>
</br>
"Of course, the Silicon Valley Summit is targeted toward both North America and Asia." Pritzker nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then you should also know that I don't have the habit of returning empty-handed." Jiang Chen also smiled and put up three fingers. Then he said, "I'll just say it now. Future Group's future strategic focus is on graphene, smart health, and cloud technology. If there is a stalemate in the North American market, we will shift our focus to the more cooperative Asian countries."</br>
</br>
Pritzker's eyes moved slightly, although it was subtle, but with senses far beyond ordinary people, Jiang Chen caught this change.</br>
</br>
Disregarding graphene and cloud technology for now, the significance of smart health offered critical meaning for the federal government.</br>
</br>
Since the beginning of the Bama era, the Democratic Party had been actively promoting medical reforms to improve the domestic medical conditions. However, it was unfortunate that during the period, he encountered the largest fiscal deficit in the history of the UA, accounting for 12% of the GDP, and it was the highest proportion of the fiscal deficit to the total economic output since the Second World War. There was no money to push health care reform.</br>
</br>
Moreover, the reform of the medical insurance system had always been one of the deepest divides between the Democrats and Republicans. The two parties disagreed on the reasons for the sharp increase in the cost of medical care in the country and the solutions to the problem.</br>
</br>
The success of Beta-4 medical drones in Penglai caught the attention of all countries. In this Summit, a number of companies in the UA also planned to introduce the advanced medical drones.</br>
</br>
For the Capital, while Beta-4 could not be helpful to ease the highest pharmaceutical prices in the world, but it could effectively reduce the cost of medical care for the UA people. If this kind of convenient and efficient drone could be introduced in clinics, UA citizens would be able to see the doctor as easily as calling 911. They would just need to make a phone call to bring the Beta-4 drone deployed in the community clinic to their home.</br>
</br>
For companies, the cost of purchasing drones was significantly lower than paying for redundant doctors. For the federal government, the saving was equivalent to the large financial subsidy for medical treatment each year.</br>
</br>
Although it would certainly be protested by the Medical Association, it would definitely be welcomed by all "people who are troubled by the difficulty of seeing a doctor."</br>
</br>
"You can sell drones completely without problems. The UA is a free market. As long as your products are safe, we will not set too many obstacles for you like some countries," Pritzker said. "The same applies to graphene and cloud technology, but I don't understand how this relates to your acquisition plan."</br>
</br>
Of course, it was for pricing rights, sales resources of those companies and some of the technologies that were of interest.</br>
</br>
For example, Future Group wanted to sell the Beta-4 drones to major private hospitals. It would be impossible for Future Heavy Industrials to recruit and send out sales to negotiate door to door. This would not only be inefficient, but also very slow.</br>
</br>
As far as expecting companies to come to buy their own products, the efficiency would be even lower. After all, not all companies were willing to risk changing their existing business model. Even though the graphene materials were excellent in all aspects, most companies were still making silicon-based electronic devices. Even if Intel bought a patent license from Jiang Chen, it did not completely stop the research and development for the higher performance silicon-based chip.</br>
</br>
When Watt invented the steam engine, the textile factory in Great Britain didn't change its equipment overnight. Even if it was late in the industrial revolution, no one would dare to say that the popularity of steam engines reached 100%.</br>
</br>
Speculate first, if worked well on peers, and then adjust slowly. It was the safest approach.</br>
</br>
In addition, unlike the Hummingbird drones, the Beta-4 was completely developed by scientists in the modern world, and its technical content was at most ahead. If other companies developed a similar product during this period, even if the performance did not reach the same level as the Beta-4, as long as with great sales team and a low selling price, it could still take a lot of market from Future Heavy Industrials.</br>
</br>
Only by occupying the high ground of the market in the shortest time could profits be maximized!</br>
</br>
Either seek collaborators or buy directly!</br>
</br>
Future Group had the capital, and in order to grasp pricing power, Jiang Chen would certainly choose the latter.</br>
</br>
From the Beta-4 drone alone, if Future Group could acquire a pharmaceutical company and use its existing partnership with major hospitals, as well as experience in the pharmaceutical and medical equipment industries. The promotion of the Beta-4 would definitely be much easier than if Future Group formed a new subsidiary from the beginning.</br>
</br>
Graphene and cloud technology would follow the same principle.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that Jiang Chen's negotiations with the Department of Commerce reached a stalemate.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 875"/>

</div></br>
</br>
The negotiations in the morning did not make much progress. Pritzker stated that he would need to contact the Capital. Jiang Chen was not in a hurry. After all, there was still a week away from the opening of the Summit. He had plenty of time to wait for the outcome of the Capital's discussion.</br>
</br>
Graphene and cloud technology both possessed great value in the global market, but Beta-4 drones were not the same and didn't apply to all markets. It could even be said that from the East Coast to the West Coast, the market was barely existent.</br>
</br>
Taking Hua as an example, leaving behind a number of widely criticized but inconveniently mentioned problems, the procedure for visiting a doctor was inherently much simpler than that of Western countries, and doctors were not as "noble" compared to the capitalist world and the hospital operating costs wererelatively low. Although its level of medical care in the world ranking may be unsatisfactory, its cost-effectiveness was undoubtedly at the forefront, which was also recognized by the world. It was also the reason why many people who get sick abroad still choose to seek a doctor domestically.</br>
</br>
In this environment, the market space for Beta-4 drones was naturally narrow.</br>
</br>
In the same way, logistics drones would be less useful in the North America market. A perfect example of a product unfitted to compete in the market due to different habits.</br>
</br>
After leaving the Pritzker's hotel, Jiang Chen got into Lawrence's car. To have a FBA official be his driver was not a treatment everyone could enjoy.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going next?"</br>
</br>
"Los Santos City Hall. It's still early. I'll have to visit the Los Santos Mayor and then have lunch with him. In the afternoon ... I have to go to Hollywood. I don't have the opportunity to come here often so I'm going to meet my old friend." Jiang Chen looked at the schedule of Xia Shiyu planned for him and said to Lawrence, who was driving.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by modern skyscrapers, the City Hall with a dome resembled the Mausoleum, looking retro and small. However, this magnificent tower was still the most well-known landmark in Los Santos. This municipal building often appeared in Hollywood blockbusters, such as the Daily Planet newspaper, where Superman works.</br>
</br>
They soon arrived at City Hall. In the square in front of the City Hall, Los Santos Mayor, Eric Gashiti, personally met with Jiang Chen and invited him to his office.</br>
</br>
It was very easy to communicate with the mayor, much easier than the officials from the federal government. The most important reason for this was that Mr. Gashiti was more focused on immediate interests than the interests of the entire federal government.</br>
</br>
Local government and the federal government were two independent systems. This provided Jiang Chen with a lot of conveniences. Just an empty promise for a multi-billion investment, he received preferential tax-reduction and tax-free policies from the city of Los Santos.</br>
</br>
</br>
Now Los Santos was desperate for investment from foreign capital. The soaring crude oil prices continued to weaken the dollar, and the refugee problem made the economy even worse. Although Los Santos was the economic center on the west coast, it still had difficulty shaking off the looming economic crisis.</br>
</br>
Of course, Eric's policy benefit to Jiang Chen was also empty promises.</br>
</br>
Only when Future Group invests in Los Santos, will these policies actually be honored.</br>
</br>
However, these were minor issues. Before Jiang Chen arrived, he was quite optimistic about the manufacturing industry in Cali. According to the forecast set out by Future Group's economic analysts, if oil prices continued to rise, the dollar would continue to weaken, and a new round of economic crisis was already foreseeable.</br>
</br>
By then, if Future Group could rely on its high self-sufficiency trust model to gain a firm foothold in the economic crisis, it could completely free up its hands to acquire overseas assets. The West Coast would be the starting point for Future Group to enter the North American market. Investment in Los Santos wouldn't be a bad choice by then.</br>
</br>
After discussing all the items on his agenda, Eric Gashiti enthusiastically invited Jiang Chen to have lunch at the City Hall. Jiang Chen, who already had this idea, was naturally pleased with the proposal. The food in the City Hall was fantastic. Except for the creamy dessert, which was not Jiang Chen's favorite, the roasted black pepper steak and the creamy corn soup were especially addictive.</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen bid farewell with Eric Gashiti and left the City Hall building.</br>
</br>
When he got into Lawrence's car, the agent supervisor was leaning against the car door with a coke and a beef burger. After seeing Jiang Chen get into the car, he quickly finished the food in his hands, crumbled the oily wrapper and stuffed it into a plastic bag before throwing it into the trash can next to him, then he got into the driver's seat.</br>
</br>
"You only ate a hamburger?"</br>
</br>
"In fact, it tasted pretty good." Lawrence grinned and started the car. "We are going to Hollywood?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen opened the holographic screen of his watch and slid his finger across the translucent map in front of him before reaching a place marked with a red dot. "The exact location is here."</br>
</br>
Lawrence saw that the map in front of him clearly and was shocked for a second, then he said enviously, "It's a really convenient tool."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Hollywood was located on the outskirts of Los Santos. It was surrounded by mountains, a mild climate, and pleasant scenery. It was not only the center of the global music film industry but it was also a true "wealthy area" in Los Santos. Many wealthy people would choose to purchase mansions there. If a person's name could be printed as the "producer" of a film with major investments, that person would be the focus of attention at any party.</br>
</br>
For example, a guy who made his fortune with firearms and gold.</br>
</br>
"Welcome! Haha, my old friend, you finally came to see me!"</br>
</br>
Seeing that grin, Jiang Chen, with a big smile on his face, hugged him. Although he didn't spend too long with this guy, the experience they shared in Iraq developed a strong friendship between the two.</br>
</br>
Or else when he was in South Africa, he would not have taken such a big risk as to give the last batch of arms to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Whether he was doing it for the money or not, he did indeed do Jiang Chen a favor.</br>
</br>
"I just got off the plane yesterday. You have to let me get over my jet lag."</br>
</br>
"Mr. Agent Supervisor, I haven't seen you for a long time." Robert noticed Lawrence behind Jiang Chen and also said hello.</br>
</br>
Lawrence with an indifferent expression lit up a cigarette and blew out an impatient smoke ring. He said impolitely.</br>
</br>
"I feel inexplicably upset when I see you jumping around on this."</br>
</br>
Robert said with a grin, "Hey, man, don't be like that. You have to give me credit for you being in this position now."</br>
</br>
Lawrence scoffed but did not speak. He clearly agreed with this point.</br>
</br>
Although Robert was once on the FBA's blacklist, it was already two years ago. It is impossible for the FBA to monitor a person for a lifetime. As long as he proved that he completely withdrew from the arms business, the FBA would naturally stop monitoring him.</br>
</br>
Just out of habit, Lawrence subjectively witnessed this guy who crossed the red line of the Capital and ended up living a comfortable life. He was not too thrilled with the result.</br>
</br>
"Come in for a drink?"</br>
</br>
"I can't, I can't drink during work." Lawrence looked up at Robert's mansion and declined Robert's invitation.</br>
</br>
"That's really regrettable, you're missing the party," said Robert. Then he turned back and patted Jiang Chen's shoulder. "Come on, man, let's go in and have a few drinks. I said multiple times to take you to enjoy Hollywood. I happen to have a few acquaintances to introduce to you here. They are all very interested in you and I think you will also be very interested!"</br>
</br>
"Acquaintances?" Jiang Chen asked while raising an eyebrow.</br>
</br>
"Yes, they are famous directors and stars." Robert winked.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 876: Rumors</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It seemed that Robert was indeed doing very well in Hollywood. To own a mansion that was over 1,200 square meters in the crowded Hollywood Hills, it would have cost him over 10 million US Dollar.</br>
</br>
A gym, a steam room, a sauna, a swimming pool, a home theater, and everything imaginable were all available. The balcony directly faced Los Santos. Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, it overlooked the beautiful skyline of Los Santos. On both sides of the mansion were green hills that looked refreshing.</br>
</br>
"The living room is the highlight of the entire building. The fireplace is built out of limestone. The modernist style with milky white furniture combines the sense of line and artistic feel. This makes home life comfortable while at the same time reflect the concept of high quality and low luxury of different eras. The floor-to-ceiling large glass windows coincide with the wooden beams, rendering a strong Spanish-style romanticism in contemporary home décor," when Jiang Chen walked into the mansion, Robert blabbed on and on.</br>
</br>
"Did you memorize the entire description on the pamphlet?" Jiang Chen mocked.</br>
</br>
"Absolutely not," Robert waved his hand quickly, but then said, "I only memorized a few paragraphs."</br>
</br>
At this time, after entering the living room, Jiang Chen heard a bout of laughter from the balcony not far away.</br>
</br>
"Hey, Robert, are you done? If you don't come now, we'll finish this bottle of champagne you have kept for ten years..."</br>
</br>
"Oh! Sh*t! Don't do that, that's my life!" Robert shouted exaggeratedly, kicking his leather shoes aside and walking into the house.</br>
</br>
On the balcony, men and women were laughing and chatting. Jiang Chen followed Robert into the living room. A man passed through the door on the balcony and came in their direction.</br>
</br>
"Haha, Robert, where is the big deal you are talking about? If you're just showing off your relationship with the FBA 'old friends'... Oh God, you, are you Jiang Chen?" The man who was grinning suddenly stopped, his eyes almost popped out as he stared at the man beside Robert.</br>
</br>
"Yes, nice to meet you." Jiang Chen extended his right hand with a smile.</br>
</br>
Although he felt he had seen this guy somewhere, he couldn't recall the name. Unless it was a particularly liked director or actor or if they had impressive features, he generally didn't pay attention to what the person's name was.</br>
</br>
"I'll introduce you. This is Bryan Singer. If you've seen the X-Men, you must be familiar with him."</br>
</br>
Hearing the name Bryan Singer, Jiang Chen suddenly put his face to a name.</br>
</br>
Speaking of Bryan Singer, most people associated him with the term X-Men. From the success of the "The Usual Suspects" in 1995, Bryan Singer officially entered the Hollywood circle from his personal production. By the year 2000, the "X-Men" adapted by him received unexpectedly great success. Then on, his directing career was tied to the X-Men franchise.</br>
</br>
</br>
It was not that he didn't try to make a transition, but he seemed to be cursed. Whether it was "Superman Returns" or "Jack the Giant Slayer", the fiasco of the box office caused Warner Bros. to weep and cry and cast a shadow over his directing career.</br>
</br>
Hollywood was a real place. Whether the future of a director was bright or not was directly linked to the box office.</br>
</br>
But Jiang Chen remembered this guy's name, not because of the X-men, but because he heard through the grapevine that this gay was bisexual.</br>
</br>
It was indeed a memorable feature.</br>
</br>
"Nice to meet you. Mr. Jiang Chen. I always thought that Robert was bullsh*tting. I didn't think it was true!" Holding Jiang Chen's hand, Bryan looked excited.</br>
</br>
"It's also nice to meet you, Mr. Singer. The X-Men is also very famous in my country. Oh, I have seen Apocalypse." Jiang Chen smiled and quietly withdrew his hand.</br>
</br>
Shaking hands with someone who may be interested in him, the feeling gave him goosebumps.</br>
</br>
Although it was only a rumor...</br>
</br>
After all, it was a party hosted by the old pervert Robert. In addition to those friends he made in Hollywood, there were also many blondes and some were even Hollywood movie stars.</br>
</br>
As Robert put it, he was considered successful in Hollywood, and several films that performed well in the box office made him a successful producer. In addition to Bryan Singer, Jiang Chen also saw Alicia Vikander. She was Laura Croft in the "Tomb Raider" released this year and the star of this party.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen knew clearly, even for the experienced pickup artist Robert, this kind woman could be quite difficult. Just relying on the identity of the producer may not be enough to open her legs, and judging by how comfortable she was at the party, it didn't look like she and Robert had a relationship beyond friendship.</br>
</br>
However, when she saw Jiang Chen, she, like the rest of the people at the party, showed a considerable degree of surprise... and interest.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, after the party, can I invite you to my house for a cup of coffee?" Alicia gently bit her bright red lips, and when no one was around and offered with a voice full of temptation.</br>
</br>
This proposal was quite attractive. Everyone knew what coffee equaled to in this situation.</br>
</br>
If only...</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry, Ms. Lau... Ms. Alicia. This proposal is indeed very tempting, but my temporary security adviser probably won't allow this." Jiang Chen regretfully declined her invitation.</br>
</br>
The rejected Alicia Vikander smiled and was not discouraged. After chatting with Jiang Chen for a few moments, she went into other circles. Jiang Chen, who was working closely with Warner Bros., would undoubtedly help her career, and Virtual Image Animation did display ambition to enter Hollywood. However, it was a pity that Jiang Chen did not seem to show enough interest in her. She was keenly aware of the situation and stopped persisting on the idea.</br>
</br>
Not just big names such as Alicia Vikander, there were a lot of beautiful women who cast a look of passion to him at the party. Emma Watson's endorsement fee was enviable. But being able to receive the supporting actress role in the epoch-making "Time Curtain" made people especially jealous.</br>
</br>
No one here was worse than her, and no one was willing to admit defeat.</br>
</br>
The party continued until eight o'clock in the evening. Unlike most of Hollywood's private parties, this party that started in the afternoon already reached its end. The sea breeze blowing from the west coast brought a little coolness and blew away the heat in the guests' hearts. The guests shook hands with Robert one after another as they bid farewell and left with joy and laughter.</br>
</br>
Everyone but Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"How does it feel? This city."</br>
</br>
"So-so."</br>
</br>
Robert laughed and opened his collection with a bottle opener. A 1965 red wine. It was a brand Jiang Chen had never seen before, but just from the color, it didn't look ordinary at all.</br>
</br>
"A very harsh remark."</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, Robert poured a cup of his collection for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
After the party, the mansion seemed empty. The wine bottles lying on the ground, poker chips, and the tin foils used for drugs all demonstrated the bustling of an hour ago.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his glass and took a sip of the sour liquid.</br>
</br>
"Where is Nick?"</br>
</br>
"It's a pity that he couldn't come. He is shooting a movie in Australia or else he definitely wouldn't miss this party."</br>
</br>
Robert took a swig of the champagne and then let out a long breath of relief. He stared at the skyline of Los Santos in the distance and said to himself, "I spent the first half of my life through the land of the dead and now I'm spending the second half of my life intoxicated in dreams... This feeling is fascinating."</br>
</br>
"Consider making a biography of yourself?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"That is a great idea!" Robert rainsed his cup to Jiang Chen from the distance, grinned and continued to stare into the skyline of Los Santos. "I have a feeling that if I took out my autobiography and made it into a script, it would be like 'Lord of War' where the box office and word of mouth would all take off and I would win both fame and wealth."</br>
</br>
"It's also possible that you will fall flat." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Don't be like this, man." Robert glanced at Jiang Chen and continued to drink.</br>
</br>
Of course, to make an autobiography into a movie was just something he thought about. It was certainly impossible to produce. It was impossible to write an autobiography after having sold arms for the Capital. Even if he wanted to produce it, the FBA certainly won't cooperate in smearing themselves.</br>
</br>
Smearing the federal government was the definition of political correctness in Hollywood blockbuster, but some of the bottom lines cannot be crossed. Lawrence, for example, once planned to use IS to solve the problem and link UA and terrorism, this would clearly not be suitable for the big screen. Even though it was the tradition to smear politicians, even the audience wouldn't buy it if it went over the line.</br>
</br>
Think of Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11," although he heavily mocked Bush to win the Palme d'Or, did he make a famous movie after that? There was a precedent for this case.</br>
</br>
"Right, 'Time Curtain'. The movie you have been working with Warner Bros. should be in theatres soon. What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"Come on, only Virtual Image Animation under Future Technology is participating in the production. I can't pay attention to a side project like this to know everything clearly." Jiang Chen helplessly shrugged.</br>
</br>
When Robert heard this, he gave a middle finger.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, in your Chinese words, this is called ZhuangBi (Showing off)?"</br>
</br>
"Your Chinese pronunciation is becoming more and more standard." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Yes, is Miss Watson in that movie? She is acting as..." Robert frowned while trying to recollect his thoughts.</br>
</br>
"Vice-captain. Wait, don't think about my actresses," said Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! Am I that kind of person?" Robert glared at Jiang Chen. He had automatically designated Emma as a kind of woman with an unusual relationship with Jiang Chen. He leaned against the balcony railing. "It's just, I recently heard some bad rumors... After all, you have invested 100 million in this movie. I can't just watch my brother get conned."</br>
</br>
"What rumors?" Jiang Chen furrowed.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Some people are investigating Miss Watson," Robert paused for a moment, then continued, "You know, I've had some ambiguous contact with the underground forces in Los Santos, though they have come clean now. Someone hired private investigators to investigate Emma's past. But her image of a woman rights' activist is kept very well. Until now, those private investigators have not dug out anything useful."</br>
</br>
"Isn't this good?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Not at all," Robert shook his head. "Especially for those who want to find something."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned and had an idea of what he meant.</br>
</br>
Asking a private investigator to investigate a person had obviously crossed the bottom line of Hollywood's "fair competition." It was different from hiring paparazzi and reporters to track and smear. Even when the top eight publishers were at the height of competition, they never used private investigators to investigate competitors' actors.</br>
</br>
Since the other side could easily cross the bottom line, naturally the means didn't matter anymore.</br>
</br>
Emma Watson was the star of Future Biology and was printed on every bottle of nutrient supply sold. She was also an actor in the Virtual Image Animation and Warner Bros. co-produced "Time Curtain". Although standing from the perspective of the president, this kind of trivial matter did not require his personal attention. However, since it was related to his immediate interests and he just heard about it, he should do something.</br>
</br>
"Who might be behind this?" Jiang Chen asked, with thoughts already forming in his mind.</br>
</br>
"I don't know." Robert shook his head. "I paid attention to it, but the force is not small either. I'm not the arrogant dealer anymore. Los Santos' gangs have no reason to do me a favor. Also, protecting the privacy of their hirer is the rule of their business."</br>
</br>
"Could it be Warner Bros.'s competitors?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Not likely." Robert shook his head.</br>
</br>
Even if it was Warner Bros.'s competitors, choosing Emma Watson as the subject of controversy would be a foolish decision. Not to mention the vice captain's role was not especially important in the film. In North America, she was barely a second-tier movie star. The idea to pull Future Group's subsidary Future Biology into the mess was not the brighest choice to begin with.</br>
</br>
A closer look into the films screening at the same period, the publishers competing with "Time Curtain," the masters behind the scenes would be unable to hide themselves.</br>
</br>
No evidence was needed in Hollywood. They only needed to know who their enemies were. And there were also plenty of ways to solve problems.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen then asked. "Who would it be?"</br>
</br>
"Perhaps she offended someone? Or maybe she caught the attention of somebody? Anyway, someone wants to ruin her reputation. It's that simple," Robert shrugged and said with indifference.</br>
</br>
After deliberating for a moment, Jiang Chen merely kept this in the back of his head. After he could not think of a reason, he didn't delve on this issue.</br>
</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, Jiang Chen focused back on the second reason for visiting Robert today.</br>
</br>
"Let's not talk about this. Do you have plans to work together again?"</br>
</br>
When Robert heard this, he glared at him cautiously.</br>
</br>
"Dude, you know, I came clean. If you want the arms, I can introduce you to people... But you don't need me to introduce them. The consortium led by the Giannini family is the biggest arms dealer in Los Santos. Even if you want to buy a few F-18 Hornets, he can give you some ideas—"</br>
</br>
"Shut up, I'm not talking about arms." Jiang Chen interrupted Robert's words and coughed. Then he said, "I'm going to register a film company in Los Santos and I'm missing a CEO."</br>
</br>
When Robert heard it was not arms, he immediately became interested, but he didn't agree right away. Instead, he asked a question that he was more concerned about. "Are you planning on starting your own movie company? Isn't your Virtual Image Animation working with Warner Bros.?"</br>
</br>
"They are holding their shares too tight and they are financially opaque." Jiang Chen shook his head. "While our cooperation with Warner Bros. is very enjoyable, there are still some small differences in the books. In addition, although virtual reality production is the main business focus of Virtual Image Animation, I don't intend to make it into another 'Industrial Light &amp; Magic' for major film makers, but just for me to have a place in Hollywood."</br>
</br>
"Do you plan to get into distribution?" Robert looked at Jiang Chen weirdly, placed an empty glass on the table beside him, and poured himself another glass. "That's not possible. The distribution rights of the film are basically controlled by the eight major film studios. I don't imagine that you can just make a movie and put it on the big screens. The distribution of film is no easier than the production of film. Many movie producers in Hollywood have to tolerate the eight studios leaching off of them otherwise, the things they produced themselves simply can't reach the theaters!"</br>
</br>
"In this era where the channel is king, even the best scented wine is afraid the alley that is too deep (1). The major cinemas won't scramble to run and beg Future Group to allow them to release its film just because it is influential in the technology sector."</br>
</br>
Robert took a sip of the wine and paused for a moment. Afterwards, he said, "As for the accounting issues... Hollywood scamming foreign investors is not news anymore. They even dares to deceive Wall Street's capitalists, let alone investors from overseas. If you invested 100 million and North American box office reaches 200 million, they could give you an income statement with minor losses, and that means they went easy on you."</br>
</br>
Here, Robert emphasized the sentence.</br>
</br>
"Even if you are working together."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged, "So I'm coming to you. Someone who even dares to deceive the Capital has no reason to not deceive the eight major studios."</br>
</br>
"Hey, man, who do you think I am?" Robert was displeased</br>
</br>
"The old fox, or something else." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Robert slyly gave him the middle finger and put the glass back on the table.</br>
</br>
He didn't pour himself another glass.</br>
</br>
Over the years, he had developed a habit. He could drink freely at a party, but he must stay conscious when he discussed business, and it was best to not touch a droplet of alcohol.</br>
</br>
"Come with me, I think we should plan this carefully." Robert turned around and walked to the living room.</br>
</br>
"Isn't film release being monopolized by the eight major studios?" Jiang Chen ridiculed while whistling.</br>
</br>
"Indeed, that's why I said we should plan things carefully. For example, how can we cut a piece of meat off of these bloodsuckers," Robert said in excitement.</br>
</br>
"So, you are ready to take on the CEO position?"</br>
</br>
Robert turned back and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Why not? Working with you always brings me good luck."</br>
</br>
(1) The best scented wine is even afraid of the alley that is too deep – Even the best product is afraid of not getting the exposure it needs to sell.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After exchanging opinions with Robert, Jiang Chen finalized the plan for Future Group to enter the film industry.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen would personally invest one billion US Dollar to establish Morning Light Film. Morning Light Film would be responsible for the production and distribution of films, and would be structured independently from Future Group. This move was mainly to avoid the Paramount Decision (1). Future Group may intervene in the screening of the film in the future. However, there was not much difference. Both Future Group and Morning Light Film were controlled by him. Although the shareholding structure remained independent of each other, there wouldn't be any difference in actuality.</br>
</br>
After all, it was not his Xin.</br>
</br>
With 10% equity and one million US Dollar in base salary, Robert was hired as the CEO of the company. After spending over a decade in Los Santos, he came clean about being an arms dealer and became a producer for three years in Hollywood. Robert was more than sufficient to take on the role of CEO with his connections in this city.</br>
</br>
Of course, everything now remained in the drafting phase.</br>
</br>
At least for now, the cooperation between Future Technology and Warner Bros. remained in a honeymoon period, and everything had to wait until after the release of "Time Curtain".</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen came out of the mansion, it was already eight in the evening. Lawrence was still leaning against the side of the car, but this time, he was not chewing on a hamburger but smoking out of boredom.</br>
</br>
After seeing Jiang Chen, Lawrence extinguished the cigarette.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going next?"</br>
</br>
"Where else can I go at this time?" Jiang Chen yawned and sat in the car.</br>
</br>
"I thought after attending this kind of party, you'd definitely have a date." Lawrence shrugged.</br>
</br>
Two hours ago, he saw a group of Hollywood stars exit Robert's mansion, some of whom were pretty blondes. According to the FBA's archive for him, this guy definitely wasn't the type that constrained himself.</br>
</br>
"I'm reducing the workload for you." Jiang Chen told the unruly agent in charge. After putting on his seatbelt, he said, "I have no plans for the next two days, and you can consider giving yourself two days off."</br>
</br>
"No arrangements?" Lawrence raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
According to the security agreement of both parties, Jiang Chen was obliged to provide the FBA with his schedule for the next day so that they could be prepared. However, Jiang Chen had no plans, which made him feel puzzled.</br>
</br>
"Yes, I will be staying in the Xin Embassy for the next two or three days to discuss the upcoming Silicon Valley Summit with my CEO. At the same time, there are some things from Xin that I need to deal with." Jiang Chen brought out the set of rhetoric that he prepared long ago.</br>
</br>
Lawrence glanced at Jiang Chen suspiciously, but he did not say anything about it.</br>
</br>
As an outsider, he couldn't make irresponsible comments about the internal arrangements of Future Group. And he would never think that Jiang Chen would sneak out and "visit" Area 51 in Lincoln County in southern Nevada.</br>
</br>
</br>
At the same time, a fierce debate was taking place here at the CIB headquarters. Steven, who had just returned from Los Santos, had found his top boss, CIB Director Naomi Madden, and was trying to persuade his boss to initiate an investigation procedure on Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"There is no conclusive statement on whether it was a graphite bomb or an EMP." Turning the pen in his hand, Naomi leaned back in his chair and listened to his reports.</br>
</br>
However, at work, his top man did not buy it. Steven magnified his volume and contended. "Conclusive? What evidence do we still need? If the testimony of 110 Ukrainian government soldiers cannot be used as evidence, then what else can be used as evidence? I'm sure it's an EMP!"</br>
</br>
Identifying the difference between a graphite bomb and an EMP was very difficult. Both could destroy the grid and damage electronic equipment. However, the former's accuracy was poor, and it was ineffective for devices with strong leak-protection. Because the site of the incident was at the most chaotic frontline, even a CIB agent couldn't penetrate behind the enemy line and collect so-called evidence like investigators.</br>
</br>
Naomi's face held a dignified look but he still didn't make a decision.</br>
</br>
The Ukrainian issue was indeed very important, or else the project team led by Steven would not directly report to him. In the Ukrainian government's military report, Russia used a weapon that could paralyze electronic equipment and immediately attracted the attention of the CIB. After the airborne operations in City M, no country could ignore the killer of modern civilization, the EMP. Although all countries were protesting against this kind of weapon, everyone knew that everyone was also studying this weapon in the dark.</br>
</br>
The Capital suspected that Future Group provided assistance to Russians, but the KGB had done a very good job in intelligence work, and the CIB couldn't collect relevant evidence for the time being. The CIB didn't even know the degree of cooperation between the two parties. If it was a simple arms sale, everything would be fine. But if the technology was sold, it would be bad.</br>
</br>
However, the people involved also made it difficult for Naomi.</br>
</br>
The Capital was releasing a friendly signal to Xin, and his top man proposed to investigate Jiang Chen... Regardless of whether Jiang Chen was related to the weapons on the Russian-Ukrainian border, it was impossible for the CIB to investigate an important guest.</br>
</br>
"The crux of the problem now is that even if we prove that these weapons came from the military factories on Ange Island, it would be an arms sale between Russian and Future Military. They did not directly sell arms to the rebels." Naomi's pen stopped spinning. He leaned back in his chair and muttered in a frown. "This is difficult."</br>
</br>
"Just because it is difficult, are we going to let them just walk away like this?" Steven said bitterly.</br>
</br>
Naomi looked at the emotional Steven. He knew exactly why his subordinate would regard Jiang Chen as a thorn in his eyes. The CIB had planned a kidnapping operation against Jiang Chen before, but the dozens of CIB agents sent to the country were still missing.</br>
</br>
At first, they thought that it was Hua who arrested them. However, after several years, the silence of the nation began to make them suspect that it was not Hua's intelligence service that got rid of those agents</br>
</br>
Those dozens of dead agents were all Steven's comrades. He understood his feelings at the moment.</br>
</br>
But from a political standpoint, it was impossible for Naomi to approve his proposal. His predecessor resigned because he had planned the kidnapping operation without approval. As the CIB director who was pro-Capital, he made the most conservative and correct choice.</br>
</br>
"I will inform the Capital."</br>
</br>
"We can't ask the Capital for everything. Please, we are the CIB, not the FBA, not the puppets of the Capital! We should be responsible for the nation's security! We can solve it with our own methods-"</br>
</br>
"It's too risky!" Naomi immediately interrupted Steven's words.</br>
</br>
However, Steven did not give up; a bloodthirsty grin appeared on his face as he said word by word.</br>
</br>
"I heard that the Freemasonry has a grudge against them."</br>
</br>
Naomi paused. Not letting this opportunity get away, Steven continued.</br>
</br>
"This is no risk, and we'll be completely out of this. We just need to provide a little help to those who are also keen against them."</br>
</br>
Naomi frowned and seemed to understand what Steven wanted to say, but there were concerns about the feasibility of this move.</br>
</br>
"A bad move will provoke a war between the two countries."</br>
</br>
"There'll be no war! As long as it is not the UA that strikes! As long as we completely separate ourselves from all of this, we'll not get into any trouble!"</br>
</br>
After a long silence, Naomi did not openly endorse it, nor go against it. Instead, he gave an ambiguous answer.</br>
</br>
"I hope Los Santos will not become the second Bay of Pig."</br>
</br>
A faint smile finally emerged on Steven's face.</br>
</br>
He knew that this conservative and cautious director was finally convinced.</br>
</br>
"I promise."</br>
</br>
(1) The Paramount Case was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films. It also changed the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited. The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements.

</br>
At six in the evening, Steven walked out of the CIB headquarters and got on a black car. Just as he fastened his seat belt and inserted the key, a Jewish man in a trench coat opened the door and sat next to him.</br>
</br>
"All good?"</br>
</br>
"The CIB will assist you."</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on the man's face.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Mr. Steven, you can finally find your revenge."</br>
</br>
Steven scoffed and didn't respond, but the smile on his lips was still obvious.</br>
</br>
"This is a little gift from us." Then, the Jewish man gently placed a card in the item holder, as if nothing had happened, and looked straight ahead with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I didn't help you for money." Stephen frowned.</br>
</br>
"But you have no reason to refuse, right?" The man smiled. "And your efforts are definitely worth this number."</br>
</br>
Stephen was silent.</br>
</br>
The car passed through the bustling streets of the Capital and the glaring and sparking lights reflected off of the windshield of the car. This was the center of a prosperous world and the center of world power. The well-dressed crowds and the unreachable floors looked fascinating just from their appearance.</br>
</br>
Steven suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
Indeed, as the Jewish man said, he had no reason to refuse.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After returning to the Xin Embassy, Jiang Chen said goodbye to Lawrence and remained in the office with Xia Shiyu. Then, she returned to her room.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu followed her.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked to Jiang Chen's room and said nothing. With her current position, she was exposed to some of Future Group's secrets, including his trip to Nevada.</br>
</br>
Although she was worried, she would not say anything to stop it. Instead, she stressed the importance of safety to him and continued to focus on the tasks at hand.</br>
</br>
He closed the door behind him and asked Zhu Yu to be responsible for her safety at the embassy.</br>
</br>
"Do you leave now?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded. He took off his suit and shirt and tossed it on the bed. The muscles of his upper body were exposed right in front of the girl's eyes.</br>
</br>
Although the defined muscles did not have explosive visual effects, they cast a controlled and firm tension. However, with professional training, Zhu Yu's heartbeat only sped up for two seconds and she did not even flush at the scene.</br>
</br>
The bullet-proof vest was taken from Zhu Yu's hands and Jiang Chen put it on himself. This type of vest was not much thicker than a shirt as it was made of graphene material. Although its protection against the kinetic energy of bullets was limited, it could effectively intercept all bullets.</br>
</br>
Finally, he put a trench coat on over it. Jiang Chen took a Type-11 pistol from Zhu Yu and placed it in his pocket. Then he brought out a K2 kinetic skeleton with an optical illusion module from the wardrobe and skillfully wielded it on himself.</br>
</br>
"The car is parked in the underground garage on the opposite side of the embassy. Coordinates are on your watch... Do you really not need our assistance?" Zhu Yu said hesitantly.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tapped the screen on his arm and set the parameters. He smiled and said, "No need, you are too worried."</br>
</br>
"Ayesha told me that you shouldn't do anything dangerous... If you get into an accident, please contact me immediately."</br>
</br>
"I will... Right, I need you to do something for me."</br>
</br>
"What's the order?" Zhu Yu asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Emma Watson, sponsored by Future Biology. Someone is investigating her. I am very curious who it is."</br>
</br>
"That's easy," Zhu Yu said.</br>
</br>
"Then I will leave it to you."</br>
</br>
At the end of October, the sea breeze in Los Santos already had some coolness to it, but it couldn't carry away the humidity in the air. Darkness already shadowed the city, but the entire city was still immersed in the gorgeous neon, the endless streams of light that colored the nightlife. Everything had just begun.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen activated optical invisibility, did not attract anyone's attention, quietly left the embassy from the back door, and walked by an FBA car. He could see the ash that had fallen from the cigarette in between the agent's fingertips, but he couldn't see him.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes later, in the underground garage opposite of the Xin Embassy, a black SUV slowly hit the road and merged into the city of Los Santos. The FBA wouldn't know that Jiang Chen, who was supposed to stay in the Embassy, was already on route to Nevada.</br>
</br>
He hasn't driven for a long time, but when Jiang Chen held onto the steering wheel, he didn't feel any discomfort.</br>
</br>
He took off the kinetic skeleton and placed it in the backpack in the passenger seat.</br>
</br>
In order to avoid being stopped by the traffic police, even after he left Los Santos, Jiang Chen did not speed up. Now that the entire UA thought that he was in the embassy. If he were detained by traffic police within a dozen kilometers away, there would be many unnecessary troubles.</br>
</br>
If he kept his current speed and not stop midway, he should be able to reach Nevada five hours later.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen opened the hologram map and made a rough estimation. When he arrived at Area 51 in southern Nevada, it should be exactly 4 in the morning. Of course, he couldn't drive directly inside. He planned to spend a full day in a nearby town. It would be a better choice to wait until the next night.</br>
</br>
After leaving Los Santos, the traffic was unusually smooth, and the scenery on both sides also changed from high-rise buildings to endless desert. To keep himself entertained, Jiang Chen turned on the radio. Although he did not like loud music, it would at least prevent him from falling asleep.</br>
</br>
On the way, Jiang Chen saw many tourist buses. In between California and Nevada, there was a tourist attraction called the "Death Valley" of the civilized world. Most of the rumors were similar to the Bermuda Triangle, which were all created by the tourism industry.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wondered if he should visit the nearby Death Valley after visiting the mysterious Area 51, but soon he drove the idea out of his head.</br>
</br>
The end of October was not considered the peak season for tourism. However, this type of attraction would drive quite a crowd and it would be better to avoid unnecessary troubles.</br>
</br>
Just as he spent time distracting himself with the vehicles along the road, his watch suddenly vibrated. Only two hours later, Zhu Yu's called.</br>
</br>
"Hey?"</br>
</br>
"The person you told us to investigate has been found."</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu's words surprised Jiang Chen. Only two hours had passed, her efficiency was almost frightening.</br>
</br>
But thinking about it, Jiang Chen was relieved. After all, the other party was a private investigator. Although it could use illegal means such as interception and drone filming, they are definitely more amateur compared to a professional agent. As long as the target is identified, the Ghost Agent on standby in Los Santos could easily track the private investigator following Emma.</br>
</br>
With the truth-telling serum, there was no intelligence that can't be known.</br>
</br>
"Employer's name is Berkeley Lewis, the eldest son of the Lewis family."</br>
</br>
"The Lewis family? Berkeley?" Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows. He couldn't recall the name.</br>
</br>
"Should I deal with it?" Zhu Yu asked.</br>
</br>
"No." Jiang Chen shook his head. "Keep an eye on him. If he does something out of the ordinary, tell me."</br>
</br>
"Yes," Zhu Yu answered.</br>
</br>
He hung up the phone. Blasting heavy metal music, the black SUV left behind a trail of dust and gradually merged into the darkness. A sign on the side of the road said, Welcome to Nevada.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 880: Area 51</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Area 51 was an area of approximately 155 square kilometers located in Lincoln County, southern Nevada, and 130 kilometers southeast of downtown Las Vegas. It was part of the UA Air Force training facility. However, everyone knew this military base was definitely not what it was advertised to be as a training facility.</br>
</br>
Only those with a high security level who were invited by senior military officials or senior leaders of the intelligence agencies could enter the military base. Could the average pilot really be qualified to train here? There were red warning signs everywhere - "No photo," "No entry," and "Authorized to use lethal weapons."</br>
</br>
Of course, there were also signs such as "Aliens" set up by nearby residents themselves. These odd signs attracted many tourists. There was nothing that couldn't be used to market in this capitalistic country.</br>
</br>
Endless sand hills were decorated with dried grasses and countless cactuses. Occasionally, a few poplars could be spotted scattered around. From time to time, some hares dashed from one bush to another.</br>
</br>
A black SUV stopped slowly beside the sand hill.</br>
</br>
It looked no different from a brand new car a few hours ago, but the car was now covered with yellowish-gray debris. When the door opened, Jiang Chen got out of the car, took a travel bag from the seat next to him, threw it into the storage dimension, and ventured to the top of the hill.</br>
</br>
The dawn light was already leaking out in the distant sky. In a few minutes, there would be daylight.</br>
</br>
After he crossed this hill and walked a few kilometers on foot, he would be able to see the legendary Area 51. However, Jiang Chen knew very well that although this mountain was right in front of him, it wasn't an easy trip to make on foot. The straight line distance on the map was more than a dozen kilometers.</br>
</br>
And that was the straight line distance!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen carefully took out a specially made telescope and turned on thermal imaging to scan the area. Every year, there were many curious climbers with backpacks attempting to explore the mysterious Area 51.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, he only saw a few hares.</br>
</br>
After confirming that there was no one there, Jiang Chen put his hand on the SUV and tossed the vehicle directly into the storage dimension. Then he began to hike up the hill.</br>
</br>
Not far from Area 51 was the Nevada Test Site, where the Department of Energy tested nuclear weapons. Although he hadn't yet seen the signs prohibiting entry, he knew very clearly that he was now on the verge of the military zone with the highest level of readiness!</br>
</br>
The slope of the sand was very gradual. It wasn't difficult to climb up, but it certainly took some effort.</br>
</br>
It took until sunrise for Jiang Chen to finally climb to the top of the hill.</br>
</br>
Taking out his binoculars, he could already spot the military post in the valley opposite him. A few kilometers further down the road was the legendary Area 51, but Jiang Chen definitely couldn't just follow the road and stroll in.</br>
</br>
</br>
With his kinetic skeleton reequipped again, Jiang Chen didn't start the optical illusion module and just walked down the hill.</br>
</br>
This wasn't a restricted military area. It was impossible for soldiers stationed at the post to keep their eyes on their binoculars all the time. Looking from the military post right across, only the shape of the mountain could be made out. It was absolutely impossible to spot anyone with only the naked eye.</br>
</br>
As long as Jiang Chen didn't make too much movement.</br>
</br>
It took half a day's time, and at two o'clock in the afternoon, Jiang Chen followed the bottom of the hill and circled to the side of the military base. Many sensors were deployed there, hidden in the bushes. They would immediately be set off if someone accidentally bumped into them, alerting the patrols.</br>
</br>
However, finding these things wasn't a difficult task for Jiang Chen. Carefully avoiding all the sensors, he hid behind a bush and overviewed the entire Area 51.</br>
</br>
Metal fencing had isolated hundreds of square kilometers of land from the desert. Large and small houses were located within this military base. Apart from tanks and armored vehicles, aircraft were also seen on the runway. At least five F-35s were parked on the runway. In addition, he saw many cool-looking airplanes that he couldn't name.</br>
</br>
The layout of the building here was almost the same as the photos published on Google Maps, but there were still some subtle differences.</br>
</br>
For example, the radar that stood in the southeast corner of the military base attracted Jiang Chen's attention.</br>
</br>
Instead of categorizing it as a radar, it was more like a "big bowl" embedded in the ground. Four poles pointed straight up in each of the four corners and were connected diagonally by slings in the center. In the middle, a giant antenna structure was suspended in midair.</br>
</br>
According to his binocular ruler, the giant bowl was at least 200-300 meters in size. Jiang Chen thought for a long time but he couldn't figure out what the antenna was.</br>
</br>
After hesitating for a moment, he pressed down on the side of the helmet, opened the tactical camera, and filmed the giant radar.</br>
</br>
Along the way, he also took a few close-up shots of the entire military base.</br>
</br>
At that moment, a rustling noise in his ear lingered, followed by a dizzy feeling that entered his brain. It forced Jiang Chen to furrow his brows. But soon, his body relaxed and he recovered from this sudden discomfort. The noise in his ear disappeared as if it never appeared in the first place.</br>
</br>
"What happened?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head while forcing out the numbness in his head. He put away his binoculars and turned off his tactical camera.</br>
</br>
He noticed that just in that moment of hearing the sound, even the holographic screen on his tactical helmet froze for a moment.</br>
</br>
[Was it an EMP?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen denied this idea for a moment.</br>
</br>
Despite the strength of electromagnetic pulses, they were ineffective on humans, and EMP couldn't explain the momentary dizziness he felt. Compared to high-energy transient currents induced by high-energy particles, this feeling was more like a kind of super electromagnetic wave or something else.</br>
</br>
Casting his doubts aside, Jiang Chen confirmed the patrol route of the military base through his binoculars. With the help of Jean, he calculated a relatively safe sneak path on the map.</br>
</br>
The preparations for the day had already been completed. The next step was to wait until dark and execute the plan.</br>
</br>
"I wonder how the embassy's doing," Jiang Chen whispered.</br>
</br>
While he said that, he wasn't worried.</br>
</br>
If someone came to visit, Xia Shiyu could help him cancel the plan. Even in special circumstances, no one would suddenly break into the embassy of other countries.</br>
</br>
The coordinates were set. He left a camera in place that could transmit data across the dimension then he traveled to the apocalypse. The mission was scheduled for the night; he didn't want to be like a real sniper and crawl behind a bush all day long.</br>
</br>
Even at the end of October, the afternoon sun in Calif was still burning.</br>
</br>
Not to mention he was in the middle of the desert...</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 881"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 881: Defense Adjustmen</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Because of Hill's refugee policy, the West Coast, far from the political center, played a very awkward role. Tens of thousands of refugees not only didn't bring any substantial benefits to Cali, but they seriously worsened the security in the state.</br>
</br>
The only benefit was simply improving the employment rate.</br>
</br>
Yes, the employment rate did rise. Among the refugees, the hard-working ones only made up a small minority. Most people belonged to the lazy class. Even though mainstream society still sympathized with these people because of political correctness, the "victims" on the West Coast didn't buy it.</br>
</br>
Although Hill lost Cali's votes, this loss was insignificant compared to the number of supporters she gained. After all, Cali was more supportive of Donny, and her ballet warehouse was concentrated on the East Coast.</br>
</br>
Of course, merely receiving a green card didn't mean they had the right to vote. Only by obtaining citizenship could they cast their "holy" ballots for their trusted president in the general election. But it didn't matter; the Hill government was working hard to resolve this problem.</br>
</br>
Just let the refugees become citizens before the next election...</br>
</br>
The group who was the most dissatisfied with Hill's policies was undoubtedly the Jewish community.</br>
</br>
The long-standing conflicts between the two sides hadn't been entirely religious. This hatred had long been integrated into the blood of both sides. There was the war which resulted in the separation, the defeat in the BC era which led to their ousting, and they wandered for more than two thousand years. It wasn't until the French Revolution when the status of Jews in Europe improved. It wasn't until more than thirty years after World War II when they finally returned to their spiritual home.</br>
</br>
It wasn't difficult to understand the hatred between the two. Just imagine the grudge between China and Japan magnified tenfold.</br>
</br>
Not all Jews were members of Freemasonry, but both the Freemasonry and Jews were definitely staunch opponents of Hill's refugee policies.</br>
</br>
On October 25th, the terrorist attack on Venice Street in Los Santos wasn't accidental, but it was an attack planned by the nation's far right. A Hispanic youth born in Utah placed ten pounds of explosives in a trash can along with 200 steel balls wrapped in plastic bags.</br>
</br>
When the demonstration team passed by, he pressed the detonation button with his cell phone.</br>
</br>
It was easy to imagine what kind of damage this kind of bomb would cause in the crowd.</br>
</br>
"This is a disaster. Sob. We're just expressing our opinion. Those racist people will go this far to commit such heinous crimes! Despicable!" In an interview with a CBS reporter, one woman from Libya said in tears.</br>
</br>
His phone placed on the roof of the car, Lawrence leaned against the door and gnawed at his burger while coldly watching the screen.</br>
</br>
To put it bluntly, as an FBA senior official, his political position should be closely aligned to the Capital's, but he had no sympathy for these people from the bottom of his heart.</br>
</br>
</br>
At that moment, a car stopped beside him. A man in a suit and tie stepped out from the car, carrying a black briefcase in hand as he swiftly approached him.</br>
</br>
Lawrence stuffed the last bit of his burger in his mouth and swallowed it down with Coke. He turned off his cell phone and looked at his colleague as he said nicely, "Mr. William, what brings you here?"</br>
</br>
Michael William, Director, Los Santos Police Department. Although a completely separate organization, due to work needs, the director often contacted people in both the FBA and CIB systems.</br>
</br>
Like most UA citizens, Mr. William was straight to the point.</br>
</br>
"The case from a few days ago ran into some problems. We originally believed it was a lone wolf attack, but the evidence that was subsequently collected reversed our previous speculation. Lawrence, we need your help."</br>
</br>
Lawrence glanced at the embassy next to him.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, I'm working for the Capital now."</br>
</br>
"Oh, God, what else is more important than the security of the UA?!" Michael said earnestly. "This attack is different. Some people in the country are deliberately provoking opposition between refugees and UA citizens and preventing them from integrating into our society."</br>
</br>
Lawrence almost laughed when he heard that.</br>
</br>
[Opposition? Are they worth the effort of provoking? Prevent? Do you have to get on your knees and ask them to come in for us to be welcoming?]</br>
</br>
Of course, he wasn't stupid enough to bring his personal feelings into his work.</br>
</br>
After a moment of deliberation, Lawrence said, "It's better that you contact the Los Santos FBA branch. I have other tasks now—"</br>
</br>
Michael raised his hand and stopped him. He took a document from his briefcase and handed it to him.</br>
</br>
Lawrence looked at the file in his hands and raised his eyebrows.</br>
</br>
The FBA branch in Los Santos was tight on staff. It was also common practice to move people from the Capital to assist local authorities in big cases like terrorism. If it involved overseas affairs, the CIB was usually sent. If it only involved domestic affairs, help usually came from the FBA.</br>
</br>
At the same time, it was proposed to enhance the security of Jiang Chen. After all, the security of this important guest was related to the friendship between the two countries.</br>
</br>
For this, the CIB proposed a compromise.</br>
</br>
The security work of Jiang Chen would be shared by both the CIB and the FBA. Half the FBA agents replaced would be moved to the recent terrorism case. The Silicon Valley Summit planned for a week later would also be jointly planned by the Los Santos police and the CIB.</br>
</br>
There was no problem with this document; it was only a slight adjustment to Jiang Chen's security plan.</br>
</br>
However, he didn't know why, but he had a strange feeling that something was unusual.</br>
</br>
Being in this position for so long, he wasn't a kind of idiot without political sense.</br>
</br>
"I need to make a phone call to the Capital," said Lawrence.</br>
</br>
"Do it as soon as possible," Michael said with seriousness.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After returning to the apocalypse, Jiang Chen went straight to Lin Lin's laboratory and handed the memory card on the tactical helmet to her.</br>
</br>
"I want to know what this is." After pulling up the photograph taken at noon, Jiang Chen pointed at the giant radar and asked Lin Lin with confusion.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin just glanced at the picture. The electronic eye quickly flashed through a string of data streams. She was trying to match this object to something that appeared in "history." She pouted and said with a clear lack of interest, "It's just a large radio telescope."</br>
</br>
"A telescope?" Jiang Chen was somewhat surprised.</br>
</br>
[This doesn't look like a telescope at all. Isn't that a radar?]</br>
</br>
"You don't just think a telescope is called a telescope because it has a lens, right?" Lin Lin glared at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Well, that's what I thought." Jiang Chen facepalmed. He paused for a moment then asked, "What does this thing do?"</br>
</br>
"It's mainly used to detect electromagnetic waves in the universe. Don't view it as just a bowl; there are countless radar arrays inside. Any faint electromagnetic wave can be captured by this to be screened and filtered. It can be considered an early extraterrestrial civilization detector." Lin Lin commented on the picture.</br>
</br>
[Extraterrestrial Civilization Detector?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's expression was a bit odd.</br>
</br>
In this case, Area 51 was indeed related to so-called aliens. However, according to Lin Lin's disapproving attitude, this original "telescope" apparently didn't capture a record of extraterrestrial civilization... at least in this timeline.</br>

</br>
"Can I see Mr. Jiang Chen? In light of the recent security situation in Los Santos, I have some security adjustments..."</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry, he's already rested. If you have any questions, you can speak to me."</br>
</br>
Standing at the door of the embassy, Xia Shiyu declined Lawrence's request to visit. He was in the desert of Nevada, more than dozens of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
Lawrence frowned slightly and eyed the embassy.</br>
</br>
"This is very important. I hope you treat it seriously."</br>
</br>
"He gave me full power to deal with it," Xia Shiyu replied with an uncompromising tone</br>
</br>
Since this Ms. CEO already said that, Lawrence no longer persisted. He nodded, handed the files over, and left the embassy.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu scanned the documents. They detailed the recent security situation and the FBA's adjustment of Jiang Chen's travel security work.</br>
</br>
According to the description in the documents, it seemed Jiang Chen's security level increased?</br>
</br>
As night arrived, Nevada's desert returned to quietness. Jiang Chen, who was wearing a kinetic skeleton, had returned to the modern world. He was still behind a bush. Silence surrounded him, leaving only the wind blowing.</br>
</br>
Lights illuminated Area 51. High-powered searchlights scanned the military base.</br>
</br>
Today's night was no different from the day before. All soldiers remained in their positions like before. Even the most meticulous soldiers, staring at the endless desert, couldn't help but feel tired and blank out.</br>
</br>
No one noticed that an invisible ghost was approaching...</br>
</br>
There was a gust of wind, and a soldier leaning against the checkpoint sneezed and rubbed his nose. The soldier standing across from him yawned and adjusted the rifle on his body. At this point, no one would check the post. Their standing posture was casual, at least not as professional as if they were in front of cameras.</br>
</br>
However, at that moment, the soldier who sneezed looked around.</br>
</br>
"Crony, did you notice anything?"</br>
</br>
"What? A hare?" The drowsy Crony instantly woke up.</br>
</br>
"No, it could be an illusion."</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, we're about to get off our shift. Don't play with me..."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the soldiers' conversation, Jiang Chen was relieved.</br>
</br>
The weakness of the optical illusion was being in environments where the optical difference would be obvious. It was difficult to achieve perfect invisibility, and walking in the sand would leave footprints. In order to avoid being discovered, he chose the road and directly entered from the checkpoint.</br>
</br>
As for the lighting problem, he could only walk against the edge of the building.</br>
</br>
Judging by the number of patrols, this military base was indeed one of the highest security military bases in the nation. In addition to those patrols with rifles at each corner of the base and invisible snipers, Jiang Chen also noticed helicopters flying by often.</br>
</br>
He didn't dare to turn off his optical illusion for a single moment.</br>
</br>
</br>
Fortunately, decades-long peace and stability made people lower their guard at this base with the highest security level. Jiang Chen didn't encounter any trouble along the way. He successfully managed to just sneak past the patrols like a ghost.</br>
</br>
At such a large base, of course, he couldn't just wander around like a headless chicken. In the photographs taken in advance, Jiang Chen marked the buildings worthy of investigation on the map. These buildings included the large radio telescope, the fighter aircraft hangar, and several houses that he couldn't identify from the outside.</br>
</br>
At the airport, Jiang Chen quietly slipped into a hangar.</br>
</br>
Here, he saw a few prototypes that couldn't be named. The aircraft didn't have a cockpit, but it was supposed to be one of the fabled six-generation drones.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen hesitated for a moment to decide whether or not to put several bombs in it and take these planes away when he leave. However, he hesitated for a moment and gave up the plan. Making too much noise wasn't good for him. If he knocked down the hornet's nest, he feared the whole state of Nevada would be locked down.</br>
</br>
In such a large desert, he couldn't walk back under his optical illusion.</br>
</br>
He would silently come and quietly leave. Anyway, the purpose of his trip wasn't to blow up planes.</br>
</br>
After the hangar was the radar station.</br>
</br>
This two-story building was in the corner of the base, just like the "Giant Bowl" to which it was connected.</br>
</br>
Compared to the highly-guarded hangars, garages, research institutes, and other facilities, Jiang Chen clearly sensed that the patrol efforts here were lax.</br>
</br>
Hiding behind a concrete wall, Jiang Chen carefully avoided the two patrol teams crossing the main road and quickly moved to the back of the radar station and looked through the window. At this time, the radar station was completely dark. Obviously, all the work had been completed during the day. There should be no researchers inside.</br>
</br>
He estimated the height of the window then glanced at the lookout tower not far in the distance.</br>
</br>
It was a blind spot, or at least the searchlight's blind spot. No light could shine there.</br>
</br>
From the storage dimension, Jiang Chen took out an electrostatic adsorption device similar to a suction cup. Although he didn't know the principles behind this device, he could easily control the adsorption between the suction cup and the wall by simply pressing the button on the grip.</br>
</br>
He didn't know anything about particle physics, but it didn't prevent him from using it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen put it on his arm and calf then stuck his arms to the wall like a gecko. He pressed the button of the right-hand grip and deactivated the adsorption of his right arm and left leg. Jiang Chen skillfully climbed up with his right hand and moved up to the window.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, perhaps because it was too humid that day, but the window wasn't locked.</br>
</br>
After entering into the radar station, Jiang Chen carefully turned on the detection equipment and determined that there were no infrared sensors or cameras in the room. Then he carefully examined the room.</br>
</br>
The room was very dark, but the night vision function on his tactical helmet solved this problem. The dark blue light prism spread out in front of his field of vision, and everything in the room was clearly displayed on Jiang Chen's retina.</br>
</br>
It seemed to be an office. Neatly stacked documents were placed on the row of desks. Jiang Chen stepped forward and glanced through them. Although he could understand English, the more technical stuff gave him headaches.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, he could ask for help.</br>
</br>
His watch was connected to his kinetic skeleton and he assigned the camera control of the tactical helmet to the artificial intelligence hosted on his wristwatch.</br>
</br>
"Jean, what are these things in these documents?"</br>
</br>
"...astronomical observations, some drafts, and some paper reports. Do you need me to translate for you?"</br>
</br>
"No, I wouldn't understand even if you translated for me. Can you see if there's any useful information such as aliens, extraterrestrial civilization or related information?" Jiang Chen said with a headache.</br>
</br>
Pointing his camera at the documents, Jiang Chen quickly flipped through them. But unfortunately, Jean didn't collect any useful information. With or without use, these files were stored on his memory card.</br>
</br>
After leaving the office, he entered the hallway.</br>
</br>
The placard on the door was a big help. The function of each room was written in English and was easy to find. There were control rooms, conference rooms, drawing rooms and other rooms, but those weren't what Jiang Chen was looking for. He was looking for the file room. Without a doubt, all secrets would be stored there!</br>
</br>
After all, it was only a two-story building. Jiang Chen didn't search for long before he found his target at the end of the first floor.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 883: The Technology of Area 51</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With a faint clunking sound, the iron door was gently pushed open.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen stepped into the file room and looked around.</br>
</br>
In addition to a row of file racks, at the end of the file racks were two closet-sized servers. Seeing the two servers at the end, Jiang Chen was suddenly ecstatic. It would completely exhaust him if he had to flip through every single document in the room, but if they backed up the data on electronic devices, regardless how secure their server was, Jiang Chen could dig the data out eventually!</br>
</br>
He could even trace and find something else!</br>
</br>
Restraining the excitement in his head, Jiang Chen asked knowingly, "Jean, can you infiltrate these two machines?"</br>
</br>
"That's easy," Jean said calmly, still in an emotionless tone.</br>
</br>
Pulling out the adjustable data cable from the arm, Jiang Chen found the interface on the servers and inserted the data cable. Soon, the screen of the tactical helmet flashed several reading windows. Jean integrated the computing resources of both the watch and the kinetic skeleton and quickly infiltrated the firewall built by security experts.</br>
</br>
In fact, during the infiltration process, Jean simply didn't encounter any strong resistance. Even the most skilled hackers wouldn't break into computers that aren't connected to the Internet. Similarly, if the computer wasn't connected to the Internet at all, then it was naturally not necessary to frequently update the firewall.</br>
</br>
Area 51 was such an exclusive military zone that is independent of the outside world. There wasn't even one kilobyte of data exchange between the Internet and the Intranet here. Naturally, there would be no so-called network security problems.</br>
</br>
As for whether there would be any hackers who could sneak inside?</br>
</br>
The soldiers at Area 51 weren't worried at all.</br>
</br>
Dozens and dozens of Soviet spies were captured there.</br>
</br>
Just the sensors spread out all over the military base were enough to make it difficult to even advance an inch for those who wanted to approach it illegally.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen patiently waited to read the article and watched the data stream flashing through.</br>
</br>
The downloading speed was increased to the maximum. Jean copied all the confidential files stored on the server. To artificial intelligence of the 22nd century, the firewall installed on these two machines was simply child's play.</br>
</br>
Half an hour later, all the data were quietly fragmented into 0s and 1s and disappeared into the tactical helmet screen.</br>
</br>
"Complete."</br>
</br>
Jean used her unemotional tone and declared the outcome of this silent battle.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't stop to rest and immediately opened the ten terabyte of compressed file that Jean downloaded onto the memory card. To review these documents with human effort would take at least one to two months to categorize the documents. However, for an artifical intelligence, all documents were sorted out in less than a minute.</br>
</br>
</br>
In these projects, Jiang Chen saw many shocking things.</br>
</br>
Document Number: 10020</br>
</br>
Record Name: RQ-180 Drone Improvement</br>
</br>
Development Direction: Improve the cruising ability, strengthen the cruising speed, and enhance the ability to defend against EMP weapons...</br>
</br>
Development Budget: One illion US Dollars.</br>
</br>
Content: …</br>
</br>
A strange expression gradually appeared on Jiang Chen's face as he skimmed the information in the document,</br>
</br>
It seemed that the EMP did scare the UA. He looked at more than a dozen projects, and all of them specifically stated improvements against EMP. For example, reducing the size of electronic components of key equipment as much as possible to reduce the high temperature generated by electromagnetic pulses, or even sacrificing a small amount of stealth and agility to apply a specific metal coating to form a Faraday cage on the fighters.</br>
</br>
With limited scientific and technological conditions, these methods were somewhat effective. However, even the researchers in Area 51 didn't find a good solution for the EMP's attacks on the grid, civilian facilities, and factories.</br>
</br>
However, the Capital already established this project and allocated a budget of five billion US Dollars to study how to defend against EMP on the soil.</br>
</br>
In addition, Area 51 seemed to be studying a small four-rotor attack drone. This drone shape was similar to Future Group's Beta-3, but at the bottom were hanging muzzles and magazines. At present, this type of drone had already entered the testing phase. Researchers in Area 51 were determining ways to eliminate rotor noise and wanted to design AIs that could automatically identify friendly and enemy targets.</br>
</br>
It seemed that on the issue of national security, the UA didn't mind copying technology. As long as they changed the appearance, who would know this was a counterfeit version of the Beta-3 logistics drone?</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't mind. As long as Future Group maintained a leading position in technology, the UA would only be able to chase behind them, unable to catch up.</br>
</br>
In addition to these projects, Jiang Chen also witnessed many incredible technologies projects that were still in the planning stage that had yet to receive funding.</br>
</br>
For example, one project was filed under the name "Northern Lights Arrival". By creating specific channels in the targeted airspace, solar wind could pass through the shielding of the Earth's magnetic field, enabling high-energy particles to cause electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects over a relatively wide range.</br>
</br>
However, this project didn't receive enough financial support. Obviously, the Capital didn't believe whimsical researchers could find a way to open a hole in the Earth's magnetic field. Moreover, the solar wind that passed through the shielding of the earth's magnetic field could not only certainly cause EMP effects over a wide area, but it would also create a large hole in the ozone layer.</br>
</br>
Even if the budget for this project was a bottomless pit, no one could measure the serious environmental impact of this bewildering weapon. If this tunnel that passed through the Earth's magnetic field could no longer be closed, surface organisms would go extinct...</br>
</br>
"Jean, is this kind of weapon possible?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jean paused for two seconds. She probably went to search the database in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
"At least in NAC's database, this type of dark technology doesn't exist."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt relieved that he would no longer be bothered by the "Northern Lights Arrival" when he received confirmation, then he continued to search the catalog for information on the radio telescope.</br>
</br>
With the help of Jean, Jiang Chen saw the project numbered 12417 not long afterward.</br>
</br>
This project was listed in the space category.</br>
</br>
Item Number: 12417</br>
</br>
Record Name: Extraterrestrial Civilization Exploration</br>
</br>
Development Direction: Through radio telescopes, analyze the possibility of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization within 50 light years from the Earth.</br>
</br>
Development Budget: 300 million US Dollars.</br>
</br>
Content: …</br>
</br>
He ignored all the content he didn't understand and only scanned through the key points. Jiang Chen looked down through the documents, but when he saw the progress, his pupils suddenly shrank.</br>
</br>
Research and Development Progress:</br>
</br>
... Subproject No. 011: Gliese 581.</br>
</br>
Location: Located 20.4 light-years away from Earth. It's located about two degrees north of Beta Librae, the brightest star in the Libra constellation.</br>
</br>
Analysis: The star is a red dwarf with spectral type M3V. Observed by radio telescope, there are active hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and other elements on the 581g planet surface, and there is a large probability of water. Planetary tides are locked, the solar wind is active, and the state of the geomagnetic field is unknown.</br>
</br>
There may be an atmosphere.</br>
</br>
There may be creatures, distributed along the twilight line.</br>
</br>
No regular electromagnetic waves are observed; civilization is less likely to exist, or if existing, it is likely to have technological capability below the Stone Age...</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saw this, he held his breath.</br>
</br>
Gliese 581 - he was too familiar with the name.</br>
</br>
He just didn't imagine that in the exploration project of extraterrestrial civilization in Area 51, there would actually be a record for this planet. Although the evaluation of their civilization level was somewhat ridiculous...</br>
</br>
Looking at the line of text, Jiang Chen was silent for a long time.</br>
</br>
As he thought about what to do, suddenly, there was a deafening alarm outside the window...</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Nightfall covered Los Santos. The bright neon lights turned this bustling city into a city that never sleeps. The corners of the streets remained crowded even deep into the night.</br>
</br>
The cool sea breeze swept through the streets, blowing away the heat of the day.</br>
</br>
This was the center of economy and culture on North America's west coast. Due to centuries of peace, they had accumulated unimaginable wealth there. Even if there had been slight unrest in recent days, there was no concern on people's faces.</br>
</br>
Regardless of their membership of any ethnic groups, people were proud of this city from the bottoms of their hearts and believed tomorrow would be better.</br>
</br>
Venice Street.</br>
</br>
Because of the recent attacks, the defense around the Xin Embassy was adjusted. After consulting the Capital, the FBA assigned some agents to assist the Los Santos police in investigating the terrorist attack that occurred during the protest, and the missing agents were replaced by the CIB.</br>
</br>
Wearing a black coat, Brad leaned against the car. Because the target had been in the embassy these days, Brad temporarily took over the security work of the embassy as a top man working under Lawrence.</br>
</br>
Looking at the lights in the embassy, Brad felt a little bored.</br>
</br>
Even the most maddening terrorists wouldn't have the abilities or guts to rush into the Xin Embassy protected by the FBA and the CIB. Support helicopters were on standby at the FBA's landing pad, and FBA sniper team was also deployed not far away. It was no exaggeration to say that the security level here was only inferior to one place.</br>
</br>
The Capital.</br>
</br>
The CIB detective who was standing opposite him handed him a cigarette and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Do you smoke?"</br>
</br>
"Thank you."</br>
</br>
Brad took the cigarette and put it in his mouth. He took out a lighter and lit the cigarette. The CIB agent who handed him the cigarette couldn't wait to borrow a lighter and lit one himself. Then he blew out a smoke ring in enjoyment.</br>
</br>
"My name is Ivan Keynes. Yours?"</br>
</br>
"Brad Wayne."</br>
</br>
"How many times have you been on missions like these?" asked Keynes.</br>
</br>
"I don't remember." Brad shook his head.</br>
</br>
There was a slight change in Keynes's expression, and a very intrigued look emerged.</br>
</br>
"Don't remember? Sh*t, you must be an experienced guy. Have you been to Iraq?"</br>
</br>
"No, my tasks are mainly domestic." Brad shook his head.</br>
</br>
He already felt the person in front of him was too chatty. However, Mr. Keynes didn't realize it himself. Not only did he not stop the conversation, but he vividly talked about his service in Iraq.</br>
</br>
"I've been there. It's terrible. There's countless amount of sand, camels, and bombs everywhere..."</br>
</br>
Brad frowned slightly as he listened to the voice.</br>
</br>
It didn't matter if people smoked, but chatting on duty wasn't very good. People with a little bit of experience knew chatting could be distracting and slow the response time to unexpected situations. Although he didn't think anything would happen, attitude was a key issue.</br>
</br>
</br>
Brad could conclude with confidence that the agent was a rookie. The reason why he left from the frontline was mostly because of this blabbering nature that could've seriously interfered with the mission.</br>
</br>
Turning his gaze to the street across from him, Brad selectively ignored him.</br>
</br>
[Why would a rookie be assigned here? What are the CIB, full of idiots, thinking?]</br>
</br>
On a corner across the street, a truck with a large Hollywood poster slowly stopped at the side of the road. The car seemed to be experiencing a breakdown. The owner pushed open the door and got off the car. He circled a few times to examine the tires, called for a car repair, and walked toward the shop on the street.</br>
</br>
Just as Brad tried to see what movie the poster was advertising, a similar truck appeared on the other side of the road and followed the traffic flow in his direction.</br>
</br>
At this time, Brad raised his eyebrows, and a sense of peculiarity alerted him.</br>
</br>
Almost subconsciously, he reached for the radio on his shoulder.</br>
</br>
"Jim, the truck that is twenty meters from your left hand, go and take a look."</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
The agent in disguise, who wasn't far from the truck, walked toward the truck that stopped by the road. He first looked into the driver's seatm then walked over to the container in the back. However, at that moment, the truck that passed in front of the embassy suddenly stopped in the middle of the road.</br>
</br>
"That truck is a bit odd." Keynes looked at the middle of the road and said what Brad was thinking.</br>
</br>
However, without a second to respond, a massive flame ball exploded from the truck in the middle of the road.</br>
</br>
"BOOM!!"</br>
</br>
A cluster of crimson fireballs engulfed the entire truck. The shockwave flipped the car behind the truck and shattered the windows of all the vehicles on the street, even shop glass windows within a ten-meter radius were all destroyed. Brad immediately ducked, and the flying debris almost swept past his head at the same time.</br>
</br>
However, Keynes, who was standing beside him, wasn't so fortunate. A pool of blood was already scattered on the iron gate behind him. The aluminum alloy pieces pierced through his neck and chest.</br>
</br>
The explosion was sudden.</br>
</br>
The fleeing cars smashed into one another and caused traffic to turn into chaos. People on the street screamed and fled, and brave people took out their phones to call the police. The car alarms were loud, adding to the mayhem on the street...</br>
</br>
Although the entrance of the embassy was ten meters away from the road, this distance was nothing for the bomb! Brad pulled out his pistol immediately, and he aimed at the still-burning debris and the chaotic crowd.</br>
</br>
In a flash, Brad understood the intention of the attackers.</br>
</br>
The first wave of attack was only causing chaos!</br>
</br>
The real attack was the second wave!</br>
</br>
"Damn, are they crazy?!"</br>
</br>
Brad clenched his teeth with a fierce expression, staring at the escaping crowd, guarding against possible attackers. At the same time, one of his hands reached for his shoulder and provided feedback to the FBA Los Santos branch.</br>
</br>
"There's a terrorist attack at the gate of the Xin Embassy! I repeat, there's a terrorist attack at the gate of Xin Embassy!"</br>
</br>
The fire trucks had already arrived. Firefighters wearing respirators and carrying oxygen rushed to the wreckage burning in the middle of the road. However, at this time, Brad saw that Jim, who he sent to investigate the roadside truck not far away, was already in a pool of blood...</br>
</br>
The door of the truck had long been opened. A team of soldiers wearing armors that resembled black dragon scales, carrying assault rifles, jumped onto the road.</br>
</br>
Without any identification, they neatly and systematically loaded their weapons. They spread out like a professional army into the surroundings, weapons already pointed in his direction.</br>
</br>
Brad's pupils instantly shrinked.</br>
</br>
Regardless of their identity, there was one thing he was sure about - they definitely weren't SWAT coming to the rescue!</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 885: Battle of Los Santos</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On Venice Street, the sound of alarms and guns disturbed the tranquility of the night.</br>
</br>
The police had already blocked off the street and dispatched almost all police forces in the nearby area to the attack location.</br>
</br>
However, this didn't change the unfavorable situation of Los Santos Police Department.</br>
</br>
"...their firepower is too strong! We need support!"</br>
</br>
"SWAT is on the way, hold on!"</br>
</br>
"Damn, what are our snipers doing?" Brad hid behind a car, controlling his pumping heart. He seized the opportunity to return fire with his pistol.</br>
</br>
However, against the unidentified armed force armed to the teeth, his m1911 bullets only tickled. Unless they directly struck the enemy's head or leg, it wouldn't cause substantial damage. Brad seriously wondered if they were wearing dragon scales or at defensive body armor of similar strength!</br>
</br>
As for the Los Santos Police Department, Brad didn't expect them to be helpful at all.</br>
</br>
The police standard was Glock pistols with one or two shotguns at most. The state legislature did not pass the police's request for automatic weapons. Therefore, in some UA blockbusters, it was often seen that the police force were beaten by the gangster's automatic firepower... before the SWAT team arrived.</br>
</br>
At the office building eight hundred meters away.</br>
</br>
On the roof of this sixty-story building, close enough to oversee the entire Venice Street...</br>
</br>
A soldier wearing a black mask with only his eyes exposed was kneeling on the edge of the roof. He systematically adjusted his sniper rifle. Next to him was an observer. The binoculars in his hand were locked on the chaotic street.</br>
</br>
"At three o'clock, 871 meters, two targets."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Three seconds later, the sniper pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
Near the ventilator, not far behind the two people, two bodies laid there quietly. From the logo on their clothes, they belonged to the FBA...</br>
</br>
The instant he heard the piercing sound of bullets, Brad watched his comrade's head get penetrated by a bullet in front of him. The insides of his brain, mixed with blood, spilled on the ground like crushed tofu.</br>
</br>
He blanked out for a second.</br>
</br>
Fear overwhelmed him, but this discomfort didn't last long. In the next instant, his consciousness was brutally pulled out by a bullet that descended from heaven.</br>
</br>
The FBA and CIB agents suppressed by the automatic weapons behind cover were killed by the sniper rifle, one by one. Twelve armed militants dressed in black combat uniforms divided into three teams, and they pushed foward by firing alternatively. They began to surround the Xin Embassy and advanced forward.</br>
</br>
The polices were forced to take cover behind the police cars and didn't have an opportunity to fight back.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the SWAT response was as fast as ever.</br>
</br>
Four police helicopters quickly arrived at the battlefield. The SWAT team, also dressed in black, quickly dropped onto the road after the helicopter approached the area. With automatic weapons, their firepower was far superior to the Los Santos police, but...</br>
</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Two gunshots.</br>
</br>
One bullet hit the concrete pavement, and the other hit the helicopter's propeller bearing and created a blinding spark. The helicopter hovering above the road slammed and crashed into the building on the side. The propeller was like rotating blades, slashing the concrete wall. The SWAT team that had yet to land on the ground were like grasshoppers strung on a rope and they crashed into the building.</br>
</br>
When the helicopter was shot down, the sniper also exposed his own coordinates.</br>
</br>
"Enemy sniper spotted, coordinates..."</br>
</br>
"Roger, moving."</br>
</br>
The SWAT team that landed on the road immediately engaged in crossfire with the unidentified armed forces.</br>
</br>
The two sides were equal in firepower, but in tactics, these SWAT units with countless experience were inferior to the unidentified armed forces.</br>
</br>
Just then, a modified van rushed out of the nearby underground garage. The remote-controlled machine gun at the top unleashed fierce bullets at the SWAT and the police car. The police officers hidden behind the police cars could only watch the unidentified armed forces rush into the embassy.</br>
</br>
"A heavy machine gun! God, it's a heavy machine gun! Hell, how did they get this stuff into Los Santos?!" With his pistol clenched tightly, a police officer looked on in fear and shouted in a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
"This is SWAT. The other party is equipped with heavy firepower. Requesting support. I repeat..." The SWAT captain leaned against the back of a cover and gasped for help from the headquarters.</br>
</br>
Support was already on the way.</br>
</br>
The Los Santos Police Department had dispatched all SWAT members in armored vehicles equipped with heavy weapons; they were headed to Venice Street. Unfortunately, they experienced a traffic jam on the way to Venice Street.</br>
</br>
Like the explosion that took place at the entrance of the Xin Embassy, bombs were detonated on all major intersections and completely collapsed the surrounding traffic. The fleeing vehicles disregarded all traffic rules and emergency lanes and crashed together on the road. Even the casualties caused by the explosions weren't greater than the casualties caused by traffic accidents experiencing a chain effect...</br>
</br>
In the past decade or so, the UA encountered many terrorist attacks and shooting incidents, but it was the first time they engaged in crossfire with such strong firepower—no, they couldn't be mere terrorists, everything about those attackers were more like mercenaries!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In Area 51 of Nevada, alarms rang out at the military base.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, who started the optical illusion, stood on the roof of the radar station and looked in the direction of the airport. Two F-35 fighter jets left the hangar and headed to the runway before they lifted off in an emergency flight. On the tarmac, next to the Osprey helicopter, about 50 fully armed soldiers were assembled.</br>
</br>
The entire military base was moving, but there was no sense of confusion.</br>
</br>
The chaos came from outside the base, not inside.</br>
</br>
After this point was made clear, Jiang Chen's pumping heart gradually settled.</br>
</br>
Just two minutes ago, he thought he was discovered. Against the encirclement of the entire military base, he had no confidence he could escape without exposing his power armor.</br>
</br>
His relaxed state didn't last long before he began to furrow his brows again.</br>
</br>
The entire military base was on high alert. It meant that the situation must not be trivial. Predictably, the highway from Nevada to California was bound to be blocked. Even if the road wasn't blocked, temporary checkpoints would be set up. However, Jiang Chen's current identity might be difficult for police to inspect.</br>
</br>
Not taking the highway? Directly cut through the desert?</br>
</br>
Theoretically feasible, but the fighters had already taken off.</br>
</br>
At this time, it was almost impossible to drive a car through the desert. While it was dark outside, an SUV with its roaring engine would be like a beacon on pilots' thermal imaging. Jiang Chen didn't think the pilots would just happen to miss the thermal imaging.</br>
</br>
Hide here for the night?</br>
</br>
That was even more unrealistic.</br>
</br>
Once dawn arrived, it would be even harder to leave.</br>
</br>
In the rare event Jiang Chen was feeling troubled, Zhu Yu called his watch.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen immediately answered the phone.</br>
</br>
However, to his surprise, it was an unfamiliar voice.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
An ominous feeling entered his head and Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Who are you?"</br>
</br>
"That's not important." The man's voice was mixed a tone of victory. After a pause, he said, "I think we need to talk."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 886: Hostage</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Xin Embassy was attacked by an unidentified armed force, and the entire Venice Street was shut down. A total of 14 civillians, 8 agents, 11 Los Santos polices, and 6 SWAT members were killed in the attack and 37 people were injured. Even the Los Santos SWAT team that came to support was also suppressed by the firepower of the enemy to be forced to take cover.</br>
</br>
Yellow tape blocked off Venice Street. Police vans and reporters' vehicles completely congested the area.</br>
</br>
The journalists who weren't afraid of death even set up cameras and brought first-hand information to the viewers around the globe. Although the Los Santos Police Department wanted to conceal their own failures, they couldn't forcefully clear the area while facing so many cameras.</br>
</br>
Ten minutes ago, all unidentified armed forces had already entered the embassy and engaged in fierce exchanges of fire with the security in the embassy. According to law, although security personnel in the embassy were allowed to possess weapons for self-defense, the weapons allowed into the embassy were limited to non-automatic weapons such as pistols.</br>
</br>
With just a few pistols, it obviously wasn't enough to fight those "terrorists" armed to the teeth. After finishing off several security personnel, the militants divided into three groups and broke through the embassy's line of defense without much effort. They kicked down the wooden door blocked by a closet and rushed into the hall with rifles.</br>
</br>
At that point, the mission was going well, but that was the end.</br>
</br>
The captain lifted his fist and the three mercenaries behind him understood. They rushed to the stairs without a moment of hesitation. However, at that moment, a fierce wind attacked the captain from the side, cutting through his Kevlar material at his throat.</br>
</br>
There was no screaming. One person out the team of four was already killed.</br>
</br>
The soldiers rushing to the stairs immediately turned around, but the next scene stunned them.</br>
</br>
Their captain stood there in a weird manner as if he was held by an unseen hand behind him. However, while they were stunned, their movements didn't stop at all. Three guns fired and the crossfire penetrated the already dead captain.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu, who started the optical illusion module, held the body of the captain with her right arm like a shield. There was no fear on her face, even if the impact from her right arm almost dislocated her joint.</br>
</br>
Even with her genetically-strengthened arm muscles, it was difficult to cut through Kevlar material with a fruit knife. She understood the situation and immediately threw away the fruit knife in her left hand without hesitation. She used her leg and picked up the assault rifle on the ground. Her left arm sandwiched the gun in her waist and returned fire at the staircase.</br>
</br>
Very effective counterattack!</br>
</br>
This type of unidentified rifle significantly enhanced its penetrating power, and the luxurious wooden stairs turned into sawdust. By using the short time gap when the enemy changed their clips, Zhu Yu suddenly dropped the body and rolled onto one side.</br>
</br>
</br>
As long as she escaped the eyes of these mercenaries for two seconds, they wouldn't be able to find her!</br>
</br>
However, at that moment, a signal bomb was thrown from the upper floor. The bang flickered while the smoke moved up to the roof at the same time.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu was perplexed and couldn't understand the significance of the move. At that moment, the water spraying down from the roof caused her heart to sink instantly.</br>
</br>
The smoke of the signal bomb triggered the smoke alarm! While the alarm bells rang, the water sprinkling from the ceiling outlined her figure.</br>
</br>
"Bang!"</br>
</br>
Blood splattered on her shoulder and stained the water droplets a light red.</br>
</br>
Strengthened bullets penetrated the thin layer of graphene material.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu kept her mouth shut and was just about to escape to the door. Another round of bullets hit her left leg. Without the slightest suspense, she stumbled down onto muddy floor tiles.</br>
</br>
A muzzle pointed at her head and Zhu Yu closed her eyes.</br>
</br>
However, the expected gunshot didn't ring out. The other person used a force that almost stopped her breathing and stepped onto her slender neck with one foot. Followed by a dry cough, white foam mixed with water droplets flowed out of her mouth.</br>
</br>
At that time, she saw with her blurred vision that a man was squatting in front of her. He lifted his mask and smiled.</br>
</br>
"Is that the optical illusion model? We long suspected you might have mastered this technology. It seems we were correct."</br>
</br>
"Let me introduce myself, I'm Cham Rothschild. You can call me Mr. Rothschild. It's a great surname. Am I right?"</br>
</br>
"Then beautiful lady... can I borrow those headphones?"</br>
</br>
Without intending to seek her consent, Cham pulled off the headset on Zhu Yu's head.</br>
</br>
[Talk?]</br>
</br>
When the stranger said this sentence, countless thoughts flashed in Jiang Chen's mind.</br>
</br>
[Why's he using Zhu Yu's communication equipment?]</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu was the first batch of Ghost Agents and was one of Ayesha's favorite apprentices. Jiang Chen thought he treated her nicely and didn't think she would betray him. After all, every Ghost Agent had an implanted chip when they entered the force. No traitor survived after betrayal. At the moment they were sworn in, their fate was tied to the chariot of Future Group.</br>
</br>
With an absence of information, Jiang Chen chose the most conservative answer.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to talk about?"</br>
</br>
"My name is Cham Rothschild. You can call me Mr. Rothschild. Of course, in order to distinguish from my brother, you can also call me the Gatekeeper." Cham smiled.</br>
</br>
"And?" Jiang Chen said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Cham exclaimed with exaggeration, and a curvature formed with his lips. "It seems you're not in Los Santos now, otherwise you should've found out what happened to your embassy."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't speak, but his mind turned fast.</br>
</br>
[What happened to the embassy? What could've happened?] At that time, Jiang Chen's eyes fixed on the Osprey helicopter not far away. [What was happening that required the mobilization of Army support from Area 51?]</br>
</br>
[Is it...]</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a chill was sent down Jiang Chen's spine.</br>
</br>
Thinking of the other party's attack in Frankberg, he thought of another, almost unbelievable possibility.</br>
</br>
"Do you think I'm bluffing?" Cham shook his head and snapped his finger at the mercenary next to him. "Do you think silence can solve the problem?"</br>
</br>
The mercenary raised his rifle and rammed the stock onto the fingers of Zhu Yu's right hand.</br>
</br>
"AHHH!" Even if the pain was about to drive her insane, Zhu Yu still defiantly suppressed her scream in her throat. Her bloodshot eyes stared at Cham through her mud-covered hair.</br>
</br>
"If you don't yell, I'll be very upset." Cham grinned then kicked away this despicable sight.</br>
</br>
It was annoying no matter how many times he looked at it.</br>
</br>
"Enough!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's grave tone stopped Cham. His eyes were as cold as knife blades as he stared at the airport in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Enough? Since that's your request..." Cham shrugged and held back the foot he was about to kick out. "I was ready to slaughter a little mouse. Anyway, Mr. Jiang Chen won't care about the death of a mouse. Especially if we have a valuable chip in our hands..."</br>
</br>
Cham was laughing manically.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen quietly waited for him to finish laughing. The laugh gradually turned into panting and then he returned to normal.</br>
</br>
"State your purpose."</br>
</br>
"Now all of Los Santos has been blocked, but I'm sure you'll find a way back. Coordinates will be sent to your map. There's a mobile phone on the roof of the target building. Pick it up and I'll tell you what to do next."</br>
</br>
Here, Cham paused and changed into a relaxed tone.</br>
</br>
"It's easy, isn't it? I hope I'll receive your call in two hours."</br>
</br>
Without giving Jiang Chen an opportunity to answer, Cham hung up.</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
It was the first serious terrorist attack in the nation since 9/11.</br>
</br>
The FBA and the CIB were in a complete meltdown. No one knew how those fully armored fighters appeared, how they crossed the borders, nor how they cleared custom. Not to mention, how they transported the heavy firepowers to Los Santos.</br>
</br>
Fifteen minutes passed since those terrorists entered the embassy and SWAT reinforcement finally arrived to surround the embassy with armored vehicles. The Los Santos Police Department never faced such an embarrassing defeat. The founder of the modern SWAT team, the LSPD SWAT team, was terrorized by the firepower of the terrorists.</br>
</br>
After the terrorists secured the embassy, ​​they mounted light machine guns at the windows and used the hostages at hand to threaten the special forces from approaching. These people neither submitted their requests nor expressed their intention to negotiate.</br>
</br>
For a while the situation was in a stalemate.</br>
</br>
Under the influence of the Internet, the impact of the attack spread across the country and around the globe through social media platforms.</br>
</br>
The countless cameras and phones made Lawrence sweat profusely.</br>
</br>
Two hundred meters away, his partner Brad was lying next to the car in front of the embassy. Although his brain was shattered by a sniper bullet, he could still recognize that the body belonged to his partner Brad.</br>
</br>
He still could not imagine that after just stepping away for a few moments, a horrific incident unfolded.</br>
</br>
[Terrorists sat in a truck and drove onto Venice Street openly. Did the CIB all become blind that they didn't see that modified vehicle hidden inside the underground parking lot?]</br>
</br>
At this time, Sheriff Michael William of the Los Santos Police Department got out of the car and came over to him.</br>
</br>
"We can't wait any longer, we should rush in immediately to save the hostages! The reporters are watching. The longer we delay this, the worse the situation will be for us. If the Army is not going to be here, get the SWAT team to do it—"</br>
</br>
"Twenty embassy staff members, as well as Jiang Chen and his CEO. Even the Capitol doesn't dare to take the risk with the hostages on their hands, do you understand what I mean Sheriff William?" Lawrence said with a stern look</br>
</br>
"So we are just going to wait?" Michael looked to the embassy with disdain on his face.</br>
</br>
"That's all we can do." Lawrence looked towards the embassy. Even from his position, he could only see a rough outline.</br>
</br>
Just then, the phone rang.</br>
</br>
Lawrence glanced at Sheriff William, and finally, William took the call.</br>
</br>
Unsurprisingly, it was from the Capitol, and it was a call from the president. As soon as the phone was connected, she asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"How is the situation over there?"</br>
</br>
"It's awful, we must plan for the worst—"</br>
</br>
"Mr. William." Hill interrupted him.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Yes...?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"I don't care what method you use, I only care about one thing. Jiang Chen must be alive. Do you understand?"</br>
</br>
Sheriff William held his breath. His throat moved, but no words could come out. It took him a while before he could articulate to the president.</br>
</br>
"I understand."</br>
</br>
After hanging up, Hill rubbed her sore eyes and immediately phoned the Xin Presidential Palace at the far away Coro Island. With an incident of this scale, it was impossible to hide it. Being proactive would show more sincerity than waiting for the other party to call.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
Even now, the UA side was still unaware that their most feared bargaining chip was now in the building.</br>
</br>
Cham Rothschild also did not expect this. He searched through all possible hiding spots inside the embassy and still did not found Jiang Chen's whereabouts. So the only possibility was that Jiang Chen deceived the FBA and did not stay in the embassy, instead, he sneaked elsewhere.</br>
</br>
With optical illusion for cover, it should not be difficult to escape under the watch of the FBA.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was absent. From this point of view, this operation already failed.</br>
</br>
But luckily, Xia Shiyu was there, and they could use their backup plan.</br>
</br>
According to Freemasonry intelligence, this woman named Xia Shiyu was not only the CEO of Future Group but also the lover of Future Group's owner. However, Cham was uncertain whether or not she could be used as a bargaining chip to lure Jiang Chen out since there were many women that have relationships beyond friendship with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
As for the title of CEO of the group, he didn't think it would be useful. After all, for a behemoth like Future Group, they could get as many senior wage earners as they wish.</br>
</br>
He was betting that Jiang Chen would go retrieve the phone and not go to the UA government and demand the immediate elimination of the terrorists in the embassy.</br>
</br>
"The identity of the other party has been ascertained. Cham Rothschild is a member of the Rothschild family. He went missing with a total of 16 mercenaries led by him when he participated in a European mountaineering club event in 2009. He was previously a member of the Poison Arrow Special Forces..."</br>
</br>
In the desert between Nevada and Cali, Jiang Chen was sitting in the cockpit of the Aurora-20. He was testing the aircraft's instruments while listening to the report of the Ghost Agent deployed in Los Santos.</br>
</br>
"Got it."</br>
</br>
"Is there anything else?" Penny asked.</br>
</br>
"Go to a place for me. Someone might be waiting for me, so keep an eye on him. However, don't make a move." Jiang Chen reached out and clicked on the watch, and sent the coordinates that Cham had given him to Penny.</br>
</br>
After receiving the coordinates, Penny bit her lip and was hesitant to speak.</br>
</br>
"What's the problem?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"No, nothing..." Although she did not have the right to ask, she asked after a moment of hesitation, "...are, are you planning on giving up the people in the embassy?"</br>
</br>
Her best friend and closest comrade-in-arms were in the embassy at the moment. If it were not for her superior's order, she would be already trying to rescue her.</br>
</br>
"Did I say that?" After checking the weapon system, Jiang Chen said expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Sorry."</br>
</br>
"It's okay, go to the coordinates now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the communication channel, took a deep breath, and put his hand on the center stick.</br>
</br>
Fifteen minutes ago, he slipped out of Area 51, rolled to across a sand dune with his quested speed, and reached the desert two kilometers away from the military base. Then, he returned to the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
Half an hour later, Jiang Chen returned to the desert, and along with him, was a fully-loaded Aurora-20.</br>
</br>
"In my opinion, you only have two hours of virtual flight time, and I'm afraid it's not a good idea to directly operate the real machine." Jean's emotionless voice fluctuated in Jiang Chen's ears but did not change his decision.</br>
</br>
"I know." After confirming that no steps were missed, Jiang Chen slowly closed his eyes. "Even for a talented pilot, one has to train for at least half a year."</br>
</br>
"This is my opinion," Jean said.</br>
</br>
"But it doesn't apply to me." When Jiang Chen said this as he opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
His dark pupils were covered by a layer of crimson red.</br>
</br>
In his field of vision, the previously strange instrument became familiar in his head.</br>
</br>
Hidden genetic code – Peerless!</br>
</br>
"It's been a long time." Muttering to himself, Jiang Chen pushed the throttle forward with his left hand, and skillfully adjusted the engine direction with his right hand.</br>
</br>
Dust was blown away by the jet propulsion, and under the effect of the lift, the Aurora-20 bounced 20 meters vertically. After a short pause, the engine adjusted its direction and propelled forward. Like a stream of light, the Aurora-20 disappeared into the night sky...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Will he go?" Sitting across from Cham, Gasol, the deputy captain of the team, asked in a deep voice.</br>
</br>
"The probability is fifty percent, but it's worth a bet." Cham glanced at the machine gun placed on the window. "After all, we have no better choice."</br>
</br>
The embassy was surrounded by the SWAT. The muzzles mounted on the armored vehicles could be seen from the outside door, and even armed soldiers had shown up at the scene. If it was not for the fact that Jiang Chen and Xin diplomats weren't in the embassy, forcing the Capital to remain extra cautious, the nature of never-compromising terrorists meant they would've already stormed in otherwise.</br>
</br>
"If he went..." Gasol grinned. He seemed to be laughing, but there was a difference.</br>
</br>
Cham laughed and leaned his rifle against the side of the chair.</br>
</br>
"Steven will wipe our butt for us."</br>
</br>
As if he had already decided on his fate, the two men smiled, except they hadn't given their own destiny the slightest consideration.</br>
</br>
From the moment they came to Los Santos, they hadn't planned on going back alive. For the gatekeeper, killing Jiang Chen meant he fulfilled his mission. He was worthy of the Rothschild's last name and worthy of the significance that the Freemasonry gave him.</br>
</br>
For Poison Arrow... they fought for faith and revenge.</br>
</br>
"What about this person?" Gasol pointed his chin at Zhu Yu, who was lying in a pool of blood.</br>
</br>
Because she wasn't bandaged, the agent with excessive blood loss was barely alive. Without any medical attention, she might die soon.</br>
</br>
Cham tapped on the railing with his finger, thought for a moment, and opened the headset.</br>
</br>
The phone soon switched on, and Cham said slowly, "You have 30 minutes left. Maybe I need to remind you that our patience is limited."</br>
</br>
After the Peerless ability was activated, emotions were stripped from the body and Jiang Chen said expressionlessly, "Oh."</br>
</br>
Cham raised his eyebrows because Jiang Chen's tone was unpredictable.</br>
</br>
"In thirty minutes, if you haven't appeared yet—"</br>
</br>
"Five minutes is enough."</br>
</br>
The communication ended, and Cham paused and looked at Gasol.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?" Gasol asked.</br>
</br>
"I feel something is wrong," Cham frowned.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Aurora-20, soaring above the clouds, didn't attract the attention of the radar. After ending communication, Jiang Chen pulled up the throttle valve. Under his operation, the vortex engine began to decelerate, and the Aurora-20 also switched from flight mode to a vertical suspension mode.</br>
</br>
The horizontal speed dropped to zero.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen reached out and unlocked the nylon buckle on his body, liberating himself from the shackles of the pilot's seat.</br>
</br>
The crimson red faded from his pupil, and his Peerless state was deactivated in an instant. Jiang Chen reached out to the control and threw the fighter plane into the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
</br>
The cold air turbulence covered his body and he didn't stay in the air for too long. In the next moment, he traveled to the apocalypse, and he touched the soft bed behind him.</br>
</br>
The T-3 power armor was placed on the side of the bed. It was equipped with an anti-radar coating and exuded a touch of bright silver. The legs and feet were equipped with anti-impact modules, with a propulsion jetpack on the back. After he put on the power armor, he took a deep breath and disappeared from the room.</br>
</br>
On Venice Street, the reporters' cameras were all pointed at the occupied embassy far away and they were discussing the situation in front of the cameras. Los Santos police stood behind the police cars, clueless about what to do and they watched the SWAT, FBA and CIB agents who were equally at a loss.</br>
</br>
Not far away, the UA military was holding a combat conference, but half an hour already passed since they first stepped out from the Osprey transport plane. There was still no action.</br>
</br>
The Colombian TV reporter, Baine, kneeled on the side of the road and finished the hot dog in his hand swiftly. He wiped the grease from his hands and was just about to return to the camera when he heard a humming sound in the air.</br>
</br>
Baine looked up into the clear night sky and thought for a moment.</br>
</br>
He didn't remember how many times this happened. The UA military's F35 screeched past Los Santos, but it often returned to the nearby air base after only a brief hover. Maybe they thought this could pressure the terrorists? Or maybe this would let the people know that the federal government wasn't just doing nothing.</br>
</br>
But the truth was that they were doing nothing.</br>
</br>
According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, embassy enjoyed a high degree of diplomatic immunity. In the absence of Xin's authorization, breaking into the embassy wasn't permitted, even if it was for rescue and attacking terrorists.</br>
</br>
Yes, for some odd reasons, Xin rejected the UA's request for authorization to enter the embassy. If the UA military entered the embassy at this time, the only way was to recuperate Xin's right to use the Los Santos embassy lease. In short, the diplomats would've been expelled... The UA certainly couldn't do that. Hill was actually relieved because Xin rejected the request for authorization.</br>
</br>
They were up against fully armed mercenaries and rescue hostages. She really didn't have confidence. However, if something were to happen to Jiang Chen, it would be difficult to ensure that those intercontinental missiles that stayed under the sea would still remain there.</br>
</br>
The Capital spokesperson expressed "regret" to the domestic and foreign reporters for Xin's refusal to authorize the UA military to enter Xin's embassy. At the same time, it once again emphasized that any form of terrorism was the common enemy of all mankind, and the UA would absolutely not compromise to terrorism…</br>
</br>
You see, it wasn't that they didn't act. It was Xin that prevented them from entering.</br>
</br>
Shaking his head, Baine was ready to return his focus to his camera. However, at that moment, his eyes staring into the air were stuck in the sky and fixed above the embassy…</br>
</br>
The flame engulfed the lower part of the power armor and looked like a striking meteor. Turbulence under the bowl-shaped anti-impact modules formed a burning cyclone, accompanied by a roar that broke the sound barrier and fell vertically through the roof of the embassy.</br>
</br>
It was the blind spot of the militants within the embassy.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes were locked onto the sloped roof. The heat source information of the enemy units had been marked in his field of vision. As for how he did it, it was through the chip implanted in the back of the Ghost Agent and the cameras in the embassy...</br>
</br>
Without the slightest buffer, the power armor smashed into the roof directly with a hard landing. The three mercenaries in the hostage's room were smashed into pieces, along with the bricks on the second floor ceiling and floor.</br>
</br>
Outside Venice Street, reporters, policemen, SWAT, the Army in the meeting, and the crowd had only one expression. It was blank. They didn't know what that thing was. When they managed to react, the thing had already penetrated through the Xin Embassy.</br>
</br>
The entire embassy looked like it was bombarded and one corner was directly cut off.</br>
</br>
The hostages curled up in the corner were equally as stunned. Because they were in the corner, the collapse that occurred didn't cause too much damage to them, but the mercenaries who stood in the middle of the room weren't so lucky...</br>
</br>
The bloody mercenaries barely lifted their pistols and pointed at the steel monster standing up from the dust.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pulled away the reinforced concrete in front of him, ignoring the spewed flames and bullets coming at him. He slapped away the pistol in a mercenary's hand and grabbed his neck.</br>
</br>
Blood splattered onto the surface of the steel armor, and the already fearsome armor was even more bloodthirsty..</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked out the window and saw the soldiers and SWAT at the doorway about to make a move, but it was clear they hadn't yet received authorization to enter the embassy... or rather, Jiang Chen, who contacted the Xin Presidential Palace, didn't approve the authorization.</br>
</br>
Turning around, Jiang Chen saw the horrified but calm eyes behind the ruins. Other than a few bruises on the forehead and being covered in dust, Xia Shiyu was uninjured.</br>
</br>
Not only Xia Shiyu, but all diplomats were safe and sound.</br>
</br>
After confirming the safety of the hostages, Jiang Chen was relieved.</br>
</br>
He finally made it. Penny should also be in position.</br>
</br>
Just at that time, the communication request was sent to Jiang Chen's watch.</br>
</br>
"Reached the target location."</br>
</br>
"You can start the execution," Jiang Chen ordered.</br>
</br>
"Roger."</br>
</br>
After receiving the order, Penny ended the communication.</br>
</br>
A cruel smile appeared, and a deathly fierceness pierced out from his eyes. The triangular prismatic barrel emerged from his steel right arm and unleashed the roar of death in rotation. Jiang Chen crossed the rubble and threw out the ammunition-loaded Hummingbird drones from the storage dimension. After setting an order to protect the hostages, he followed the hallway forward.</br>
</br>
A strong wind came from the side and the mercenary hiding behind the door slammed toward the steel helmet with a tactical short axe. This aggressive attack appeared to be flawless, but he apparently didn't consider the hardness of Grade A steel. The axe blade didn't even dent the helmet before his right arm was chopped off by a waving dagger.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the howling mercenary with blood gushing out from his arm. He continued to walk forward.</br>
</br>
The mercenary crouching behind cover vented his fear with unleashed bullets and tried to use firepower to repel the slaughter armor. However, only jumping sparks reflected in their pupils. Even if the bullets were strengthened to counter against Celestial Trade's kinetic skeletons, they couldn't penetrate through the armor of the machine.</br>
</br>
A grenade was thrown at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The exploding hot air scrapped the armor's surface. Except for a series of slamming sounds, it didn't give the scared mercenaries any comfort.</br>
</br>
Fear didn't last too long, including the pain that was about to arrive.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen lifted the minigun and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
With orange trajectories, blood and fire ended their lives...</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 889: It“s not up to you</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The light bulbs flickered in the room. Cham supported his body with a rifle and shook his cloudy head to drive away the dizzy feeling. He struggled to get up from the ground. Gasol, who was previously sitting next to him, was similarly holding himself up with a rifle.</br>
</br>
Just a moment ago, the entire embassy shook violently as if it was hit by a missile. The huge impact shattered all the ceilings and everything smashed on the ground. At the same time, the two were toppled and they also lost their balance.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, what happened?!" Gasol spat out and subconsciously glanced out the window.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the UA soldiers made no further moves.</br>
</br>
"I don't know."</br>
</br>
Cham, with an uncertain expression, squeezed the sentence out of his mouth and turned off the safety of the rifle.</br>
</br>
"Should we execute the hostages?" Gasol said gravely.</br>
</br>
"Execute some."</br>
</br>
If they didn't respond to such provocative actions and allowed the other party to think they were bluffing, it would be problematic.</br>
</br>
After finishing this sentence, Cham pulled out his pistol, and looked at where the girl on the ground.</br>
</br>
However, to his surprise, the blood on the ground was still there, but she had disappeared.</br>
</br>
Cham cursed.</br>
</br>
He was careless. When the bullet broke through her combat suit, the optical illusion stopped functioning. Because he thought she lost her combat power and she wouldn't have lived for long after the loss of blood, he just tied her up and tossed her to the corner.</br>
</br>
Unexpectedly, this combat suit didn't completely fail from the breakage...</br>
</br>
Nor did he expect she could move even while being that injured...</br>
</br>
Cham and Gasol raised their muzzles immediately and their narrowed pupils scanned the room. When the optical illusion moved, it would cause a slight ripple around the individual. With enough concentration, it wouldn't be difficult to identify her movements.</br>
</br>
Half a minute later, dense gunfire came downstairs, and a strong of sense uneasiness entered his mind.</br>
</br>
What happened next confirmed his instincts.</br>
</br>
The door was kicked open and Gasol lifted the muzzle out of his reflex. However, at that time, Zhu Yu moved.</br>
</br>
With one hand, she pulled out the dagger on her waist, and in a flash of a second, the dagger cut open his throat. Not far away, Cham turned his gun, but he didn't have time to aim before a dark shadow slammed from the doorway, sending him flying.</br>
</br>
Cham was coughing out blood. He pushed off the body of a mercenary on top of him and he desperately tried to reach for his gun. However, three shots shattered his hopes.</br>
</br>
"AHHH—" His left hand held onto his broken right hand. His face was twisted because of the sharp pain.</br>
</br>
A flash of resoluteness entered his eyes. Relying on his strong will, he let go of his left hand holding onto his right arm and he reached for the detonator around his waist. The modified van parked in the garage was filled with 200 kilograms of explosives. As long as he pressed the detonator, the entire embassy would be lifted from the ground up.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, when he pressed the detonator, the expected explosion didn't happen.</br>
</br>
The optical illusion was forcibly deactivated. Zhu Yu appeared beside Gasol's body. The bloodstain on the body couldn't be distinguished. A round tube resembling a can of Coke was nonchalantly tossed out from Jiang Chen's hands and rolled slowly in front of Cham. However, he didn't notice it. He just looked at the detonator with disbelief.</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of EMP? You guys just don't remember." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Impossible. It's impossible... There's a heating wire in the bomb. Even if there was EMP, it should directly trigger the bomb," Cham mumbled, even forgetting his pain.</br>
</br>
"We can make EMP bigger and naturally, we can also make it smaller. For example, the round pipe in front of you - we call it the EMP grenade."</br>
</br>
Without bothering with Cham, who was completely stunned, Jiang Chen went to Zhu Yu's side and kicked away the fallen Gasol on her. He examined the gruesome wounds on her shoulders, sighed, and picked her up from the ground.</br>
</br>
"You did a good job. Just rest for a while," Jiang Chen whispered. He placed the unconscious girl on the couch, released the Beta-4 medical drone from the storage dimension and pointed it in her direction.</br>
</br>
Cham stared blankly at this scene and was even more shaken and stunned.</br>
</br>
He couldn't understand where the drone came from.</br>
</br>
He didn't need to understand.</br>
</br>
Because soon, he would take his last name with him and go to hell.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked in front of Cham, ignored the shaking pistol, nonchalantly took it away from him and threw it to the side.</br>
</br>
"I heard you're the Gatekeeper."</br>
</br>
Cold sweat rolled down from his forehead. Chan said with difficulty, "You...are you Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"..." From Cham's eyes, Jiang Chen saw a lot of emotions, and the most dominant emotion was disbelief.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of his position of high power, the Freemasonry had already equated him to the likes of Carmen Rothschild and Luke Joyce. They had forgotten about his past when he once single-handedly penetrated into IS territory and the Ukrainian theater. Before gaining today's achievements, his combat power was already at the human pinnacle.</br>
</br>
Even if he rarely used his own force, even Robert Downey Jr., the successor to Stark Industries, didn't give his steel suits to his subordinates and completely retire behind the scenes.</br>
</br>
Realizing he had underestimated Jiang Chen's abilities, the detonator fell to the floor, and Cham's fingers slowly slackened.</br>
</br>
"I won't tell you anything."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised one of his eyebrows, and a needle emerged from his hand covered in steel.</br>
</br>
"You don't get to make that choice."</br>
</br>
In the eastern suburbs of Los Santos, on the 13th street of Knights Road, the originally illuminated streets had already merged into the curtain of the night. On the roof of a shopping mall building, the cold wind gusted wildly, but it still didn't manage to cool his pumping heart.</br>
</br>
Standing behind the roof's water tank, Steven looked in the direction of the stairs. He repeatedly put his hands into his trench coat pocket, as if that cold metal texture could cool the restlessness of his heart.</br>
</br>
[Will he come?]</br>
</br>
Steven was unsure.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't in the embassy and the operation already failed. The change from assassination to kidnapping was a forced change of plan, and this phone placed on the roof was the only insurance of this mission. However, no one could guarantee this insurance would work.</br>
</br>
Based on the previous CIB mission in Gya, the other party had a record of them stepping into danger for the female CEO. However, people could change. If he really chose to collect the corpses for the entire Xin Embassy, they couldn't do anything about the fact.</br>
</br>
At that moment, a faint sound came from the stairs.</br>
</br>
Steven immediately focused his attention. His hands slowly left his pocket, exposing the pistol hidden inside his trench coat.</br>
</br>
The door quietly opened.</br>
</br>
However, no one was there.</br>
</br>
Steven stared at the stairway not far away, slowly turning off his pistol's safety while holding his breath.</br>
</br>
However, at that very moment, a cold sensation was pressed against the back of his head, causing his frantic heart to suddenly fall to the bottom.</br>
</br>
A female voice came behind him.</br>
</br>
"Don't move."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When the embassy was hit by the "missile", Venice Street erupted. A corner of the embassy was cut off, exposing the steel beams inside. The splattered concrete blocks even hit the armored vehicles on the street, showing their powerful force.</br>
</br>
The soldiers leaning behind the armored vehicles peeked out and looked at the chaotic embassy and exclaimed, "WTF? What was that?"</br>
</br>
"A missile? Or something else?"</br>
</br>
"It didn't seem like it... Do you not think it looked like a person?"</br>
</br>
If it weren't for the police's desperate attempt to stop the mob, those eager reporters would've rushed into the embassy to find out what it was. They were keen to know what exactly hit the embassy and they had every reason to believe that the audience waiting in front of the TV was also keen to know the truth.</br>
</br>
The SWAT team leaned against the door of the embassy. Their automatic rifles were already loaded. They were just waiting for the commander to make an order before rushing in to teach the terrorists who had previously embarrassed them a lesson. However, Los Santos Sheriff Michael Williams appeared to be quite hesitant.</br>
</br>
He didn't obtain authorization from the Capital.</br>
</br>
Or, the Capital didn't receive authorization from Xin.</br>
</br>
Lawrence leaned against the street light and pressed his phone to his ear. This was already the tenth call he received. Half the calls came from the Capital and half came from the FBA. Everyone had the same questions: What happened? What actually hit the embassy? Are the people in the embassy still alive?</br>
</br>
As well as…</br>
</br>
Did a war start?</br>
</br>
Lawrence noticed the people outside the cordon hadn't realized the seriousness of the situation with the corner of his eye. Many people were busy uploading their captured photos to Twitter or Facebook, sharing their shock from that moment.</br>
</br>
"I swear! I just saw it! It definitely wasn't a missile. It was a man! No, it's Iron Man! Jesus! This is crazy!"</br>
</br>
"...Do superheroes really exist?"</br>
</br>
"Why are our police still not moving? What are they waiting for?!"</br>
</br>
Lawrence withdrew his gaze and sighed, turning his gaze to the half-collapsed embassy and praying.</br>
</br>
[Please let everything be okay...]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Smoke blew out from the muzzle. Jiang Chen put away his tactical rifle and deactivated his power armor.</br>
</br>
Having obtained the information he wanted, Jiang Chen naturally didn't need Cham Rothschild to live anymore. As a distant member of the Rothschild family, his blood was separated from Carmen by more than three generations. He didn't have any value as a bargaining chip.</br>
</br>
As a Gatekeeper, he knew much more than Jiang Chen imagined.</br>
</br>
Every time the Freemasonry Level 33 members held a secret meeting, he stood at the doorway of the conference room. Although he didn't deliberately explore the contents of the meetings, he still had a very clear understanding of the list of the Level 33 members and the location of the meetings.</br>
</br>
</br>
After taking out his satellite phone, Jiang Chen put the rifle aside and sat on the sofa, dialing Ayesha's number.</br>
</br>
"Are you okay?!"</br>
</br>
There was a rare anxiety and panic in Ayesha's voice.</br>
</br>
Hearing that familiar voice, Jiang Chen smiled with relief.</br>
</br>
"I'm fine. The crisis at the embassy has been dealt with. In addition, I've obtained a lot of interesting intelligence from the Gatekeeper."</br>
</br>
Ayesha made a sigh of relief and whispered in a blaming voice, "Next time... don't do this."</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I know my limits," Jiang Chen said carelessly, leaning against the cushion on the sofa. He then said, "The rest of my job is to tie the loose ends. I need you to send more people to Europe. It's time for this to end."</br>
</br>
Ayesha closed her eyes and said seriously, "Leave it to me."</br>
</br>
"Also, let Zhang Yaping know. I need the Xin government to put pressure on the UA government. There's an interesting confession in my hands; it happens to belong to a CIB agent." Jiang Chen grinned. "It will be a breakthrough for us to blackmail the Capital."</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen stretched his body and looked at Zhu Yu lying on the other sofa.</br>
</br>
The Beta-4 drone provided her wounds with a simple treatment. It was hovering next to her after completing the task. Jiang Chen called the drone back through the holographic screen and threw it back to the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The drones downstairs were still hovering at the door to the hostage room, but there were no mercenaries alive left in the entire embassy. The power armor couldn't be disguised anymore and many rescued embassy staff would become suspicious about this. The reason why he wasn't in the embassy was also something that had to be kept a secret.</br>
</br>
Although there were a lot of problematic things, Jiang Chen knew Xia Shiyu would surely think of a solution for him.</br>
</br>
After dealing with the aftermath, while the outside world remained shocked by the situation inside the embassy, Jiang Chen had a phone conversation with the Capital.</br>
</br>
After the call was connected, Jiang Chen unceremoniously exerted dominance in the conversation and used a furious yet calm tone.</br>
</br>
"Madame Hill, I need an explanation for this attack."</br>
</br>
"I really am sorry for the incident that happened to you and the staff of your embassy, Mr. Jiang Chen. I understand your anger and pain, but please believe me - we were also the victims of terrorism. Forty UA citizens died in the attack. Some of them were police officers and citizens. They could be fathers of children, husbands of wives—"</br>
</br>
Although her tone was quite sincere, it undoubtedly avoided any responsibility and portrayed the UA as the victim. As a former secretary of state, Hill was undoubtedly a tough opponent on diplomatic issues.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen mercilessly interrupted her.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to listen to a recording first?" Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Hill paused for a moment and didn't understand what Jiang Chen meant.</br>
</br>
"I'll take that as a yes." Leaving this sentence, Jiang Chen opened the holographic screen of the watch and played the recording Penny obtained.</br>
</br>
(Wind)</br>
</br>
Ghost Agent: "What are you doing here?"</br>
</br>
Steven: "Just in case."</br>
</br>
Ghost Agent: "What do you mean by 'just in case'?"</br>
</br>
Steven: "Literally... if he comes, I will kill him. If he doesn't come, then the mission fails..."</br>
</br>
Ghost Agent: "Who is he?"</br>
</br>
Steven: "Your boss, Jiang Chen."</br>
</br>
When the recording was played halfway, Jiang Chen noticed that the breathing on the other side of the phone almost stopped. Half a minute after he turned off the recording, there wasn't a single word.</br>
</br>
The CIB was suspected of murdering foreign key personnel visiting and even colluded with terrorists. Once exposed, this scandal wouldn't only destroy the diplomatic credentials of the UA for decades, but it would even shake the foundation of the current federal government. If the Republican Party used this to challenge the current government, Hill might become the president with the shortest term of the UA in the century.</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen expected, it was a sufficient bargaining chip.</br>
</br>
With a curvature forming on his lips, Jiang Chen leaned back on the sofa, patiently waiting for Hill's reply.</br>
</br>
"If you don't remember Steven's name, I can help you out. His identity is the CIB's agent supervisor, belonging to the Ukrainian Action Group. Now, he's in our hands."</br>
</br>
With a long silence, Hill no longer avoided the question and said, "Be straightforward. What do you want?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
"When we were interrogating Steven, we learned an interesting piece of information. After attending the governor's party, he returned to the Capital. And after he came out of the CIB headquarters, he met a Jewish man and received a sum of money from him."</br>
</br>
"His name?" Hill asked.</br>
</br>
"I don't know." Jiang Chen shook his head. "As long as he is not stupid, he will not introduce himself to Steven."</br>
</br>
Hill said, "We can't convict someone because a Jewish man bribed him."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed and then continued.</br>
</br>
"Madame Hill, you have been in the Capital for too long. Is it still unclear? There are some things we don't need to prove at all. We just need to know who the enemy is."</br>
</br>
There was a brief silence.</br>
</br>
Seeing that she still did not provide a stance, Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"Since the beginning of the Thirteen Colonies, the forces of Freemasonry have been entrenched in the UA for too long. Its roots already permeate every inch of the country. Look at the current Europe and what they have done there. Since they were able to oust Merkel by special means yesterday, who can guarantee that Hill will not step down tomorrow? Think of what happened Kennedy, who was one of the few presidents in the history of the UA who was not part of the Freemasonry."</br>
</br>
"Just then, they launched a team of special forces to kill me, and even instigated a senior CIB official. If this did not go over the bottom line of your country, then I really feel sorry for you."</br>
</br>
After finishing this sentence, Jiang Chen stopped speaking. He knew that with the situation evolving to this point, the Capital would inevitably make a "correct" choice. Or rather, the money bag WASP Consortium behind Hill would make the right choice for her.</br>
</br>
Silence continued for a while, and Hill slowly began to speak.</br>
</br>
"I need to discuss this with my chief of staff."</br>
</br>
She must discuss this matter with someone.</br>
</br>
"I hope I can hear good news before dawn." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The terrorist attack that happened last night swept across the country like a tsunami. There was no terrorist organization that claimed to be responsible for the attack.</br>
</br>
However, instead of guessing who the attackers were, people were talking about who actually rescued the hostages in the embassy.</br>
</br>
When the "unknown force" hit the embassy, someone captured what happened with their phone. Although the short one-frame scene appeared blurry, people could still clearly distinguish that it was not a missile, but a humanoid steel armor!</br>
</br>
When they saw photos, many people climaxed.</br>
</br>
Most of them were fans of Iron Man.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that Iron Man really existed. And just a few streets next to Hollywood?</br>
</br>
"...Based on the number of camera frames and the analysis of the picture, the speed of a falling humanoid object should be above the speed of sound, or at least close to the speed of sound. Perhaps it was another technology from Future Group? After all, from my personal knowledge, I have not heard of a weapon that could be deployed at this speed through hard landing. If the steel armor is piloted by a person, striking the ground at the speed of sound would undoubtedly break it the person into pieces...if there is no protection." A military expert analyzed.</br>
</br>
</br>
"... An Army Captain, who did not want to be named, said in an interview after the attack. The Capital urgently mobilized a company of force from the nearby military base. The unit was from Area 51 at the junction of California and Nevada. According to informed sources, the mysterious steel armor may be a secret weapon developed by the Pentagon." Colombia reported.</br>
</br>
"The hostages have been confirmed to be safe. After the security confirmation by the Los Santos Police Department, they already lifted the blockade on Venice Street. At present, the Xin Embassy has not accepted any interview with reporters. The FBA requested to enter the embassy for investigation, but Xin has not approved the FBA's request for the time being," The New York Times reported.</br>
</br>
However, while people were discussing with enthusiasm about "the one that saved the hostages," a financial earthquake had quietly begun.</br>
</br>
The source was located on Wall Street, from Goldman Sachs Group headquarters.</br>
</br>
When people stepped onto Wall Street, they discovered that Goldman Sachs Group's building was surrounded by FBA personnel and police cars. Shortly afterwards, Goldman Sachs Group CEO Lloyd Blankfein was handcuffed and assisted out of the Goldman Sachs building in a low-key manner. Then he was taken away in a FBA's car.</br>
</br>
Subsequently, the Capital issued relevant announcements and launched investigation procedures for Goldman Sachs with a total of 17 charges including financial fraud. Subsequently, the Capital held a press conference to explain the legality of the investigation process.</br>
</br>
Goldman Sachs Group definitely would not concede. It immediately issued an announcement on its official website about a press conference, accusing the Capital's decision to be without legal ground, and claimed that these 17 counts were supported by false evidence. In addition, Goldman Sachs Group's lawyer team would actively respond to all accusations.</br>
</br>
The Capital's move also alerted Congress.</br>
</br>
The Goldman Sachs Group belonged to the two major families of Goldman and Sachs, both of whom were of Germanic Jewish descendants and were linked by a marriage relationship. The name of the Goldman Sachs Group was derived from the names of the two big families. After the Second World War, the two families started to show differences and the Sachs family became the actual controller of the Goldman Sachs Group.</br>
</br>
The Sachs family was one of the leaders of the North American Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
The Capital's attack on the Freemasonry at this point in time made it impossible for people not to relate it to the tragedy that happened at the West Coast last night.</br>
</br>
The Goldman Sachs Group was being investigated and the entire Wall Street was rattled.</br>
</br>
No financial group had a clean record, but since everyone was part of a country governed by law, everything must be determined by law and evidence. The UA Department of Justice, without conclusive evidence, used the FBA to apprehend the CEO of Goldman Sachs. There was no doubt the FBA had violated regulations.</br>
</br>
The Goldman Sachs lawyer team was ready to respond, and was even ready to sue the Justice Department. In a country where power was divided into three pillars, as long as the best lawyers were hired, black could be turned into white. Goldman Sachs had complete confidence that it could win this lawsuit.</br>
</br>
However, the real battlefield was not in court.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether the charges were true or not, the scandal involving alleged fraud by a world-famous financial group had triggered a credit crisis that shook its stock price and it even spread the effect to the entire financial community. On the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the same day, the Goldman Sachs Group, with a market value of 70 billion US Dollar, plummeted, sharply pulling down the Dow Jones Index by three percent.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Morgan Stanley, another big investment bank in the UA, immediately began the acquisition of Goldman Sachs Group and its assets. Some financial analysts commented that if the Department of Justice gave the nod to the merger and purchased Goldman Sachs. A never-seen-before financial giant may be created on Wall Street.</br>
</br>
Also interested in Goldman Sachs was Future Bank. While Morgan Stanley was acquiring Goldman Sachs Group, Futures Bank North America Subsidiary also began to increase its shares of Goldman Sachs Group.</br>
</br>
The entire Goldman Sachs Group was pushed to the edge of the cliff, and the Sachs family's control of the financial empire had fallen to a precarious level.</br>
</br>
People aware of the situation could clearly see that Future Group and the North American WASP Consortium no longer disguised their desire and revealed their claws against the Jewish Consortium. If Goldman Sachs falls, Wall Street would undoubtedly face a reshuffling at an unprecedented scale.</br>
</br>
Many people sensed something unusual.</br>
</br>
The sky was about to change.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 892"/>

<div class="caption">Chapter 892: You should feel honored</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The tragedy on Venice Street cast a gloom over the bright skyline, but people's lives were not greatly affected. The streets of Los Santos were still bustling, but something seemed missing from the usual propersity. The waves of the financial tsunami from East Coast already arrived on the shaky West Coast.</br>
</br>
Revolving around Morgan Stanley's merger and acquisition plan for Goldman Sachs, financial markets throughout North America and even the rest of the world were restless. The originally turbulent crude oil market was already dragging down the global economy, and now the financial turmoil on Wall Street has pushed the crisis to its peak.</br>
</br>
For the WASP Consortium, it was a golden opportunity. Since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, only one investment bank was left that supported the influence of Freemasonry on Wall Street. If the Goldman Sachs Group was to be acquired by Morgan Stanley, then North America wouldreturn to the Anglo-Saxon embrace and send the unwelcomed Jews back to Europe.</br>
</br>
From the budding of the financial industry in North America three hundred years ago, the conflict between Jews and Protestants was already the fuse for conflicts between the two sides. Although both parties had reached an agreement, the competition and hostility between them never changed.</br>
</br>
If it were before, the UA Department of Justice would absolutely not allow Morgan Stanley to complete the acquisition of Goldman Sachs Group. A united Wall Street was not in the interests of the federal government. Even if Hill's campaign funds were partially supported by the Morgan family, the relationship between them was not one of superior and subordinate but a cooperative one. The president would seek benefits for the "sponsor", but there was the premise, that it must be within a reasonable range. The two sides maintained an unspoken understanding of cooperation and competition and formed the North American campaign ecology...</br>
</br>
However, the emergence of Future Group tipped the balance.</br>
</br>
The CIB participated in the Los Santos attack, forcing the federal government in an awkward position. If Jiang Chen made the evidence public, the federal government must face not only the condemnation of the international community but also domestic pressure.</br>
</br>
After all, it was not just the securities of Xin Embassy that died. There were civilians, FBA agents, Los Santos police, and even the CIB's own agents. The Republican Party was eyeing the president's position. If Hill could not handle the aftermath of this incident, she would likely face impeachment from Congress…</br>
</br>
Therefore, under the influence of external factors, the Ministry of Justice acquiesced with Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisition plan.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen proposed for Future Bank to acquire Goldman Sachs, the Capital would certainly not agree. However, since the acquisition was from Morgan Stanley, Hill kept an eye open and an eye closed. Although the ownership of the company had changed, it was still in the hands of UA Citizens.</br>
</br>
</br>
The merger and acquisition plan was for up to 50 billion US Dollars, and the assets involved were in the 100 billion range.</br>
</br>
Even the Morgan family could not digest the astronomical amount of assets alone. Many investment banks, including First B City Bank and Brown Brother Harriman Bank, sent representatives to contact partners at Goldman Sachs to gain a share in this robbery.</br>
</br>
Future Group did not stand on the sideline. Futures Bank CEO David Smith immediately flew to New York City after receiving a call from Jiang Chen. As a former Citibank executive, mergers and acquisitions were his expertise.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave him a budget of 5 billion US Dollars to acquire as much of Goldman Sachs' assets or share as possible.</br>
</br>
The CEO was investigated and the FBA's vehicles surrounded the headquarters of the group. The investor's panic mood was reflected in the freefalling stock price. In order to control the ownership of Goldman Sachs, the Freemasonry was forced to sell assets to obtain liquidity and buy back stocks from the wavering shareholders.</br>
</br>
The financial market was filled with chaos. Outside the financial sector, there was also mayhem.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Capital did not ask too much about what hit the embassy on that day. However, major UA media showed strong interest. CBS parked a team in front of the Xin Embassy and waited for the mysterious hero who was wearing the "iron and steel armor" to appear.</br>
</br>
However, they were going to be disappointed.</br>
</br>
Because the main building of the embassy was seriously damaged, there were still a few days before the start of the Summit. Jiang Chen resided in the Hilton Hotel in San Francisco. Because this was done secretly, he did not attract the attention of media reporters when he left.</br>
</br>
It was already a few days later when the media realized that Jiang Chen was not there.</br>
</br>
"The biggest individual shareholder of the Goldman Sachs Group, Stephen Sachs, was found dead in his home. The cause of death was a bullet in the head. At present, the FBA has been involved in the investigation and initially confirmed that the suspect is a middle-aged man. He was arrested and jailed for burglary in 2013 and was a repairman at a car repair company after his release."</br>
</br>
As if he was deliberately reading it to Jiang Chen, Lawrence, sitting in the driving seat, took the newspaper and read it casually when Jiang Chen stepped into the vehicle.</br>
</br>
"Oh my. What a sad story," Jiang Chen put on his seat belt and said nonchalantly.</br>
</br>
"Was it you?" Lawrence glanced at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
According to pieces of evidence gathered by the FBA, weapons and equipment used by Cham may be provided by the Sachs family. The Jewish businessman who had previously been in contact with Steven was probably a member of the Sachs family.</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen looked at Lawrence's skeptical expression and smiled. "My dear friend, why do you think I did it? In fact, with a dispute involving hundreds of billions of dollars of interest, there is no need for me to do anything. They will do everything for me."</br>
</br>
Lawrence did not respond and defaulted to Jiang Chen's explanation. He put the newspaper aside and started the car.</br>
</br>
The traces of bullet holes were still visible on Venice Street, but the broken shop windows were replaced with new ones. The dark burn marks in the middle of the road were cleaned and repainted. The car left Venice Street and headed toward San Francisco.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu and Zhu Yu were in another car, and four black vehicles surrounded them from all four sides.</br>
</br>
Compared to a few days ago, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that the security level had been at least doubled. Obviously, the UA did not plan to be embarrassed twice, let alone at the last moment.</br>
</br>
However, security work was not to be blamed for the last attack. If it weren't for Steven to weaken the security around the embassy, with just a dozen mercenaries, they wouldn't even be able to touch the door of the embassy.</br>
</br>
Soon the vehicles arrived at the airport.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen stepped out, Lawrence said.</br>
</br>
"Right, someone asked me to tell you something."</br>
</br>
"What is it?"</br>
</br>
"At noon yesterday, the Director of CIB, Naomi Madden, submitted his resignation." When he said this, Lawrence stared into Jiang Chen's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Maybe I should be happy?" Jiang Chen mocked Lawrence.</br>
</br>
"You should feel honored that at least two CIB directors resigned because of you."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged.</br>
</br>
He agreed with Lawrence very much.</br>
</br>
Especially the choice of words "at least".</br>
</br>
Presumably, in the near future, there would be plenty of opportunities for the two parties to mingle with each other.</br>

</br>
Silicon Valley Summit commenced as scheduled. Because of the participation of Future Group, the summit was added with a flavor of leading-edge technology.</br>
</br>
Although the organizer previously considered the impact of the terrorist attack and had the thought of canceling the summit, after consultation with the parties involved, the summit filled with high expectations, commenced.</br>
</br>
In the exhibition, Future Group reached an import and export agreement of graphene materials with 117 large and medium enterprises and established Coro island as the trading hub for global graphene materials.</br>
</br>
In addition, Future Group acquired a pharmaceutical company in Silicon Valley for 5.1 billion US Dollars and the company would be be responsible for the sales of the Beta-4 drone in North America after restructuring with Future Medicine.</br>
</br>
In cloud technology, Future Group also garnered great results.</br>
</br>
A total of 171 tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, entered into a supercomputer lease agreement with Future Group, relying on quantum satellite transmission speeds to obtain information processing services provided by the Supercomputing Center on Coro Island. In terms of cost, the Coro Island Supercomputing Center was only half of the cost of the Silicon Valley Supercomputer Center.</br>
</br>
Perhaps Future Group's direct income was similar to the two companies, but the market prospect was substantially greater.</br>
</br>
With the gradual increase in the popularity of the Internet, cloud technology was the trend of the future.</br>
</br>
In the near future, there would be fewer and fewer personal servers, and even the vast majority of work would be done on the cloud. Maybe someday in the future, a CPU or even a computer won't be needed, only a browser would be needed to enjoy high performance service.</br>
</br>
Strictly speaking, the Phantom helmet was an application of cloud technology.</br>
</br>
The three-day Silicon Valley Summit ended. Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu returned to Los Santos. The trip to the UA was nearing its end. Before returning to Xin, "The Time Curtain" co-produced with Warner Bros. hit the theater and the premiere was held at the China Grand Theatre in Hollywood.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen originally also planned to walk the red carpet, but since Time Warner and Future Group both invested a lot of promotional resources and the premiere event was bound to be quite chaotic, for security reasons, Jiang Chen gave up on the idea. Instead, he immediately boarded a plane returning to Xin.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The Gulfstream aircraft took off from Los Santos International Airport. Jiang Chen looked at the city disappearing in the distance and felt relieved</br>
</br>
The battle with the North American Freemasonry forces was not yet over, but he himself was not suitable to stay there any longer. The WASP Consortium gained the upper hand. Although the old European consortiums like the Rothschild extended a helping hand, the UA obviously would never allow these European consortiums to tap into Wall Street.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Freemasonry forces in North America declined to the lowest in history. Unwilling to succumb behind the scenes, they already alarmed the UA.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen, it was also the best time to get rid of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
When he returned to Xin, the European mission would begin.</br>
</br>
Sitting opposite of Jiang Chen, Xia Shiyu looked at Jiang Chen, who was immersed in thought, and showed confusion for the fourth time in her eyes.</br>
</br>
When the embassy was captured by terrorists, she thought she was dead. However, when she saw Jiang Chen wearing a power armor come alone to save her, she only felt the softness in her heart that had been buried for a long time once again be touched.</br>
</br>
Perhaps the love for romance was the nature of every woman, or maybe it was just because work occupied her heart for too long. Recalling that night, when she expressed herself after being drunk, her face began to blush.</br>
</br>
Only if she could maintain that state forever...</br>
</br>
Confusion gradually faded from her eyes, Xia Shiyu suddenly woke up and shook her head repeatedly to drive the unhealthy thought out of her mind.</br>
</br>
[No, he already has a girlfriend...]</br>
</br>
If she was to become a mistress, disregarding that she won't be able to accept the fact herself, her parents certainly won't accept this.</br>
</br>
[What's more, he has been avoiding...]</br>
</br>
When she thought about this, her heart could not help but feel sour. Although Jiang Chen did not do anything or say anything, the sensitivity of the woman made her feel faintly aware that he had been avoiding her feelings. She had noticed this when they were in Wanghai.</br>
</br>
With a bizarre expression, Jiang Chen saw her blushing, shaking her head, and then feeling conflicted. He didn't know what kind of thoughts were in her mind.</br>
</br>
After thinking about it, Jiang Chen asked in a concerned voice.</br>
</br>
"Do you feel okay?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's sudden words made Xia Shiyu, who was in the middle of a bewildered thought, jump up. She wanted to say something but nothing came out of her mouth.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen became more and more convinced that his guess was correct, then he stood up.</br>
</br>
"I'll help you get some motion sickness pills."</br>
</br>
However, as he was prepared to leave the seat, Xia Shiyu grabbed his cuffs and responded to Jiang Chen's caring gaze with, "I'm fine."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said, "Are you really okay? You don't look so okay."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gently bit her lower lip, after indulging in a long silence, she whispered out the words that did not coincide with the situation.</br>
</br>
"...Why did you come to save me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen paused for a second, then laughed.</br>
</br>
"Do you need a reason?"</br>
</br>
"But they were targeting you! If..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen interrupted Xia Shiyu's slightly emotional words.</br>
</br>
"No one can act with indifference when an important person to them is in danger. I just did what I wanted to do."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu could no longer distinguish the latter part of the sentence.</br>
</br>
At this moment, her head was buzzing.</br>
</br>
This feeling was like her heart and soul being immersed in sweet honey, and her long-buried feelings finally received a response.</br>
</br>
[Important person…]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After getting off the plane, Ayesha rushed into Jiang Chen's arms and only let go of him after a long time. The two sapphire eyes that could speak were filled with worry and longing.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen rubbed her soft chestnut hair and kissed her on her forehead.</br>
</br>
"Sorry to have worried you."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's had a complicated look on her face.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen kissed Ayesha forehead, that nasty feeling was back.</br>
</br>
In order to make herself feel better, she quietly looked way.</br>
</br>
What she did not notice, however, was that her little trick had already been spotted by a little girl.</br>
</br>
The sapphire-like eyes moved back and forth several times between Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu. A sweet smile suddenly appeared on Ayesha's face.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, who sensed Ayesha's gaze, subconsciously looked to her. However, for some strange reasons, the curvature of her lips made her heart beat faster. It was like a child who did something wrong was discovered by an adult.</br>
</br>
Their eyes only met for less than one second before her eyes fled and looked toward Jiang Chen, who was shaking hands with President Zhang.</br>
</br>
It took her a while before she hid away the unnatural emotions in her.</br>
</br>
Based on Jiang Chen's request, the Xin government did not make a grand appearance, but President Zhang Yaping personally came to the airport. It was not only Zhang Yaping who came to the airport, but also other political leaders of Xin and members of the Liberal Party. It took a while just to shake hands with everyone.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen was busy interacting, Ayesha quietly walked to Xia Shiyu and whispered in her ear.</br>
</br>
"Can you come with me?"</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 894: Great Synagogue</br>
</div></br>
</br>
For most foreigners, the name Pilsner may be unfamiliar. However, when it comes to Pilsner beer, many people would surely have heard the name.</br>
</br>
Pilsner is a distinctive town compared to many other towns in the Czech Republic. Known for its architectural or medieval monuments, it was a metropolitan area located in the western region of Czech Republic. Famous for the automotive and the beer industry, it was where one of the three most famous Czech beers originated and the place of production for the famous Skoda in Eastern Europe.</br>
</br>
Most of these industries were assets of the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
And the assets totalling more than one billion dollars included the world-famous Great Synagogue. Although almost destroyed in the hands of the Nazis in World War II, more than half a century later, this ancient church was repaired. While some marks of history disappeared, the appearance was no different than the past.</br>
</br>
In the synagogue, Jewish people were praying. The bearded Cantor gentled caressed the Torah in his hand and read the unknown prayers in Hebrew. Brass-colored candle holders were engraved into the ancient wall and candles swayed with flickering lights.</br>
</br>
There was a heavy wooden door behind the synagogue. Underneath the door handle, an illuminati eye the size of a thumb was engraved onto the surface. Passing through the wooden door, a spiral corridor with dry stone steps led to underneath the ground. At the end of the corridor was a wine cellar with a stone wall on the side. The stone wall couldn't be opened from the outside, and the door would open only if the password matched.</br>
</br>
After passing through the stone door, the claustrophobic feeling suddenly disappeared, and the underground of the church became open again. Persian rug worth more than the price of gold and diamond stretched over the length of the floor. The hallway was decorated by mahogany wood carvings, and on the table were ancient silverwares, all of which highlighted the luxury of this place.</br>
</br>
This was the heart of the synagogue and the heart of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
At the end of the hall was a conference room. The door was open, and a young man stood at the door. There should have been two people standing there, but one of them decided to stay in North America forever. Now there was only one.</br>
</br>
When a secret meeting was held, they were the guardians of the Covenant.</br>
</br>
When they were needed by the secret meeting, they would become the hounds that seeked vengeance.</br>
</br>
There were only few times in history they were sent out for mission, but they rarely failed. The more famous ones were Kennedy and 115 related witnesses, and the hero of the Civil War, Lincoln. These assassinations were masterpieces of their work.</br>
</br>
However, coincidentally, they only missed three times in a century.</br>
</br>
Except for the head of state who conquered Europe, the other two were all Chinese.</br>
</br>
At the conference table, thirteen Level 33 members of the Freemasonry were already seated around the table. The lord who sat at the top of the table glanced around and his eyes stopped on the "stranger", who took a seat on the chair that belonged to the Rothschild family.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Where is Carmen?"</br>
</br>
"He's in Sweden and he can't make this meeting." James Rothschild crossed his fingers on the table and the gold ring on his fingers glittered under the candles. "My dear brother asked me to represent the Rothschilds at this meeting. He has finally realized my value."</br>
</br>
The immediate blood of the thirteen families were automatically Level 33 members, but just like Level 33 members did not just belong to the members of the thirteen largest families, not all Level 33 members were eligible to attend this meeting.</br>
</br>
Only the owners or heirs of the thirteen families could speak at the conference table.</br>
</br>
Several members at the conference table exchanged looks with each other and saw strange expressions in each other's eyes.</br>
</br>
The Rothschild family was the leader of the European consortium, James Rothschild, of course, was not an unfamiliar name. As the youngest son of the Rothschild, Mr. James also received a certain degree of inheritance rights. However, compared to his brother, James' talent was not particularly outstanding, or that his talent was not in the family business, but on women's belly. Even though he repeatedly tried to prove that his talent, people could see the difference between James and Carmen.</br>
</br>
Just from the undisguised proudness on James' face, the talents of the two were not on the same level.</br>
</br>
Not keeping his eyes on him for too long, the Lord put the focus back on the meeting.</br>
</br>
"I believe that you must have known before coming. Our compatriots' actions in North America have failed."</br>
</br>
The expressions on everyone's faces were not pleasant, except for the one representative that just received permission to participate in the meeting, Mr. James, who was eager to prove his worth in front of his allies.</br>
</br>
As soon as the Lord finished speaking, James Rothschild immediately stood up and began to speak in an aspiring tone.</br>
</br>
"Gentlemen, this is not the time to be depressed. We should formulate more effective plans to kill the threat that is threatening us in its cradle. I propose that we should directly attack Coro Island, which is the foundation of Future Group. As long we promote hatred to Future Group among the people of Xin, we will be able to nurture pro-Europe forces in Xin, create riots, and let Future Group be consumed in a civil war..."</br>
</br>
The Krupp family representative, who was sitting across from James, frowned slightly and looked at the Bruce family representative next to him. They each saw a bit of helplessness in each other's eyes.</br>
</br>
[Creating riots? It's easier said than done.]</br>
</br>
The Future Group has unimaginable prestige in Xin. The Freemasonry certainly considered the option of transporting refugees to Xin to drag down the country's economy, and to shake the foundation that allowed Future Group to maintain its monopoly position.</br>
</br>
However, the Xin government did not like the idea at all. Or rather, Asia, who shared a strong patriotic view, never believed the idea that their country must save everyone around the world. Even in their past attempts to convince human rights organizations to protest, the Xin government never took them seriously.</br>
</br>
The Level 33 member meeting was not the company's regular morning meeting. This impassioned speech did not make any sense. The meeting's focus was to discuss how to deal with the decline of the Freemasonry North America forces and the rise of the WASP Consortium fueled by the Morgan family's acquisition of Goldman Sachs Group.</br>
</br>
The other side already used the dirtiest tactic of assassination. Obviously it planned to settle the grudge with the North American Jewish Consortium and no longer considered the consequences. If the Goldman Sachs Group was acquired by Morgan Stanley, it would signal that the Freemasonry is kicked out of Wall Street, and the effect on their assets in North America would be incalculable!</br>
</br>
However, they had no rights to say this, after all, they were the first ones to use the assassination tactic.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Rothschild, that's enough." The Lord smiled and nodded to James. He gestured and signaled him to sit back down.</br>
</br>
Although James still wanted to say something, the Lord had already spoken. James, who was about to continue his speech with his mouth already open, decided to stop. He shrugged and sat back down.</br>
</br>
"We should discuss some more constructive issues. Allies in North America need our support. The trouble now is the UA government. If the Foreign Investment Commission insists on delineating our capital, the Sachs family will have a hard time resisting the siege from the WASP Consortium." The Krupp family representative stood up, looked at his allies, and spoke in a serious tone, "We can start with the WTO and accuse the UA of protectionism in the takeover of Goldman Sachs Group and barriers to investors from Europe."</br>
</br>
"As long as European capitals can enter Wall Street, it is not difficult to keep Goldman Sachs. Lehman Brothers' tragedy cannot be repeated!"</br>
</br>
"As for Future Group, we can try to contact them and release peaceful signals. Russia is pressing harder on the Ukrainian issue. North American allies have been hit hard. Now is not the best time to deal with them. We can put them aside first and use the European market as a bait, they have no reason to refuse us."</br>
</br>
Including the honored Lord, the representatives of the families present all nodded.</br>
</br>
The European Consortium accumulated wealth for centuries. It wouldn't be a difficult task to spare billions to keep the Goldman Sachs Group alive. The minerals held by the major mining giants in the world were calculated to be worth trillions of dollars.</br>
</br>
As for Future Group, as long as it was a business, who would say no to money? Although there were some "little" unpleasantness between the two sides, the frictions between the two parties already existed. Since Future Group chose to remain silent before, there was no reason to believe they would make a different choice this time.</br>
</br>
Just throw a bait, and perhaps they could convince Future Group to join forces...</br>
</br>
"I agree with Mr. Krupp's proposal."</br>
</br>
"I oppose. We have already decided to take a different path with Future Group. If we make concessions at this point, they may not necessarily accept our good intentions."</br>
</br>
"We can release a peaceful signal first with the goal to stabilize Future Group, or Russia. It is not wise to face too many enemies at the same time. We must first solve our North American issue, and then consider the others."</br>
</br>
"We can't give up on the assassination against Jiang Chen, but next time we have to be more secretive! As long as Future Group doesn't have him, the group is nothing at all."</br>
</br>
Although there were controversial voices at the conference table, most family representatives still expressed their support for the Krupp family's proposal.</br>
</br>
James looked at the representative of the Krupp family and a trace of disdain quickly disappeared from his eyes.</br>
</br>
He could clearly feel that everyone around the table were contemptuous of him. In their eyes, only his nasty brother mattered and they did not take him seriously at all.</br>
</br>
[These idiots don't know that I also Have inheritance rights! Why can't I receive the respect that should have belonged to him?]</br>
</br>
He didn't pay attention to the discussions after. His thoughts already drifted elsewhere.</br>
</br>
As he was zoning out, he suddenly smelled something unusual.</br>
</br>
As if something was burning...</br>
</br>

</br>
"They did it?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"I see."</br>
</br>
Carmen Rothschild hung up the phone, then tossed it on the table. He picked up the goblet full of red wine on the table, and cast his sights on the garden outside. It just snowed. The edge of the window was dotted with fine cones of ice, the white fluffy scene in the garden perfectly painted the serenity of the season.</br>
</br>
It was Rothschild's manor in Finland.</br>
</br>
Yes, he was not in Sweden, but in Northern Europe.</br>
</br>
Just half an hour ago, a fire broke out in the Pilsner Church in Czech Republic. The 13 Level 33 members of the Freemasonry were all killed during their secret meeting.</br>
</br>
Looking at the reflection on the window, Carmen's finger tapped on the glass, he listened to the crisp sound, but his thought already drifted elsewhere.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, his instinct was correct.</br>
</br>
The Future Group possessed a special interrogation method. With consideration of its leading position in neural connection technology, it was possible for Future Group to directly scan the brain of the interrogated person through a device similar to a Phantom helmet.</br>
</br>
When Cham failed in North America, he realized that the Freemasonry assembly was already exposed. Even if the Gatekeeper was loyal, and combined with news reports also indicating that he was killed at the scene, Carmen still prepared for the worst.</br>
</br>
With a sigh, Carmen drank the red wine and twirled the remaining wine in the glass. A smile suddenly appeared on his face. He fixed on his own reflection and muttered to himself quietly.</br>
</br>
"It's fine."</br>
</br>
He could have also guessed that this defeat would surely contribute to the emergence of reconciliation between the Freemasonry and Future Group.</br>
</br>
Although the 13 families were united because of common interests, as long as they were businessmen, they would weigh the pros and cons. However, it would be naive to reactive. People always repeat the same mistakes. In World War II they already made the mistake once. If it weren't for their North American ally, they might have already vanished in the dust of history.</br>
</br>
[It's fine.]</br>
</br>
For a family like Rothschild, the death of an heir or the owner of the family would only cause temporary problems. A machine is never scrapped because of a broken gear. Even if he died, the Rothschild wouldn't just fade away in history like this.</br>
</br>
[As long as all of the direct family has not passed away, the death of an heir of the thirteen families dying is no different from the death of the president.]</br>
</br>
[If hatred can annihilate all unrealistic ideas and reunite the shaken senior Freemasonry into one force, the cost of the thirteen lives is nothing.]</br>
</br>
Of course, Carmen also admitted his own selfishness here.</br>
</br>
His brother James Rothschild was always reluctant to just be an honest wealthy man and showed enthusiasm for family affairs that did not conform to his identity. It was great that he disappeared through the hands of the Future Group.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Johnson, its time to go."</br>
</br>
After finishing the remaining wine in the glass, Carmen put the empty glass on the window sill and turned to the door.</br>
</br>
His bodyguard, Johnson, stood in the doorway like a statue. There was no expression on his dark face. When Carmen passed by, he turned and followed him.</br>
</br>
"Where are we going?"</br>
</br>
"Going to Europe to clean up the mess."</br>
</br>
[Also, to take back the position of the Lord.]</br>
</br>
He put on a coat and stepped into the blizzard. Behind him, it was the manor in the northern hinterland. He walked towards the garage, and Johnson followed closely behind him. The snow drifting in the northern breeze even tainted his pupils, and there was no extraneous expression on his defined face.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"It was a success?"</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"I see."</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen was relieved.</br>
</br>
After obtaining the assembly of Freemasonry from Cham, he first announced the end to the hostage crisis to the outside world, and released the news that dozens of terrorists, including Cham, were shot on the spot to paralyze the alertness of the Freemasonry.</br>
</br>
Then the Ghost Agents stationed in Europe immediately headed to Czech Republic, arranged agents near the Pilsner Church, and closely monitored the movement of the Freemasonry members. Finally this morning, the Freemasonry held a secret meeting. Ghost agents who took advantage of the opportunity took a decisive action to destroy the entire church in a sea of ​​fire...</br>
</br>
"Did something good happen?" Kelvin looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"You can say that." Putting away his phone, Jiang Chen focused back on the big screen at the Space Launch Center. When he learned that the space elevator project had made major progress, he didn't even go home to take a shower but instead rushed here.</br>
</br>
From the cameras, a group of Pioneer robots were connected by graphene cables and quietly floating in synchronous orbit. They surrounded a giant ring and systematically carried out construction operations.</br>
</br>
The entire space station was already starting to take its shape. The ring acting as the counterweight was completed, as the graphene track approached completion, the ring would gradually move outwards, keeping the center of gravity of the entire space elevator in the synchronized orbit.</br>
</br>
"With the help of Pioneer robots, our construction speed is much faster. The rockets launched into space no longer need to carry supplies, which saves a large capacity for the Space Launch Center and saves a great chunck of the budget for the entire project." Looking at the magnificent project on the screen, Kelvin was full of proudness.</br>
</br>
"I only care about how long it will take to finish this whole thing," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"The space station is 90% completed, and the graphene tracks has all been transported to outer space. After the space station is complete, the tracks can gradually be connected ​​to the space station. Latest, by mid-December, the entire space elevator will be complete! "Kelvin responded with excitement.</br>
</br>
[In mid-December. At most one and a half months?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded pleasingly.</br>
</br>
Once this "highway" was complete, Celestial Trade's space colonization plan would fully commence.</br>
</br>
The current lunar colony expanded to a scale of 50 people, which doubled from a month ago. The moon ice exploration wells and moon acquisition stations deployed on the outskirts of the colony has also expanded. According to information provided to Jiang Chen by the scientists in the colony, they have already designed a set of helium-3 collection programs. At present, the reserves of helium-3 in the colonies have already reached two kilograms, and if they were all used to generate electricity, it would be enough to power Xin four years.</br>
</br>
In addition, Kelvin also brought another piece of good news to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The first bok choy grown on the moon farm has matured, and the fresh vegatable was placed on the dinner table of the moon colonists. This breakthrough meant that the colony reached the first stage of self-sufficiency. Although at present, it was quite difficult to completely be independent from imports, this breakthrough was undoubtedly exciting enough.</br>
</br>
People could take their footprints further. And going further is no longer just a dream...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 896: Tinder Nuclear Fusion Reactor</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave the launch center instructions for the next steps. In the next supply mission to the Moon, the rocket would be loaded with a "Tinder" nuclear fusion reactor on the rocket.</br>
</br>
The so-called "Tinder" was the model of the five nuclear fusion generators operating in the power center of Penglai. After integrating the technology from Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant, the production of "Tinder" nuclear fusion generator was succesfully implemented in the Sixth Street.</br>
</br>
In fact, for the modern world, the difficulty of this nuclear fusion generator was mainly in the materials. With 21st century materials, it could hardly withstand tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of degrees of high temperature. For a nuclear fusion reaction to take place between helium-3 and tritium, the temperature must be maintained at tens of millions of degrees.</br>
</br>
"Tinder" nuclear fusion power generating unit used a cold fusion technology. The core temperature was only 4,000-10,000 degrees. With the special materials from the apocalypse, it could allow reactions between the helium-3 and tritium to take place and allow stable amount of power to be generated.</br>
</br>
Limited by the production process, the "Tinder" generator could currently only be completed in the Sixth Street. However, the demand for "Tinder" was not high, and Jiang Chen currently did not plan to move the production process to the modern world in order to increase production capability.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen left the center, it was starting to get dark.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen called Ayesha and said that he would come back later. After finishing dinner at the cafeteria, he boarded the returning yacht.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When he returned home, it was already nine in the evening.</br>
</br>
Ayesha seemed to have fallen asleep, judging by the dimmed lights in the mansion. Natasha returned to Russia for a trip and she was not at in the mansion these days.</br>
</br>
Even with his body injected with genetic vaccines, after having just stepped off the plane and running errands for a whole day, he did feel some tiredness. He originally planned to go to the office to read some books, but without the energy, he gave up that plan.</br>
</br>
"Forget it, it's already this late, time to go to bed."</br>
</br>
Yawning, Jiang Chen did not turn on the lights up again and went to the second floor bathroom.</br>
</br>
He turned on the faucet and the water began to splash.</br>
</br>
Comfortably taking a shower, Jiang Chen felt his exhaustion being washed away and he seemed to be back alive again. After drying himself, he put on a set of loose pajamas. Then he walked out of the bathroom feeling full of energy, even humming a son while walking back to his room.</br>
</br>
He pushed open the door and was ready to turn on the lights when saw there was someone on the bed.</br>
</br>
Seeing this scene, he was smiling.</br>
</br>
This little girl already showered and was waiting for him in bed. She couldn't wait any longer?</br>
</br>
</br>
He didn't see Ayesha for more than a week already, his lower abdomen also began to feel heated and dispersed his fatigue from bottom to top. Whenever he thought of her gentleness and intimacy, no matter how many times, he just wanted to hold her tight and give her his tenderness…</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wanted to give her a surprise. With a grin, he quietly sneaked into the bed, took off his clothes, and reached to the corner of the quilt, and moved closer to the figure on the bed.</br>
</br>
There was a murmur from inside the sheets. Jiang Chen smiled and gently reached out. He "explored" and "moved forward" in darkness.</br>
</br>
Just then Jiang Chen paused and was confused.</br>
</br>
[Huh? Why does is it feel different?]</br>
</br>
As if to confirm Jiang Chen's speculation, a short and suppressed pout came from underneath him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was surprised, his sat up from the bed and then opened the bedside curtains.</br>
</br>
With a swoosh, the curtains opened.</br>
</br>
The moonlight scattered through the window and was sprinkled between the two.</br>
</br>
The serene and graceful waist was as smooth as silk under the bright moonlight. The timid rabbits were subtle but cast a subtle seduction. The delicate neck was white and soft, and the face flushed. The two brows were like crescents in the sky, and the teeth gently bit into the lower lip.</br>
</br>
However, it was obviously not the right time to enjoy the scene.</br>
</br>
Even if the light was not bright, Jiang Chen discovered that the person below was not Ayesha. And in his impression, Ayesha never had the habit of sleeping naked…</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's lips trembled slightly, looking at the eyes inches from her, with the gradually heavy breathing, her heart pumped rapidly.</br>
</br>
After getting off the plane in the morning, she did not go home directly. Instead, she went to the Future Building to deal with the things accumulated during the week. Not only was she tired from work, but after the conversation with Ayesha when she landed, she was so confused and conflicted that she didn't even eat dinner and she passed out after taking a shower.</br>
</br>
Before going to Los Santos, she moved in here, but Ayesha hadn't had time to prepare a room for her. She just looked for an empty room and because she was too tired, she did not think too much and went in.</br>
</br>
What a coincidence…</br>
</br>
If she were to blame someone, it was Ayesha who kept the room too tidy. At first glance, it didn't look like someone lived there.</br>
</br>
It was not just Xia Shiyu whose mind stopped working.</br>
</br>
When his sight met her sight, he forgot how to speak. The phrase "sorry" got stuck in his throat and could not come out. Rationality told him that he should first come down from her and explain the misunderstanding. However, human beings are never purely rational creatures. Rather, it's sensuousness that drives human behavior.</br>
</br>
And impulse...</br>
</br>
Sniffing that faint fragrance, under the influence of the scene, Jiang Chen slowly leaned into that beautiful face.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's expression was a bit conflicted.</br>
</br>
In the conflicted state, it contained expectations, contained resistance, and contained confusion...</br>
</br>
She admitted that she has feelings for Jiang Chen... No, it was like, or even love. Even if she resisted at the bottom of her heart and tried to forget it countless times, she could not completely remove it from her heart.</br>
</br>
However, just as she gently closed her quivering lashes and prepared to hand over everything to Jiang Chen, the gradually approaching breathing began to move away.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu slowly opened her eyes.</br>
</br>
There was a trace of confusion in her eyes.</br>
</br>
However, the two's sight did not fix onto each other like before. Jiang Chen subtly looked away.</br>
</br>
"I am sorry..."</br>
</br>
He almost did it, but the slightest resistance in her eyes, like a bucket of cold water, extinguished the passion in his heart.</br>
</br>
He admitted he is an unscrupulous bastard, but that didn't mean he had no bottom line. For strangers, he could act freely. For equally unrestrained people, he didn't mind playing with them. But for the important people around him...</br>
</br>
He admitted that sometimes he may be scandalous, but he was far from just thinking with his bottom half.</br>
</br>
If she was unwilling, then he was using the affection in her mind to force her to do something she didn't want to. What's more, he knew that Xia Shiyu is a relatively traditional woman and he could not give her the traditional sense of marriage.</br>
</br>
Tears began to well up in Xia Shiyu's eyes.</br>
</br>
She didn't know why, she was feeling a hint of sorrow. Even she wasn't clear about why she felt this emotion. She didn't even understand whether she was looking forward or resisting. Perhaps it was also why she was unable to respond to Ayesha proposal...</br>
</br>
As the distance between the two people gradually widened, the door was gently pushed open.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 897"/>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 897: I“m willing to share with you</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the quietness, the creak of the door was crisp.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu looked to the door and her eyes met Ayesha, who had a devious smile on her face. Inexplicably, she felt like her hand was caught in the cookie jar. Shyness soon overwhelmed her. She looked away and was about to push away Jiang Chen, but little did she expect a hand would reach from the side and gently hold her wrist.</br>
</br>
She looked to the side, and Ayesha was standing by the bed.</br>
</br>
Still in the push-up position, Jiang Chen was also unfortunately stuck in the awkward situation.</br>
</br>
"I..." Gazing into the sapphire blue pupils, he was somewhat embarrassed. He was about to say something, but Ayesha's finger gently touched his lips.</br>
</br>
Then she turned to look at Xia Shiyu, whose face was covered in a red hue. Ayesha smiled lovingly and softly said.</br>
</br>
"Can you give me the answer to the question I asked you in the morning?"</br>
</br>
Hearing Ayesha words, Xia Shiyu's eyes fled, but behind her was the soft bed. She had nowhere to escape.</br>
</br>
"Question?" Jiang Chen looked at Ayesha, and for a temporary moment, he forgot about his current state.</br>
</br>
Ayesha's bright eyes blinked, and it was a rare time that she did not respond directly to Jiang Chen's question. Xia Shiyu was turning even more red and her eyes were filled with panic and uncertainty.</br>
</br>
Contrary to Jiang Chen, Ayesha, with her delicate emotions, captured more of the emotions named "hope" from Xia Shiyu's complicated eyes. The so-called resistance was not a refusal from the heart, but it was more of an unexpressed reserved state...</br>
</br>
Having made this clear, a faint smile formed on Ayesha's face.</br>
</br>
With both her hands around Jiang Chen, Ayesha who was already naked, hugged him from the back and pressed down on him...</br>
</br>
From a long time ago, she made up her mind and decided to push these two people teogether at the necessary moment.</br>
</br>
Although she made the decision on her own, she had already made the decision for the two people who were not straightforward.</br>
</br>
Clouds and fog cast a shy veil on the moonlight, which disguised its brightness and hid the arousing picture under the moon. Outside the window was the garden. Two vines intertwined in the garden on the fence and interspersed among the green groves.</br>
</br>
An unknown white flower blossomed at the end of the vine, and the fragrance spread until deep into the night.</br>
</br>
…</br>
</br>
The next day.</br>
</br>
A glimpse of sunlight sneaked into the window, and when Jiang Chen opened his drowsy eyes, the sun was already high up in the sky.</br>
</br>
Watching Xia Shiyu's kitten-like posture, and the softness from her arms and legs tangled around him like an octopus, his heart began to beat faster. It seemed that she felt the sudden acceleration of his heartbeat. Ayesha, who was lying on his chest, sniffed with her nose and then lazily licked the corner of her mouth.</br>
</br>
Seeing this scene, Jiang Chen took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
</br>
If it were not for the fact that he didn't want to wake up the two women, he really wanted to shout to express the uncontrollable feelings in his chest at the moment...</br>
</br>
[This is so cute! ! !]</br>
</br>
However, this intimate picture did not last long.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's eyebrows slightly moved and she slowly opened her still weary eyes. However, when her eyes fell on the clock on the bedside table, she suddenly jumped from the bed like a squirrel's tail being stepped on.</br>
</br>
It was already ten o'clock!</br>
</br>
Today was not Saturday or Sunday, but Monday!</br>
</br>
"What's the matter, why are you in such a hurry?" Looking at Xia Shiyu that hurriedly got up, Jiang Chen asked with a smile and admired her beautiful curvatures.</br>
</br>
She fumbled to grab her black-rimmed glasses from the bedside table and gave a hard stare at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?! You see what time it is!"</br>
</br>
However, at this moment, she suddenly flushed and realized that she was wearing nothing at all. She immediately reached out and covered her sensitive parts. With a whispering voice, she quietly said.</br>
</br>
"Turn... turn around. I'm going to put on some clothes."</br>
</br>
[I already seen it anyway, it is not like you'll lose anything…]</br>
</br>
Although he mocked in his mind, Jiang Chen wouldn't just say it out without any sense. Since he was a gentleman, he turned his head away.</br>
</br>
Relieved, the fast pumping heartbeat finally slowed down.</br>
</br>
Confirming that Jiang Chen turned his head, she slowly got out of bed. Ayesha was still sleeping. She did not want to awaken her. On the one hand, she didn't have the heart to do so. On the other hand, she did not know how to face her.</br>
</br>
After all, last night, under Ayesha's guidance, the two held hands together to brace the impact of the "beast".</br>
</br>
Even the Good Morning's greeting was skipped. Xia Shiyu put on clothes and rushed to the bathroom. While withstanding the pain of her first, she spent the shortest amount of time to put on professional clothes, put on light makeup, and then walked with her high heels to the garage.</br>
</br>
The plan in the morning was now out the window. By the time she got to the office, it would already be lunch time. Since she became the CEO, it was her first time being this late, but also for her to be late because she slept in.</br>
</br>
Not long after Xia Shiyu left, Ayesha slowly opened her beautiful eyes.</br>
</br>
Obviously, she woke up long ago and just pretended to be asleep.</br>
</br>
Looking at the side of her lover's face, Ayesha had a sweet smile on her face. She got closer to Jiang Chen's ear and whispered softly, "Did you have fun last night?"</br>
</br>
Looking at the faint redness on the sheets, Jiang Chen did not speak for a long time.</br>
</br>
Ayesha pecked on his lips and made him look at her.</br>
</br>
"She has always liked you."</br>
</br>
"Don't you mind?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha gently shook his small head, her luscious chestnut hair turned golden under the sunlight.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Although she did not say a word, Jiang Chen has got all the answers from her deep and gentle eyes.</br>
</br>
He rubbed her hair lovingly, and looked at the eyes that closed because of comfort. He suddenly remembered something, and he asked.</br>
</br>
"What did you say to Xia Shiyu when we got off the plane?"</br>
</br>
Ayesha tilted her head and began to repeat what had happened.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
At that time, Jiang Chen and the others had just gotten off the plane.</br>
</br>
Ayesha secretly approached Xia Shiyu while taking advantage of Jiang Chen busy dealing with the Xin officials.</br>
</br>
Taking her to the corner of the airport, Ayesha looked at her.</br>
</br>
"Do you like Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu, who was read like book, subconsciously wanted to deny it. But when she saw the face of her "enemy", she didn't want to say the defeated words out loud. Since she already decided a long time ago that she would take Jiang Chen from her hands...</br>
</br>
"Yes...so what?" Xia Shiyu said coldly, in defiance.</br>
</br>
Unexpectedly, she did not see any negative emotions from the girl's face.</br>
</br>
Or rather, that smile from the bottom heart of her heart seemed to be happy for her candid answer.</br>
</br>
"Great." Ayesha took a step forward, held her right hand, then said sincerely.</br>
</br>
[What is great about this?!]</br>
</br>
Xia Shi looked at her dumbfounded.</br>
</br>
Intuition told her that her expression was not fake.</br>
</br>
But why?</br>
</br>
Obviously, she was her rival and intended to "steal" her favorite person from her hands... Was she that much of a non-threat? That night, I...</br>
</br>
If Ayesha's previous sentence made her dumbfounded, then the next sentence completely crashed her brain</br>
</br>
The little girl holding her hands gazed into her eyes, her sapphire eyes filled with sincerity.</br>
</br>
"I know you really love him. If you don't mind, I am willing to share with you..."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"What happened later?" Jiang Chen kept asking.</br>
</br>
"Later... she broke free from my hand and fled without saying anything." Ayesha was slightly upset when she spoke about this.</br>
</br>
Of course, this frustration did not last long, and soon she was immersed in the happiness of Jiang Chen's "special way to get up."</br>
</br>
At last, before lunch, Jiang Chen spared Ayesha who was "begging for mercy" and watched the little girl limp into the kitchen.</br>
</br>
After lunch, Jiang Chen helped Ayesha clean up the dishes and then went to the garage. Sitting on his converted Lamborghini, he raced toward Future Building.</br>
</br>
Compared to Xia Shiyu, who was meticulous, the employees of Future Group were no longer surprised by the President's casual work time. After all, only the CEOs of the subsidiaries had direct report relationships. Ordinary employees rarely had the opportunity to contact him on the job. Therefore, there was no need to lead by example.</br>
</br>
However, both were late together today, and indeed many people were somewhat surprised.</br>
</br>
For example, the two ladies at the front desk of the building,</br>
</br>
"Hey, that was... the president right?" With curly hair, the female professional poked her colleague next to her and said with a look of curiosity.</br>
</br>
"Yeah? What happened?" asked the colleague with her hair in a ponytail.</br>
</br>
"Have you noticed that Boss Xia was actually late today and came after eleven! And, the way she walked... it was a bit weird." The curly haired woman quickly glanced around her and whispered to her friend.</br>
</br>
The ponytail woman's face immediately turned red and seemed to have related it to something. She gave her a hard stare and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Don't talk nonsense! Maybe it's just her time of the month. If the department manager hears about this, be careful about your bonus!"</br>
</br>
The curly haired girl popped out her tongue and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
But nonetheless the gossip only spread to more people, in less than an hour, the "must-tell story between Boss Xia and the President" began to spread. Although after learning of this news, many male workers who secretly admired their beautiful boss pounded their chest in disappointment, most people still blessed the two from the bottom of their hearts.</br>
</br>
Both of them have considerable reputation in the company. The two finally coming together was also expected by most people</br>
</br>
Sitting in the office for just a short while, Xia Shiyu pushed open the door and came in.</br>
</br>
Her black long hair was tied up. The delicate face had light makeup on it. The white shirt and black pencil skirt drew out her perfect curves, and the black stockings underneath the skirt were simply irresistible.</br>
</br>
When Xia Shiyu's eyes met with Jiang Chen's, Xia Shiyu who had already adjusted her mind couldn't help but panic. She looked away and then took a few steps forward and handed the files to him.</br>
</br>
"...this is Future Bank's proposal for the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs Group's assets. David Smith has already been in touch with some of Goldman Sachs' shareholders. They also plan to withdraw from the infighting between the Jewish Consortium and the WASP Consortium. We expect that we can acquire 11% of Goldman Sachs Group shares at relatively low prices, as well as some of the physical assets that are distributed along the West Coast. Due to the amount involved is as high as $6.1 billion dollars, we need your signature."</br>
</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu bit her tongue three times as she spoke. She buried her head and wanted to find a crack on the ground so she could hid inside it.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took the documents she handed over and took this opportunity to look into her eyes. He said seriously.</br>
</br>
"I will take responsibility."</br>
</br>
"This, here is the office... Please don't do this." Xia Shiyu's eyes once again escaped. The panic on her face was not one that belonged to a successful business woman.</br>
</br>
A smirk formed on Jiang Chen's face and he couldn't resist the temptation to tease her.</br>
</br>
"Eh? What did I do?"</br>
</br>
"..." Xia Shiyu's face remained red and she did not respond.</br>
</br>
Seeing that she was not talking, Jiang Chen stood up and walked around the desk slowly. When he was beside her, he whispered into her ear.</br>
</br>
"Or, rather... are you looking forward to something?"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu eventually escaped, but Jiang Chen did not really intend to do anything. It was the workplace after all. If he did plan to do something, he would have to wait for everyone to leave work…</br>
</br>
The work in the afternoon was basically signing documents after documents to deal with the success of Future Group in the Silicon Valley Summit.</br>
</br>
A large number of graphene material orders allowed Coro Island to become a global trading center for graphene materials. Jiang Chen originally intended to build the hub in Penglai, but considering that Coro Island was the capital of Xin and the numerous expansions of the port on the southern tip, compared to Penglai, which focuses on tourism, it was more suitable as a transfer station for the transfer of graphene materials to the world.</br>
</br>
In fact, the Malaysian government had tried to put this trade center in the New Malaysia Special District and provided a number of unimaginable preferential conditions. However, Jiang Chen, with almost no hesitation, rejected the proposal of the Malaysian government.</br>
</br>
For any sane people, anyone could see the benefits of such a trade center. Controlling a material trade center would mean huge international influence. And these international influences could be directly reflected in the economic growth of the country!</br>
</br>
Although graphene was basically produced at the plant in the New Malaysian Special District, the location of production doesn't dictate ownership. Oil was mostly produced by OPEC member countries, but it was still settled with US dollars.</br>
</br>
The same principle.</br>
</br>
Although Malaysia and Future Group maintained cooperation worth tens of billions of dollars, Malaysia even created a special district for Future Group. The relationship between the two sides was quite close, but it was not close enough for Jiang Chen to willing surrender such a great benefit.</br>
</br>
The graphene trading center would only be built on Coro Island, and the settlement of graphene would also be entirely done in Xin New Dollar.</br>
</br>
Even if Coro Island does not produce one gram of graphene at all.</br>
</br>
In addition to the graphene trade center, cloud technology projects with companies in the UA and Hua had also started. Future Group planned to build a new supercomputer center near the Future Building. It claimed that the supercomputer center would be using a supercomputer newly developed by Future Heavy Industrial. Actually, it would use quantum computers and transmit data through quantum communication satellites to provide data processing services for contracted companies.</br>
</br>
Finally, the first batch of 100,000 Beta-4 unmanned drones arrived at the port of Los Santos and was received by the reorganized Futures Medicine. The reorganized organization was responsible for selling to major North American hospitals. Although skeptical about the drone's medical technology, many hospitals placed a small order.</br>
</br>
Based on the estimate that every hundred people would need a Beta-4, there would be a gap of more than three million in North America, and this figure did not considere replacement or damage! Based on this calculation, the entire North American market would be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. It was a completely untapped market.</br>
</br>
In the near future, major hospitals would see the benefits of the Beta-4 drone.</br>
</br>
Even at the current stage, North American doctors' unions, nurses' associations, and other organizations issued protests, but when money ruled, these voices were only silenced and ignored. Just because the textile workers protested, did the steam engine stopped selling?</br>
</br>
As for the unemployment rate in North America...</br>
</br>
That would be the Capital's headache, and not a problem for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"At nine o'clock on November 6th, a SUV that drove into the Synagogue located in Pilsen, Czech Republic, caught on fire. When the SUV crashed into the church, the vehicle exploded. The Pilsen Fire Department dispatched immediately, but when the fire engine arrived, the church was completely swallowed by flames."</br>
</br>
"A total of 31 people were killed and 57 suffered burns of varying degrees. The vehicle was remotely controlled and contained highly adhesive fuel. At present, the Pilsen City Police Force has initially determined that this incident to be a terrorist attack against Jews. The Czech President made a speech in front of the media, declaring the Czech Republic to enter a state of emergency and Pilsen to be placed under martial law. When asked how long the martial law would last, the Czech President did not explicitly give an answer. He only said that martial law's duration would be further discussed at parliament..."</br>
</br>
The news on the television showed the horrific incident that occurred in Czech Republic and once again was another blow to the Western world deeply traumatized by terrorism.</br>
</br>
In contrast, the gunfight that took place on Venice Street in Los Santos was forgotten by the media.</br>
</br>
After all, the death of a group of UA and Xin citizens was far less compelling compared to what happened here.</br>
</br>
In particular, there were exactly thirteen chairmen of European conglomerates that were praying in this humble church...</br>
</br>
Ayesha, with a plate, walked next to Jiang Chen. She gently placed a glass of milk and golden fried rice in front of him.</br>
</br>
A follow-up report of the Pilsen Attack was shown on television. Ayesha's expression didn't look any different, as if it had nothing to do with her.</br>
</br>
"The FTSE 100 Index opened at 7,121 points, diving 4.3%, the French CAC40 index opened at 4,441.7 points, down 2.0%, the German DAX30 index opened at 10,610.8 points, a substantial plunge of 5.7%." While drinking milk, Xia Shiyu concentrated on the newspaper, "Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the Nikkei rose slightly, and the Dow Jones Index rebounded slightly after being down at the open..."</br>
</br>
With a sigh, she put down the cup.</br>
</br>
"The economic crisis has already begun."</br>
</br>
With half a half cup of milk down, the corner of her mouth was still stained with white milk. Perhaps she realized this, she subconsciously licked it with her tongue.</br>
</br>
The action was especially seductive, although she did not realize this, Jiang Chen who sat next to her closed his legs.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu noticed that the way Jiang Chen sat seemed a bit unusual. She looked to his side with a puzzled expression.</br>
</br>
"Any questions?"</br>
</br>
"No, no! Ahem, speaking of this... Economic crisis, is it related to this?" Jiang Chen hurriedly pointed to the report on TV, and followed her last sentence to change the subject.</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's question, Xia Shiyu nodded approvingly.</br>
</br>
</br>
"There is no direct connection. This economic crisis is due to causes from a long time ago. From the recent soaring oil prices, it is a glimpse of the cause. But to some extent, this attack could be considered the tipping point."</br>
</br>
As Xia Shiyu explained, she spread the newspaper in her hands and turned to another panel. She did not know the connection between the attack and the Los Santos Incident, the Freemasonry, Jiang Chen, and Ghost Agents. She just analyzed the issue from an objective point of view.</br>
</br>
Looking down at Xia Shiyu's slender fingers, Jiang Chen saw the title on the newspaper, which seemed to be about European inheritance taxes.</br>
</br>
"The key lies in the people who died in this attack. Among them are the Chairman of the Krupp Group, the Director and CEO of Luxembourg's Albed Steel Group, the Executive Director of Siemens... and even the second order of Rothschild Bank. In addition to the last one, these people are the real power figures of the European capital."</br>
</br>
Speaking of this, Xia Shiyu pushed up her glasses and a flash of sharpness showed in her eyes.</br>
</br>
"The unexpected incident has made the European economy, which is already stagnant, even worse, and even pulled down the North American economy. In contrast, the long suppressed Asian market has rebounded. If we look at this from this perspective, our departure from the European market appears be a correct decision."</br>
</br>
"Are you not going to praise me?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"You just got lucky." Xia Shiyu glared at the cocky Jiang Chen and scoffed him.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shrugged and did not deny this point.</br>
</br>
After the start of the war with the Freemasonry, many people in the group opposed the complete abandonment of the European market and excessive investment in Asia, but only he insisted on making this decision.</br>
</br>
Even now, this decision was absolutely without support. If it were not for the fact that he was the only on the board, this decision would not have passed at all.</br>
</br>
But as a result, this decision became worth celebrating...</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu finished her milk and looked at the clock on the wall. "It's almost time, should we go to the company together?"</br>
</br>
"I have a completion ceremony to attend to in the afternoon. I'll be free in the morning. We can go together and I'll just ride in your car." Jiang Chen finished the remaining items on the table and looked at the plate in front of Xia Shiyu, "is it really okay for you to eat this little?"</br>
</br>
Other than drinking the cup of milk, she only had an egg. It was only half past seven and more than four hours away from lunch</br>
</br>
However, Xia Shiyu didn't seem to mind but instead looked at Jiang Chen in confusion.</br>
</br>
"Is it not a lot? But I'm already full."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In mid-November, the underwater tunnel linking the Pannu nine islands was finally completed. In the future, citizens would no longer need to transfer to a ferry to travel from Coro Island to Ange Island. The journey would be completed through the highway connecting the nine main islands</br>
</br>
The underwater pipeline made of graphene material was like a transparent crystal corridor. In this crystal corridor, the colorful corals, shells and tropical fishes could be seen by lifting ones head. Even people with deep-sea phobia did not need to worry as cold lights were installed inside and outside the pipeline, enough to dispel fears caused by the deep ocean.</br>
</br>
As for safety, the ability to withstand pressures over millions of pascal was indicative of the strength of graphene material at the depth of up to two hundred meters. The inner surface of the graphene pipe was coated with a fireproof layer, which also eliminated the danger that a car accident may cause fire. After all, fire was one of the few weaknesses of graphene material.</br>
</br>
The Xin's submarine highway surpassed the record of 123 kilometers set in the Bohai Bay underwater tunnel and became the longest underwater tunnel in the world!</br>
</br>
As an investor in the highway, Jiang Chen participated in the completion ceremony organized by the construction party.</br>
</br>
In front of the crowded media lenses, the ribbon was cut.</br>
</br>
After the cut, it was the opening ceremony.</br>
</br>
Not only were the construction party and Future Group executives in charge of the project invited to attend the ceremony, the President of Xin, government officials, celebrities, and even foreign guests were also among the participants. More than 70 guests participated in the ceremony, boarding a fleet of vehicles that consisted of more than 30 luxury cars.</br>
</br>
With the media following closely, Jiang Chen led this special fleet to complete the first trip on the submarine highway.</br>
</br>
It was an extremely glamorous and extravagant ceremony!</br>
</br>
The company that received the most highlight was the new energy automotive company Luer. As one of the sponsors of the ceremony, all vehicles were provided by either Luer or companies connected to Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
It was not just an opening ceremony. Rather, it was a large-scale promotion for pure electric vehicles. The auto market in Xin, in the past, had been very sluggish, and the reason nothing to do with per capita income. The main reason was transportation. If a car could only run in one city, there was really no need for a middle-class family to buy a car.</br>
</br>
However, the need would be different after the completion of the underwater tunnel.</br>
</br>
In the foreseeable future, Xin's automobile market would surely welcome a period of explosive growth. The focus of Future Group's promotion would be on new energy vehicles!</br>
</br>
Future Group planned to build thousands of wireless charging stations distributed throughout Xin, with an area of coverage even greater than gas stations!</br>

</br>
Just as Xia Shiyu expected, the economic crisis arrived on schedule and swept the world from the Mediterranean at lightning speed. Even if OPEC member states all announced production increases, the upward oil price momentum remained unstoppable.</br>
</br>
It should be noted that capacity was only one of the factors that determined the price, and not the only factor. The Turkish Civil War cut off the southern corridor that supplied European's energy needs. The Ukrainian issue and the sanctions against Russia completely blocked the gas pipeline from the east to Europe.</br>
</br>
The extreme forces such as IS spread like wildfire and have also caused the Middle East's oil production capacity to hit a low.</br>
</br>
The attack on the Pilsen Synagogue was just a fuse.</br>
</br>
The turmoil in the stock prices of the thirteen financial groups directly detonated the long-overdue crisis.</br>
</br>
The global economy once again hailed a disaster no inferior than the 2008 financial crisis. The New York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones failed to stop the freefall, and Wall Street's "dealer" rang the bell to begin the shuffle.</br>
</br>
It was India that fell first. Due to geological conditions, India was an oil importing country and has very little natural gas reserves. As an emerging economy that was on the road to industrialization, the price of oil directly constrained the lifeline of this country.</br>
</br>
With the rise in oil prices, bills for imports of crude oil in India also continued to rise, and the crisis further exacerbated. The rapid increase in production and transportation costs, the drop in exports, and the withdrawal of investors, followed by a sharp rise in the Indian government's fiscal deficit, eventually triggered a crisis.</br>
</br>
There were countless companies that went bankrupt. The unemployment rate in all countries grew by more than a percentage, and the consumer index fell to a historic low. Affected by the impact of the aftermath, Future Group's group operation also suffered. These losses were reflected on the November financial report.</br>
</br>
However, compared to other companies, Future Group's focus on the frontier industries, was minimally impacted.</br>
</br>
With the continued expansion of the planting area of petroleum crops, the factories of Future Group at least did not need to worry about high oil prices. As for other commodities driven by crude oil prices, Future Group relied on the three raw material suppliers, MLL Island, Country F, and Madagascar to ease some of the pressure.</br>
</br>
The global economic situation was in a downturn. Jiang Chen also gradually shifted the focus of investment to the industries beyond Earth. The real enemy was actually just light years away. While the Freemasonry posed a big problem, in contrast, he must plan out more important things in advance.</br>
</br>
The space elevator was basically complete. Some plans that previously must be put on hold, could now gradually start.</br>
</br>
Before that, Jiang Chen had one more thing to do.</br>
</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Coro Island Central Hospital, a hospital funded by Future Group, brought together cutting-edge technologies for Future Biology. Many incurable diseases that could not be solved by modern medicine was treated to a certain extent here, and some were even completely eradicated.</br>
</br>
The entrance of the hospital was completely jammed by reporters and TV vans. People looked at the hospital entrance with full of hope. At this moment, they were devoted believers, they were waiting for a miracle.</br>
</br>
A culture chamber that was tangled with tubes stood inside the special medical room in the hospital. On the surface of the culture chamber, a palm-sized screen was embedded and the center of the screen pulsated with numbers similar to a countdown.</br>
</br>
When the number returned to zero, the medical staff in the room gathered around the chamber and emptied the culture fluid, opened the chamber, lifted the respirator and the tubes with different functions on the patient, and finally lifted the patient to the moving bed and sent him to the rehabilitation room.</br>
</br>
There was an uproar downstairs, and if it weren't for security guards, the eager reporters would have rushed upstairs</br>
</br>
Who had this honor?</br>
</br>
Yes, it was the famous physicist and the patient with ALS, Hawking.</br>
</br>
Before he was sent to the rehabilitation room, he opened his eyes and saw Jiang Chen at the entrance. He used his vocal cord to intermittently say the first words he said in decades.</br>
</br>
"Where is my wheelchair?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and did not answer. He watched him be taken into the rehabilitation room.</br>
</br>
For the well-developed medical technology of the 22nd century, ALS was not a problem. The reason why he stayed in the chamber for so long was mainly to repair the muscle cells and neurons in his body that were necrosis due to paralysis.</br>
</br>
In the rehabilitation room, accompanied by medical personnel, Hawking with two crutches regained the ability to walk again. Like a toddler learning how to walk, he was emotional, and every one step he took, a coherent word was squeezed out from his shaking lips.</br>
</br>
The nurse helping him could only distinguish two words.</br>
</br>
"Unbelievable," and "God."</br>
</br>
More than an hour later, Hawking, who was already able to walk on crutches, was escorted from the rehabilitation room by two medical staff members. It was not easy to learn to walk again, especially for an elderly person who had been in a wheelchair for several decades.</br>
</br>
Looking at the old man with emotion and gratitude on his face, Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
"How does it feel?"</br>
</br>
"Kick me. I need to make sure I'm not dreaming." Hawking replied English, although the pronunciation seemed off.</br>
</br>
"Haha, you should tell your son and daughter to do that. It's amazing, I originally intended to prepare you a keyboard and a loudspeaker, but did not think that in less than two hours, you 'learned' how to speak," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Where are they? I want to meet them now!"</br>
</br>
"They are downstairs," Jiang Chen pointed to the stairs. "But before you go downstairs, you better be prepared because it is already surrounded by reporters."</br>
</br>
Hearing the latter half of the sentence, Hawking, who was eager to walk down stairs, suddenly stopped and turned to Jiang Chen with an unpleasant expression.</br>
</br>
"Can you get rid of them?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"We made a promise. If I cured you, the first thing you need to do for me is to be interviewed by reporters."</br>
</br>
"I'm a patient, I need to rest!" Hawking said, unwilling to accept the fact.</br>
</br>
"But people are eager to know the truth, and I have no right to stop them." Jiang Chen shrugged and said in innocence, "Let's think about it. We cured a late-stage ALS patient. It is a miracle that will go down in history. Doctors who have worked diligently for your health certainly are hoping you can speak to the media. Shouldn't you do something for them?"</br>
</br>
Perhaps the last sentence touched the stubborn old man. After going downstairs, Hawking accepted an interview with the media.</br>
</br>
"Thank you Jiang Chen, thank you Future Biology. I'm very grateful to the care staff at the Coro Island Central Hospital. I feel great right now. I want to do a lot of things right now. I want to embrace my wife, my son, my daughter...I have owed them this hug for a very long time. In addition, I still want to see my wheelchair, and I will send it to the Queen of England. I'm sorry I'm separated with Britain, but the Pannu archipelago has historically been part of the Commonwealth. I am very fortunate that I did not have to betray my vows..."</br>
</br>
Hawking said slowly, but no reporter showed impatience. Everyone felt the deepest emotion in his tone and the excitement of defeating the disease. His wife and children pushed through the crowd and embraced the old man.</br>
</br>
The Times reporter wiped the corner of his eyes and captured this warm picture. It became the cover of the Times the following day.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the fame of Future Biology and Future Medicine also spread to the world with the news of Hawking's recovery. The Beta-4 drone, which was originally unmarketable due to the economic crisis, was also digested by the North American market at an incredible pace.</br>
</br>
The original rumor that Future Group could not cure Hawking faded overnight.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

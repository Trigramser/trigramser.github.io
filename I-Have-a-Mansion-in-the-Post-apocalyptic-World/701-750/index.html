</br>
"You know what happened after?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou looked at him blankly.</br>
</br>
"After? He fired a shot at me and after I was shot I fainted. When I woke up again, I found myself in the bathtub.</br>
</br>
It seemed Zhu Tianyou was not clear as to what happened on the cruise ship after their coma. For some reason, Tanaka released the T virus, turning the cruise ship into living hell. When Jiang Chen told him what happened afterward, he initially did not believe it. When he saw the combat recording brought out by Jiang Chen, his expression gradually turned into horror.</br>
</br>
The person that kidnapped him was a murderous devil.</br>
</br>
And the devil, for some reason, became interested in the drugs he possessed.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen asked him what Tanaka got out of him, he gave two names after a moment's silence.</br>
</br>
"Ethiopia, Somalia."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen eyebrows jumped.</br>
</br>
"Specific locations?"</br>
</br>
"Give me a map. I can point it out for you." Zhu Tianyou extended his hand.</br>
</br>
Using the same tablet, Jiang Chen turned off the portrait of Tanaka and opened Google Maps. Zhu Tianyou swiped a fewÂ times on the screen; the screen locked in on the Gulf of Aden. Then it enlarged to show the Ethiopian-Somalia border, and then he pointed out two positions.</br>
</br>
"Right here."</br>
</br>
"What's here?"</br>
</br>
"A tea plantation, and a salt factory." Zhu Tianyou smiled, but the smile on his face was bitter.</br>
</br>
If he revealed the secret, it meant that he had completely given up on it. The T virus was involved; he didn't expect Jiang Chen or Interpol would be merciful to his asset. The assets he operated diligently for ten years in the Gulf of Aden was now ruined. It will be impossible to say he was not distressed.</br>
</br>
"I'm glad you confessed. Your choice may have saved the lives of many people." Jiang Chen took the tablet back.</br>
</br>
Zhu Tianyou, with a self-deprecating smile, shook his head.</br>
</br>
Save people?</br>
</br>
How many families did he break apart? He can't even count them himself.</br>
</br>
According to the data provided by the Royal Caribbean Company, a total of 3,121 passengers were onboard. Counting the waiters, crew, and other staff there was a total of 3,600 people.</br>
</br>
A total of 201 survivors were placed in the Port D in Moro. In order to avoid panic, these individuals were temporarily controlled and only permitted to leave the country after the conclusion of an observation period of one week. In fact, the virus' survival time was very short. Ultraviolet light can kill it and three days was already enough to prove the safety of the survivors. Extending this time to seven days was just a preventative measure</br>
</br>
On the day of the incident, the United Nations sent a commissioner to observe on MLL Island. Embassies of various countries also contacted the Moro government one after another to confirm the list of survivors.</br>
</br>
Because of the demand for the outside world to understand the inside story, Moro finally agreed to media interviews after discussion with Celestial Trade.</br>
</br>
</br>
Since the storm in City K, the T virus once again appeared in people's eyes. The massacre of tens of thousands of people who died that night was so terrible that all the spectators felt a deep chill in their bones. Now, the tragedy on the Royal Caribbean Cruise seemed to tell people that the threat of the virus has not been eliminated.</br>
</br>
BBC, CNN, Columbia Broadcasting, Al Jazeera... media flocked to MLL Island just like bees searching for nectar. The unafraid reporters, carrying cameras and microphones, rushed to the survivors, Moro officials, Celestial Trade soldiers,Â and anyone possibly informed.</br>
</br>
"I was sitting right next to the dance floor and the crowd on the dance floor suddenly became chaotic. It was not far from me when a lady bit the face of her partner, and at first, we thought they were sharing an affectionate moment until she had torn a piece of meat from his face... Godâ¦ terrible ... ... "A woman with a scar on her face said in a whimper.</br>
</br>
"I was resting in my room because I had an upset stomach due to eating some seafood. Someone was smashing on the door so I went to open it. When I saw fully armed soldiers, my first reaction was that Hollywood must be shooting a film and I was fortunate enough to be part of the cast. But when I saw the blood on the ground and the bodies behind them, I understood, it was not a joke ... "</br>
</br>
"I was a chef, and happened to be grabbing something in the freezer. I was ready to go out with the ingredients when I suddenly saw the riot outside. I thought there were pirates at first, but then I found the situation far worse than pirates. I ran into the warehouse, unplugged the power, and hid in the freezer. Perhaps they smelled something, the zombies ran in... Thank God, they can only push on the door and not pull on it.</br>
</br>
"There are no signs, just like the Walking Dead!" The distraught man sat on the steps on the street, his face looked weary as he shooed away the reporters.</br>
</br>
"The superior ordered us to shoot, so we shot... Please do not ask such stupid questions, they are not humans, so I don't feel guilty at all," a Celestial Trade soldier who participated in the rescue operation said.</br>
</br>
Also received by the rescue signal were Country F and Nippon. However, because of the loss to almost all naval forces at the beginning of the year, Coastal Guard ships had been in short supply. It was not until Celestial Trade completed the rescue and the cruise ship detonated did their ships rush to the scene.</br>
</br>
Nippon, because of the distance, arrived even later.</br>
</br>
"If we first boarded the cruise ship, we would not have ordered the killing of those zombâ¦, Ahem,Â those poor infected souls! Absolutely not! We would use fishing nets to find ways to control them, and then lock them in a psychiatric hospital. We need to properly accommodate these unfortunate people until we find a solution." In an interview with the media, a minister said frankly in an attempt to establish a responsible image of a large nation before the international community.</br>
</br>
Controversy currently set aside.</br>
</br>
Similar to the infection that happened in the City K at the beginning of the year, Future Biology once again made a "disaster fortune".</br>
</br>
According to the feedback from official distributors such as Amazon and Taobao, Jiang Chen could intuitively see that the sales volume of the T virus vaccines and nutrient supplies rose sharply in the past week.</br>
</br>
Nowadays in the information age, people of the world have long been influenced by countless disaster movies and gained all sorts of "survival skills". Anyone knows that when the apocalypse is here, the four basic essentials are food, medicine, fuel,Â and weapons. As a long shelf life and easy to store liquid food, nutrition supply was undoubtedly the best "strategic reserve supply."</br>
</br>
Even if governments repeatedly declared that the plot in movies could not happen in real life, the direct infection rate of the virus was not high, and the survival time under the exposure of ultraviolet light was short, this collective panic apparently can't be dispelled by any two or three statements.</br>
</br>
Unless the culprit was sent to the guillotine.</br>
</br>
Just as intelligence agencies around the world joined forces to frantically search for the sources of the virus, the Ghost Agents Jiang Chen deployed in Nippon started to make a move ahead of the CIB.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Idiot!"</br>
</br>
In Nippon, inside the Yoto Government Building and the Defense Ministry's office, Defense Minister Nakatani angrily dropped the document to the ground.</br>
</br>
"What's going on with Takeda Pharmaceutical? Didn't we tell them to tone it down since the last meeting?"</br>
</br>
The assistant stood by the door and didn't dare to make a sound.</br>
</br>
After a while, Nakaya Ryo finally vented out his anger. He took a deep breath.</br>
</br>
"Go and fetch me the Chairman of Takeda Pharmaceutical!"</br>
</br>
"Yes ..." The assistant nodded before quickly turning around.</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
At the same time, Takeda Pharmaceutical's building was turned in a chaos. The tragedy that took place on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship left the entire world in panic again because of the name T virus. As early as six months ago, CIB began to pay attention to the name Takeda Pharmaceutical, Takeda has been very careful, and with the Defense Ministry's help, even the UAÂ didn't manage to collect any evidence.</br>
</br>
Takeda's board of directors had pressured President Hiroshi Tanimura many times and demanded that he strictly restrict the operation of the Kurofune. Including limiting the supply of raw materials, scrutinizing funding applications, sending inspectors to monitor the laboratories, and other moves to curtail the organization.</br>
</br>
If City K's actions were exposed, Hiroshi Tanimura probably won't be able to save his own life, let alone all the members of the board which may be trialed by the International Tribunal for crime against humanity.</br>
</br>
However, just last month, Tanaka suddenly disappeared on his way home from work.</br>
</br>
This scared the Takeda's board of directors. They initially thought it was CIB that made the arrest and thought the company's secrets have been exposed. It was not after investigation did they realize that CIB knew nothing.</br>
</br>
Luckily, Tanimura immediately ordered the company to search for the whereabouts of this man in the entire Nippon region. But he did not expect that only in a month's time, the missing Tanaka already went abroad and created a major headline.</br>
</br>
"Where is Tanaka?" It was already the tenth time Tanimura asked this question.</br>
</br>
"We haven't found him yet," said the vice president anxiously. "I have contacted all the associations that have relations with us and launched all the underground forces we can use to search for his whereabouts, but ..."</br>
</br>
"A bunch of useless tools," Tanimura screamed, his fingers trembling as they moved toward his temples.</br>
</br>
From the day Tanaka disappeared, he realized the situation was turning south, but he didn't think it would actually happen.</br>
</br>
[Damn, where did that guy find the raw materials!]</br>
</br>
As the chairman of Takeda Pharmaceutical, Tanimura certainly read the T virus synthesis formula. Producing one gram of virus concentrate requires at least one kilogram of methaconeone, the raw materials that could be used are bath salt, or Arabic tea. But regardless, they are all prohibited items!</br>
</br>
</br>
Tanimura's brow twisted together.</br>
</br>
"President, what are we going to do now?" The vice president said, trembling violently.</br>
</br>
"Delete all the research data and all the relevant information of Kurofune from the company's database."</br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical had been on CIB's suspected list, and with this tragedy of at least 27 UA citizens dying on the cruise ship, CIB would no longer be concerned with their method of investigation. Presumably even if the Nippon government intends to intervene and protect Takeda Pharmaceutical, CIB would infiltrate the company through special means.</br>
</br>
Since the secret could no longer be protected, then they must completely destroy it!</br>
</br>
Although it is research worth 500 million US Dollar, it was nothing compared to the market value of 10 billion.</br>
</br>
Then, someone suddenly knocked on the door.</br>
</br>
The two stopped talking, exchanged eye contact, and then Tanimura said,</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
It was Tanimura's assistant</br>
</br>
Tanimura frowned, looking at the assistant.</br>
</br>
"Did I not say, no matter what happens, before my conversation with the vice president ends, do not disturb me?"</br>
</br>
"But... It is the Defense Minister's phone call."</br>
</br>
With a long sigh, Tanimura asked.</br>
</br>
"What did Nakatani say?"</br>
</br>
"He said go see him after work," the assistant carefully responded</br>
</br>
"Where??" Tanimura asked.</br>
</br>
"Yoto Metropolitan Hotel."</br>
</br>
In the hotel rather than the government building. It seemed to be a secretive meeeting.</br>
</br>
Of course, the virus-related event was certainly not suitable to be discussed in the office, especially at this sensitive moment.</br>
</br>
After work, Tanimura stepped into his Honda and headed for the Yoto Metropolitan Hotel.</br>
</br>
After two traffic lights and turning a corner, he slowed down.</br>
</br>
There seemed to be a traffic accident in front which caused a serious traffic jam.</br>
</br>
Tanimura looked at his watch as the agreed time was inching closer and began to feel anxious. He slapped hard on the steering wheel twice, but the cars in the front had no response. From the scene, the traffic accident seemed very serious and couldn't be cleared within a short period of time.</br>
</br>
Tanimura sighed, took out his phone, and called the minister, but for some strange reasons, the phone call couldn't be made.</br>
</br>
Of course, the president of Takeda Pharmaceutical didn't have the courage to stand up against the Defense Minister. He hesitated for a moment, then parked the car on the side of the road and walked across two streets before he stopped a taxi.</br>
</br>
"To Yoto Metropolitan Hotel."</br>
</br>
"Ok," The driver replied.</br>
</br>
The car ride was smooth. Tanimura leaned on the chair and loosened the tie around his neck. Through the mirror, he saw the face of the driver. A delicate face with a ponytail; she looked pure.</br>
</br>
"Where are you from?" Tanimura asked casually.</br>
</br>
"Nago."</br>
</br>
"Nago. I heard a lot of beautiful girls come from there." Tanimura flirted.</br>
</br>
"Oh, sir, you sure do know how to joke." The driver smiled politely.</br>
</br>
Tanimura didn't seem to mind the lack of interest from the beauty. He introduced himself.</br>
</br>
"My name is Tanimura, and if you read the news regularly, you must know me."</br>
</br>
"... Oh it is Mr. Tanimura." The driver looked surprised. "I heard you are the ... chairman of Takeda Pharmaceutical?</br>
</br>
Extremely satisfied with the beauty's admiration, Tanimura smiled.</br>
</br>
He knew too well those who came to work in Yoto from other places, especially the girls who look like they just graduated. They live in a single apartment, sleep on a few square meters of tatami, take over half an hour of subway a day to go to work in the city, and can not resist the temptation to take part in adult films...</br>
</br>
Especially this type of beautiful girl, the agents looking for "actress" brokers would not overlook her.</br>
</br>
"Can I know your name?"</br>
</br>
"Shinanoha."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Shinanohaâ¦ beautiful name." Tanimura smiled and said with sincerity, "If you have any inconveniences in life, please contact me. This is my business card. There are my phone number and address on top."</br>
</br>
Of course, the address was not his home, but a mansion he bought elsewhere.</br>
</br>
Tanimura put the card in the box behind the stopper.</br>
</br>
A smile appeared on Shinanoha's face as she turned the steering wheel to turn a corner.</br>
</br>
"Thank you. I think I'll be able to become good friends with Mr. Tanimura."</br>
</br>
Her words made Tanimura's mind turn wild as he thought he had a chance, so he began to chat with his new female friend.</br>
</br>
Time flew, but they still didn't reach Yoto Metropolitan Hotel.</br>
</br>
Tanimura looked at his watch and glanced at the time; ten more minutes before the agreed on time.</br>
</br>
Looking at the more and more scattered buildings, he frowned slightly. "Is this the direction to Yoto Metropolitan Hotel?"</br>
</br>
"There is a traffic jam on the major highway so I have to go through the shortcut," Shinanoha politely said.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Tanimura realized something was wrong. He pulled out his phone to open the map app. However, he didn't receive the 4G signal.</br>
</br>
"Please do not worry, Mr. Tanimura -"</br>
</br>
"Stop! NOW!"</br>
</br>
Shinanoha paused for a second, and then smiled.</br>
</br>
"... it seems like I have to ask you to sleep for a while."</br>
</br>
Tanimura knew something went awfully wrong. He immediately reach out to the door, ready to jump out. But then he heard a snap sound; the door was locked.</br>
</br>
Just as he turned around and was ready to stop the driver, his gaze met with a tazer.</br>
</br>
"Please be obedient before we reach our destination."</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical planned to hold a press conference at the end of the month to announce the launch of a new anti-viral drug. However, on December 30, the day before the conference, Takeda Pharmaceutical suddenly announced the conference was canceled.</br>
</br>
"At all costs, mobilize all you can mobilize amd make sure you find the whereabouts of Tanimura before the UA!" In the Defense Department Office, Nakaya roared into the phone.</br>
</br>
Yesterday he waited late into the night, but Tanimura never showed up.</br>
</br>
Even a traffic jam wouldn't last that long!</br>
</br>
He couldn't be reached by phone. Nakaya called Tanimura's home and his wife picked up the phone. When asked whether Tanimura came home, his wife was confused. Realizing that the situation was not good, Nayaya immediately called the police station. That night, all the police force in Yoto was mobilized to search for the whereabouts of Tanimura.</br>
</br>
The result was clear. Until now, the person was still missing.</br>
</br>
Fiercely hanging up the police department's phone, Nakaya wearily rubbed his head.</br>
</br>
He didn't sleep for the entire night.</br>
</br>
Tanimura possessed too much intelligence, and if these intelligences were made public, Nippon would enter into the worst diplomatic crisis since World War II! Just the information of "the T virus was researched under the authorization of the government "was enough to force the prime minister to step down.</br>
</br>
Hundreds of thousands of dead souls in City K, the tragedy on the Royal Caribbean Cruise... This was not something that could be defended by "scientific research without any other purpose", "the sample was improperly stored", "sorry".</br>
</br>
Nervous sweat continuously rolled down Nakaya's forehead. He then picked up the phone and called the Takayama, head of the Yamaguchi-gumi.</br>
</br>
"The Defense Minister actually personally called a peasant, I am honored," Takayama said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Don't bullsh*t with me, I want you to help me." Nakaya immediately said.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?" Takayama didn't ask for the pay and nonchalantly said.</br>
</br>
"Help me find someone. President of Takeda Pharmaceutical. His photo can be found online and his name is Tanimura."</br>
</br>
"After I find him?"</br>
</br>
Nakaya hesitated for a moment and eventually lowering his voice.</br>
</br>
"Kill him."</br>
</br>
The entire country had been rattled by the missing Tanimura.</br>
</br>
It was at this juncture that a small newspaper in State C far across the Pacific suddenly revealed the secrets of Tanimura's disappearance.</br>
</br>
According to an insider, President Tanimura disappeared on his way to a meeting with the Defense Minister, suspected of absconding.</br>
</br>
Fear of absconding? Fear of what? When people saw the news, everyone was confused.</br>
</br>
Why did the president of Takeda Pharmaceutical want to secretly meet at the hotel with the Defense Minister? The financial situation of the company was good with a promising market, why did president of Takeda Pharmaceutical abscond? People began to suspect the real intention behind the meeting...</br>
</br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical was previously just on CIB's suspected list, by now, the CIB had begun to monitor the company. The missing Tanimura also had the honor to become part of the "extra care" list of the CIB and FBA.</br>
</br>
However, no one would have thought that Tanimura had already been kidnapped by Ghost Agents and had been taken off Nippon territory by Droplet No.1. He was held in an interrogation room in the underground facilities of New Moon Island.</br>
</br>
The news was released by the Ghost Agent, under the instructions of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The purpose on one hand was to push Takeda Pharmaceutical to the front of the stage to attract attentions from CIB and other intelligence agencies.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, it was used to disrupt the situation and create a chance for Ghost Agents again.</br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical was a Nippon company, but it also possessed information on the virus. Of course, the server that stores the virus data cannot be connected with the network, and it was bound to be heavily protected. After the incident, Takeda Pharmaceutical would most likely delete the company's data within the server, but it was impossible not to leave a backup.</br>
</br>
The T virus itself was approved as a weapons project. The Napon government certainly would not be willing to let their investments go down the drain, and they definitely would collect the data and keep it in custody.</br>
</br>
Nuclear weapons were dangerous, but no country had ever volunteered to surrender it.</br>
</br>
The same was true of T virus.</br>
</br>
If the UA came in possession of the virus, the first response would certainly not be to destroy it, but to get it out of the hands of its ally nation through an exchange of interests. This weapon was more terrifying than nuclear weapons, and it was without radiation.</br>
</br>
The order that would take ten nuclear bombs to destroy will probably only take ten kilograms of the T virus.</br>
</br>
This power to destroy the world must be buried. No one can possess it!</br>
</br>
When the Napon government began to transport the experimental data, the Ghost Agents deployed in Nippon would once again make a move and destroy the virus at all costs.</br>
</br>
At the moment, in New Moon Island's underground facility's interrogation room.</br>
</br>
Tanimura with a pale face looked at the interrogators in front of him with a bitter expression.</br>
</br>
He was ready to resist till the end.</br>
</br>
However, these people didn't plan to waste a second at all.</br>
</br>
Tied to the chair with the camera set up, a shot of truth-telling serum was injected. Tanimura blanked out and spilled everything including the color of his wife's underwear.</br>
</br>
And Tanimura's testimony confirmed Jiang Chen's conjecture.</br>
</br>
The production of the T virus requires a large amount of methacone, bath salt or Arabian tea can be used as the raw materials that can extract methacone.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Tanaka disappeared a month ago along with the experimental data and other intelligences. The virus experiment did get the permission of the Napon government.</br>
</br>
"Ten tons of salt ... If Tanaka succeeded in taking over the production of Zhu Tianyou, Sh*t, the madman now has at least hundreds of tons." Standing behind Jiang Chen, Ivan cursed out</br>
</br>
"How much virus can that produced?" Jiang Chen looked into Tanimura eyes and asked in a grave tone.</br>
</br>
Tanimura's head lowered and used his broken English.</br>
</br>
"If other raw materials are not taken into consideration ... ten tons of bath salt can turn half of North American into hell."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen and Ivan exchanged eye contact.</br>
</br>
Each saw the shock in the other's eyes.</br>
</br>
The shock was knowing that a madman controlled a weapon that could destroy the world. And this madman was also particularly unfriendly towards Xin.</br>
</br>
"Send a diplomatic request to the Ethiopian government. If Tanaka is within its region, we need to arrest him immediately," Ivan said fiercely.</br>
</br>
"Ethiopia will not allow this. We are unfamiliar with them. They will at most inform the UA troop," Jiang Chen said calmly.</br>
</br>
"Is there any difference?" Ivan asked.</br>
</br>
"The combat effectiveness of the UA is impressive. As long as someone gets rid of the madman, does it really matter who?"</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't agree.</br>
</br>
"No difference. The virus will just change hands." Jiang Chen stood up, narrowed his eyes, and stared at the sluggish face of Tanimura. Then he coldly said, "The arrest will be executed by Ghost Agents. Celestial Trade Naval and Air Force will provide support."</br>
</br>
"What about inbound permission?"</br>
</br>
"We don't apply. We'll go directly."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 704: Best of Luck</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Somalia, located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, was the sea route that all shipping vessels must enter and leave the Suez Canal from and it occupied the lifeline connecting Europe and Asia. Due to the continuous civil war, the order of production had collapsed for many years and pirates has been the local economy since the 20th century.</br>
</br>
Chaos, poverty, and the proliferation of arms; here was the hotbed for terrorism.</br>
</br>
Occasionally, foreign tourists would visit and spend hundreds of dollars hiring local bodyguards. The bodyguards were usually pirates that switched into the industry and they know clearly who they can't provoke and where they can't go. Although the price was not cheap, it was better than a multi-million dollar ransom.</br>
</br>
However, there are exceptions to everything.</br>
</br>
Just in the town of Belek, north of Mogadishu, an Asian man was walking alone on the slum streets. In the shadows, pairs of unpleasant eyes watched him without any disguise to the maliciousness in their eyes, staring at him as well as his shoulder bag.</br>
</br>
But when he took a turn and headed for that house deep in the slums, all the unpleasant eyes disappeared.</br>
</br>
It was the stronghold of Sabah (Youth Party).</br>
</br>
Stopping at a fairly complete sand house, Tanaka pulled out his phone, confirmed the coordinates, and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
When he opened the door, the previously noisy room gradually turned quiet. The man standing in at the door hoisted a rifle and saw the head of the hat, he then asked.</br>
</br>
"Are you Tanaka?"</br>
</br>
"That's right," Tanaka said smilingly.</br>
</br>
"Cell phone, and weapons." The black man reached his hand out.</br>
</br>
Tanaka obediently pulled out a cell phone and put it in the hands of the man.</br>
</br>
"Weapons too." The man repeated in broken English.</br>
</br>
"I don't have any weapons." Tanaka opened his hands.</br>
</br>
The black man glanced incredulously at him and reached for his pocket, but other than his passport and a few pieces of paper, he didn't feel any weapons and found only a small bottle of a thumb-sized perfume.</br>
</br>
"I advise you not to open it, or you may kill yourself." Tanaka said with a smile when he saw the man was about to open it. He used Arabic with a tone that didn't sound like he was joking.</br>
</br>
There was a burst of laughter, apparently no one took his warning seriously.</br>
</br>
The man's opened his mouth and a cruel smile appear, in front Tanaka, he pulled out the cap.</br>
</br>
Just as he was going to stuff it into the Asian's nostril, a sudden flash of blood covered his pupils and the color of life in his brown pupils gradually faded.</br>
</br>
His chested pumped rapidly as sweat rolled down from his nose and dripped onto the ground.</br>
</br>
Tanaka gently took the bottle from his hands, and then put the cap back on.</br>
</br>
The rest of the room looked at each other, not understanding the immediate situation. A thin man went up and patted him a few times with his hand. When he saw that there was no reaction, he immediately pulled out a pistol and said warily to Tanaka.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What did you do to him?"</br>
</br>
Tanaka smiled at the boy's action.</br>
</br>
"You'll know right away."</br>
</br>
"AHHHHâ"</br>
</br>
A scream came from behind. A man suddenly bit the neck of another man, pushed him to the ground, and blood gushed out. This scene suddenly terrified his companions, they stepped forward to pull the two "twisted" together apart.</br>
</br>
"Quickly, separate them!"</br>
</br>
"Break off his arm!"</br>
</br>
"Ouch! He bit me!"</br>
</br>
The sudden unexpected scene made the boy pointing at Tanaka distracted as he turned around to look behind him.</br>
</br>
"Roar!"</br>
</br>
A short roar came from his back; no one reacted in time. The boy standing in front of Tanaka was smashed into the wall by the man who previously unplugged the bottle and half of his face was chewed off.</br>
</br>
"AHHHHHH! Bati, what are you doing!</br>
</br>
The miserable howl gradually began to weaken, blood splashed onto Tanaka pants.</br>
</br>
The pistol slipped from the boy's hand and fell in a pool of blood.</br>
</br>
The man seemed to have captured the smell of the same kind from the boy's body, he stopped chewing and glazed at the other living being with his crimson eyes, he then jumped to them.</br>
</br>
The gunshot was finally heard, the person who was plowed to the ground pulled the trigger of the AK-47 in his hand desperately and fired around the house. However, no zombie was killed, but rather, he killed and injured a lot of people who were still alive.</br>
</br>
Blood in the dark room formed a river and covered the ants crawling.</br>
</br>
Tanaka walked to the boy's side, picked up the pistol and the dropped cellphone, he reached out with a smile and rubbed the boy's short hair.</br>
</br>
"Good boy, go now."</br>
</br>
The boy opened his mouth and stared at Tanaka with horrific eyes. However, he did not pounce on Tanaka, but he slowly moved his sight and locked them onto another living person.</br>
</br>
"Devil!" Crawled under the table, a thin man dashed to the door in horror.</br>
</br>
However, he didn't manage to reach the door; Tanaka raised his gun.</br>
</br>
"Bangâ"</br>
</br>
The man's eyes widened and fell in a pool of blood. The boy in unruly steps, jumped on his body, opened his bloody mouth and took a fierce bite.</br>
</br>
Tanaka took a stool, sat at the door of the room and smiled at this bloody scene.</br>
</br>
On the cruise ship, he used all of his stock, and the 5mg inside the perfume bottle here was the last bit.</br>
</br>
But he didn't feel pained at all.</br>
</br>
Two months ago, he had developed a modified version of the virus, and now infected people will not only become zombies, but also may evolve into mutants. Most crucially, these modified zombies will not target him as a prey.</br>
</br>
This data came from dozens of light years away, all of this was the intention the Kurofune.</br>
</br>
It was a waste to just throw the inferior products away. He wanted to serve an appetizers to those poor suckers, so he used the inferior product on the cruise ship.</br>
</br>
He will soon be able to get a steady stream of raw materials and before the world could react, the fire of civilization will be extinguished.</br>
</br>
The phone began to ring, Tanaka picked up, and said smilingly.</br>
</br>
"You stood me up and tested me with a boring trick."</br>
</br>
"... We have to make sure we are not dealing with the UA military." The voice over the phone was gloomy.</br>
</br>
"It doesn't matter, I have a lot of time. What do you think? Interested?"</br>
</br>
"This is the T virus?" The voice over the phone was mixed with a touch of excitement.</br>
</br>
If this virus is brought to Nouveau York, the Capital... Sabah will undoubtedly become the most powerful and most influential terrorism organization after Al Qaeda . The whole world will tremble in terror and listen to the teachings of the True God.</br>
</br>
"Because it's an improved version, I plan to call this the TT virus," Tanaka chuckled.</br>
</br>
"How much do you plan to sell it for?"</br>
</br>
"I'm not selling it for money," Tanaka shook his head.</br>
</br>
"...What do you want then?"</br>
</br>
"Do me a favor. There is a salt factory near Hudour, which is Mr. Zhu's business right? Including his tea plantations in Ethiopia, help me control them. I will split you half of what I produce."</br>
</br>
"Deal!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Garrett hugged his wife and daughter in front of the New Moon Island Military Base Hospital. He then walked to Jiang Chen who stood under the coconut tree.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Mr. Garrett."</br>
</br>
Looking at Garrett, Jiang Chen opened his arms with a smile, and gave him a hug.</br>
</br>
Letting go of Jiang Chen, Garrett moved his neck and jokingly said.</br>
</br>
"Congratulations, Mr. Jiang Chen, you've got yourself a loyal hound."</br>
</br>
Having said that, Jiang Chen clearly saw the gratefulness in his eyes.</br>
</br>
"Please do not belittle yourself like this; I never thought of my troops as hounds," Jiang Chen laughed. "What about the new body? How are you feeling?"</br>
</br>
"Awesome, I feel relived" Garrett punched himself in the chest and made a strong muffled sound, "Muscle tissues are a lot stronger than before, and I feel like I can fight against Captain America."</br>
</br>
"Chris Evans will not want to fight with you, his abilities are just special effects." Jiang Chen smiled, and then his expression turned serious. "let's stop the joke here. Ttime is tight and your first task has arrived."</br>
</br>
"Ready to go." Garrett stood straight.</br>
</br>
"Well, you have three days to get acquainted with your body and practice some high-tech weapons."</br>
</br>
"Three days later?"</br>
</br>
"I need you to travel to Somalia."</br>
</br>
"Target?"</br>
</br>
"Drugs."</br>
</br>
"Is the target a drug dealer? That's easy." Garrett whistled.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile.</br>
</br>
"The opponent is the one who exploded you into a crippled person and the culprit who released the T virus."</br>
</br>
Garrett took a moment to process, then his eyebrows raised. He bumped his fists together with a ferocious smile appearing on his face.</br>
</br>
"Excellent. I will beat him so hard that his mother won't recognize him."</br>
</br>
"Find him and capture him. Kill him if he can't be captured and kill him again if he resurrects. Make sure to kill him till he no longer moves. Here's your mission briefing, and more specific information is sent to your chip."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tapped the watch on his left wrist.</br>
</br>
Garett paused, and only himself could see the stream of data flashing through his retina that formed a three-dimensional task briefing.</br>
</br>
Just like wearing the Google Glasses, the AR device was implanted directly on his cortex rather than an external item.</br>
</br>
Including the T virus information, Tanaka's ability, as well as the secret of the Kurofune, all the information gathered by the Ghost Agents about the Kurofune were shared to the chip in his brain.</br>
</br>
After browsing through the mission briefing, Garrett solemnly looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I will."</br>
</br>
"Ghost Agents will provide you with support, if necessary, Aurora-20 will strike too. I wish you the best of luck." Jiang Chen patted on his shoulder and then turned away.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 705: Lin Linâs Confusion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Garrett took off along with the Ghost Agents; good news will soon arrive from Somalia.</br>
</br>
Kurofune had gone out of control, Takeda Pharmaceutical was caught in the whirlpool of public dissent, and all of CIB's energy has also been drawn into the chess match with the Nippon government and the investigation of Takeda Pharmaceutical. In order to clear their name from their virus, the Nippon government started a secretive operation to transfer the virus data and samples.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Ghost Agents lurking in Nippon were eyeing the data and virus samples. As long as the transfer work began, they would immediately move to destroy the backup data and samples.</br>
</br>
In addition, Jiang Chen also possessed a copy of the video that recorded Mr. Tanimura's confession about his crimes.</br>
</br>
If the video was made public, all the conspiracies related to the T virus will be exposed under the sunlight. The Nippon government would also be dragged into an irreversible pitfall by providing financial aid and policy support to Tanaka and would be condemned by the whole world.</br>
</br>
In order to prevent causing suspicions and to prevent the UA from receiving the news ahead of schedule, the release of the video was set after the destruction of the experimental data and virus samples. By then, the video would be anonymously uploaded to YouTube and other video streaming sites, the Nippon government's crimes would be made public.</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen would selectively delete the part related to the Kurofune.</br>
</br>
Making the temporarily invincible threats public serves no purpose other than creating panic.</br>
</br>
What's more, this would have very limited impact on Tanaka. He already took the virus data and the inventory in the lab and freed the virus recklessly on the cruise ship. To commit such an action, he already didn't care whether the secrets of the Black Ship were made public or not.</br>
</br>
Somalia's salt factory was the last stop in his plan.</br>
</br>
If the raw materials could be used to produce enough of the virus to cover the entire world, and the local extremist organization was used as a medium to spread the virus to the world. All of civilization would be pushed to the brink of destruction. Kurofune's mission would welcome its ultimate conclusion.</br>
</br>
What prompted him to make such a sudden but lunatic decision?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't know, but he hat evert reason to believe that this must be related to the Natural Selection Space Colonization Ship.</br>
</br>
"Is it because the technology I brought to this world caused their vigilance?" Jiang Chen furrowed at the thought.</br>
</br>
Graphene chips? Quantum communication satellite? Water treatment? Robot? What exactly is it?</br>
</br>
He had a hunch that the final showdown with the Kurofune was coming.</br>
</br>
Before dealing with Harmony, the stinger lurking inside the human must be removed!</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Changing his body?"</br>
</br>
Returning to the apocalypse, Jiang Chen found Lin Lin and told her the situation of Tanaka, hoping to get an answer from here.</br>
</br>
</br>
"So to understand, as soon as he removes his hat, his bodily functions will cease and then wake up from another body." Jiang Chen tried to elaborate Tanaka's story in more detail.</br>
</br>
Lin Lin frowned, the marker pinched between her fingers casually beat the table.</br>
</br>
"Your description is too abstract, can you not give me a sample of something?Â Like that hat, or Tanaka's DNA."</br>
</br>
After carefully recollecting his memory, once on the plane and once on the cruise ship, every time Tanaka "died", whether the hat or body, were destroyed completely.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen helplessly shook his head.</br>
</br>
"This is going to be difficult." Lin Lin pouted and muttered in a quiet voice, "Digitalized people can do it, but some special equipment can also do it. To put it simply, you don't need to know if the so-called false body is a real human or not."</br>
</br>
"What does that mean?" Jiang Chen took a second to process.</br>
</br>
"It is very simple. Didn't you help a prince make a highly restored man-made human in the modern world? With the use of basic artificial intelligence technology, other than you and the prince, the two insiders, the princess in other people's eyes is just like the real human, right?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin's words woke him up</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen instantly realized that he just subconsciously regarded him as a human, but he never thought about if he is really human.</br>
</br>
"You mean ... Tanaka is a man-made human?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"Well, I didn't say that," Lin Lin's small head shook quickly, "but it has to do with the hat that never leaves him."</br>
</br>
"Of course I know that," Jiang Chen smiled helplessly, "So what's your solution, the intelligent Miss Lin Lin?"</br>
</br>
Lin Lin blushed, clearly she didn't think of a good solution, but she didn't want to frankly admit that.</br>
</br>
"Ahem, in short, you have to give me that hat first, only after studying it can I conclude..."</br>
</br>
Just then, a knock came from the door before it was gently pushed open. Yao Yao wearing aprons appeared in front of the door.</br>
</br>
"Ummm, it's time to have lunch. Wait after you eat to work..."</br>
</br>
Hearing it was time to eat, Lin Lin happily ran out of the door, leaving Jiang Chen behind. Looking at Lin Lin's back, Jiang Chen shook his head amusedly, and followed her.</br>
</br>
After the family enjoyed lunch together, Jiang Chen returned to the modern world, but then returned to the apocalypse within two hours. As usual, he set up transport points and added 300 tons of rice, potatoes, bacon, vegetables, salt, pepper, and other foods to the warehouse in the backyard.</br>
</br>
With the scale of the food trade increasing, the population of Wanghai was also growing. It was originally enough to transport every other quarter, but now it must be done every month.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, with Lin Lin's Fourth Dimensional Transportation Device, Jiang Chen only needed to set the transportation point, and he would be able to throw things from the modern world. So it didn't take him long to move the three hundred tons of goods.</br>
</br>
He sent a message to Wang Qing and requested her to transfer all these foods to the warehouse base for preservation. He then returned to the mansion, opened the refrigerator, and stuffed the fresh seafood inside.</br>
</br>
The food outside the mansion was different from the food inside.</br>
</br>
The former were wholesale seafood from Australia, while the latter was fresh food purchased from the market on Coro Island.</br>
</br>
After finishing, Jiang Chen didn't immediately return to the modern world, but walked around the camp to destress.</br>
</br>
It was the end of December, there was a lot of snow in Wanghai on the wasteland.</br>
</br>
White velvet snow covered every inch of land there. Under the sunshine, the snow reflected a gold-plated sheen. Snowplow vehicles operated in the square, pushing snow to the outside of the base. Children ran from across, picking up snowballs to play. Soldiers lined up with rifles and patrolled with Reptile drones.</br>
</br>
Along the way, people who saw him all stopped their work and saluted.</br>
</br>
The General, who resumed the order of the city, was revered in the heart by the survivors living there.</br>
</br>
As for those who saluted to him, Jiang Chen just smiled and didn't disturb their work.</br>
</br>
To be honest, watching the respect in their eyes from the bottom of their heart really made him feel warm and fuzzy inside.</br>
</br>
When he passed the rocket launch site, he suddenly remembered something, so he paced toward the Aerospace Technology Research Institute.</br>

</br>
Modern world, Somalia, Mogadishu.</br>
</br>
A man in a leather jacket with luggage walked out of the airport with giant strides. Above his high noseÂ was a pair of round sunglasses; his well-defined face looked quite vicious. Just from his appearance, this guy wasn't someone to be messed with!</br>
</br>
Standing outside the airport, Garrett looked around then pressed on his headset.</br>
</br>
"This is Garrett, arrived at Mogadishu Airport... Roger."</br>
</br>
Like in a video game, the blue road sign directly appeared in his field of view, marking the mission site.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, this stuff is really convenient," he murmured to himself.</br>
</br>
His gaze locked onto his destination. Through the crowd, he walked straight towards the blue road sign.</br>
</br>
He walked directly on a street and turned into a local hotel. He didn't go to reception; instead, he went straight upstairs. He stopped at room 503 then gently pushed the door.</br>
</br>
The door opened.</br>
</br>
Just like as the Ghost Agent said, the door wasn't locked.</br>
</br>
Garrett walked inside. His boots crunched on the wooden floor. Carefully checking his surroundings, he closed the door behind, went straight to the bed, and took out a card from under the pillow.</br>
</br>
Everything was according to the mission briefing.</br>
</br>
With a grin, he then crouched down and pulled out a password-protected briefcase.</br>
</br>
He entered the password. With a click, the briefcase opened, exposing the black lacquer of the Reaper Assault Rifle as well as orange-colored bullets and cartridge.</br>
</br>
He dumped the equipment onto the bed, stuffed the rifle and drones into the bag, and inserted the pistols into his pocket. After arming himself, he left with the briefcase.</br>
</br>
When he went downstairs, a grey-shirted man extinguished his cigarette and stepped forward.</br>
</br>
"Sir, do you need a bodyguard? 400 dollars a day. I can guarantee your safety in Somalia."</br>
</br>
"Do you have a car?"</br>
</br>
"Of course. In Somalia, the bodyguards are the drivers." The man smiled, revealing his white teeth.</br>
</br>
Garret nodded then waved.</br>
</br>
"Take me to your car."</br>
</br>
"Okay. My name is a bit long - you foreigners might not be used to saying it, so you can call me Nasheed."</br>
</br>
"Smith," Garrett said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Smith was the name on his passport.</br>
</br>
Nasheed's car was parked near a fruit stand. Not far from the fruit stand were a few children eating apples.</br>
</br>
After shooing away the children, Nasheed opened the door and invited Garrett to get in.</br>
</br>
It was a modified Toyota pickup; the trailer in the back had clear signs of welding marks. Needless to say, this guy must've been a pirate or something, the reason being that Toyota pickup trucks combined with 50-caliber machine guns were almost the standard for terrorists.</br>
</br>
After playing hide and seek with terrorists in Iraq for more than five years, Garrett knew these things too well.</br>
</br>
But at that moment, he didn't say anything. He got into the front seat and fastened his seat belt.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Where to?" The driver started the car and turned to ask.</br>
</br>
"Hudur."</br>
</br>
Nasheed, almost about to drive, suddenly paused.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter?" Garrett asked.</br>
</br>
"It's not safe there and I don't suggest you go... That's one of Sabah'sÂ strongholds, and you must've heard they're unfriendly to Americans," Nasheed said.</br>
</br>
Garrett grinned.</br>
</br>
"Just take me there and drop me off."</br>
</br>
Nasheed made a helpless expression.</br>
</br>
"If you insist."</br>
</br>
While Garret traveled on the car, a woman with a black turban drove to the desert north of Hudur.</br>
</br>
The second-hand car was parked next to a sand dune. The woman pulled off her turban while throwing the black robe in the car, exposing a pretty face, and an Optical Illusion combat suit in a sand color.</br>
</br>
When she got to the back of the car, she pulled open the trunk and took out the hidden Ghost Sniper Rifle as well as a drone backpack.</br>
</br>
Putting the sniper rifle over her shoulder, she opened the hologram map, confirmed the coordinates of the targeted salt factory and the contours of the surrounding terrain, then headed for the dunes next to it.</br>
</br>
The small drone terminal was behind the sand dune. She immediately activated optical invisibility and headed for the top of the dune.</br>
</br>
Creeping on the sand, she set up her sniper rifle. The crosshairs locked onto the salt factory hidden in the hamlet.</br>
</br>
"Ghost Bird is in place, waiting for attack orders."</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
In the laboratory of the salt factory, Tanaka inserted a glass tube into a flask filled with a clear-colored liquid and carefully introduced the blue-colored reagent. The moment the blue liquid mixed with the transparent liquid, a chemical reaction suddenly occurred. The originally incompatible blue liquid beads instantly disappeared.</br>
</br>
A man, who was standing by the side, incredulously watched this scene.</br>
</br>
"Have you learned yet?" Tanaka asked smilingly.</br>
</br>
The man disguised his surprised look, pretended he hadn't heard, and looked away.</br>
</br>
"No need to be nervous. I know Sabah sent you here to learn. You have to be careful when producing this virus; you could kill everyone if you don't pay attention."</br>
</br>
Just then, the door was suddenly pushed open and a brown-skinned man came in and spoke two words to Tanaka in Japanese.</br>
</br>
"They're here."</br>
</br>
Tanaka looked a little surprised, but he soon returned to normal. He removed the glass tube from the rack then walked to another table.</br>
</br>
"They're actually here. It seems that Jiang Chen can still surprise me."</br>
</br>
"What to do?" asked the brown-skinned man.</br>
</br>
"How many tons of salt have been transferred to the desert?"</br>
</br>
"97 tons."</br>
</br>
Tanaka nodded, pleased. He picked up the test tube, poured a little bit of unknown powder inside, poured the cloudy liquid in the test tube into the flask and pressed on the cork.</br>
</br>
The flask was placed in front of an incandescent lamp. Looking at the oil-like luster on the surface, Tanaka smiling unconsciously.</br>
</br>
"Very good, that's enough."</br>
</br>
He tucked the flask into the hand of a black man. Tanaka patted him on the shoulder and spoke in English.</br>
</br>
"After observing it so many times, you should try it yourself."</br>
</br>
The man looked at the flask then at Tanaka, confused.</br>
</br>
"What, what should I do?"</br>
</br>
"Add a sample of embryonic stem cells from that brown bottle over there, put it into a petri dish and incubate it for two hours at 37Â°C then the virus's last step is done. I'm going to the washroom and going to grab something to eat. Rest assured - I completed the dangerous steps. You can do it!"</br>
</br>
Tanaka and the brown man left, leaving behind a confused chemist.</br>
</br>
"Did you tell him the recipe?"</br>
</br>
"That's right. He won't live for long anyway," Tanaka said with a smile.</br>
</br>
In the village where the salt factory was located, there were about 1,000 people, including the elderly, women and children. 500 of them were directly or indirectly in the drug business. With the help of Sabab, Tanaka had taken over Mr. Zhu's business effortlessly, and now he was the boss.</br>
</br>
So when he walked out of the salt factory, these foolish natives looked at him with awe.</br>
</br>
They weren't aware he was the man who would bring them death.</br>
</br>
Tanaka walked to the front of the parked Toyota pickup and opened the door but didn't sit inside. He looked up at the glaring sun. His eyes narrowed and he whispered, "The Kurufune is welcoming its last moment. Soon, the whole world will remember our name, fear it, and embrace the era of Harmony in the soothing horn of doomsday. Sakda, do you choose to meet our enemies here or follow me to the end?"</br>
</br>
"Is there any difference?"</br>
</br>
"No difference. Our fate is the same."</br>
</br>
"Then I choose to meet them here," the brown-skinned man said.</br>
</br>
A cloud covered the gradually lowering sun.</br>
</br>
Tanaka nodded with a smile as he patted Sakda's back.</br>
</br>
"Best of luck."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
When the door opened, the northern wind blew snow all over the ground.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen closed the door, hung his winter coat on a hook, and walked to the Aerospace Technology Research Institute.</br>
</br>
Compared to the previous "workshop," the snow-covered Aerospace Technology Research Institute could undoubtedly be called a proper workshop. It had a wide lobby and was a five-story building. Although researchers were still in short supply, at least it was more spacious.</br>
</br>
He went straight to Jiang Lin's lab and saw him working with several researchers in lab coats around a two-person tall oil drum.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen went up then looked at the barrel for a moment.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"It's called the 'Messenger,' a space telescope that belonged to the Pan-Asia Cooperation. It has a maximum observation range of 13.8 billion light-years and captures light from the beginning of the Big Bang. It can directly observe galaxies in 1-50 light years, photograph the landforms of the planets, it can also be used to observe black holes, dark matter, etcâ¦" As he put some things aside, Jiang Lin explained to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Good lord, where did this thing come from?" Jiang Chen, clearly intrigued, stared at the object.</br>
</br>
"The Zhao Corporation got it from the Taipei Space Launch Base. It was originally used to explore extraterrestrial civilizations. However, before it was put into use, the Third World War broke out, so this was brought into Taipei's Fallout Shelter... You told me to collect all equipment related to space, so I bought it."</br>
</br>
"How much was it?"</br>
</br>
"10000 credits." Jiang Lin shrugged.</br>
</br>
10,000 credits was a huge sum for the average person, but it was nothing for NAC. If this was before the war, this space telescope would've cost at least billions of dollars' worth of pan-Asian currency. Now, it was worth a thousand canned foods.</br>
</br>
"Great value, you did an excellent job." Jiang Chen laughed then looked at the thing a few more times. "How was this repaired?"</br>
</br>
"This wasn't broken to begin with, but it wasn't completed. The survivors on the Taipei side sold the design drawings and the ground monitoring equipment to us. As long as we digest the technology and create the remaining parts, we just need to install it before it's good to go."</br>
</br>
Once this space telescope was completed and launched by Celestial Trade, the mysterious veil of the Natural Selection and Gliese 581g planet would also be completely uncovered. Only when the enemy was seen with one's own eyes could earth have the possibility of fighting its enemy.</br>
</br>
After telling Jiang Lin to complete the space telescope as soon as possible, Jiang Chen left the Institute. On his way to the community center, he happened to see Wang Qing, who was looking for him.</br>
</br>
From her face, there was a matter of urgency.</br>
</br>
"What happened?" Jiang Chen stopped and looked at her.</br>
</br>
Wang Ching nodded.</br>
</br>
</br>
"A distress signal came from Liuding Town."</br>
</br>
"Liuding Town?"</br>
</br>
While Liuding town still remained independent from the order of NAC-led Wanghai City, it had now become a vassal of NAC with close economic ties. For no other reason, no matter how strong its air force and long-range firepower were, its foundation was ultimately the sea, and they relied heavily on imports from onshore survivors.</br>
</br>
Think about it - what kind of industry could be supported by an aircraft carrier?</br>
</br>
More and more small and medium-sized survival campsÂ envied the jurisdiction of the NAC. With closer trading with the Sixth Street, they had taken the initiative to join the NAC economic zone and accept the protection of the NAC military government. This could also save a considerable amount of tariffs and military expenses. Among these was the Beer Bottle Company that provided ammunition supplies for Liuding Town and the small harbor towns that had close trade ties with Liuding...</br>
</br>
For these small and medium-sized survival camps, NAC gave them a high degree of autonomy. The only requirement was to abide by the NAC-designated constitution and pay taxes to NAC according to their charter.</br>
</br>
All the pawns had taken refuge in NAC, and Liuding naturally became a pawn of NAC. Although they were unwilling to accept this fact, after several internal meetings in the Liuding government under the leadership of the capitalist Tang Miya, Liuding and NAC signed a defense pact symbolizing their friendship.</br>
</br>
When they received a request for assistance from Liuding Town, NAC was certainly obliged to respond.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen hadn't imagined he would run into this on a temporary trip.</br>
</br>
"Who's the enemy?" Jiang Chen looked at Wang Qing.</br>
</br>
"I'm still not sure if it's an enemy..." Wang Qing shook her head. "A destroyer appeared close to the Bohai Aircraft Carrier and has been hovering five kilometers away from the port of Wanghai. Since they're unsure if it's a hostile force, Liuding has been tense lately."</br>
</br>
[Destroyer?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen furrowed his brows slightly.</br>
</br>
What worried him wasn't that it was a destroyer, but that a new force had appeared in the sea near Wanghai. If they possessed a destroyer, presumably their forces weren't small. Whether this destroyer was inherited from before the war or made by them, it proved they wouldn't be easy to deal with.</br>
</br>
And what made him most surprised was that someone could actually travel freely on the dangerous seas?</br>
</br>
Zhao Chenwu mentioned before that the Zhao Corporation had a small fleet, but it basically didn't dare to leave shallow waters and only sailed along the island mass. The monsters in the ocean were far more dangerous than those on land.</br>
</br>
Aside from polarized extreme variants, the strongest mutant on land was the Mother of Death Claw, and they even trembled in front of electromagnetic pulse cannons. In the ocean, both the upper and lower limits were unknown.</br>
</br>
After all, species, whether quantity, density, or size, weren't at an order of magnitude. Disregarding everything else, a mutated blue whale was almost equivalent in size to a Bohai Aircraft Carrier. Jiang Chen had seen the photo of the mutated blue whale; it was shot by the merchants who sailed to Japan. Its massive size made it impossible for him to imagine what weapons could defeat it.</br>
</br>
"Did Liuding try to contact the destroyer?"</br>
</br>
"They've tried to get in touch with them, but the other side seems to be averse to contact."</br>
</br>
They didn't want to engage in conversation; they were just hovering in the distance.</br>
</br>
It was evident why Liuding felt nervous. Both parties were too close to each other, and any misjudgment could lead to battle. If the opposite destroyer struck, the Bohai Aircraft Carrier, which had its engine broken for more than two decades, couldn't evade an attack.</br>
</br>
"What message did Liuding send?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"They want us to honor the defense pact," Wang Qing said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and said after a moment of contemplation:</br>
</br>
"Deploy a battalion of forces from the First Division on Hengsha Island and send engineering teams to build forts and fortifications on the island. Give this to Cheng Weiguo. He knows what to do."</br>
</br>
"Hengsha Island is outside the jurisdiction of NAC. There are two different mutant nests in the area. Do we send troops directly?" Wang Qing asked.</br>
</br>
"Mutants nests? Perfect - NAC's artillery hasn't performed military exercises for a long time. Bombard the area then enter." Jiang Chen waved his hand and ordered.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Wang Qing saluted.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 708: Operation: Black</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Somalia, Hudur region. It was sunny.</br>
</br>
A large net was formed around the village where the salt factory was located. Garrett, a modified warrior, was responsible for the frontal attack. He was supported by a Ghost Agent, as well as a Celestial Trade Marine Corps soldier who was deployed in the vicinity as backup. All combat units had arrived in their scheduled positions.</br>
</br>
They were only waiting for the night to execute their mission!</br>
</br>
The sun began to set, and a dim halo shrouded the outer edge of the red terrain of the earth, scattering a blood-like color to the surrounding sand dunes. Dark-skinned villagers with long branches shooed the goats back into the pen. A truck drove on the dirt road and raised a cloud of dust. Several armed militants carrying AK-47s jumped off the vehicle and ordered the villagers next to them to unload the "tea leaves" on the truck and move them into the plant.</br>
</br>
The Ghost Agent on the sand dunes took a deep breath, shifted her gaze from the scope, and clicked the touchscreen on her right arm a few times.</br>
</br>
In order to prevent snipers from snooping, these militants cleverly pulled ropes between the buildings and hung dyed cloths on the rope. However, these methods weren't so effective for a Ghost Agent equipped with advanced technology.</br>
</br>
The only problem was the civilian population in the village - it was difficult to avoid accidental injuries.</br>
</br>
A holographic screen emerged. Before her eyes was a bird's eye view of the village. The drone had arrived over the salt factory. Using infrared identification devices, it marked the heat source belonging to the militants and used the two-line positioning method to directly present a three-dimensional position of the target on the Ghost Agent's retina.</br>
</br>
The sky finally turned dark.</br>
</br>
In addition to the armed militants who were still standing around, the villagers had already returned home and closed their doors and windows. The entire village was filled with silence. When the last light went out, Garrett, waiting by the highway, took out his Ripper Assault Rifle from his travel bag, loaded it cleanly, took the rifle and walked towards the wall on the periphery of the village.</br>
</br>
The Ghost Agent, codenamed Ghost Bird, had already shared the enemy's heat source coordinates on his chip. Although their dark skin color provided them with natural night camouflage, under the monitoring of drones, they were no different from people sitting underneath a spotlight.</br>
</br>
"At three o'clock, there are two sentinels."</br>
</br>
Leaning against the wall, Garrett pressed on the headset.</br>
</br>
"Can you hit them over there?"</br>
</br>
"There's a building in the way; you have to rely on yourself."</br>
</br>
"Okay." At the same time the voice faded, Garrett took out the drone from the backpack behind him and threw it in the air like he was throwing a Frisbee.</br>
</br>
Buzz-!</br>
</br>
A short buzzing sound whistled past. The two sentinels didn't have time to react before a series of blood splatters appeared and they collapsed into pools of blood.</br>
</br>
</br>
With a rifle, Garrett stepped out of the shadows and reached for the hummingbird drone that hovered over the bodies of the two men. He then proceeded in the direction of the salt factory with his rifle.</br>
</br>
At that moment, a shrill scream coming from the distance suddenly broke through the silence of the village. Then, on the other side of the village, there was heavy gunfire!</br>
</br>
Garrett's expression turned stern as he assumed his location had been exposed. He immediately rushed for cover and switched his rifle to automatic.</br>
</br>
The screams awakened the sleeping villagers and lamps began to light up.</br>
</br>
Of course, some people would never wake up again.</br>
</br>
The lights illuminated the dark village. Cries, screams, and gunfire mixed together. Garrett waited for a long time, but the envisaged siege didn't come.</br>
</br>
"The situation is odd." The Ghost Bird's voice appeared in his ear.</br>
</br>
"What happened? Can you see things from over there?" Garrett frowned.</br>
</br>
"Zombies. The villagers are infected and turned into zombies... The zombies are now attacking the militants and they're killing each other."</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
[This madman!]</br>
</br>
Garrett cursed, immediately lifted his rifle, and rushed toward the salt factory.</br>
</br>
This mission didn't receive approval from the Somali authorities. At the moment, all the people in the village turned into zombies. Such a big event was absolutely impossible to cover up! The heavy casualties of unrelated civilians would inevitably draw the attention of the local warlords, international watchdogs, and UA troops stationed in the Gulf of Aden.</br>
</br>
Celestial Trade definitely couldn't become the scapegoat!</br>
</br>
He had to finish this quick!</br>
</br>
Roar--!</br>
</br>
His dark skin stained with blood, a man dashed out of the darkness and rushed at Garrett. Judging from his ferocity and speed, he obviously wasn't an ordinary zombie!</br>
</br>
Garrett didn't avoid him at all. He reached out with one hand at lightning speed, grasping the neck of the zombie then snapped it in half. As he listened to the sound of the snap, the neck of the zombie broke and the bloodthirst in its pupils gradually faded.</br>
</br>
Without any pause, Garrett set up his rifle and continued to rush toward the salt factory.</br>
</br>
Gunfire resounded in the distance, and bullets coming from the side pierced through the zombies about to sneak up on Garrett.</br>
</br>
The terrain of the alley was too narrow, and the long range of his rifle made it difficult for it to be effective in close-range combat. Although they were there to destroy the virus, they didn't think they would encounter zombies there!</br>
</br>
[Damn it! I should've brought my machine gun here!]</br>
</br>
Blood spattered Garrett's face as he pulled out a dagger stuck in a zombie's eyes while he cussed into the communication channel.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! These zombies aren't right!"</br>
</br>
"They seem to be mutated... You better act fast. The mayhem here might have alerted the local military force. We didn't apply for entry, so they might not be very friendly."</br>
</br>
"I know!"</br>
</br>
After smashing down a zombie with his gunstock, Garrett unleashed some bullets and swept across seven or eight zombies. He whipped open a wooden door and rushed into a house.</br>
</br>
There was a zombie on the floor and a corpse being eaten. Before it reacted, he rushed into the backyard and took a deep breath then kicked against the sand wall.</br>
</br>
The titanium alloy bone was activated, and the built-in power module powered to its maximum.</br>
</br>
His foot hit it directly. With only a crackling sound, the entire sand wall collapsed and the two zombies behind the wall were directly knocked to the ground. Because the earlier commotion brought the zombies to the street, there were almost no zombies on this street.</br>
</br>
In front of him was the salt factory!</br>
</br>
While running, Garrett said while gritting his teeth:</br>
</br>
"Ghost, local military forces have discovered the situation here!"</br>
</br>
"Yes. Based on the satellite screen, you only have fifteen minutes."</br>
</br>
"That's enough!"</br>
</br>
The gunfire inside the plant had stopped. From the heat source information sent by the drone, the zombies had apparently won. Sabab, who dealt with the devil, was finally bitten by a devil.</br>
</br>
Kurofune had never had any allies. All human beings who refused to accept evolution were their enemies.</br>
</br>
Inside the factory, a dozen zombies with rifles still around their waists rushed toward Garrett.</br>
</br>
Orange-red flames jumped out from the muzzle. Garrett pressed the trigger and instantly exploded the zombies' heads.</br>
</br>
Clankâ</br>
</br>
A clip was emptied, so Garrett pulled out a new clip from his waist and was about to load it.</br>
</br>
At that very moment, a strong wind suddenly attacked from the side.</br>
</br>
Garrett, whose five senses had been strengthened, reacted immediately and placed his rifle in front ofÂ his chest.</br>
</br>
Boomâ</br>
</br>
Its gun body made out of plastic steel was actually broken in half by the direct blow.</br>
</br>
After throwing the broken weapon onto the ground, Garrett jumped back with force. He distanced himself from the man and locked his eyes onto him.</br>
</br>
"Who are you?"</br>
</br>
The brown-skinned man swung his arms and prepared himself to fight. The muscles of his body swelled at an unbelievable speed.</br>
</br>
"Who I am isn't important."</br>
</br>
His previously peaceful eyes suddenly turned ferocious.</br>
</br>
"You just need to know that today, you will die here with the identity of a Celestial Trade soldier."</br>
</br>
"Are you sure?" A menacing smile formed on Garrett's face.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 709: Tokyo Ghoul</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the bustling streets of Yoto, a black van departed from an underground garage two blocks away from the Takeda Pharmaceutical Building.</br>
</br>
According to intelligence collected by Ghost Agents, the Ministry of Defense had taken the lead in transferring T virus data from Takeda Pharmaceutical today. In order to ensure complete security, not only the Ministry of Defense Intelligence Department, but also the Cabinet Intelligence Research Office, which directly obeyed the Prime Minister's orders, and the Second Division of the Ground Self-Defense Force, participated in the transfer.</br>
</br>
But on the day of the transfer, their actions were surprisingly low-key.</br>
</br>
In addition to the black van, all the Napon intelligence agency's energy was used to shift the attention of the CIB.</br>
</br>
Takeda Pharmaceutical's chairman, Tanimura, went missing. The Minister of Defense blamed this on the UA. In his opinion, no one else had the strength to be able to take Tanimura out of the country without anyone knowing.</br>
</br>
News about Tanimura's disappearance that they desperately tried to cover up was also first leaked from newspapers in State C, thousands of kilometers away. This was also evidence that supported Nakaya's speculations.</br>
</br>
However, the Nippon government didn't realize there were other people eyeing them.</br>
</br>
Just as the black van left the garage, a white car parked at the door of the clothing store about 200 meters away began to move too.</br>
</br>
"The target has left the garage."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
After closing the communication line, Shinanoha glanced at the screen on her right arm. Through the image from the drone, the position of the black van was confirmed and she kept a distance of 300 meters. It was located in the center of the city and it was inconvenient to execute the mission. As long as the target arrived at the destination street...</br>
</br>
Shinanoha's lips formed a smile.</br>
</br>
By the way, Shinanoha was just the name on her passport - her real name was Zhu Yu from Michigan.</br>
</br>
She had helped Jiang Chen many times and was one of the older agents. In order to ensure everything went smoothly, Jiang Chen sent her to Napon to plan the mission against Takeda Pharmaceutical after the cruise ship tragedy.</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu approached a red light so she stopped the car.</br>
</br>
The black van continued to drive to the targeted location, but she wasn't worried at all. From beginning to end, the van hadn't disappeared from the drone's monitor.</br>
</br>
At this moment, an unexpected event occurred!</br>
</br>
A Mercedes on the other side of the road suddenly turned its steering wheel, veered onto the opposite lane, and rammed into the black van without any warning.</br>
</br>
No one could react in time.</br>
</br>
The Mercedes was obviously modified, and it flipped the black van over.</br>
</br>
The crowd screamed and fled, but Hell had only just begun.</br>
</br>
Boom!</br>
</br>
Fire erupted from the Mercedes, immediately swallowing the black van and the nearby crowd. The flying debris blew away the escaping passers-by, spilling blood and broken limbs on the street. The braking vehicles collided and rammed into the shops along the street. The sudden explosion completely paralyzed the traffic on this road.</br>
</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu, who was waiting at the traffic light, stared at the fire blankly.</br>
</br>
Immediately, she reacted, entered the return command for the drone, and updated her partner at the ambush location.</br>
</br>
"The target has been destroyed, the mission is canceled..."</br>
</br>
Someone exploded the data and samples of the virus into pieces right in front of them. Was it the CIB? No, they wouldn't want to destroy the virus but obtain the virus! Who could it beâ¦</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu's eyebrows furrowed as she was lost in thought.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, a shrill scream outside the window shook her.</br>
</br>
"It'sâ¦ it's a zombie!"</br>
</br>
"That's a lie! How could that be! How could this appear in Yoto!"</br>
</br>
"Run!"</br>
</br>
"Drive! Drive! Drive!"</br>
</br>
Noisy shouting and car whistles could be heard; traffic accidents near the intersection completely ravaged the entire neighborhood. The sudden outbreak of the T virus turned everything into horrific mayhem.</br>
</br>
It wasn't an anime, and it wasn't a movie.</br>
</br>
The bloody living-dead walked through the stagnant traffic and used their hands, that couldn't feel pain, to open windows. They pounced at the fleeing people, bit all the flesh and blood they could see and expanded the numbers of living-dead.</br>
</br>
Seeing the blood in front of her, Zhu Yu suddenly recalled something.</br>
</br>
The vehicle not only contained the virus data, but also Tanaka's newly developed improved virus samples...</br>
</br>
There was no time to delay; she awaiting death by staying in that car!</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu immediately opened the car door and followed the direction of the crowd, heading away from the source of infection.</br>
</br>
At that very moment, a familiar face suddenly appeared on the big screen next to the street.</br>
</br>
A pleasant face appeared with an iconic flat cap.</br>
</br>
"Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tanaka..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In Somalia, thousands of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
In the salt factory, Garrett confronted Sakda.</br>
</br>
Watching the gestures of the man in front of him, Garrett's eyes narrowed slightly.</br>
</br>
"Muay Thai?"</br>
</br>
Sakda didn't speak and responded with his fists.</br>
</br>
Woosh.</br>
</br>
The sound of wind breaking rang in his ear. His opponent's iron fist that seemed capable of breaking through his steel plate made Garrett suddenly turn serious and disregard all his contempt.</br>
</br>
There was another sound of a fist breaking the air. Sakda skillfully took a jab before he followed with a powerful elbow strike directly onto Garrett's face.</br>
</br>
Pooch!</br>
</br>
After a muffled sound followed by a drop of cold sweat, Sakda's pupils gradually enlarged.</br>
</br>
His elbow strike felt like it hit an iron plate...</br>
</br>
No, if it was an iron plate, he had the confidence he could penetrate it with his genetic modification. At the moment, however, it was as if the man's arm was in front of him and he easily blocked his strike. Not only that, but judging by the sharp pain from his hand, his right hand was crippled.</br>
</br>
It seemed that the man in front of him had also experienced some degree of "mutation."</br>
</br>
And it was a more horrifying transformation.</br>
</br>
"Don't be surprised - my bones are made of titanium!"</br>
</br>
Garrett grinned and punched his face, caving his nose right in. His entire cheekbone broke into pieces.</br>
</br>
"Take this punch for the guy called Tanaka. After you go to hell, thank him for me."</br>
</br>
After lobbing Sakda to the side, who was no longer breathing, Garrett opened the hologram map and walked toward the target destination.</br>
</br>
Pushing open the wooden door, he arrived at the basement of the salt factory. The viral density here was extremely high, but for Garrett, who was injected with a genetic vaccine, a high density the virus had no effect on him.</br>
</br>
He nonchalantly finished the zombies that pounced at him and he headed straight for the source of the infection.</br>
</br>
The source of infection was a petri dish, from which the virus leaked.</br>
</br>
There were dozens of bath salt bags next to it. There were also dangerous bottles of glass on the table.</br>
</br>
All the viruses were here.</br>
</br>
"Only 11 kilograms...how could that be?!"</br>
</br>
Garrett gritted his teeth and immediately released a drone. However, he searched the entire salt factory and didn't find Tanaka or any more viruses.</br>
</br>
There was only one possibility!</br>
</br>
The Kurofune had already transferred all the raw materials and made new viruses!</br>
</br>
Garrett punched the wall and made a dent in the concrete wall.</br>
</br>
"F*ck!"</br>
</br>
At the same time, the voice of Ghost Bird resounded in his ear.</br>
</br>
"There are only five kilometers left before the local military force arrives. We must evacuate immediately."</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Garrett turned off his microphone and reluctantly looked back at the salt factory. He picked up his rifle broken in half from the floor and departed the salt factory.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 710: Messy Situation</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Ayesha called Jiang Chen back to the modern world through the Fourth Dimensional Messenger on the EP.</br>
</br>
He never thought that after being only gone for a while, the world would change dramatically.</br>
</br>
First was news from Ghost Agents in Nippon.</br>
</br>
There was a T virus outbreak in Yoto, the entire Shinagawa area was quarantined, and more than 100,000 people were infected. The Defense Forces sent in 5,000 combat units to Yoto. At the same time, the UA troops stationed in Nippon also dispatched five Osprey helicopters, dropped a company of Marines, and went to Shinagawa to carry out rescue activities.</br>
</br>
It was also in this incident that Tanaka's face appeared on a big screen in Ginza, marking his first public appearance.</br>
</br>
"Good afternoon, my name is Tanaka."</br>
</br>
"You may not be familiar with my name, but it doesn't matter. You must've heard of the virus I developed."</br>
</br>
"You don't have to try to understand the motives behind my action. If you really want to get to the bottom, it's probably war."</br>
</br>
"Yes, this is war."</br>
</br>
"Human civilization will usher the dawn without hypocrisy and sin. Look forward to the day Kurofune arrives."</br>
</br>
"I wish you the best of luck."</br>
</br>
Although Tanaka called his actions "war," the world media still categorized the attack as an "act of terrorism" and referred to it as the Asian version of the September 11 incident. The Defense Force and the UA military in Nippon took control of the situation immediately. They used barbed wire to create a quarantine zone and evacuated survivors from the area.</br>
</br>
However, the tens of thousands of casualties still cast a shadow on the country and the entire world.</br>
</br>
Similar incidents had occurred in the past. In March 1995, a certain evil organization in Nippon released sarin gas in the Metro, causing heavy casualties. However, compared to the number of casualties of the T virus leak, the '95 event was nothing in comparison.</br>
</br>
"We express deep sorrow for the crisis that occurred in Nippon. We strongly condemn the use of biological and chemical weapons against unarmed civilians!"</br>
</br>
"This is a global disaster. To the nine citizens who died in the virus incident... Our Seals will provide you with an explanation."</br>
</br>
"The Kremlin has issued a national warrant for arrest. If Tanaka or the Kurofune appears in Russia..."</br>
</br>
"France..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
However, on the third day of the T virus incident in Yoto, the town north of Hudur in Somalia attracted the attention of the entire world.</br>
</br>
Overnight, 987 villagers and 45 militants all died of unnatural causes.</br>
</br>
The cause of death was the T virus!</br>
</br>
No, to be precise, it was the improved version of the T virus.</br>
</br>
The local military forces dispatched troops to the target village immediately after hearing gunfire and explosions. However, this group apparently underestimated the combat effectiveness of the zombies. They directly drove Toyota pickup trucks with their machine guns and rammed inside.</br>
</br>
</br>
If they were ordinary zombies, perhaps they could be easily suppressed by more than a dozen guns, but these zombies were mutated.</br>
</br>
In particular, this type of zombie, whose muscles were swollen and tumor-like, could directly knock over a pickup from the side, and these militiamen realized their sloppy behavior had struck the hornet's nest.</br>
</br>
The thirty militias who rushed into the village became food. The warlords who controlled the Belvedere area immediately sent a regiment of troops to block the desert north of Hudur and set up checkpoints in the distance. Soldiers were sent to evacuate villagers from the area.</br>
</br>
However, they obviously weren't effective.</br>
</br>
Within two days, the zombies spread to neighboring areas and turned villages with populations of at least five thousand into places of the living-dead.</br>
</br>
However, the problematic part was that the village viral outbreak was located on the border between Somalia and Ethiopia and was an area with disputed borders. Because of the chaotic political situation in Somalia, the warlords didn't seek help from the United Nations. They stupidly chose to block the news, which pitted them against neighboring Ethiopia.</br>
</br>
It wasn't until the third day of the incident that Ethiopia received news from a town on its side. "Strange" people were crossing the border from Somalia, and they opened their mouths to bite people...</br>
</br>
Fortunately, the Ethiopian military dispatched the forces of a division immediately and even used armored vehicles and tanks to keep the zombies out of their borders.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Ethiopia sought help from the United Nations.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of these political tensions that despite the simultaneous outbreak of the T virus in Yoto, the virus incident in Somalia wasn't known to the world until three days later.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
New Moon Island, Celestial Trade Military Base. Garrett stood at Jiang Chen's desk. His face was both embarrassed and anxious. The Ghost Agent who stood next to him, code-named Ghost Bird, originally named Penny, was also considered an experienced agent.</br>
</br>
However, the mission took a surprising turn.</br>
</br>
"What happened in Somalia? Garrett, you go first." Jiang Chen's finger tapped on the table and he didn't have the most pleasant expression.</br>
</br>
"We set up a capture plan, but Tanaka wasn't in the salt factory... The T virus found in the salt factory was only 11 kilograms," Garrett said with his back straight.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Penny.</br>
</br>
Penny's expression was a bit more awkward, because the intelligence was collected by the Ghost Agent, and they had received credible news from their informant. Tanaka had been in the salt factory for several days and there were at least three trucks driving into the village each day. He took the tea leaves smuggled from Ethiopia.</br>
</br>
Yet on the day of the mission, Tanaka disappeared?</br>
</br>
Also gone were the virus-raising materials and viruses made by Tanaka in the past few days.</br>
</br>
"Sorry."</br>
</br>
"Hundreds of kilograms of virus extracts are missing, and there are nearly 100 tons of viral raw materials missing. What do you think I want to hear from you?" Jiang Chen stared into Penny's eyes and took a deep breath, but he didn't continue to make things difficult for her.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen's watch vibrated.</br>
</br>
He previously told Jean to monitor news on the Internet about the T virus. Now that she was calling him, it was probably regarding this very reason.</br>
</br>
"You can go first," Jiang Chen dismissed the two of them as he took the call.</br>
</br>
"Roger!"</br>
</br>
Garrett and Penny sighed in relief, looked at each other and turned around.</br>
</br>
After the office door was closed, Jiang Chen pressed down on the watch and Jean's holographic image appeared beside his hand.</br>
</br>
"New news."</br>
</br>
"What news?"</br>
</br>
"The Belvedere Regional Army refused to execute the request signed by the Somali authorities regarding the UA military's takeover of the affected area and threatened to withdraw all checkpoints set up outside the infected zone if the UA military forcibly entered the infected area and allowed zombies to proliferate to the entire region of Somalia."</br>
</br>
"Well, that fool is playing with fire then?"</br>
</br>
Not everyone had the capital to use the virus as a bargaining chip. The Belvedere regional warlords obviously overestimated their fighting power. After the events in Yoto, they still dared to act so recklessly; it was like they were trying to be the enemy of the whole world!</br>
</br>
Jean's next words confirmed Jiang Chen's speculations.</br>
</br>
"Two hours ago, the United Nations passed a war resolution. Six F-18 Hornets took off from the UA military base in the Gulf of Aden, and they also deployed 12 Osprey transport aircrafts."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 711"/>
<div class="totop" >

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 711: The War at Somalia</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The United Nations approved the NATO's dispatch of troops to Somalia with three votes for and two against.</br>
</br>
The Somalia authorities accepted the resolution and expressed their willingness to cooperate with NATO's military operations. Belvedere warlord with the Youth Party leaders all issued statements that the actions of the Somali authorities were "shameless betrayals," and would carry this war of resistance to the end.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the UA, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and other countries declared war on the Belvedere warlords and Ethiopia authorized NATO with military passage.</br>
</br>
Such a rapid response was reminiscent of the 2001 war in Afghanistan. Perhaps it was out of vengeance for allies, perhaps because of the terrifying death rate of the T virus, or perhaps because from the very beginning, it was a war involving all humanity.</br>
</br>
Any organization that provides shelter for Tanaka will be uprooted, no matter the costs!</br>
</br>
More than 200,000 troops from both sides were involved. NATO and the Somali government invested 90,000 people in total, while the Belvedere warlord mobilized 150,000. The first round of fire broke out in in the northeastern part of the capital, Mogadishu.</br>
</br>
The battle outcome was obvious. With the support of the UA Djibouti Air Force Base, thousands of warfare missiles nearly paralyzed all the armored units of the Belvedere warlords. The NATO ground forces relied on mechanized armor and cooperated with ground forces to advance toward Belvedere.</br>
</br>
However, the battle situation was not as easy as the UA imagined.</br>
</br>
The Belvedere warlords who were proficient in guerrilla tactics and relying on Toyota pickups and standard 107 rocket launchers, raided the M1A1 main battle tank at close range at an incredible pace. This caused a lot of trouble for the UA armored units and soldiers.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Belvedere warlord received messages from his allies. Support from organizations such as Libyan and Al-Qaeda were extremely tenacious in the fight.</br>
</br>
Perhaps these "indigenous" would eventually lose, but for the war to finish, it may not happen until next month.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After putting down the newspaper in his hands, Jiang Chen sighed and after a few moments of despair, he said to Jean.</br>
</br>
"Help me to contact Xia Shiyu. Prepare 5 billion liquidity assets from the group. I want to acquire Yoto real estate. The economic crisis in Napon is inevitable.</br>
</br>
"Okay, Mr. Chairman... but is now the time to consider this?" Jean asked.</br>
</br>
"You don't understand. Man is an economic creature." Jiang Chen shook his head and smiled, saying something that made the artificial intelligence confused.</br>
</br>
It was two days since he came back. Five days has passed since the Yoto T virus incident.</br>
</br>
The sudden approval by the United Nations of NATO's military actions against Belvedere's warlords had muddled the situation in Somalia. However, the key figure, Tanaka, was still missing.</br>
</br>
</br>
The Ghost Agent analyzed the footage captured by the Skyeye X1 spy satellite and finally determined that on the day of the attack, Tanaka left Somalia on a convoy back to Ethiopian tea gardens. However, because all everyone wore headscarves and their facial features were indistinguishable, the investigation couldn't progress.</br>
</br>
However, at this time, the informant that the Ghost Agent spent heavily on training in Sabab was once again playing a key role!</br>
</br>
According to intelligence, Sabab (The Youth Party) had recently come to start transferring people and equipment to the Mandela region of Kenya. Mandela was located at the junction of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia where the religious situations were complicated.</br>
</br>
"Next time your informant contacts you, ask him how the brain is grown on their leader's head." Putting the information in his hands on the table, Jiang Chen's brows was no longer twisted together.</br>
</br>
Penny shrugged, and reported to Jiang Chen in a helpless voice.</br>
</br>
"They believe that as long as they have control of the T virus that is feared by other Western countries, it is equivalent to controlling nuclear weapons and will be able to achieve parity with the mainstream countries of the world and negotiate to achieve their own political aspirations. Therefore, after trading with Tanaka, Sabab, which was originally a marginalized terrorist organization, immediately received the attention and assistance from IS, Al Qaeda, and Taliban. Until now, they still count on Tanaka to help them win the war."</br>
</br>
"They are dreaming." Jiang Chen groaned.</br>
</br>
Apart from that, countries will purchase large quantities of antiviral vaccines from Future Biology every month. The poor African people may not be immune to the vaccine.</br>
</br>
"What about us?"</br>
</br>
"We are going to kick them so they wake up."</br>
</br>
After taking a document from the desk, Jiang Chen signed his own name and then tossed it in Penny's arms.</br>
</br>
"Last chance, we only have one chance. Destroy the virus and destroy the Kurofune," Jiang Chen starred at her emerald green eyes and said word by word.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's stare was a little suffocating, but her back remained straight.</br>
</br>
"I understand!"</br>
</br>
"Then go now."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved and signaled that Penny could leave.</br>
</br>
Taking the document from the office, Penny closedÂ the door.</br>
</br>
The office was empty again. Jiang Chen took a deep breath and rubbed his temples.</br>
</br>
"Jean, do you have any good ideas?"</br>
</br>
Jean's hologram figure surfaced beside him and looked blankly at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Ask, what is a good idea?"</br>
</br>
"Kill Tanaka," said Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Jean was silent for two seconds and said.</br>
</br>
"Is it difficult?"</br>
</br>
"He is as slippery as a rat, and harder to kill than a cockroach. He could "resurrect" several times, and we know nothing about it."</br>
</br>
"What does he want?" Jean asked.</br>
</br>
"To destroy the world?"</br>
</br>
"With one person, how could he destroy the world?"</br>
</br>
"The T virus in his hands, and the Kurofune lightyears away is plotting for him."</br>
</br>
"Then destroy all the viruses and then cut off the contact with the Kurofune."</br>
</br>
Jean's answer was abstract.</br>
</br>
Destroy all viruses? It was not that simple, what he can do now is to follow behind the trail of the Kurofune. Find the drug plant and send the soldiers there.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile, but suddenly, he paused.</br>
</br>
Wait, destroy the virus...</br>
</br>
He suddenly thought of an idea.</br>
</br>
Although somewhat absurd, it seemed feasible...</br>
</br>
NATO's military operations disrupted the situation in the Somali region. This was bound to have an impact on the mission of Celestial Trade. On the other hand, the chaotic situation, at the same time, provided the second military operation of Celestial Trade a chance to take advantage of this mess.</br>
</br>
On December 31, the NATO coalition forces exchanged fires with Belvedere warlords on the outskirts of Belvedere. This was the gateway to Belvedere. Belvedere suddenly announced that it would withdraw all checkpoints in the affected area and "release" thousands of infected people.</br>
</br>
Condemnation had no meaning. The Ethiopian army suddenly announced its participation in the war. Tanks and infantries crossed the border and took over the garrison in the infected area.</br>
</br>
Belvedere warlords were facing enemies in the front and back. Their demise was only a matter of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow</br>
</br>
At the same time, Garrett, Ghost Agents, and 12 Celestial Trade Marine Corps soldiers arrived in Kenya along with their equipment.</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 712: Arriving in Nippon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
This was Jiang Chen's first visit to Nippon.</br>
</br>
When he stepped out of the private jet, he could clearly see the depression in Yoto from the scene at the airport.</br>
</br>
It was hard to imagine that there were only a few people in the giant airport. The convoy waited at the airport gate, accompanying him was Future Group's subsidiary in Nippon and the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nippon...</br>
</br>
"Welcome, Mr. Jiang Chen, I'm Takagi, nice to meet you." Once served as Ambassador of Hua, Takagi was very fluent in Han, and had a respectful attitude toward Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
However, the Nippon people were always respectful to everyone, Jiang Chen couldn't tell whether he meant it or not.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Takagi." Jiang Chen shook his hand courteously.</br>
</br>
After some small talks, Jiang Chen learned his identity.</br>
</br>
This guy came from a surprisingly powerful background. He was actually the deputy minister of the Ministry of Economy and Trade.</br>
</br>
Sitting on the sedan sent by the subsidiary, Takagi got in alone too. He chatted with Jiang Chen while exploring the meaning of Jiang Chen's visit.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang Chen, forgive me for being straight forward. The situation in Yoto is very chaotic. It is not theÂ best time for a sightseeing trip."</br>
</br>
"Haha, Mr. Takagi is a comical guy." Jiang Chen avoided answering the question, but laughed and diverted the subject, "I wonder what are some good places to visit?"</br>
</br>
Takagi took a moment to process as he was stunned but quickly returned to normal and smiled.</br>
</br>
"If you plan to go sightseeing, I recommend Mount Fuji."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Of course, Jiang Chen did not plan to sightsee. As Takagi said, there were no scenic views of Napon at this time.</br>
</br>
There were few vehicles on the streets. Other than the traffic lights, Jiang Chen's car didn't stop at all. There were very few pedestrians on both sides of the street. Even if someone was passing by, they were in a hurry.</br>
</br>
Although this T virus leak occurred only in Shinagawa, it destroyed the order in Yoto. Thousands of companies filed for bankruptcy protection overnight and hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs. The Napon Prime Minister announced last night that the country was in a state of emergency. Citizens who lacked food and household items needed to go to a designated place to collect rations...</br>
</br>
All the people in Nippon were surprised to find that their prime minister, who was "flourishing" in the international political scene, had his hair turn white overnight.</br>
</br>
Not only did the citizens of Yoto suffer, but the quality of life of the people in other parts of Nippon also fell significantly.</br>
</br>
The tourism, real estate, and retail sectors bore the brunt of the devastating blow and spread the economic crisis to other areas. However, the most serious loss was not among those industries, but the currency itself.</br>
</br>
Some time ago the prime minister was pushing for a monetary quantitative easing policy which already caused the exchange rate of the Yen against the Dollar to fall to 134:1. Although it has improved in 2017, it has never returned to 2014 levels.</br>
</br>
</br>
Before the outbreak of the virus, the international exchange rate of 1 Dollar was about 106 Yen. After the outbreak of the T virus, the exchange rate became 1:532.</br>
</br>
Feel this five-fold drop.</br>
</br>
Tanaka's T virus made Japan's wealthy class become the middle class overnight, the middle class become the working class, and the working class become refugees on the streets.</br>
</br>
Just yesterday, the Future Group injected US$5.2 billion in its subsidiary account in Yoto to prepare for the acquisition of small and medium-sized enterprises on the verge of bankruptcy in Nippon, as well as land, real estate, and skyscrapers that had been devaluedâ¦</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen's arrival, Napon politicians and entrepreneurs were both happy and worried. The good news during the country's monetary and financial system collapsing was that a foreign investor was willing to enter the market at this moment and inject vitality into this shaky economy. However, what they were afraid of was that Jiang Chen did not come to save their economy but to take money away from them.</br>
</br>
After getting off the car, Jiang Chen and Takagi bid farewell and entered the company building under the guidance of CEO Ren Pengfei.</br>
</br>
Future Group Nippon subsidiary was located in Shibuya. Because many high-tech companies gathered there, Shibuya was also known as the "Nippon Silicon Valley." Although close to Shinagawa, which was quarantined, the group's business had not been greatly affected.</br>
</br>
However, it could be predicted that, in the future, for a long period of time, Future Group's business in Japan will experience negative growth.</br>
</br>
Other than Future Biology's vaccines.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Chairman, I have already booked a room for you at the Hilton Hotel. Do I need to take you to the hotel first," Ren Pengfei asked respectfully.</br>
</br>
"No, I didn't intend to live in a hotel." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
Ren Pengfei was confused.</br>
</br>
Not living in the hotel? Are you going to sleep in the company? But there is no bed in the company?</br>
</br>
"Contact me the most famous real estate holders in Yoto."</br>
</br>
"Yamato Housing Construction and Mitsui Real Estate are the two largest real estate companies in Yoto."</br>
</br>
"Which is the most extensive in Yoto?"</br>
</br>
"It should be Yamato Housing Construction," Ren Pengfei replied after thinking for a moment.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then that one it is. Contact Yamato for me first. I'm going to buy a couple of suites."</br>
</br>
A few to start, Ren Pengfei was immediately shocked by how decisive Jiang Chen was. But when he thought of Wall Street's assessment of Jiang Chen's assets, he no longer thought it was a big deal as he nodded.</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
After Ren Pengfei went out, Jiang Chen sat directly on his office chair and looked at the layout of the office.</br>
</br>
The decor of birch wood was not particularly bright, but it looked very comfortable. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind could directly overlook the streetscape of Shibuya's most bustling district and the lighting was also excellent. Jiang Chen originally intended to buy an even better skyscraper for the company's subsidiary company. However, it seems that this was not necessary.</br>
</br>
It didn't take long for Ren Pengfei to come back with a shrewd-looking middle-aged man.</br>
</br>
Before Jiang Chen said anything, the man introduced himself courteously</br>
</br>
"I am Koizumi, the General Manager of Yamato Housing Construction. I did not expect to see you, Mr. Jiang Chen, here. It is my honor..."</br>
</br>
"No need for flattering words, I'm Jiang Chen and I plan to purchase some real estate in Yoto. Does your company have any good listings you would recommend?" Jiang Chen got straight into the topic.</br>
</br>
Koizumi did not feel dissatisfied with Jiang Chen interrupting him. When he heard Jiang Chen's words, his eyes almost smiled.</br>
</br>
"Of course, we have the most comprehensive listing available! Not only that, if Mr. Jiang Chen likes an estate we don't currently own, we can also act as an intermediary for buying houses. Whether luxury, location, or price, we'll ensure your satisfaction. If Mr. Jiang is willing to pay in US Dollar, we can also offer you a discount!"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 713"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 713: Buying Yoto</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Koizumi did indeed do what he said. Yamato Housing Construction listings really made Jiang Chen extremely satisfied. A 2,000-square-meter mansion with a beautiful environment and its own garden. It was located on the outskirts of Yoto that overlooked the bay. The most critical element was that it stayed away from the noise in the urban areas. A great place to do scandalous things without anyone knowing</br>
</br>
However, the only regret was that...</br>
</br>
"How much for Mt. Fuji?"</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
"Are you not providing intermediary services? Minister Takagi recommended to me the scenery of Mount Fuji. I plan to buy it," Jiang Chen said in a semi-joking tone.</br>
</br>
"...Oh, I'm sorry, Mt. Fuji has no property owner. It is not for sale. If Mr. Jiang is interested, we recommend this golf course at the foot of Mt. Fuji. It has its own resort and entertainment facilities and can be converted into a private villa. Koizumi feltÂ exasperated.</br>
</br>
"That's regrettable. What about the golf course? How much is it?"</br>
</br>
"5.2 billion yen... If you pay in US Dollar, we can get a discount for you here. It will only cost US$9.5 million." When Koizumi said this, his heart was bleeding.</br>
</br>
If it were one month ago, the 18-hole golf course was almost 5 billion yen and back then, the 5 billion Yen, according to the exchange rate, was equivalent to 47.5 million US Dollar! However, there was no other solution since the banks no longer lent money. In order to turn around the capital of Yamato Housing Construction, what he could do wasÂ to collect as much US Dollar as possible, and reduce the losses that the Yen's depreciation had on the company's asset.</br>
</br>
"No problem, let's buy them together." Jiang Chen waved his hand and bought it like he was buying a cabbage. He directly dropped the golf course into the "shopping cart".</br>
</br>
He didn't know how to play golf? It didn't matter, he could always learn. If he didn't manage to learn, it would be a good place to show off. Or he could just sell it for more than that ten years later. In short, with the current exchange rate of the Yen, there would be no loss for buying anything here.</br>
</br>
Since he bought his villa and purchased a golf course, Jiang Chen simply took the chance of the big yen discount, picked up another thick booklet provided by Koizumi, and continued to sweep the market.</br>
</br>
This booklet was marked with real estate not owned by Yamato Housing Construction. Instead, the major household owners entrusted Yamato Housing Construction as an intermediary for its sale. Koizumi would not bother Jiang Chen with the small apartment buildings built. All the assets registered on the booklet were real estate with prices of more than 5 million US Dollar.</br>
</br>
Even after being screened, the T virus and domestic pessimism has affected the number of registered properties for sale and caused a massive amount of listings</br>
</br>
Everyone wanted to flee the city, whether foreigners or locals. Even if Future Biology improved their vaccines, they would not be able to curb the panic in the hearts of people. Especially due to the rumors of mosquitoes and flies carrying viruses, and even stray dogs being sources of secondary infections. Even if the official media repeatedly stated that both the T and TT viruses had a very short survival time and cannot be carried by other organisms, they still could not stop the spread of rumors...</br>
</br>
</br>
Shibuya 109 Building? The heart of fashion? Only 60 million USD? Buy it!</br>
</br>
Shibuya MODI? Yoto's new landmark, the center for the entertainment business? This price is quite cheap, now mine!</br>
</br>
Shinjuku Commercial Street? Akihabara? Newly developed mansion area in Minato City? Anyway, they are now all the price of cabbages. Buy, buy, buy!</br>
</br>
As long as there were in the hands of Yamato Housing Construction, Jiang Chen bought all the assets he wanted. However, he did not use the money of Future Group but used the money in his own private account. Thirteen billion dollars were thrown out and almost half of Yoto was bought out.</br>
</br>
Of course, these real estates could not be developed by Jiang Chen himself and he didn't have that energy either.</br>
</br>
He'll hire several professional managers to set up a real estate leasing company. Wouldn't it be a great business to just accept rent from people?</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was not until the evening did Jiang Chen finish all his transactions.</br>
</br>
With a huge sum of 11 billion US Dollar brought back to the company, Koizumi did not know whether he should be crying or laughing. Laughing that the agency fees amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. Crying that even this billion-dollar big deal would not make up for the losses Yamato Housing Construction had in the past few days.</br>
</br>
However, in the short term, Tokyo's housing prices would still be unable to escape the curse of continual decline, and it was great to offload these properties earlier.</br>
</br>
Regardless of Koizumi's thoughts, Jiang Chen was very satisfied with the result.</br>
</br>
The sky was getting dark and it was already time to get off work.</br>
</br>
Recently, the public security in Yoto had been poor at night. The company canceled all night shifts and Jiang Chen did bother them longer and separated with Ren Pengfei. After requisitioning the company's two Mercedes, he left Shibuya with several Celestial Trade bodyguards.</br>
</br>
The security was terrible, but the road conditions were excellent.</br>
</br>
An hour's drive, Jiang Chen arrived at his newly bought mansion.</br>
</br>
According to Koizumi's suggestion, this mansion was usually staffed with care professionals and can be accommodated after the transfer. At the same time, the servant's employment contract would also be transferred to the owner. Parked in the garage, Celestial Trade bodyguards consciously went to all corners of the mansion and arranged cameras, sensors and other security devices.</br>
</br>
Although there were only six of them, the strength of Celestial Trade bodyguards was absolutely top of the crop among security companies with the aid of high-tech equipment.</br>
</br>
When he opened the door, he saw a beautiful maid in a black and white British maid outfit, She was kneeling at the entrance with a dignified smile on her face.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Jiang Chen finally understood when Koizumi bid farewell, the smile he had that "all men would understand".</br>
</br>
Buy a mansion and get a maid?</br>
</br>
Too corrupt!</br>
</br>
With a "disheartened" mood, Jiang Chen resisted the urge to "criticize" the wealthy class of Nippon. Instead, told the maid to go and make him two cups of black tea, and bring it to the bedroom.</br>
</br>
The tea was quickly made and placed on the nightstand.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen ignored the misunderstanding of the maid's flushed face and didn't touch her. He simply waved her to go back to her room and then told her to close the bedroom door in her puzzled expression.</br>
</br>
The air in the bedroom wavered slightly. Ayesha, who ended the optical illusion, appeared beside Jiang Chen and looked at him with the same puzzled gaze.</br>
</br>
The eyes seemed to be asking, "Why didn't you eat the little rabbit that was in front of you?"</br>
</br>
"I don't have the energy to do thatâ¦ No, am I like that?" Jiang Chen glared at Ayesha and then sat beside her. "Was there someone following us along the way? "</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head.</br>
</br>
"Is that so?" Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
[It isn't that easy after all? I hope it's because of Tanaka's caution and not that I guessed wrong...]</br>
</br>
While thinking, Jiang Chen lied on the bed</br>
</br>
Ayesha leaned over and lied on Jiang Chen's body like a kitten and looked at him with her sapphire eyes.</br>
</br>
"Do you want to sleep?"</br>
</br>
However, the big eyes revealed her innermost thoughts.</br>
</br>
[Are we not going to do anything?]</br>
</br>
Staring at the tenderness in her eyes, Jiang Chen felt that a certain string in his heart was gently tugged on.</br>
</br>
Well, he couldn't resist any longer.</br>
</br>
"Ayesha, go and turn off the lights...and shut the curtains."</br>
</br>
"Mhmmâ¦"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 714: Draw a Snake out of its Hole</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Early morning, when the first ray of sunshine sneaked into the curtains, Jiang Chen opened his eyes and spent a moment in bed.</br>
</br>
Ayesha, lying next to him, has disappeared.</br>
</br>
The plan needed her to hide in the dark, so she could not live with Jiang Chen, but had to lurk nearby. Jiang Chen could see her location on the map of his EP, but he did not open the map. Instincts told him that she was not in the mansion now.</br>
</br>
Since awakening the power of the second level ofÂ genetic code, Jiang Chen had found that he has become more and more sensitive to human scents...</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was more appropriate to call it intuition?</br>
</br>
Intuition now told him that Tanaka has already noticed him, but was hesitant on whether he should be approached.</br>
</br>
The maid brought the breakfast to the table and gently knocked at the door of the bedroom to remind Jiang Chen it was time to get up for breakfast.</br>
</br>
After climbing out of bed, Jiang Chen took clothes from the hangers and went to the bathroom to wash up. Then he headed straight to the dining room.</br>
</br>
On the table was a slice of bread, fried eggs, and a cup of coffee.</br>
</br>
He took a bite of theÂ honey-coated bread and nodded in satisfaction.</br>
</br>
Not bad, the color and smell were both excellent.</br>
</br>
Looking at the maid standing beside him, Jiang Chen could not help but sigh in his heart.</br>
</br>
[This is too corrupt! The damn wealthy class!]</br>
</br>
The maid respectfully placed the newspaper on the table and then stood aside.</br>
</br>
"How long have you been working here?" Jiang Chen asked casually.</br>
</br>
"This is my first day."</br>
</br>
People who could afford luxury homes in the ten billion yen range were, in fact, powerful people. Although the country's adult film industry was flourishing, many wealthy individuals in the country are unexpectedly clean. After all, things that are rare are more valuable. Yamato Housing Construction naturally would not provide inferior service to important clients.</br>
</br>
"I haven't asked for your name yet."</br>
</br>
"You can call me Qian Xia," Qian Xia said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"You don't look good, are you still studying?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, I'm studying education at Waseda University and studiedÂ three foreign languages: Chinese, English, and Korean."</br>
</br>
It was no wonder her Chinese was so fluent.</br>
</br>
"Waseda University? You're a great student."</br>
</br>
"Not at all. Education belongs to the lower school department and is often referred to as a second-rate degree." Qian Xia politely joked.</br>
</br>
"Are you planning to be a teacher?" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia shook her head.</br>
</br>
"I used to think about it, but sure enough, I'm not very good at it."</br>
</br>
The salary of a teacher was much lower than the salary of a maid. The monthly salary of two million Yen was simply an unimaginable huge sum for her a few months ago. We must know that the average salary in Nippon was about 200,000 Yen. Even her professor made only half a million Yen.</br>
</br>
</br>
Although this job had an "escort" nature, the relatively simple nature and the disproportionate income made the flaw not worth mentioning.</br>
</br>
And if there really is a relationship with the owner, it would change her life</br>
</br>
"Do you not go to class?"</br>
</br>
"After the Shinagawa virus incident, the school suspended classes."</br>
</br>
"That is really sad news." Jiang Chen's face had no sad expression on it when he said it.</br>
</br>
"Mhmmâ¦ a dozen people from our school died. I feel like tragedy is occurring around me. It is too terrifyingâ¦" From Qian Xia's expression, Jiang Chen could read her sorrow. Perhaps among the dozen or so people who were killed there were those she knew, and perhaps even her friends.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sighed and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Look on the bright side. The films always told us that the villain will eventually be punished."</br>
</br>
"Well, I hope..."</br>
</br>
That smile was dignified, but Jiang Chen could see the haze behind the brightness.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
After breakfast, the maid brought the plate into the kitchen.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sipped on the coffee and picked up the newspaper.</br>
</br>
The habit of reading newspapers was developed a long time ago. As he always traveled between two worlds, in order to stay in touch with the world on this side, it was still necessary to know current affairs.</br>
</br>
This news was published in a Nippon newspaper.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, people in Yamato wouldn't miss this opportunity to build momentum. While everyone lacked optimism about the economy, Future Group swept Yoto real estate, which would undoubtedly help boost investors' confidenceâ¦ Bullsh*t!</br>
</br>
Nobody was willing to live with the living-dead. Tanaka hadn't been caught yet. The T virus may erupt for the second time.</br>
</br>
Because of the influence of T virus, housing prices in Yoto, in particular, had already fallen to the bottom, as they did during the economic crisis in the 1990s. The housing prices in Shinagawa district... Not mentioning the house, many household owners were gone, and the house could only be taken over by the Yoto Municipal Government.</br>
</br>
Why did Jiang Chen dare to buy at the bottom? It was only because he knew that the Kurofune would not last long.</br>
</br>
Well, it seems that investors on Wall Street were ready to buy. Jiang Chen rejoiced that he came early, or else others would have taken advantage of the situation.</br>
</br>
Not only Yoto's real estate, but also the Nippon high-tech companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy, Future Group planned to acquire them all.</br>
</br>
It must be admitted that Nippon companies do have a strong ability in the electronics industry. Such as medical care, energy, robots, cameras, displays, optical components... these technologies were even more advanced than the Silicon Valley. The most crucial point was that these technologies were a perfect fit for Future Group</br>
</br>
He had a press conference in a bit on Future Technology's acquisition of three Nippon electronics companies. The companies would cooperate with Future Heavy Industries to enter the mobile phone industry. At the same time, he would also act as a spokesperson for Future Technology and explain the privatization and reorganization of assets to shareholders of these three listed companies at the meeting.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Jiang Chen felt the watch on his left wrist vibrate.</br>
</br>
He glanced at the direction of the kitchen. He didn't call out Jean's holographic image but only opened the voice function.</br>
</br>
Jean immediately said.</br>
</br>
"They succeeded."</br>
</br>
"Garrett?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. The Kenyan drug factory has been destroyed and a total of 214 armed militants were killed. About 1.7 tons of virus stock and 50 tons of raw materials were destroyed. Although the Kenyan military was alerted, our combat units did not expose their identity and successfully evacuated from Kenya."</br>
</br>
"Excellent." Jiang Chen nodded and only said the one word.</br>
</br>
It was over half of Kurofune's inventory.</br>
</br>
Tanaka tried to hide the Kurofune behind terrorism, use terrorism to send the T virus to the world and realize Kurofune's doomsday plan. From now on, Celestial Trade will use dominating actions to suppress them, force them to come out of their rat holes, and stand in front of him.</br>
</br>
It was almost time.</br>
</br>
Putting the newspaper aside, Jiang Chen drank the rest of the coffee in one breath and walked to the door.</br>
</br>
Hearing the sound at the entrance, Qian Xia came out of the kitchen.</br>
</br>
"Is master ready to go?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Putting on his shoes at the door, Jiang Chen stood by the mirror and fixed his collar.</br>
</br>
"About when will you come back? I'll prepare lunch." Qian Xia smiled.</br>
</br>
"Around this evening... Right, do you have your own place in Yoto?"</br>
</br>
"There is a small apartment that I have rented for a year, but I haven't gone back for a long time."</br>
</br>
"Go live at your place today."</br>
</br>
"Did I do a bad job?" Qian Xia lowered her head and said sadly.</br>
</br>
When Jiang opened the door, he turned his head and smiled.</br>
</br>
"No, just go tonight. I may have something to do."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"...above is Future Technology'sÂ restructuring plan for the three companies. Thank you for being here for our media and shareholders. Thank you!"</br>
</br>
There was a burst of applause from the audience, but the faces of the original shareholders of the three acquired companies were not smiling. Even if Future Group offered a good deal and took over their mess, it still couldn't make up for the losses they suffered during the virus incident.</br>
</br>
The reporter's response was more positive and he asked Jiang Chen all sorts of questions.</br>
</br>
"What kinds of products will be introduced by Future Technology?"</br>
</br>
"What will the amazing features of this product be?"</br>
</br>
"When will you get married?"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
These reporters always plugged in irrelevant questions in serious situations.</br>
</br>
In short, the press conference ended successfully, and it was now late.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by bodyguards, Jiang Chen walked out of the venue and entered the Mercedes.</br>
</br>
"Boss, where are we going now?" The driver started the car and turned to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Go home."</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
The driver nodded and skillfully turned the steering wheel. Two Mercedes in the front and back guarded Jiang Chen's car in the middle. Although the bodyguards in the car were dressed in suits, they were all equipped with kinetic skeleton underneath.</br>
</br>
Even without guns, their combat abilities could compare to a six-man infantry squad. With such a powerful force, Jiang Chen even wondered whether Tanaka was afraid since his bodyguards were too strong.</br>
</br>
After thinking about it, he shook his head and dismissed the idea.</br>
</br>
News of him in Nippon had spread. With Tanaka's madness and his threat to the Kurofune, he would never pass on this opportunity. In Xin, which was absolutely controlled by Celestial Trade, the Kurofune had no opportunities at all.</br>
</br>
In the car, he suddenly got a call from Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"How did the acquisition go?"</br>
</br>
"It went smoothly. The CEO of the subsidiary handled it for me. I felt that I wasn't useful at all and was just a mascot at the press conference." Jiang Chen revealed a helpless expression as he spoke with a sly tone.</br>
</br>
Hearing Jiang Chen's unserious voice, Xia Shiyu sighed and began to lecture him. "So I told you that there's absolutely no need for you to be there in person. Now that the situation in Napon isn't so peaceful, you're in a dangerous position as the group's President. If any incidents happen, there isn't even a successor in place."</br>
</br>
"Haha, why don't you help me?"</br>
</br>
Somehow, this joke shouldn't have been blurted out of his mouth. Jiang Chen himself was stunned. Just as he was prepared to explain himself, the call was disconnected.</br>
</br>
"It was just a joke; there's no need to hang up on me!" Jiang Chen muttered, hesitated, and ultimately decided not to call back. He stuffed the phone in his pocket and closed his eyes to rest them.</br>
</br>
</br>
At the same moment, thousands of kilometers away.</br>
</br>
The hand holding the phone trembled unceasingly, and Xia Shiyu's face was red. Her original serious expression vanished.</br>
</br>
The phone slid onto her folder.</br>
</br>
Without any indications, she suddenly buried her entire red face into her arms.</br>
</br>
[Obviously it was just a joke; why did I react in such a dramatic way? Why did I hang up the phone? Doesn't that make it look like I took it seriously? What a shame! Will he think that I... Hmph, why do I care about what he thinks? I'm so mad!]</br>
</br>
It must be said that women thought much more than men to the point where they would even confuse themselves.</br>
</br>
Unaware of the confusion Xia Shiyu was in, Jiang Chen was sinking into his seat to rest. He didn't linger on the incident at all.</br>
</br>
As the car gradually left the city, the bustling high-rise buildings receded and were replaced with lush green trees and harmonious dwellings. Jiang Chen looked at the GPS; they were a few kilometers away from the mansions.</br>
</br>
The sky had turned completely dark. There were street lights on the roadside with only a few souls on the road. Because of the chaos caused by the economic depression and collapse of order, the entire city of Yoto wasn't safe. With that in mind, he couldn't help thinking about the little maid he just received who he asked to return to her apartment. Hopefully, she wouldn't encounter any danger.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jiang Chen opened his eyes.</br>
</br>
The feeling became stronger and stronger as if there were something staring at him in the distance.</br>
</br>
"Here?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen murmured to himself and put his hand into his pocket. Feeling a dense metal object, his hand gripped the pistol. At the same time, Ayesha's voice came from a miniature headset hidden in his ear.</br>
</br>
"300 meters in front, there are a lot of heat sources in the groves. Roadblocks are set up in the middle of the road."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes.</br>
</br>
"How many people?"</br>
</br>
"Fifty-seven."</br>
</br>
Fifty-seven? Even though he was wanted by the world, the Kurofune was still able to mobilize so many "believers" in the outskirts of Yoto?</br>
</br>
This was contrary to Jiang Chen's expectations. He thought Tanaka would be discreet and play tricks, but he was open and stood in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Where are you now?"</br>
</br>
"In the mansionâ¦ Wait, the situation is a bit odd. There's only one person. The others are all-"</br>
</br>
Not far from the streetlights, there were shadowy figures, blank eyes, and dangling hands. Jiang Chen knew what those were too well.</br>
</br>
They were zombies!</br>
</br>
Without hesitating, Jiang Chen immediately ordered the driver.</br>
</br>
"Stop!"</br>
</br>
The three cars stopped and the Celestial Trade bodyguards obviously noticed something was wrong. Six people, including the driver, immediately stepped out of the car and kept Jiang Chen's car in the middle. Although there were fifty-something zombies against them and there were only six sticks on their side, no one showed any fear.</br>
</br>
No matter if it was the T virus or TT virus, it made no difference to those who were injected by vaccines. Unable to be infected through bites, the threat of zombies was greatly diminished.</br>
</br>
The door opened again and Jiang Chen stepped out.</br>
</br>
"President, it is dangerous outside. Please remain in the car." The bodyguards standing in the front row saw Jiang Chen getting out and whispered.</br>
</br>
"No, staying in the car is more dangerous."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen said emotionlessly. He walked to the front and stood in front of Tanaka, tens of meters away.</br>
</br>
"We meet again."</br>
</br>
"Yeah, last time we met was last year," Tanaka said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"It was the year before last. It was 2018 years ago."</br>
</br>
Looking at Tanaka's composed expression, Jiang Chen suddenly laughed.</br>
</br>
"As the saying goes, best two out of three. We tied during the previous two matches. This is the final match, so shouldn't we decide a winner?"</br>
</br>
"I agree." Tanaka smiled.</br>
</br>
"So, are you prepared to fight me with these 56 zombies?" Jiang Chen put his hand in his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Of course. Don't underestimate them." Tanaka smiled and opened his hands. "They're the manifestation of science."</br>
</br>
Instantly, the blank pupils turned red. As if driven by some kind of force, the muscles of these zombie bodies suddenly looked like boiling water. With explosive roars, they began to swell...</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 716"/>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 716: That day will never come</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The sallow skin quickly turned into a petrifying green, and the weak limbs instantly expanded into huge muscles unscientifically.</br>
</br>
A low bloodthirsty, demonic roar echoed between the trees on both sides of the road.</br>
</br>
On this highway without a soul, the mutant zombies howled and rushed in their direction, and leaped toward Jiang Chen. Six sticks were taken out as they ran to the zombies without fear.</br>
</br>
"Come closer! Prepare to engage!" Watching those mutated zombies that were obviously difficult to deal with, the bodyguard captain's head felt numb. However, thinking that the president was standing behind him, he decided to give it his all. He shouted, took on a defensive posture, and gestured his comrades to move closer to him.</br>
</br>
Since they were at a numerical disadvantage, it was most secure to gather together. The six bodyguards guarding Jiang Chen retreated to a car and formed a "C" formation, exposing their kinetic skeletons and preparing to fight with zombies.</br>
</br>
However, right then, Jiang Chen patted the shoulder of the bodyguard's head and motioned for him to move...</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen, who was drowned out by the corpse tide, Tanaka raised his head and cackled.</br>
</br>
"Hahaha, although I assumed you were trying to lure me out, you think only six bodyguards can get rid of me? You're too arrogant. Don't feel sad. Before you die, give names to my servants."</br>
</br>
Before the start of the operation, he had already sent messages to the Kurofune through Klein particles, interfered with the particle movement of Klein particles, and blocked Jiang Chen's "door" to the apocalypse. Although Jiang Chen had a lot of good tools on his body, even if he took out his power armor at that very moment, he wouldn't have the opportunity to put it on.</br>
</br>
If Jiang Chen died, the mission of Kurofune could end too.</br>
</br>
They maintained a steady pace of scientific and technological development. It was absolutely impossible for human civilization to defeat the Kurofune on the day of the showdown. No one could stop the evolution to Harmony.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, there was a flash of light around the corpses, and a breeze blew past Tanaka's face.</br>
</br>
A tingling sensation came from Tanaka's cheeks, but no blood dripped. The high temperature allowed the wound to instantly scab over.</br>
</br>
Tanaka's triangular eyes shrunk slightly.</br>
</br>
The zombies originally surrounding Jiang Chen were blown away; 17 zombies immediately collapsed. Jiang Chen, who was standing behind the hole, held a laser sword in his hand. The long sword cast a light blue sheen.</br>
</br>
The light was gentle, but it was also dangerous.</br>
</br>
"It seems you have a lot of good stuff." Tanaka looked a bit sterner.</br>
</br>
"That's right."</br>
</br>
The laser sword flickered in Jiang Chen's hands, directed at the group of zombies.</br>
</br>
"And far more than you can see."</br>
</br>
The death of their companions didn't make the remaining living-dead afraid. They still ran fearlessly towardÂ Jiang Chen. However, they hadn't come into contact with Jiang Chen before they crashed into a wall.</br>
</br>
</br>
A wall made of guns and bullets!</br>
</br>
Like a hurricane, the rain-like bullets shredded the remaining thirty zombies into pieces in a flash. Like ghosts appearing out of nowhere, Black Warriors armed with Ripper Assault Rifles emerged in front of Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The bodyguards next to Jiang Chen were completely stunned.</br>
</br>
Originally, they thought it would be a hard battle. They didn't expect that they weren't needed at all.</br>
</br>
Although they heard about the advanced technology in the company, "laser swords" and "optical invisibility" only appeared in sci-fi blockbusters; they didn't expect to see it in reality.</br>
</br>
There were broken limbs on the ground; black blood stained the streets.</br>
</br>
Tanaka opened his mouth, which eventually turned into a helpless sigh.</br>
</br>
"I originally thought that more than 50 mutated zombies were enough to finish you. I didn't expect that I was the careless one."</br>
</br>
"Not only can you actively induce zombies to mutate, but you can also order the zombies to act as slaves. You've also surpassed my expectations." Jiang Chen put away his laser sword and spoke expressionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Yeah, the first one was correct. The second one was wrong." Tanaka chuckled. "Even I can't order the zombies; I can only make them treat me like their own kind."</br>
</br>
On the entire road, there were only Tanaka, Jiang Chen, the Ghost Agents, and the six bodyguards. There was no need to order the zombies at all. It was only necessary to strengthen their senses and athleticism to the point where they could detect Jiang Chen, then they would instinctively pounce at him and shred the living into pieces.</br>
</br>
"Where did the zombies come from?"</br>
</br>
"There was a small village close by, but it took me a lot of effort to get these zombies to come here," Tanaka said with a smile and touched his hat brim with one of his hands. "It's really unfortunate that I played all my cards. We have to decide the winner next time."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen grinned, looked into his eyes and muttered to himself.</br>
</br>
"My thought process has been wrong the whole time."</br>
</br>
Tanaka stopped what he was doing and examined Jiang Chen with intrigue.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Do you have some interesting insights you're planning to share with me?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen didn't speak but looked back at the bodyguards behind him.</br>
</br>
"Wait for me at the mansion. There are only three kilometers left; leave me a car. I can go back by myself."</br>
</br>
"But..."</br>
</br>
"That's an order," Jiang Chen said affirmatively.</br>
</br>
"...Yes."</br>
</br>
The bodyguard captain gritted his teeth and waved at the bodyguards behind him. The six bodyguards put away their sticks and got into their cars. The two cars bypassed the roadblock in the middle of the road and headed towards the mansion.</br>
</br>
"You can leave now too." After the bodyguards left, Jiang Chen looked down at his watch then spoke to the four Ghost Agents in front of him.</br>
</br>
"Roger that."</br>
</br>
Without any nonsense, the four Ghost Agents nodded and disappeared from the road.</br>
</br>
The irrelevant people had all left, leaving only two people on the road.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at Tanaka and said:</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily an insight. It's just some random inspiration and I realized something interesting. Everyone who has seen you thinks you're one person. But is that true?"</br>
</br>
Keeping his fingers on his brim, Tanaka was still smiling.</br>
</br>
"Of course I'm one person. What else could I be?"</br>
</br>
"A lot of people."</br>
</br>
Tanaka's expression finally changed, and his smiling eyes gradually turned vicious.</br>
</br>
His expression was akin to the last card of a gambler being uncovered.</br>
</br>
Although this slight change was imperceptibleÂ under the dim light of the street, the sensory-enhanced Jiang Chen still acutely noticed this change.</br>
</br>
A light bulb flickered and silence persisted on the road for a moment before Tanaka slowly said, "So what?"</br>
</br>
"Yeah, so what?" Jiang Chen sighed. "You've heard of 'cloud computing'?"</br>
</br>
Tanaka's pupils looked anxious.</br>
</br>
"All programs are run on the server side, and ultimately, the server compresses the computation results and transmits them to users over the network. This allows users to use a low-end computer and enjoy high-end servicesâ¦ The premise is that the network must be open."</br>
</br>
"So? Are you planning to educate me on computers?" Tanaka quietly said.</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Jiang Chen opened his hands and put away his laser sword. "If my guess is right... you can take off your hat now."</br>
</br>
Tanaka took off his hat.</br>
</br>
The flat cap fell to the ground.</br>
</br>
However, things were contrary to his expectations. His consciousness didn't leave him; everything in front of him was still visible. It was as if a virtual reality player suddenly found himself unable to log out of the game...</br>
</br>
His pupils contracted in disbelief, and Tanaka's calm expression turned into panic.</br>
</br>
"This is impossible!"</br>
</br>
[Impossible!]</br>
</br>
The Kurofune didn't respond to his request...</br>
</br>
Satisfied with the expression on Tanaka's face, Jiang Chen's mouth finally showed a glimmer of victory.</br>
</br>
"It seems that I've bet correctly. Your so-called rebirth is based on a special kind of 'cloud computing.' Through a 'server' a few light years away, user A's memory and thoughts were transplanted to user B. How could they know when to 'rebirth' you a few light years away? Why don't we make a bold assumption - the hat on your head and your own signal of life is the switch of 'rebirth'. "</br>
</br>
From the quiver of Tanaka's face, Jiang Chen confirmed his conjecture.</br>
</br>
"The next step will be easier."</br>
</br>
"Klein particles can interfere with each other. Since you could prevent me from communicating with the 'gate' through interference and thus prevent me from starting interdimensional travel, then I can also stop the communication between you and the Kurofune. You didn't know that when Garrett killed you in Kenya's military operations, you used the ability to 'rebirth' and switched consciousness to this body in Japan, I recorded your communications band then."</br>
</br>
"On Earth, only the two of us know how to communicate correctly using Klein particles. Maybe I can't analyze the content of your communications with the Kurofune, but your voice is as pronounced as if you were screaming in an open valley. "</br>
</br>
"As long as the communication band is recorded, it is easy to interfere with communication. It's only necessary to constantly stimulate the vibrations of the Klein particles at a specific frequency. And you know, I can go to another world. There are crystals with rich Klein particles beyond imagination."</br>
</br>
"It's not safe to use Klein particles as a means of communication. Am I right?"</br>
</br>
Cold sweat rolled down from Tanaka's forehead, and he moved back slightly.</br>
</br>
This was the first time he felt fear since he acquired the ability to rebirth from the Kurofune. If he took off his hat before he died, he would be able to rebirth into another body. No matter how he died, he would never truly die. He wouldn't even experience pain during the moment of death because rebirth happened in an instant.</br>
</br>
"Do you think you can run?" Jiang Chen looked at his footsteps shuffling back, and a mocking smile appeared.</br>
</br>
There was a flash of ferocity in his eyes. Tanaka took out a pistol from his pocket and pointed it at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The gunfire resonated on the desolate highway.</br>
</br>
The bullet, however, seemed to hit a wall and was blown away by the air released.</br>
</br>
"Nitrogen armor. As you can see, I have a lot of good stuff." Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Tanaka immediately pointed the gun at himself.</br>
</br>
His rebirth ability had double insurance.</br>
</br>
The communication interference couldn't continue forever. Even if there was a momentary lapse, as long as the Kurofune detected that he was dead, he could wake up in another body.</br>
</br>
However, before he could point to himself, his hand was clamped by a hand from behind.</br>
</br>
A sharp pain from his back numbed his body quickly.</br>
</br>
"Beautiful."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked in front of Tanaka. He smiled and nodded to Ayesha standing behind him then picked up the cap from the ground, patted the dust away, and put it on Tanaka's head again.</br>
</br>
"I haven't thought about a good way to kill you. So, you'll have to stay alive now."</br>
</br>
Wearing this pesky hat, quietly lying in the underground facilities of New Moon Island for the rest of his life...</br>
</br>
"Oh, I didn't expect I would reach doomsday before you." Sweat fell from his forehead, and Tanaka stared straight into Jiang Chen's eyes. The voice squeezed out of his throat had a self-deprecating tone to it.</br>
</br>
"It's a very ironic ending."</br>
</br>
His black pupils seemed to contract as if he regained his life. As he struggled, he squeezed out a sentence:</br>
</br>
"Don't be too happy. I will wait for you at doomsday."</br>
</br>
"Let me reassure you - that day will never come," Jiang Chen whispered before Tanaka's pupils dilated.</br>
</br>
[Because I am here.]</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After injecting an anesthetic every 12 hours, Tanaka would always remain in a coma and was sent to the underground facility of New Moon Island. There, he will wear his hat, lie in the virtual reality training cabin, be imprisoned forever in the absurd virtual world, and accept spiritual torture.</br>
</br>
He'll never be able to die, never be able to take off his hat, and never be able to get in touch with the Kurofune until his death.</br>
</br>
Perhaps this was more miserable than death itself.</br>
</br>
At the same time, Celestial Trade contacted the President of Kenya and reported details of the military operations in the Mandela region to the Kenyan authorities. At the outset, the expression of Kenya's President's after knowing the incident was outrage because the soldiers of Celestial trade not only landed in Kenya without authorization, but also took out 214 Sabab militants.</br>
</br>
Even if the target of the attack was terrorists, who gave them the power to enforce the law? It was a direct slap in the face to the Kenyan government if the event was made public.</br>
</br>
Fortunately there were no civilian casualties.</br>
</br>
However, when the Celestial Trade battle footage and evidence of the destruction of 1.7 tons of virus stock and 50 tons of virus raw material were placed on the Kenyan President's desk, not a peep came out of the Kenyan President.</br>
</br>
1.7 tons of TT virus, if spread throughout Kenya, would be enough to turn Kenya into an uninhabitable zone.</br>
</br>
The President of Kenya and Jiang Chen talked on the phone. After a short five-minute exchange, the whole incident became like this...</br>
</br>
"Yesterday, under the authority of the Kenyan government, the Celestial Trade Marines launched an operation in Kenya's Mandela city near the Somali border. After a total of 12 Marine Corps soldiers parachuted the area, under the cooperation of the Kenyan military police, a total of 214 Sabab armed militants were killed, and the terrorist organization based in Mandela was completely eliminated."</br>
</br>
"In the Sabab base, the Celestial Trade soldiers destroyed a total of 1.7 tons of TT virus stock and 50 tons of raw materials for the production of the virus. During this large-scale drug war campaign, Tanaka, the culprit of the Yoto virus incident, was killed on the spot. Celestial Trade declined to disclose the name of the hero who killed Tanaka."</br>
</br>
"A Capital spokesman said that the discovery of Celestial Trade in the Sabab stronghold confirms the necessity and rationality of NATO's military operations in Somalia. And he reiterated that terrorist organizations must not be allowed to obtain the T virus... "</br>
</br>
Tanaka is dead, at least in name. The fewer people that know he is alive the better. If other countries knew that Tanaka was not actually dead, but was merely detained by Jiang Chen in the underground facilities of New Moon Island, the situation may get pleasant.</br>
</br>
Of course, they will never know.</br>
</br>
</br>
In the morning, Jiang Chen sat in the dining room and watched the news on the TV.</br>
</br>
The breakfast on the table was simple.</br>
</br>
A glass of milk and a bowl of fried rice.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia was not at the mansion last night, and Ayesha rushed to Xin to smuggle Tanaka overnight. Jiang Chen was not interested in eating the meals prepared by the six men outside, so he could cook himself.</br>
</br>
It was his first time cooking in a long time. He prepared himself a bowl of fried rice and also creatively added some exotic products from the apocalypse. Such as delicious mud crab sauce, edible lizard meat. However, the reality was cruel. Deliciousness was simply "1+1=2". Although the fried rice was not inedible, it was not the best either.</br>
</br>
Recalling the period of working in Wanghai three years ago, Jiang Chen could not help but sigh.</br>
</br>
It was a waste of his "good cooking."</br>
</br>
When he was reminiscent, he completely forgot his only good dish was "tomato fried eggs".</br>
</br>
After finishing breakfast, Jiang Chen rested for a moment on the sofa and looked at the beautiful decorations in the room.</br>
</br>
Did the Kurofune just collapse like that?</br>
</br>
To be honest, there was a kind of relief in his heart.</br>
</br>
The Kurofune was like a tumor on the back of civilization. The T virus it produced was corrupting the civilization. It makes all the order shaky. He didn't want the world to become an apocalypse too, even if none of the country gave him a welcoming feeling.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, before the situation got worse, he ended it all...</br>
</br>
Someone knocked on the door and Jiang Chen got up to open it.</br>
</br>
There were two policemen at the door; a man and a woman. No matter from their expressions or movements, they were very restrained. This may be because they knew Jiang Chen's identity, or perhaps because of the muscular bodyguards on the sideâ¦</br>
</br>
The older-looking police officer opened his mouth and asked in non-standard English.</br>
</br>
"Hello, Mr. Jiang, I'm the police officer of the Yoto Police Department. Please cooperate with us..."</br>
</br>
"Do I need to go to the police station with you?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"No, no, we just want to learn a few things from you. Did you find a suspicious person near the mansion yesterday?" The old policeman asked.</br>
</br>
"You can ask my bodyguards. They may be more concerned with what happened outside than I am." Jiang Chen shrugged and smiled.</br>
</br>
Tanaka had said that he obtained the "raw material" of the zombies from the village near the outskirts of Yoto. The entire village was missing, not to mention traces of the T virus in the village. It was impossible not to alarm the local police.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen cleaned the road spotless. All the bodies were thrown into the apocalypse, and blood dissolver was poured on the highway. Even if Detective Conan arrived, he would not be able to find the direct link between the villager's disappearance and Tanaka, and the indirect connection with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Including the Yoto Police Department, they did not list Jiang Chen as a suspect at all.</br>
</br>
Someone like Jiang Chen, with his level of entrepreneurship, if he really wanted to engage in this kind of detrimental activity, did he need to personally go to Yoto for this?</br>
</br>
"I see, I'm really sorry to bother you!" The old policeman bowed and was ready to leave.</br>
</br>
However, at that time, the policewoman stepped forward a half-step, glanced into the entrance suspiciously, and then looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Is there anyone else in the mansion?"</br>
</br>
Compared to the old police officer, the policewoman's English was much more fluent. She was obviously well-educated.</br>
</br>
"There is also a maid. Miss Policewoman, is there a problem?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Where is she?"</br>
</br>
"She rents an apartment by herself."</br>
</br>
"Does she go back to the apartment every day? Or is it only today?" The woman pursued aggressively.</br>
</br>
[Huh? This chick is pretty clever.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a moment to process and looked at the policewoman intriguingly.</br>
</br>
"What is your name?"</br>
</br>
"Kwai, Mr. Jiang, please don't avoid my question." Kwai reported her name, watched Jiang Chen's eyes, and said word by word.</br>
</br>
"Very good, Miss Kwai, I noticed that you are using an interrogative tone. What you mean is that a criminal case occurred on your side and I am the subject of your suspicion?" Jiang Chen retorted.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was very cautious with his diction, he used "criminal case" instead of the "T virus incident." If he became Tanaka's scapegoat, it would be comical.</br>
</br>
To be honest, this female policeman was quite beautiful. Her nose is very delicate, and her forehead was very high, she just had a proud temperament. However, with this police uniform, it felt like a uniform tease.</br>
</br>
Kwai did not hear holes in Jiang Chen's words, her face carried a hint of disappointment.</br>
</br>
The old policeman pulled the sleeves of Miss. Kwai and dragged her behind his back. The he bowed to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"I'm really sorry, we absolutely do not suspect you."</br>
</br>
After this, the old police officer forcefully dragged her out of the mansion, disregarding the dissatisfaction on her face.</br>
</br>
After the police left, the bodyguards walked next to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What are the arrangements for today?"</br>
</br>
"Today..."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked up and gazed at the pristine sky, and the marshmallow-like white clouds. He smiled.</br>
</br>
Such good weather. It would be simply too wasteful not to enjoy it.</br>
</br>
Since coming to Nippon, he didn't even get a chance to be corrupt yet.</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 718: On the Verge of Collapsing</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Leaving Jiang Chen's mansion, the two just got in their police car and before they drove far, the old captain Sakai criticized.</br>
</br>
"Are you crazy? Do you actually suspect that the president of Future Group is the murderer of the missing villager?"</br>
</br>
"But it's suspicious, isn't it?" Kwai argued. "On the day of the incident, he returned home very late. There was a maid in the mansion and she happened to return to her apartment last night."</br>
</br>
"I think what Kwai said makes sense." The police officer who drove interrupted.</br>
</br>
The old policeman scorned and refuted their opinions: "Motivation? A president of a 100 billion company will dirty his hands to do this? Don't forget we just came to understand the situation since the emergence of the T virus. However, this case will be handed over to the self-defense force investigators to handle. This kind of big case is not under the jurisdiction of our small police station."</br>
</br>
Reprimanded by his boss, the police officer driving forced a laugh.</br>
</br>
"Senior you're right."</br>
</br>
After a pause, the police officer Ito said through the rearview mirror, staring into the eyes of the Kwai.</br>
</br>
"I warned you that you're not allowed to act without authorization. One mistake will result in a diplomatic dispute. It may even cause more serious problems. Consider it carefully!"</br>
</br>
"Yes--"</br>
</br>
Kwai dragged out her tone before she looked to the side with her mouth pouted</br>
</br>
Although she agreed, the expression on her face was filled with disapproval.</br>
</br>
What is meant by "A president of a 100 billion company will dirty his hands to do this?" It is simply too strange to measure a person's personality with assets! No matter from which point of view, his actions were very suspicious!</br>
</br>
Taking a deep breath, Kwai looked at the mansion in the rear-view mirror and her eyes were filled with determination</br>
</br>
[Since you don't believe it, then I'll prove it to you!]</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
"Is it tight?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, yes, it's a bit big."</br>
</br>
"Oh, isn't it better to be bigger?"</br>
</br>
"No, it's uncomfortable."</br>
</br>
"What about this?"</br>
</br>
"Oh, better."</br>
</br>
"Can you go in a little further?"</br>
</br>
"No, I can't anymore."</br>
</br>
Qian Xia pushed her toes a bit further into the boots and put the boots on. Jiang Chen smiled, nodding with satisfaction.</br>
</br>
This one looks good, just buy this pair!</br>
</br>
"But... this pair of shoes is worth 1 million Yen. Is that really okay?" Looking at the label, Qian Xia gulped while her eyes flashed with joy.</br>
</br>
One million yen was is equivalent to a year's savings of most Napon worker.</br>
</br>
"Don't worry, I'm in a good mood today." Jiang Chen smiled, took out his card to pay.</br>
</br>
The salesperson packed the shoes and handed it to Qian Xia with a polite smile.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia hugged the box and buried her head shyly, not knowing what to think.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't notice this. It was only 1 million yen, nothing to sweat over.</br>
</br>
</br>
What's more, the yen was now as cheaper as a piece of paper...</br>
</br>
With the local Qian Xia acting as the guide, Jiang Chen spent a whole day visiting many interesting places. However, it was also quite funny to see that many of the landmark attractions that both of them visited were considered to be industries under his name. For example, Building 109, Shinjuku Commercial Street...</br>
</br>
It was more touring his own back garden than sightseeing.</br>
</br>
Although the pedestrian traffic on the streets were a lot clearer after the T virus crisis, the shops were still open for business.</br>
</br>
Throughout the day, Jiang Chen basically walked around, but at night...</br>
</br>
Hmmm.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen found an excuse and let the maid go home first.</br>
</br>
The accompanying bodyguards had long helped him get rid of the trailing reporters. Jiang Chen attended the press conference only two days before. Now everyone knows he is there. With his current worth, and the exposure of media that does not match his worth, it was impossible for the reporters not to be interested in him.</br>
</br>
If the reporters followed him, he couldn't play.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The sun shined over Ise Bay, it was a great day for a vacation. Typically, this golden beach would be full of beautiful youthful figures, but this time around there was barely any one. The sky over the entire country was covered by gloominess.</br>
</br>
Invisible dark clouds lingered in the hearts of people.</br>
</br>
In the beach hotel next to Ise Bay, a Caucasian man sat across from an Asian man at the table. There were two cold drinks on the table. The drinks were filled with ice and reflected two equally cold faces.</br>
</br>
The Caucasian man looked at the table and broke the silence first.</br>
</br>
"Do you have news of Tanaka?"</br>
</br>
The Asian man shook his head.</br>
</br>
The Caucasian man remained silent for two seconds and continued to ask.</br>
</br>
"Can you contact my lord?"</br>
</br>
The Asian man suddenly smiled, the smile was helpless.</br>
</br>
"You know only Tanaka can."</br>
</br>
Tanaka kept his mouth closed about how to communicate with the Kurofune. Even to his confidant, he did not disclose more about the secret of the black ship. After all, for this semi-religious organization, to maintain the mystery of the "Pope", can enable members to maintain awe and preserve the cohesion of the organization.</br>
</br>
However, the disadvantages of doing so was also obvious.</br>
</br>
As a spiritual leader, if he died, the entire organization would become a mess, and those secrets would also be brought into the tomb.</br>
</br>
Tanaka obviously did not take this into consideration.</br>
</br>
He also never considered that with a hack, he would die one day...</br>
</br>
"What about Charles? Why didn't our brothers in Europe come?" the Asian man asked.</br>
</br>
"Charles is dead."</br>
</br>
"Dead?" The Asian man's face was a bit surprised.</br>
</br>
"Since the Rothschild family took power, our brothers in Europe have had a hard time. Willey Society have searched for us all over Europe. They think we have the Golden Apple in our hands... Those idiots are just as annoying as flies. ."</br>
</br>
A disgusted emotion flashed across his face, and the white man paused. Then he said, "The situation in the Americas is getting worse too. The last Tanaka mission was too hasty, and the missing pilot Gordon was found in Singapore. FBA has begun to investigate us... What about the Nippon side?"</br>
</br>
"When the T virus leaked, the Nippon authorities and Takeda Pharmaceutical turned their backs on us." The haze on the Asian man's face deepened, and the teeth that had been bitting the pipette gritted.</br>
</br>
"Overall?" asked the white man.</br>
</br>
"It's terrible." The Asian man replied with only two words.</br>
</br>
"I think so too." The white man smiled bitterly.</br>
</br>
The conversation suddenly stopped. The two sat in silence, as if in a daze, as if thinking about the future.</br>
</br>
The silence lasted for a long time.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the white man spoke again.</br>
</br>
"You know... Since Tanaka has the Lord's blessing, why is he unable to resurrect? He is the spokesperson chosen by the Lord, this is not right..."</br>
</br>
"What do you mean by this statement?" The Asian man seemed to have guessed what the white man wanted to say and frowned.</br>
</br>
"I mean, could we... have been abandoned?"</br>
</br>
While the sentence was being said, both sides saw confusion and fear from each other's pupils.</br>
</br>
What should they do next?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 719: You choose yourself</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Yoto at night was covered by a layer of neon.</br>
</br>
Among them, Ginza was the most dazzling and defined the word prosper to the extreme. This is Yoto's most prosperous street and the best place to find fun.</br>
</br>
Three Mercedes parked next to an exquisite club. The tall signs read Yoshihara Club.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen has only heard that this was the most renowned club in Ginza and even in Nippon.</br>
</br>
It is said that the person who paid for the construction of this club at that time were a figurehead of the Liberal Party. The purpose of this investment was to allow politicians in his own circle to come to the club and enjoy themselves while negotiating secrets within the party. If they discussed at home, they may be filmed by reporters. If they discussed in the congress halls, it would also be too uptight. So, they decided a private club would be the best choice. In the meantime, it was possible to strengthen relationships through some "extra programs."</br>
</br>
By now, people who come here are not necessarily politicians. There are many large business owners and bankers. Because at the time of the establishment of this club, it was the highest straight club in Napon, so all the people the club accepted had strict identity restrictions. Either you have to be a member, or you are brought in by a member, or you have to prove that your assets are more than 10 billion.</br>
</br>
The club will promise to keep secrets for its members. It is not that there are no reporters who want to sneak in and see what high-level ministers and big entrepreneurs played, but they have all "disappeared" without exception.</br>
</br>
In the spirit of playing something upper-class, Jiang Chen came here.</br>
</br>
However, he just flashed off his passport and the club's reception lady invited him in respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Do you not need me to provide my proof of assets?" Jiang Chen joked.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, you're very comical," the reception lady said, smiling. "Who doesn't know now that you used 11 billion US Dollar to sweep half of Yoto."</br>
</br>
The reception lady quickly completed a membership form for him, and handed the membership card with golden edges to him respectfully. This membership card is for personal use only. It is the highest level membership card of Yoshihara Club and can be used to enter the club's most exclusive private room.</br>
</br>
After taking the card, Jiang Chen just glanced at it and threw it into his pocket.</br>
</br>
"Can I bring bodyguards?"</br>
</br>
"You are the most distinguished S-class member, so of course. However, the club has rules and bodyguards can only stay in the hallway, cannot enter rooms, and cannot carry metal objects. Your private room is 210. Do you need me to take you there?"</br>
</br>
"No, I'll take a look around."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was still curious about this fabled top-tier private club in Japan, and what kind of perverted stuff existed there. He heard that not only the private rooms had interesting entertainment, but there were also some cool stuff outside the private room.</br>
</br>
</br>
After finishing, Jiang Chen turned to the bodyguard behind him, "You don't have to follow and wait for me in the car."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
Since they couldn't bring metal objects in, it was too troublesome to take off the kinetic skeleton; he will simply leave the bodyguard outside. He then followed the red carpet and walked down the corridor to the direction of the private room.</br>
</br>
On this road, he did see two public rooms. Someone was performing on the stage. However, what he was a little disappointed with was that the content of the performance was too serious. There was really no point in the night scene.</br>
</br>
However, when he gave it a thought, he was also relieved.</br>
</br>
After all, it was a high-end club, it would be inappropriate to display something that the public loved? The Heaven (1) wasn't even this blatantâ¦</br>
</br>
Standing in front of the stage, Jiang Chen was disinterested and turned to the door.</br>
</br>
"Excuse me, are you Jiang Chen?"</br>
</br>
After hearing someone call his name, Jiang Chen stopped and looked back.</br>
</br>
This person was dressed in a casual outfit, with thin hair combed back very neatly. He had a high nose and wide forehead, there was a bit of a powerful vibe surrounding him. Those who wanted to enter the gate of the Yoshihara Club would not be unknown characters.</br>
</br>
"And... you are?"</br>
</br>
"I'm Mitsui, and the family owner of the Mitsui Financial Group." Mitsui smiled and stepped in front of him. "I didn't expect to see the richest man in the world here. It's really an honor."</br>
</br>
"It's all false names. I'm still far from the richest man in the world." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Excuse me for being straight forward, is it the first time that Mr. Jiang has come to this place?" Mitsui smilingly said.</br>
</br>
"Oh, why do you think so?"</br>
</br>
"Only people who come here for the first time will look around." Mitsui said, "If it's convenient, please allow me to take you around."</br>
</br>
"It's okay. I will just look around." Jiang Chen refused.</br>
</br>
"Believe me, you must be interested. After all, I'm a member of Kurofune's Asia Division." At the word "Kurofune," Mitsui didn't make a sound but only made the word out with his lips.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen slightly narrowed his eyes, but his facial expression remained unchanged.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then please, Mr. Mitsui, lead the way."</br>
</br>
"This way please."</br>
</br>
On the second floor, Mitsui took Jiang Chen into a chic private room. They sat on the sofa and Mitsui took a small pot of alcohol from the side and poured it into delicate porcelain cups.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang doesn't seem very surprised about my identity." Mitsui was slightly curious.</br>
</br>
"What is there to be surprised about?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
The Kurofune without Tanaka was nothing to fear. Just like Future Group without Jiang Chen would be nothing.</br>
</br>
"Honestly speaking... your disregard makes me very depressed." Mitsui sighed. "You must have taken care of Tanaka."</br>
</br>
"You should have seen it in the news." Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Mitsui shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Here you can be rest assured that you can speak whatever you want. Mr. Jiang stop playing riddles with me. You and I both know that bullets alone will not kill him, it at most will waste a replacement of his. If I haven't guessed correctly, he didn't die in Kenya but died in Yoto."</br>
</br>
"It seems that you know a lot. So what? You confessed this to me, what is your purpose?" Jiang Chen looked at him and said indifferently.</br>
</br>
"I confessed to you without any other intention," then he paused for two seconds. Mitsui looked at Jiang Chen and said in sincere tone, "The Mitsui family became a member of the Kurofune just because of historical reasons. After the nature of the organization changed, we have been trying hard to draw a line with it. But under the threat of Tanaka, we are forced to settle with him..."</br>
</br>
"For example, to provide them with funds?" Jiang Chen said with a sneer.</br>
</br>
Mitsui's expression was awkward.</br>
</br>
"Yes, but we have already introspected. To show sincerity..."</br>
</br>
Mitsui took out a USB from his cuff and put it on the table.</br>
</br>
"This is?"</br>
</br>
"There is a list inside." Mitsui looked at Jiang Chen, "the list of all Kurofune members in the Asian Division."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pinched the USB and looked at Mitsui with intrigue.</br>
</br>
[This guy is also very clever.]</br>
</br>
It was only a matter of time before he will be finished as an accomplice to the Kurofune knowing the end of the Kurofune. Jiang Chen was able to get rid of Tanaka in Napon and his strength has already made Mitsui fear. Thus, he took the initiative to surrender to Jiang Chen, the enemy of the Kurofune, by providing him with the list in exchange for his name to be removed from that list.</br>
</br>
The reason why this list was given to Jiang Chen and not to the government was because he intended to use Jiang Chen's hand to kill those members of the Kurofune that are lurking in Asia.</br>
</br>
The fierceness of Celestial Trade will definitely not allow the members of the Kurofune who are exposed to remain alive.</br>
</br>
Since he has chosen betrayal, then the betrayal must be absolute!</br>
</br>
Even if one is still alive, Mitsui may live in fear. So, simply borrow a knife to kill people, he could remove all these problems!</br>
</br>
"Interesting." Jiang Chen put away the USB as a smile emerged on his face.</br>
</br>
"I hope this is enough to wash my sins," Mitsui said, falsely.</br>
</br>
"It will," Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
Receiving a positive reply, Mitsui finally felt relieved and laughed.</br>
</br>
"I would like to thank Mr. Jiang. In order to express my gratitude, your enjoyment today is on me."</br>
</br>
Just then, a suited bodyguard opened the door and walked to the side of Mitsui. Leaning over, he whispered two sentences.</br>
</br>
It seemed that he had heard some interesting news. Mitsui's eyebrows slightly raised, turned his head, and whispered a few words.</br>
</br>
The bodyguard responded and immediately walked out the door.</br>
</br>
Mitsui turned and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, it's my apology that we talked about business for a long time. I'm sure Mr. Jiang is here to relax. Right? We have a show to enjoy now."</br>
</br>
The voice just fell and the door of the room opened again.</br>
</br>
Two burly bodyguards came in with a chair.</br>
</br>
Sitting in a chair, a beautiful woman was dressed in casual clothes. With adhesives plastered on her mouth, she maintained an indecent sitting posture, and her hands and feet were tied to the chair by nylon rope.</br>
</br>
Looking at the face filled with horror, Jiang Chen felt it looked familiar.</br>
</br>
"Nooooâ"</br>
</br>
The beauty writhed and struggled to break away from her chair. However, this chair was obviously an S&amp;M-specific prop, and could not easily be broken.</br>
</br>
"Prepare ten male actors and a video camera." Mitsui orderly with indifference.</br>
</br>
"Yes!" one of the bodyguards nodded.</br>
</br>
Hearing the words of Mitsui, the beautiful woman's expression turned more fearful. The two long legs tied with nylon rope desperately tried to kick out. However no matter how hard she tried, the center of gravity of the chair was as steady as a rock, and there was no sign of loosening of the rope.</br>
</br>
After examining for a long time, Jiang Chen finally realized where he saw her.</br>
</br>
Isn't this the policewoman he saw in the morning?</br>
</br>
More than a dozen muscular men came in and there was a photographer.</br>
</br>
When Miss Kwai was completely in despair, Jiang Chen suddenly spoke.</br>
</br>
"Leave her to me, it's a waste of a beautiful girl to shoot a movie."</br>
</br>
Mitsui chuckled and responded to Jiang Chen with a look that all men would understand.</br>
</br>
"Then I will not bother. I hope Mr. Jiang will have a good time tonight."</br>
</br>
He gestured, turned around and walked outside the door. The others also left in succession, leaving only the two in the room.</br>
</br>
Seeing that she wouldn't have to suffer a miserable fate, Kwai took a sigh of relief, and tried to calm her breathes.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen walked forward, teared the tape off of her mouth. Because the movement was too brute, tears almost came out of her eyes because of the pain.</br>
</br>
"Oh, long time no see... Although not really that long."</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen's teasing expression, Kwai bit her teeth in humiliation and squeezed out a few words from her mouth</br>
</br>
"Quick... help me untie this."</br>
</br>
"Why?"</br>
</br>
Kwai was stunned. She had originally thought that Jiang Chen regained his conscience and decided to save her, butâ¦</br>
</br>
Looking at her the horrified expression returned to her face, Jiang Chen opened the camera in close proximity, and said evilly.</br>
</br>
"Who said I'm going to untie you? A whip, a candle, or a trojan, choose for yourself."</br>
</br>
Or, all of them.</br>
</br>
It seems like there were many props in the roomâ¦</br>
</br>
(1)Â The Heaven â A high-end club in China known for scandalous things.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
With a deep exhale, Jiang Chen took out a bottle of chilled red wine from the refrigerator. Without any regard to the string of zeros on the list price, he pulled out the corks, took two swigs from the bottle, and then wiped the sweat from his forehead.</br>
</br>
Leaning beside the refrigerator, he noticed an unfriendly sight. Jiang Chen smiled and looked at Kwai with messy hair while holding up the bottle from the distance.</br>
</br>
"Want to have a drink?"</br>
</br>
Delicate nose, high forehead, as well as some arrogance. Her student temperament has not yet faded away; she must have only graduated recently. Otherwise, she would not be able to do such a brainless thing. Sneaking in here to investigate? Is this place that easy to sneak into?</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, she sneaked in in casual clothes. If she wore a uniform, it would be even more perfect, especially with her pair of long legs. It was hard to imagine that the island nation known for short chubby legs would have a pair of perfect legs like thisâ¦</br>
</br>
However, one thing did surprise Jiang Chen. It was the girl's first time.</br>
</br>
Looking at the bright red that slid to the rug along the stool's legs and her white ankles, his mouth formed a curvature.</br>
</br>
"I'll interpret that as you have agreed. Anyway, someone is treating, it would be a waste not to drink it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took another bottle of red wine from the refrigerator. This time he looked at the label.</br>
</br>
Good lord, a bottle of red wine was 100,000, and it was US Dollar. Although he drank more expensive wine before, he still felt shocked by the price. The things in this room were really not what the average person could afford.</br>
</br>
With two bottles of wine, he walked back to Miss Kwai. Jiang Chen then sat on the sofa opposite of her; his sight enjoyed the graceful body for a moment.</br>
</br>
Looking at the grieving expression on her face, Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Looks like you have one? Is your boyfriend an eunuch?"</br>
</br>
"You devil..." Tears hung from the corner of her eyes and Kwai squeezed out the sentence from her teeth.</br>
</br>
"On the contrary, I helped you to get rid of the devil and saved you." Jiang Chen put on some clothes, pulled out the SD card from behind the camera, and looked at her with a smirk. "And actually towards the end, you were cooperating pretty well weren't you ?"</br>
</br>
A blood red color crawled from her neck to her ear. Kwai gritted her teeth and stopped talking.</br>
</br>
"Don't look at me like that," Jiang Chen looked at her hateful gaze and stood up.</br>
</br>
Walking beside her, he leaned over and whispered in her ear. "Even if I didn't do anything, do you think you could have escaped?"</br>
</br>
"You obviously don't realize where this is."</br>
</br>
"Why don't you take a look around this place in a bit, maybe you can see your minister having a 'long conversation' with a student? Of course, it may be the Prime Minister too. From the identity of the guests who enter and leave here, do you not realize anything?"</br>
</br>
</br>
"If you don't want to disappear from this world, you'd better be obedient."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gripped the SD card with a grin, he combed her hair behind her ear.</br>
</br>
"Let today be a lesson. I don't care what you're trying to investigate about me, but I advise you to stop. Otherwise..."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen approached her ear and said half-jokingly.</br>
</br>
"I will have to educate you again."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen heavily emphasized the word "education".</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Judging from the scared look on Kwai's face, Jiang Chen knew very well that this chick was listening to him. If he really did not do anything, presumably the club would not let her go, even if it were for the benefit of other members, they have to leave some blackmail in their hands, or simply let her disappear...</br>
</br>
Well, these reasons were all found after the fact.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not think too much at the time. It was too inconsistent with his unscrupulous style not eating the meat in front of him.</br>
</br>
The SD was thrown into the storage dimensional and kept for his personal pleasure. Jiang Chen left the club, got in his own car, and returned to the suburban mansion.</br>
</br>
When he arrived home, it was almost two o'clock in the morning.</br>
</br>
Qian Xia had already fallen asleep. Jiang Chen did not wake her up. Instead, he returned to his room after washing up and fell asleep till dawn.</br>
</br>
The next morning, Jiang Chen woke up early, jogged around the street, and then returned to the mansion to get on the computer and read the news.</br>
</br>
Not surprisingly, after the news that Tanaka was executed, Yoto's housing prices showed signs of recovery, and at least the momentum of a large-scale sell-off had been curbed.</br>
</br>
Just last night, Future Biology announced the licensing of T and TT virus vaccines to 11 pharmaceutical companies to expand the vaccine penetration rate and swore to kill the zombie virus in its bud. Every time these pharmaceutical companies produced a vaccine, they had to pay 1.5 USD in royalties to Future Biology.</br>
</br>
Because of these two pieces of news, people's fear of the T virus finally cooled down a lot.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, the Bank of Napon further expanded their monetary stimulus measures, the Congress also came up with a plan for recovery and construction. All these played a positive role in Napon's domestic economy. The exchange rate between the yen and the USD rose, but it would take some time before these rescue measures become effective.</br>
</br>
According to an analysis by professional managers hired by Jiang Chen, housing prices in Yoto were still seriously undervalued. The total value of the 11 billion dollar properties he acquired in Yoto, after falling to 9.7 billion, rose back to 10.5 billion. By the time the Napon economy recovers to the level before the outbreak of the virus, the 11 billion in real estate could potentially increase by ten folds.</br>
</br>
Hearing this, Jiang Chen could not help but regret not buying more. There were still more than 20 billion US Dollar in his private account.</br>
</br>
Although the value was low now, there was no trading volume.</br>
</br>
Those small buildings may still be on the market, but the landmark buildings, such as the 109th Building, were definitely not being sold anymore.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was considering whether the information on Tanimura should be exposed or left to be used as a threat against the Napon government in the future. If directly leaked, Napon's economic situation will undoubtedly deteriorate once again and he would be able to take the opportunity of the disruption to acquire several more properties and companies.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen browsed the website, Qian Xia brought breakfast for him and a cup of aromatic freshly ground coffee. Then, she gently said.</br>
</br>
"Master, enjoy. If there is anything you need, just call me."</br>
</br>
"You go ahead." Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
After Qian Xia left the room, Jiang Chen opened several other pages. After seeing nothing interesting, he took out the USB from Mitsui and downloaded the list.</br>
</br>
Looking at the long list, a smile began to form.</br>
</br>
Excellent, as long as this list is sent to the Ghost Agents, it will be a game of mouse and cat.</br>
</br>
The name of Mitsui was removed. He downloaded the list to his watch and sent it to Ayesha through Jean. She then dispatched the Ghost Agents deployed in Asian countries to perform assassination missions.</br>
</br>
After these tasks were completed, Jiang Chen leaned back in his chair and stretched.</br>
</br>
Just as he was planning what to do, the watch on his left hand vibrated suddenly.</br>
</br>
It was news from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
The destroyer wandering near Wanghai finally made a move.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 721: Submarine Observation Station</br>
</div></br>
</br>
With half a month to go before the New Year, a gloomy cloud covered Liuding.</br>
</br>
The survivors living on the deck of Bohai Aircraft Carrier felt a great deal of unease from the wandering destroyer. They'd maintained a certain degree of superiority over the land survivors because were no zombies, mutants, predators or mutated humans on the aircraft carrier. They didn't have to struggle to survive on land.</br>
</br>
However, the situation seemed to be reversed now.</br>
</br>
The threat from the sea made them feel a fear they'd never experienced.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, Jiang Chen honored the defense pact and NAC sent troops!</br>
</br>
Construction of the Hengsha Island fortifications had been completed. The island was equipped with a "Fireball-1" rocket cluster system, 2,000 rockets, and fifty-one J-type electromagnetic pulse cannons. Under the leadership of Cheng Weiguo, a 1,000-strong reinforcement camp was stationed there.</br>
</br>
NAC had no navy - not even a few ships. But it didn't matter. NAC possessed the top artillery in all of Pan-Asia. Just a few days ago, their rockets filled the sky, cleansed Hengsha Island of soldiers then annihilated two mutant nests.</br>
</br>
The whole process was easier than sweeping the floor.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because of NAC's strong forces that the destroyer cruising around Wanghai City was calculated and reserved.</br>
</br>
At least they weren't opposed to communication unlike before.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the shore of Hengsha Island, a spherical submersible device surfaced. From its appearance, this submersible and Jiang Chen's "Droplet No.1" seemed similar, except that the smooth cone on the back was missing.</br>
</br>
After a visual exchange, the five soldiers inside the bunker stood up and carefully surrounded it. The door at the top of the submersible opened and a man in a light blue jumpsuit walked out. Faced with five black weapons, he raised his hands calmly.</br>
</br>
"I'm not a threat. I'm hoping to meet your leader."</br>
</br>
"You're the ambassador from the destroyer?" The leader of the five soldiers stared into the man's eyes.</br>
</br>
"Yes." The man nodded.</br>
</br>
The captain turned his head and ordered the soldier beside him.</br>
</br>
"Make a request to the higher-ups."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
When news of the arrival of the destroyer's ambassador reached Jiang Chen's desk, he immediately sent someone to bring him to Fishbone base and meet the messenger.</br>
</br>
Upon seeing his blue costume, Jiang Chen initially thought the clothing belonged to an underwater fallout shelter. After a closer look at the work unit's ID, he realized this wasn't the case.</br>
</br>
The Beluga Whale Submarine Observation Station appeared to be a harmless organization.</br>
</br>
He just didn't explain why they had a destroyer.</br>
</br>
When Wu Yue met Jiang Chen, he demonstrated respect then reached out his right hand and shook Jiang Chen's hand.</br>
</br>
"I'm Wu Yue, the vice-captain of the Seagull."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen, the general of the NAC military government." Jiang Chen released his hand and looked into his eyes then he asked, "I don't think anyone would feel good about a warship at their front door. To avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, please explain your intentions."</br>
</br>
"We absolutely have peace in mind. You can rest assured," Wu Yue said sincerely.</br>
</br>
"Is that so? Why did you not come to greet us until now?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
It wasn't until NAC made a big move on Hengsha Island that the Seagull finally sent an ambassador. Jiang Chen didn't believe they intended to communicate from the very beginning,</br>
</br>
Wu Yue sighed when he heard Jiang Chen's question.</br>
</br>
"To be completely honest, even if I personally oppose the war, not everyone is peace-loving. There will be no real peace between the giants and dwarves. Only two giants on equal footing can truly negotiate... Do you understand what I mean?"</br>
</br>
"Yes." Jiang Chen nodded, giving him an interested glance. "But what you said surprised me. It seems that even though you remain at sea, you are still in touch with the happenings of the apocalypse?"</br>
</br>
"We're not completely living in isolation." Wu Yue opened his hands. "We're different from the fallout shelters. When the nuclear war broke out, we only had a month's worth of supplies. We stretched that to three months. Ultimately, we still had to think of ways to survive above sea level."</br>
</br>
"Very good. It seems that you intend to trade with us?" Jiang Chen said with a smile. "But I still have a question. I don't know if it's inconvenient for you to answer me, but how do you actually live in the deep sea without being attacked by mutants?"</br>
</br>
"Mutants? There are occasional aggressive mutants such as mutated sharks or mutated killer whales that may pose a threat to our production and life. However, we developed a sonar ten years ago that drove away a school of mutated fish. Although the mutants are scary, they are no longer a threat to us."</br>
</br>
Wu Yue paused for a moment and looked at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"What about you? Are you interested in trading with us?"</br>
</br>
"What do you need?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"We need any resources! Food, steel, ores, and energy!" said Wu Yue.</br>
</br>
Food wasn't so urgent as seaweed was the best source of nutrients, and some fish that weren't highly mutated were also edible. However, energy was the basis for submarine observation stations. Without energy, they couldn't even get the oxygen they needed to survive.</br>
</br>
Unfortunately, although many marine behemoths were huge in size, they didn't have enough crystals for their size. Considering the ammunition required for killing, it clearly wasn't worth wasting the number of crystals needed, so they only had two methods of obtaining energy.</br>
</br>
One was to plunder, and the other was to trade.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled when he heard what Wu Yue said.</br>
</br>
"Well, what can you give me?"</br>
</br>
"It depends what you need. We're good at underwater construction, deepwater maintenance, and we can also escort your trade fleet," Wu Yue said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
The first two were useless. There were so many resources on land. He currently had no plans to expand to the bottom of the sea; providing escorts for the trade fleet would certainly interest the merchants on the Sixth Street, however. Without the threat of major mutant species in the deep sea, ocean trade was far more secure than traversing on land routes.</br>
</br>
"Your proposal is acceptable. Regarding the trade fleet escorts, I can arrange for you to talk to the council on the Sixth Street. The merchants there should be very interested."</br>
</br>
If the Beluga Whale Submarine Observation Station could really freely navigate the deep sea, NAC's trade fleets would be able to spread through the land and sea to Southeast Asia, Japan and other regions, and even farther away. As long as the price was reasonable, working with them was definitely an option that outweighed any disadvantages.</br>
</br>
However, when it came to the deep sea, Jiang Chen suddenly remembered one thing.</br>
</br>
After signing the trade agreement, Jiang Chen asked Wu Yue.</br>
</br>
"Since you traverse the deep sea... Can you tell me about the circumstances surrounding the Pan Asia Corporation's space elevators?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Kwai returned home without her soul. She didn't recall how she left the Yoshihara Club, nor was she aware of the expression she had when she walked into the 50-square-meter apartment.</br>
</br>
She took a shower and collapsed onto her bed. When she woke up the next day at noon, she realized that the pillow was soaked.</br>
</br>
Whenever she thought about what happened yesterday, her body shivered uncontrollably.</br>
</br>
She picked up the phone on her nightstand, and her fingers unconsciously rubbed the screen as she didn't know who to call. The buzz of an incoming e-mail suddenly shocked her. After seeing the sender, she was relieved. It was a work email.</br>
</br>
As expected, the search warrant she applied for the day before was immediately rejected. Her plan wasn't to catch up with the changes. She originally planned on investigating Jiang Chen first and find evidence of his connection with the Yoto Suburbs virus incident then obtain a search warrant to become a legend in the Yoto police community....</br>
</br>
It now appeared that her plan was just a joke.</br>
</br>
Tears dripped down involuntarily, washing away her self-esteem.</br>
</br>
She wanted to call the police, but she felt that her thoughts were ridiculous. She was part of the Yoto Police Department - who would she report to? She suddenly regretted her decision the day before. If she hadn't acted on impulse, she wouldn't have beenâ¦</br>
</br>
She wanted to call her boyfriend, but she didn't know how to seek comfort from him. It was impossible to talk about what happened last night.</br>
</br>
The most ridiculous thing, however, was that the figure who scared her lingered in her mind like a devil.</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
"Space elevator? You're asking the right person; no one is more familiar with that thing than us." Wu Yue suddenly laughed. "Before the war, one of White Beluga Submarine Observation Station's tasks was to investigate the geological environment near the space elevator base No. 3 to detect geological disasters and assist with maintenance."</br>
</br>
"What's the situation like there?" Jiang Chen asked immediately.</br>
</br>
"Destroyed thoroughly." Wu Yue reluctantly shrugged. "I still remember the day. At the beginning of the war, the tracks that streaked into the clouds were hit by several missiles, and 30,000 kilometers of graphene cables collapsed into the sea. An entire island was cut into two pieces by a graphene cable... so I advise you not to count on it."</br>
</br>
[Don't count on it?] He wasn't foolish; Jiang Chen had been counting on the space elevator. NAC had no way of getting to sea or else he would've already sent people to explore the whereabouts of pre-war space elevators. Rebuilding a space elevator was nearly impossible in the apocalypse, where there were few people and resources and no production capacity for technology, but it could be done in the modern world!</br>
</br>
"I think I can still count on it... Do you have any way of moving the wreckage of the space elevator into shallow water?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
</br>
Wu Yue looked at Jiang Chen as if he was a madman, and he facepalmed.</br>
</br>
"Do you know how heavy the base station for the space elevator is?"</br>
</br>
"How heavy is it?"</br>
</br>
"With a displacement of 10 million tons, no power system is capable. After being anchored, it has to rely on special transport equipment to redeploy. Not to mention that it's still sinking at the bottom of the sea. Not to mention shallow sea - it's not easy to bring to the surface to begin with."</br>
</br>
"I see..." Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
"What do you want to do with a space elevator? It can only be deployed at the equator," Wu Yue wondered.</br>
</br>
Wu Yue had another thought he failed to verbalize. Now that outer space was filled with space debris and looked like an asteroid belt from afar, there was no way to develop in outer space.</br>
</br>
"You don't have to worry about what I'm using it for." Jiang Chen waved. After contemplating for a moment, he continued, "Well, you can escort our construction ships. We'll be responsible for the shipment. We can discuss the price again?"</br>
</br>
"I will convey your proposal to my superiors and give you a reply tomorrow at the latest." Wu Yue nodded.</br>
</br>
"Then you can take your leave now," said Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It wasn't impossible to build a space elevator from scratch. The Graphene Research Institute in the modern world developed a graphene cable that could be used to construct a space elevator. Although an elevator of 22nd-century standards couldn't be achieved, a primary stage space elevator could still be built.</br>
</br>
However, unlike Penglai, even if the production capacity of the New Malaysia Special District was completely directed to the space elevator project, it would take at least five years to complete the entire project.</br>
</br>
In other words, when the space elevator would be completed, it would be 2023.</br>
</br>
But if the wreckage of the space elevator from the apocalypse could be transported into the modern world, it would make things much easier.</br>
</br>
It wouldn't be impossible for the project to be completed within one year.</br>
</br>
Wu Yue didn't disappoint Jiang Chen's expectations. The White Beluga Submarine Observation Station quickly agreed with Jiang Chen's proposal. After some bargaining, the two sides finally reached a preliminary cooperation agreement.</br>
</br>
NAC set up a port on Hengsha Island, north of Wanghai City, where the merchants from Sixth Street would trade necessities with the station. Items traded would include food, raw materials, some household goods, industrial products, and a limited number of arms.</br>
</br>
The settlement currency was limited to NAC's credit, and the tariffs were tentatively set at 10%.</br>
</br>
The space elevator's transportation agreement was written in another agreement.</br>
</br>
White Beluga Submarine Observation Station would dissemble, repair space elevator bases, and recover the wreckage of space elevators from outer space. The NAC was responsible for dispatching transport vessels.</br>
</br>
Because the sunken space elevator was far from Wanghai, and the depth of the sea near Wanghai was relatively shallow, it wasn't convenient to place a space elevator base there. After discussion with the Observation Station, Jiang Chen decided to use Taipei as a transit point.</br>
</br>
For Jiang Chen, it didn't matter where he shipped these parts to the modern world. If it wasn't for the fact that he was unfamiliar with the station, he would've rushed directly to the targeted sea area to transport it from there and save time.</br>
</br>
After signing an agreement with the Observation Station, the expeditionary forces of NAC also finished mobilizing.</br>
</br>
The AS Order steel airship could take off and fly along the coastline toward the island of Yizhou. It was expected to arrive in Taipei within eight hours. Accompanied by the Zhao Corporation's trade fleets, their main task was to act as guides and communicate with survivors on the island of Yizhou.</br>
</br>
Zhao Corporation was familiar with the situation in Taipei. The rocket engines and aviation equipment acquired by NAC were all obtained from the launch site in Taipei.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's instructions to the captain, Li Wang, were simple - they were to establish an outpost in Taipei with 200 Marines along with radar stations and lighthouses. They were to establish positive relationships with local survivors as permitted by theÂ circumstances and, if possible, integrate those survivors under the NAC banner.</br>
</br>
For this second NAC crusade, Jiang Chen gave Li Wang a high degree of autonomy. During the Hongcheng expedition, the ex-guard captain had proved his abilities.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen also believed the captain he personally promoted would definitely live up to his expectations.</br>

</div></br>
</br>
AS Order had taken off. The destroyers wandering near the coast of Wanghai had already returned. Before returning to the modern world, Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao visited Sixth Street. After being warmly received by officials, they visited the industrial development area.</br>
</br>
Rows of tank shells were located outside the military factory. Jiang Chen and Sun Jiao walked alongside the industrial park. Jiang Chen looked at the workers who were working on the assembly line. Compared to the modern world New Malaysia Special District, the industrial park in the apocalypse could only be described as "miniature."</br>
</br>
Due to population constraints, industrial development on the wasteland was a hundred times more difficult compared to the present day. Even if the equipment technology far surpassed the modern world, the production capacity of the modern world couldn't be matched.</br>
</br>
The production output of Future Heavy Industries was ten times the total number of workers in the NAC. Sometimes, Jiang Chen couldn't help but wonder how great it would be to move some workers to the wasteland. Of course, that was just wishful thinking. Lin Lin's research on transporting people had stalled; Sun Xiaorou jokingly dubbed him the name "Hamster Killer."</br>
</br>
Each experimenter was a hamster.</br>
</br>
And those poor hamsters died without exception...</br>
</br>
As he watched power armor being moved out of the factory by a construction vehicle, Jiang Chen asked Sun Jiao, who was standing next to him:</br>
</br>
"How many power armors do we have?"</br>
</br>
"A total of 325 sets, my general." Sun Jiao grinned as she playfully spoke.</br>
</br>
Judging by the curvature of her mouth, Miss General was apparently also very pleased with the production quota of NAC.</br>
</br>
"That much?" Jiang Chen was surprised.</br>
</br>
According to Han Junhua's teaching of military knowledge from before the war, 300 power armors were sufficient to arm three mechanized infantry battalions.</br>
</br>
He still remembered Zhao Chenwu told him a year ago that the monthly output of power armor was as high as ten units, which was the case when the capacity of the military factory was operating at its maximum. What exactly happened to make the output of power armor increase by so much?</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao read the confusion in his eyes and answered his question.</br>
</br>
"It seems that your memory isn't very good. Did you forget that during the last expedition, we brought Hongcheng area under our sphere of influence? With the opening of the airship shipping route, many downstream processes have been outsourced. Many survivors from Hongcheng migrated to Wanghai. The production capacity of Sixth Street long surpassed that a few months ago."</br>
</br>
"I see." Jiang Chen grinned joyfully and nodded.</br>
</br>
The two continued to walk along the street filled with factories and workshops.</br>
</br>
"Speaking of which, it'll be New Year's soon."</br>
</br>
"Yes, the 2018 New Year. The days have gone by quickly," Jiang Chen said emotionally.</br>
</br>
</br>
"...then, will you spend New Year's here?"</br>
</br>
Looking at Sun Jiao's hopeful eyes, Jiang Chen couldn't refuse. Last year, he spent New Year's in the modern world. It looked like this year, he would spend it here.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"Great, Yao Yao will definitely look forward to it."</br>
</br>
"Aren't you the one who's looking forward to it most?" Jiang Chen teased.</br>
</br>
"Hmm... I'm also very much looking forward to it."</br>
</br>
Her crescent-like eyebrows and the curvature of her lips revealed Sun Jiao's mood. Looking at her joyous face, Jiang Chen also smiled and caught up with her quick steps.</br>
</br>
The inspections ended before dark and the two returned to the mansion via helicopter.</br>
</br>
On the helicopter, Jiang Chen suddenly sighed and said:</br>
</br>
"I feel regretful today."</br>
</br>
"Regretful? I feel happy." Sun Jiao moaned with dissatisfaction and couldn't understand why Jiang Chen suddenly said that.</br>
</br>
"We spent all day at the factory and I didn't take you to the shopping street."</br>
</br>
Sun Jiao's cheeks blushed and she rolled her eyes.</br>
</br>
"Can you finish your sentence next time?"</br>
</br>
Back at Fishbone base, Jiang Chen went to the General's office in the community center. When he arrived at the office, Han Junhua was standing next to the holographic map. The map was locked onto Yizhou Island, and there was a small green area marked in the northern part of the island.</br>
</br>
"Is the expeditionary army there?"</br>
</br>
Han Junhua nodded.</br>
</br>
"The Order is anchored in the northern part of the island and 200 expeditionary forces have landed in Taipei. According to feedback from Li Wang, the supply station is under construction. He's currently leading 200 expeditionary forces to search nearby areas."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded and asked, "What's the attitude of the local survivors?"</br>
</br>
"They're very vigilant against outsiders, but they haven't made any hostile moves for the time being."</br>
</br>
"Very good. It looks like Li Wang is doing well." Jiang Chen's lips revealed a smile.</br>
</br>
After the supply station was established, the second supply boat could deliver supplies and reinforcements to this group of pioneer troops. By taking Yizhou Island under their control, it could be used as a springboard to spread NAC's influence to southern and southeastern Asia, extending the trade route to more distant areas.</br>
</br>
After all, it wasn't as convenient to get to Yoto as Xin. Jiang Cheng didn't want to disappear long-term, so this time, he didn't stay in the apocalypse for long. After he dealt with trivial affairs, he returned to the modern world.</br>
</br>
With the virus crisis coming to an end, Yoto's colleges and universities had also resumed classes. Qian Xia, who was still studying at Waseda University, naturally received an email from the school about the resumption of classes.</br>
</br>
When the mansion was empty, she just went there regularly to clean the rooms. But now that the master was living at the mansion, she naturally couldn't run between both places like before.</br>
</br>
After some consideration, she spoke with Jiang Chen and asked for his advice. If Jiang Chen needed her to stay at the mansion to take care of his daily life, she could drop out of school and be his full-time maid.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen rejected her proposal and asked her to study hard. Her full-time maid position could wait until she completed her education. He would have to return to Xin soon afterward. If there weren't any special requirements to do so, he wouldn't return to Yoto often.</br>
</br>
In order to make it easier for her to travel, Jiang Chen gave her a car. The happy maid kissed his face. Jiang Chen didn't have any particular reaction, but because of her own "out of line" behavior, the maid, holding her skirt, felt her heart pounding hard.</br>
</br>
Unlike most businessmen who had potbellies and bald heads, Jiang Chen's body, although it wasn't completely muscular, was definitely symmetrical. He was strong and was a little handsome. Qian Xia enjoyed his presence.</br>
</br>
Looking at Qian Xia's blushing face, Jiang Chen's thoughts turned to when he would eat this rabbit. Her shyness mixed with curiosity and passion always tested his limits.</br>
</br>
However, as he was planning to "slowly savor" her, news came from Future Technology. The development of the virtual reality shopping mall finally ended.</br>
</br>
It seemed that there was no opportunity to slowly savor her.</br>
</br>
He could only devour...</br>

</div></br>
</br>
After half a month of military operations in the BelÃ©m Devon region of Somalia, NATO successfully captured the warlord-controlled area. At the same time, the United Nations was pressured by various parties to eventually issue a controversial document.</br>
</br>
The zombies were defined as unnatural deaths, allowing the army to kill zombies.</br>
</br>
Interestingly, when discussing this issue, many countries stubbornly voted against it for strange reasons. For example, the reason why France voted against it was because there was no death penalty in the country. Therefore, it wouldn't vote on this solution involving the death penalty. But India was even odder - their reasoning behind their vote was because they thought the living dead were servants of Shiva...</br>
</br>
In any case, even if it was controversial, this long-overdue document was passed through the efforts of all parties.</br>
</br>
NATO sent two tank companies and cleared out the zombies from the infected area on the border between Somalia and Ethiopia with the help of drones. At the same time, far on the other side of the world, the self-defense forces and UA troops stationed in Napon began to enter the quarantined Shinagawa area of Yoto and cleared out zombies there.</br>
</br>
The vaccines launched by 11 global pharmaceutical companies in cooperation with Future Biology had fully entered the market. It was expected that in the next four months, it would be sufficient to popularize in the world's major countries. Based on the patent fee of 1.50 per vaccine, it was expected that in the next four months, Future Biology would receive 5.7 billion US Dollar in revenue.</br>
</br>
The figure was almost equivalent to four years of Future Biology's net profits.</br>
</br>
However, as a cost, granting the licensing of the technology meant overdrawing the potential profits of the T virus vaccine. After all, other pharmaceutical companies were more dominant in terms of production scale; even if the cost had an additional 1.50 in royalties, this cost could easily be made up elsewhere.</br>
</br>
In the past few days in Yoto, Jiang Chen headhunted a professional manager and formed a professional real estate management team to manage the 11 billion USD of real estate he acquired in Yoto. He was responsible for the maintenance of buildings and leasing of shops.</br>
</br>
At Yoto International Airport, Qian Xia waved at Jiang Chen emotionally.</br>
</br>
The day before leaving Yoto, Jiang Chen eventually showed his claws to Qian Xia in her maid uniform. At first, she resisted somewhat, but it didn't take long before she obeyed while incoherently murmuring some words.</br>
</br>
Maybe it was because the pain of the first time was unforgettable, or maybe it was because of other reasons. After that night, Jiang Chen felt that she looked at him with eyes containing a different glory.</br>
</br>
"Will master still come back?" Qian Xia buried her head and whispered in a low voice.</br>
</br>
"Occasionally perhaps."</br>
</br>
</br>
"Then...when I graduate, could I go to Xin to find you?"</br>
</br>
"Of course."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen tousled her head and didn't say much in terms of a farewell. He then turned and boarded the Gulfstream G650 private jet at the airport.</br>
</br>
Under her watchful gaze, the plane disappeared into the distant horizon.</br>
</br>
Soon after Jiang Chen returned to Xin, Future Technology and Amazon, eBay, Taobao, Jingdong and many other e-commerce giants published announcements on their official websites simultaneously.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the Phantom Helmet also welcomed its second system update. After the update, an application management program appeared on the interface. Just like Apple's App Store and Android's Android Market, Phantom's Helmets also allowed users to download apps freely.</br>
</br>
However, at present, although Future Group announced VR program development tools and provided server rental services, no company could demonstrate the advantages of the VR platform. They had been investigating how to transfer existing applications to the VR platform.</br>
</br>
So, for now, aside from the web browser, only two applications existed in the application management program.</br>
</br>
One was the Godly Land, and the other was the newly launched virtual reality online shopping platform â VRstore.</br>
</br>
The newly launched VRstore currently had two modes.</br>
</br>
One was a simple mode combining plane images and VR images. Users could search for items just like on traditional e-commerce stores and find what they wanted in the shortest amount of time. The only difference was that the searched items could be held directly in hand, and the searched clothes could be directly worn.</br>
</br>
The other mode was the virtual mall mode. After entering this mode, the user would appear on a virtual street designed by Future Technology, which referenced New York's Times Square and other famous commercial streets. According to a certain algorithm, the goods and decorations in the shops were randomly processed, so that the user could experience and enjoy randomized products with their friends.</br>
</br>
According to the news released by Future Technology, there were seven e=commerce giants that joined the VRstore. On the first day of the VRstore launch, all the top shops of the seven giants were made available with a grand total of 800,000 products available.</br>
</br>
Many users who tried the VRstore experienced the joy ofÂ VR shopping. While the sales volume continued to rise, this powerful VRstore was also positively rated by users.</br>
</br>
"The skirt I purchased is already here. It's amazing. It's exactly the same as I saw in the VRstore!"</br>
</br>
"I used to be unwilling to buy expensive clothes online. Not to mention size, but what I wear and what models wear seem completely different.Â Now it's okay, I can try clothes in a VR environment and find things that really suit me."</br>
</br>
"It's crazy, how did Future Technology do it?"</br>
</br>
"It's a pity there's no tasting function. If the taste of food could be replicated, I'd be able to eat in the virtual mall... I wonder if you can be full in the virtual world?"</br>
</br>
"My God, my wallet! How did I spend so much money! Oh..."</br>
</br>
For technical reasons, VR images of products were currently produced by Future Technology. Therefore, images of these 800,000 products were randomly selected, sent to Future Technology's headquarters, and scanned using special equipment, producing high-resolution VR images.</br>
</br>
As for the VR image production fees for products, Jiang Chen didn't scam them and charged them a cost of 1,000 US Dollar per item. And for the products registered in the VRstore, a monthly data management fee of 10 US Dollar was charged.</br>
</br>
Compared with the profits gained from the VRstore, theÂ investment was definitely worth the money.</br>
</br>
Phantom helmets had reached hundreds of millions of active users worldwide, and VRstore was one of the only two applications which created strong exposure. Controlling such a large amount of traffic, the price could double and shops would still be willing to pay.</br>
</br>
In addition, advertising and other costs were calculated separately and were quite pricey. If the product was on VRstore's homepage recommendation list, the revenue of the shop would have to be divided equally with Future Technology. Even though the price was a bit high, there was still a stream of shops that applied for front page exposure.</br>
</br>
These charges, together with data management fees, were the two major revenue streams for VRstore.</br>
</br>
Some analysts realized that the launch of VRstore would signal a new period of downward trends for physical stores.</br>
</br>
For example, the British "Observer Daily" had thoroughly analyzed this issue.</br>
</br>
"We had optimistic thoughts that online shopping would never replace physical stores and would affect the spending habits of some people at the most. Physical stores have an advantage that online shopping can't replace, such as intuitively touching the products you want to purchase, and the fun in shopping itself. These are elements not available in online shopping."</br>
</br>
"Now, VRstore seems to have done it - everything that online shopping was unable to do. Maybe this will be a start to completely rewriting the landscape of the global retail industry."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 725: Miraculous Sales Figures</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The relationship between major e-commerce companies and VRstore was akin to the relationship between retail chains and shopping malls. From payment to logistics, traditional e-commerce stores were responsible for providing the goods, while VRstore provided the "window." The relationship between the two parties more closely resembled a symbiotic relationship.</br>
</br>
In fact, Jiang Chen previously considered starting from scratch - he thought about getting rid of those veteran e-commerce giants, taking a series of chains from payment to logistics and creating a platform belonging to Future Technology. However, after discussion with Xia Shiyu, he gave up on this plan.</br>
</br>
It was like Future Technology was building a rocket, but there was no need to carefully polish each screw.</br>
</br>
Inside Future Building on Coro Island, wearing a perfectly-tailored business outfit, Xia Shiyu stood at Jiang Chen's desk and reported the stats of VRstore. From the excitement flowing out of her solemn face, Jiang Chen could already sense the gratifying accomplishments of the "VR+ e-commerce" plan that had been in the works for half a year.</br>
</br>
"... According to feedback from the North American branch, Amazon's total revenue rose 18% in the first week, while the VRstore platform accounted for 40% of this week's transaction volume. eBay's transaction revenue also rose by 13%. The two e-commerce giants immediately submitted an additional cooperation agreement to us. They're hoping we can relax the auditing process and speed up the process for additional shops to enter virtual reality."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen comfortably leaned back in his seat.</br>
</br>
"What about Hua?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu's lips formed a smile then she said:</br>
</br>
"Taobao's revenue rose by 28% compared with last week, Jingdong 34%."</br>
</br>
This 28% increase wasn't to be underestimated. Although it was attributable to many factors such as natural growth and online marketing, the entire sales base was gigantic. Just looking at Taobao alone, Taobao's annual transaction volume in 2015 was 3 trillion! And since 2010, it had maintained a 60% increase over the years.</br>
</br>
Although the growth rate had slowed down, according to Taobao's 2017 data, the transaction volume still exceeded 4 trillion. Now, with the sudden emergence of VRstore, Taobao's transaction value could break the 5 trillion milestone.</br>
</br>
"It's almost like a money printing machine," Jiang Chen exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"I think so too." Xia Shiyu nodded in agreement. "Do you know how much money we made on VRstore last week?"</br>
</br>
"How much?" Jiang Chen was intrigued.</br>
</br>
"1.2 billion."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this figure, he was stunned.</br>
</br>
However, Xia Shiyu seemed to think that the number wasn't shocking enough, so she added, "1.2 billion US Dollar."</br>
</br>
After recovering from his shock, Jiang Chen smiled and touched his nose with embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"...If you didn't tell me, I would've thought it was Vietnamese Dong."</br>
</br>
</br>
1.2 billion a week was more money than a money printing machine! A money printer couldn't print that fast!</br>
</br>
Even more shocking was that this 1.2 billion was their income after tax. Although the scanning fee for the one million items contributed to more than half of the sum, the figure of 1.2 billion still stunned Jiang Chen. Alibaba's net profit per year was around 7 billion and it ranked top among the global e-commerce giants. Future Group's VRstore only took a week to earn the same amount Ali earned in a quarter.</br>
</br>
Once VRstore matured, what would it become?</br>
</br>
In order to celebrate this victory, Jiang Chen gave a large red envelope to each of the 300 employees of the VRstore project team and also hosted a party on the Hot Spring Island.</br>
</br>
From the beginning, VRstore had used programmers from the modern world and independently developed VR programs. For Future Group, it was undoubtedly a big step towards technological independence.</br>
</br>
For now, in all of Future Group, only Future Technology managed to achieve this feat.</br>
</br>
The first reaction of people with vested interests in emerging technology was repulsion. The second reaction was determining how to stop technology. The third reaction was thinking about how to respond to the trend and make changes. However, if they began to think about change three beats slower than the rhythm of the world, they would unfortunately be eliminated by the times.</br>
</br>
Bentonville, Arkansas, home to Walmart, the world's largest retailer.</br>
</br>
This legendary retail company had a near-mythical family history. When Fortune magazine released their list of the world's top 500 companies in 2007, Walmart topped the list with a revenue of 35.11 billion US Dollar and received this honor for six consecutive years. When Fortune magazine began assessing the top 500 companies in the world in 1955, Walmart was just a mom and pop shop in Bentonville.</br>
</br>
At that moment, in the Walmart headquarters, the board of directors held an emergency meeting to discuss their strategy for dealing with the impact of VRstore on the retail landscape.</br>
</br>
"Which idiot has the proposal from Future Technology? We could've taken the VRstore ride."</br>
</br>
"We had a vote from the board of directors, Mr. Casero." CEO Macmillan rose and responded to the director who mocked him.</br>
</br>
"Oh? You mean, all of us here are idiots?"</br>
</br>
"Don't get me wrong - I absolutely didn't mean that, Mr. Casero. Unless you personally think so."</br>
</br>
"Youâ"</br>
</br>
Knock, knock, knock.</br>
</br>
The sound of knocking on the table forcefully dispersed the noise around the conference room.</br>
</br>
The chairman, sitting at the head of the conference table, Robson Walton, stopped knocking his hand and glanced at the two men with cloudy but sharp eyes.</br>
</br>
"We have more important things to do than arguing, don't we?"</br>
</br>
The aged Walton family owner had a high prestige among the board of directors. When they saw Old Walton speaking, all the directors looked at each other and quickly ended their meaningless arguments. McMillan shrugged, opened his mouth, finally said nothing, and sat back.</br>
</br>
Yes, Walmart had rejected Future Technology.</br>
</br>
Walmart also ran its own e-commerce website, and it was the third-ranked in the UA. But six months ago, they didn't accept the concept of "VR + e-commerce" proposed by Future Technology. As for why, Walmart's network was comprehensive; it could connect its large physical retail stores and online businesses together to provide a full range of customer shopping services, so there was no need to rely on the VR platform.</br>
</br>
No Americans were unfamiliar with the products on Walmart's shelves.</br>
</br>
Also, if Walmart supermarkets appeared on the virtual reality platform, this would definitely have a greater impact on Walmart's physical store sales.</br>
</br>
But the facts proved their decision to be horrendously wrong.</br>
</br>
Whether they were willing to accept it or not, Walmart's physical store sales would be impacted by VRstore. Their refusal to enter VRstore resulted in more market share in ecommerce taken away by Amazon and eBay.</br>
</br>
"We were at a disadvantage against Amazon. Now. VRstore has pushed us directly to our pitfall. It's not only Amazon, but eBay is also trying to gain distance on us." One director shook his head as he spoke.</br>
</br>
"It isn't too late to make up for it now. I'll personally go visit Xin. I'll make the secretary book a ticket for tomorrow," Macmillan said.</br>
</br>
"It isn't too late? Even if we change our minds now and beg Future Technology to let us join VRstore, do you think we could immediately enter the VR platform?" Casero, who had previously argued with him, mocked him. "Scanning 800,000 products took more than half a year. If we enter now, there are still countless shops ahead of us in queue. Maybe this time next year, Walmart's merchandise will appear on the shelves of VRstore?"</br>
</br>
It would be impossible for them to set aside their partners and allow a latecomer jump in.</br>
</br>
"I'll persuade him," Macmillan said earnestly.</br>
</br>
"Haâ"</br>
</br>
Casero was about to say a few mocking words, but Mr. Walton, the chairman, didn't give him a chance to speak and forcibly interrupted him.</br>
</br>
"You don't need to book anything - take my plane. Don't wait until tomorrow - go today."</br>
</br>
Holding his breath, Macmillan nodded his head seriously.</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
</br>

"How was your time in Los Santos?"</br>
</br>
"It was okay. I'm going to go back to Wanghai tomorrow."</br>
</br>
"Is filming complete already?</br>
</br>
Coro Island was as sunny as ever today. Leaning against a beach chair, Jiang Chen was sluggishly talking to Liu Yao on the other side of the globe. Ayesha, who was wearing a bikini, brought a cold drink for him and leaned over to kiss him on the forehead then ran to the beach.</br>
</br>
"It's long been completed; it was just a two-minute performance, and I ended up dying." Liu Yao stuck out her tongue and groaned.</br>
</br>
For a minor character, two minutes of screen time was quite enough. Of course, she didn't have any dissatisfaction, but she was just used to ranting to Jiang Chen over the phone.</br>
</br>
"Will you see the movie at my place?" Jiang Chen smirked.</br>
</br>
Liu Yao's face instantly turned red.</br>
</br>
His smirk reminded her that the last time she went to Xin, he was watching her movie while doing some strange things.</br>
</br>
Her eyebrows raised. Liu Yao provocatively teased him:</br>
</br>
"Oh? Do you only last two minutes?"</br>
</br>
"If you forgot, why don't you try to find out?"</br>
</br>
"Pervert!"</br>
</br>
Hanging onto his phone with a smile, Jiang Chen began to enjoy the summer.</br>
</br>
The cloud in the distance was like a boat, drifting along the blue sky. The sea breeze with a hint of coconut swept by his face and took away the heat from his body. Jiang Chen couldn't help but close his eyes and take a nap on this perfect day.</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
The next day, Jiang Chen went to Dr. Amos's lab and observed the experimental results of the "spiritual bridging." However, the experiment unfortunately seemed to have encountered a bottleneck. Although the last-generation chip solved the issue of overheating, it seemed to have a heavy load on the brain.</br>
</br>
Being connected for half an hour consecutively could cause the user to fall into a coma and interrupt the connection. Amos was doing some debugging.</br>
</br>
However, even then, his research results were astonishing.</br>
</br>
It was the only piece of technology from the modern world surpassing the 22nd century that Jiang Chen had seen. As for how far Amos could go in this field, Jiang Chen wasn't able to foresee the limit.</br>
</br>
As he left Dr. Amos's lab, a call from Xia Shiyu came in. She said Walmart's CEO had requested a meeting with him.</br>
</br>
"Walmart? Is there a problem with nutrient supply? Why didn't he seek out Tao Ming?" Jiang Chen asked with confusion.</br>
</br>
"Not about nutrient supply, it's about VRstore..."</br>
</br>
After listening to the explanation from Xia Shiyu, Jiang Chen slapped his head and realized.</br>
</br>
With Future Group increasing their influence, aside from the initial negotiations with the major e-commerce companies, Jiang Chen had delegated the entire project to Future Technology's project team. Ning Huajian, who took over Xia Shiyu's role, was very competent in his position and the people who were chosen for the project team were all elites of the company. In the end, their results didn't disappoint Jiang Chen. Therefore, Jiang Chen didn't question the details too much.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Where's he now?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"In Future Building."</br>
</br>
"Is he already there? Let him go to my office and wait for me."</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
After hanging up the phone, Jiang Chen took the elevator and went straight to the floor where his office was located. At the door of the president's office, he met the representative of Walmart who came to negotiate, CEO Macmillan.</br>
</br>
Upon seeing Jiang Chen, Macmillan greeted him enthusiastically.</br>
</br>
"It's nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang Chen. Please forgive me for my uninvited presence."</br>
</br>
"Haha, not at all. Future Group welcomes your arrival. Mr. Macmillan...Standing in the doorway isn't the gentlemanly way of hospitality. Please, come inside."</br>
</br>
After McMillan was invited into the office, the two sat on the sofa, and the office assistant dressed in business professional attire skillfully made two cups of coffee for them.</br>
</br>
"Get Ning Huajian to come here."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
The assistant nodded with a smile, listened to Jiang Chen's instructions, and left the office.</br>
</br>
Since mid-2017, the headquarters of Future Group subsidiaries had all moved to Xin, including Future Technology from Hong Kong. Although the Chief Executive triedÂ to convince him to stay, Jiang Chen still executed this decision.</br>
</br>
As for the reason, it was very simple. This move would save Future Group billions of dollars in tax revenue each year. Future Technology's operations in Hua would be carried out through a subsidiary and would no longer be directly managed by the company. There were many benefits to the localization of management and wouldn't be repeated here.</br>
</br>
While waiting for Ning Huajian's arrival, Jiang Chen looked at Macmillan and asked with a smile,</br>
</br>
"Mr. Macmillan, I heard you're here because of the VRstore?"</br>
</br>
"Yes. About this point, I've already filled in the visit application," Macmillan said comically.</br>
</br>
Soon, the office door was pushed open again, and Ning Huajian came in.</br>
</br>
"Boss, were you looking for me?"</br>
</br>
"This gentleman is looking for you, Walmart's CEO. Please sit down." Jiang Chen gestured toward the sofa and introduced Ning Huajian to Macmillan.</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's introduction, Ning Huajia immediately understood Macmillan's intentions and smiled at McMillan.</br>
</br>
"Future Technology, and even more so, VRstore, welcomes every partner to join us. If Walmart is willing to join our family, I certainly welcome you with open arms."</br>
</br>
However, Ning Huajian's tone suddenly changed.</br>
</br>
"However, it's a pity that VRstore's operations team has a limited ability to scan products. Establishing VR images isn't an easy task. For now, we can only scan 100,000 items per month."</br>
</br>
Ning Huajian didn't finish his sentence, but the meaning was obvious.</br>
</br>
Every month, 100,000 items were permitted to enter VRstore. It simply wasn't enough for seven e-commerce giants. When Walmart was asked, they didn't join. Now that cooperation agreements had been signed with the other e-commerce companies, why didn't Walmart do this earlier?</br>
</br>
"Can't the scanning speed be increased?" Macmillan asked anxiously.</br>
</br>
"The number of 100,000 will definitely increase gradually, but as you know, we must give priority to the needs of our partners," said Ning Huajian.</br>
</br>
Macmillan was silent for a moment as he adjusted his thought process.</br>
</br>
"I know our proposal may make it very difficult for you, but we promise we won't let you do it for free."</br>
</br>
"At the 2018 Annual Global Merchandise Exhibition, Walmart will be the organizer of the exhibition. If you can help us scan 300,000 items onto VRstore within the next two months, we'll invite you to assist the organizer."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Macmillan looked at Ning Huajian and looked at Jiang Chen again.</br>
</br>
"...to host a Global Merchandise Exhibition based on the VR platform with the world watching."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 727: VRcity Plan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In a small villa with a wide backyard in Florida, a man was preparing to go to work when his wife suddenly ran to him with a tablet.</br>
</br>
"Honey, check this out."</br>
</br>
"What's the matter, my dear? Let me see..." The man took the tablet from his wife's hands with a smile. He casually glanced at the news. However, two seconds later, he suddenly opened his eyes and couldn't believe it. He mumbled, "God, the world's first VR merchandise exhibition, hundreds of millions of people participating in the grand event on the same stage. It will no longer just be enterprises - consumers are also allowed to participate."</br>
</br>
The idea of hosting an exposition on the VR platform was undoubtedly a wild idea. However, no one doubted whether Future Technology had the capability. When this news was announced for the first time, almost all netizens felt their expectations lifting, and all the businessmen were keenly aware of the business opportunities.</br>
</br>
This would break the business-to-business limitations in previous expositions, connecting businesses, and business through B2B while connecting businesses and consumers through B2C. The Expo would no longer just be a procurement conference for companies but would also be a promotional event for the products themselves!</br>
</br>
"I must go to the company quickly. The boss will definitely be interested in this news." The man kissed his wife on her forehead. He put the tablet in his briefcase and immediately rushed to the garage.</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
From large machinery, motorcycles, auto parts, chemical products, clocks, and watches, to kitchen utensils, ceramics, home decorations, medical equipment, menswear, and office stationery... This global merchandise expo covered almost every aspect of life and production. Over 500,000 pieces of goods would be exhibited and the duration of the exhibition was more than five months.</br>
</br>
When McMillan proposed this proposal, Jiang Chen immediately agreed to his conditions without hesitation.</br>
</br>
Scan 300,000 items for Walmart to enter the VRstore, and in the future, Walmart would be given the same priority as the other seven other e-commerce companies. For Future Technology, it was nothing difficult.</br>
</br>
They would expand their staff and improve the efficiency of VR image production...</br>
</br>
The monthly scanning quota would be raised to 400,000. The quota of 150,000 would be allocated to Walmart every month, just enough to meet their 300,000 target. The additional 100,000 units would be allocated to the VR Merchandise Exhibition, as long as the 500,000 items were scanned within five months.</br>
</br>
If this merchandise exhibition was successful, it would definitely be a win-win situation for VRstore and Walmart!</br>
</br>
"Socializing and shopping - we can integrate the two! I suddenly thought of a brilliant idea!" Standing in Jiang Chen's office, after reporting on the progress of the exposition, Ning Huajian suddenly began to sell to Jiang Chen his own idea.</br>
</br>
</br>
"What idea?" Jiang Chen put down the file in his hands.</br>
</br>
"Based on Godly Land, we can add a third function to the VRstore! Virtual City!"</br>
</br>
"What's the difference between this and our 'virtual mall mode'?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"The difference is huge!" said Ning Huajian with excitement. "The virtual mall is a group shopping mode based on the friend system of the Phantom Helmet, similar to 'Lan.' The concept I proposed is more like an MMORPG."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing the word MMORPG, Jiang Chen suddenly understood what he meant. His eyes were filled with light.</br>
</br>
"You meanâ¦"</br>
</br>
"Yeah! We can build a virtual city that will dynamically expand with the number of users, just like in Godly Land!"</br>
</br>
"When shopping, people can also exchange ideas with users who are also shopping, become friends and invite each other into their own private spaces. Not only that - when users meet their social needs in the virtual city, we can launch virtual prop buying features such as houses, cars, furniture, clothes, kitchen utensils... Before purchasing these things in the world, users can buy them in the virtual world as a trial."</br>
</br>
After listening, Jiang Chen's eyes turned brighter.</br>
</br>
"This idea is quite interesting."</br>
</br>
Inspiration was magical. Although it began with fragmented ideas, Ning Huajian'sÂ imaginative vision resonated with Jiang Chen. With an exchange of opinions between the two, these fragmented ideas were gradually pieced together into a complete puzzle.</br>
</br>
"VRcity," Jiang Chen suddenly said, interrupting Ning Huajian's endless enthusiasm.</br>
</br>
"What?" Ning Huajian paused.</br>
</br>
"I said, VRcity." Jiang Chen looked at Ning Huajian with passion. "These ideas don't need to stick to VRstore's framework at all. We can completely set up a new project team to design a virtual social software called VRcity."</br>
</br>
"VRcity will include a virtual city that can expand based on the number of users, and it will be linked with VRstore and the Phantom Helmet login space! Users can use real money to buy real estate in the virtual city's residential area, and the purchased property will serve as their own Phantom Helmet login interface!"</br>
</br>
The excitement in Jiang Chen eyes was contagious to Ning Huajian.</br>
</br>
"That's awesome! The most frequent comments on our official website are that the white cube space is too ugly. But will the server resources be sufficient if you allow users to DIY their own room?"</br>
</br>
"They're definitely enough!" Jiang Chen smiled.</br>
</br>
The apocalypse had digested the commercial quantum computer production technology from Hong City. The first batch of commercial quantum computers had already left the production line and was transported to the modern world by Jiang Chen. Now that Future Group's commercial quantum computer reserves reached 10, it was more than sufficient to support this project.</br>
</br>
After downloading the VRstore, the user's helmet would no longer appear in an isolated white cube. It would appear in a virtual room that would be far more beautiful and far more spacious than reality. With a push of the door, the user would welcome the entire virtual world.</br>
</br>
Completing all kinds of interesting small tasks in a virtual city would grant the user virtual coin rewards. They could buy virtual products with virtual coins. If they were satisfied with the virtual product, they could jump directly to the interface linked with VRstore and throw this virtual product into their shopping cart.</br>
</br>
If this idea could really be fulfilled, VRcity would be able to connect the entire VR world as one.</br>
</br>
"For this virtual city, we can draw some of our staff from the operational team at Godly Land. For VRcity content, we can headhunt people from Rockstar and EA's Maxis studio."</br>
</br>
Rockstar Studios was famous in the gaming industry. Its launch of the Grand Theft Auto series of urban-themed roleplaying games was widely acclaimed worldwide. Maxis was also a great studio, and the Sim City series was their masterpiece.</br>
</br>
Recruiting talent from these two studios to design the "game" nature of VRcity would definitely be the perfect combination.</br>
</br>
Digging up people from these two studios wasn't difficult with the financial resources of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"Boss, I feel like my inspiration is flowing like magma. I can't stay here. I have to go back to the office and put everything on paper."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen waved his hand. "Then don't talk nonsense. Go!"</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Ning Huajian rushed out the door and ran to his office.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 728: The Strong will always be Strong</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Jiang Chen originally intended to directly buy the two studios, but there was a minor incident during the acquisition process.</br>
</br>
There was no problem with Maxis since EA was only second to Microsoft, the studio killer. The giant Maxis series studios were cut countless times, and Future Technology was more than willing to acquire the studios just as they were ready to swing their knives. They were happy with the deal and sold Maxis Studio at a premium of 20 million US Dollar.</br>
</br>
Rockstar was a bit more difficult.</br>
</br>
The parent company of Rockstar was Take Two, and its operation wasin good condition. GTA VI: Return to Liberty City, which launched in June 2017, continued the glory of GTA V and expanded the map from California to New York and included one European city. The map more than doubled in size compared to the previous game. GTA VI easily reached sales volumes of 40 million copies across all platforms.</br>
</br>
Take Two, of course, wouldn't be that foolish to sell their cash cow.</br>
</br>
That being the case, Future Technology had to take a step back and start headhunting people.</br>
</br>
The international headhunting company hired by Jiang Chen provided him with a list of 27 names with skills in planning, script-writing, which included the chief designer of Rockstar Studio, in addition to their personal information, incomes, and debts. After obtaining the list, Jiang Chen took out his checkbook and gave their monthly salary a 50% boost then the headhunters took the list back and headhunted using this standard.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen gave Ning Huajian the responsibility of establishing the VRcity project team. He was an expert in this regard. Although Jiang Chen was a frontrunner in virtual reality technology, he definitely wasn't as knowledgeable of the market as the CEO who had worked from the ground up.</br>
</br>
After handling those tasks, Jiang Chen noticed it was still early, so he took a trip to the Material Science Laboratory and examined their progress.</br>
</br>
After resolving the graphene-related challenges, the Materials Science Laboratory recently recruited a group of scientists and set up two new project departments to study the application of graphene cables and graphene chips.</br>
</br>
The former was aimed at space elevators, while the latter was aimed at the electronics industry of Future Heavy Industrial.</br>
</br>
Some time ago, the new Top 500 list of supercomputers was revealed at the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC) in Frankfurt, Germany. "Tianhe No.3," developed as part of the National Key Project and the National Parallel Computer Engineering Technology Research Center, claimed the top of the Top 500 list once again after "Sunway TaihuLight."</br>
</br>
Unlike previous years, using the Dragon Calvary X1 type supercomputer chip, Hua not only won but also cleared out the top five! The news made Hua Computer Engineering Technology Research Center ecstatic and they quickly added 100,000 to their monthly order to increase monthly imports to 200,000 chips.</br>
</br>
</br>
Based on this trend, it wouldn't be long until they eclipsed the rest of the world!</br>
</br>
Hua's dominance of the supercomputer market also terrified UA. Although Intel also introduced new super chips based on graphene materials, the gap was still more than just a minor difference compared to the Dragon Calvary X1.</br>
</br>
In desperation, although it was committed to fostering local manufacturers such as Intel and Qualcomm, the UA Department of Defense selectively purchased 50,000 supercomputer chips to upgrade the performance of the Department of Defense supercomputers. However, the deal didn't go through in the end because Future Group refused to fully disclose the technical details of the lix architecture. This was an unacceptable security risk to the Capital.</br>
</br>
Unless Future Heavy Industries was a domestic company, they would't feel reassured.</br>
</br>
However, those private super-computing centers didn't have so many concerns. In the market, the survival of the fittest was reflected to the extreme. For example, after seeing the powerful features of the Dragon Calvary X1 chip, Google immediately sent out an order of 60,000 chips per month to upgrade its servers.</br>
</br>
After seeing the strength of Future Heavy Industrial in the field of chip manufacturing, Google simply gave up its plan to enter the chip manufacturing industry.</br>
</br>
Businessmen strove for profitability.</br>
</br>
Google used more than 300,000 chips per quarter. If the Dragon Calvary X1 was used, the company would be able to reduce the number of servers by at least 10% while meeting current business demands. While Future Heavy Industrial quoted a wholesale price of 347 USD per chip, this equated to 60.82 million per month for 60,000 chips. However, from an overall cost perspective, the choice of the Dragon Calvary X1 could save them at least 200 million annually.</br>
</br>
They lost the motivation to develop their own chips.</br>
</br>
Not only Google, but Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which accounted for the nation's top server chip purchase customers in the UA, also had a strong interest in the Dragon Calvary X1.</br>
</br>
At present, the monthly shipments of the Dragon Calvary X1 supercomputing chip reached the incredible figure of 500,000; 200,000 of which flowed into Hua and 100,000 flowed to supercomputers in small countries such as Switzerland and in Europe. The remaining 200,000 were destined for UA.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
In the foreseeable future, the battle to get onto the Top 500 list of the Frankfurt International Supercomputing Conference would be extremely tragic. Whoever used the Dragon Calvary would be able to dominate the list. If the top ten computers on the list were all equipped with the chip, there would be a competition between who possessed more chips and who used them more skillfully.</br>
</br>
Unless Celestial Trade's quantum computer was made public, it would be difficult to end this conflict.</br>
</br>
Based on the fact that the major supercomputing centers were extremely close, graphene development involved working on the development of the X2 chip and using it to bring in money.</br>
</br>
Do you want to become stronger? Do you want to fire up your national pride? Come and buy Dragon Calvary X2...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen had already imaged what the ads would look like.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industries completed the registration of the lix architecture in various countries and registered patents for each instruction set. After receiving the news, Loongson immediately came to him to obtain authorization for the lix architecture. They were ready to start developing their own superchip based on the lix architecture.</br>
</br>
This was agreed upon when the chip was first sold, so Jiang Chen agreed without a second thought. The global price of patent fees was standardized - chips that used lix architecture would pay 10% of the selling price as a patent fee. Although this figure was twice as high as Qualcomm's 5%, Qualcomm's pricing was based on the total price of electronics, where Future Technology only conscientiously charged based on the price of a single chip.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen noticed that Mr. Wu Weiwen, president of Loongson who came to sign the patent agreement, wasn't particularly happy.</br>
</br>
"Are there any problems, Mr. Wu?" Jiang Chen asked happily.</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"No problem at all. I just think Mr. Jiang is especially crafty."</br>
</br>
"I don't quite understand what you mean. Can you explain it to me?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
Wu Weiwen smiled and didn't speak further. He walked away with the lix architecture licensing agreement.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen noticed he seemed to have aged instantly.</br>
</br>
Loongson was a state-owned enterprise and enjoyed financial subsidies in business operations. Theoretically, Wu Wenwei, the president, didn't need to worry about their financial performance. Even if he couldn't sell a chip in a year or two, the company would absolutely not worry about going bankrupt.</br>
</br>
Frankly speaking, when Jiang Chen agreed and authorized him to use the lix structure with Loongson, Wu Wenwei could clearly sense his superiors' emphasis on Loongson.</br>
</br>
However, when the first batch of Dragon Calvary X1 was sent to the supercomputing centers and the scientists at the Supercomputing Center shouted with joy, Wu Wenwei could clearly sense that the eyes of the superiors standing beside him suddenly shifted.</br>
</br>
Especially after making the top 5 of the supercomputer list.</br>
</br>
The leaders responsible for the National Key Project were almost collectively promoted. The project leader even received praise from the chairman.</br>
</br>
This was a great achievement!</br>
</br>
Whether it was the individual, the country, or the ethnicity.</br>
</br>
Because of this achievemnet, they couldn't stop.</br>
</br>
Sure enough, just as Wu Weiwen expected, the leader responsible for the supercomputing project contacted Future Heavy Industrial immediately after receiving the award and increased the number of purchasing orders. Technology was like a drug - once they started, they couldn't stop.</br>
</br>
Did you get on the top five this year and would you be willing to lose your place next year? Do you still want to have a career?</br>
</br>
What should they do if they didn't want to lose?</br>
</br>
They could only buy Dragon Calvary X1. How long did they have to wait before the old scholars came up with research results?</br>
</br>
On the dinner table, a sentence from the top leader made Wu Weiwen deeply distressed.</br>
</br>
"You can't always follow protectionism. With no market, where's the competition? Future Group is a child who walked out of our country. Rather than attempting to fill this bottomless hole, it's better to obtain their technology. Aren't we a family after all?"</br>
</br>
A dangerous thought.</br>
</br>
Very dangerous.</br>
</br>
However, Wu Wenwei was also clear that as a president of a state-owned enterprise, he simply couldn't change this.</br>
</br>
Nothing could be done to solve the problem, but some things just couldn't be solved with money.</br>
</br>
Unless he could beat the Dragon Calvary X1 and come up with the world's most powerful super chip...</br>
</br>
But was this possible?</br>
</br>
Future Heavy Industrial already occupied the high ground of the market and had become the standard chip maker. With its technical advantages, it would take over most of the orders. With the proceeds from these orders, they would continue to invest in these R&amp;D projects, and their technology would only become more powerful and unreachable.</br>
</br>
By that time, even Intel and ARM would have to learn from the instruction set of lix architecture to enrich their X86 architecture and ARM architecture and pay royalties to Future Technology, who owned the intellectual property rights.</br>
</br>
The powerful would become more powerful. That was the market.</br>
</br>
Before the existence of disruptive products, the giants who already occupied the high points would never stumble. It was foreseeable that even if he now obtained authorization of the lix architecture, they would absolutely depend on the chips from Future Group for the next ten years at least.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 729: Coro University</br>
</div></br>
</br>
In the suburbs of Coro City, a 2000-acre, European-style manor stood tall. The majestic main building revealed the atmosphere of the academy with its green lawn and campus full of vitality. At the moment, in front of this luxury building, a crowd stood together. It was full of young people with faces full of energy.</br>
</br>
The person standing on the high stage in the doorway was our protagonist, Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
First of all, this wasn't Jiang Chen's manor but a newly built university...</br>
</br>
Well, in fact, there was essentially no difference between the two.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen stood on the podium, people burst into cheers. People below the stage waved the Xin flag and the flag with Future Group's logo.Â They offered their highest respects to the leader of science and technology that led Xin to prosperity.</br>
</br>
In the minds of the young people, he undoubtedly had an unwavering influence.</br>
</br>
Wearing jeans and a white T-shirt, Jiang Chen stood on the podium, waved at the crowd, and picked up the microphone.</br>
</br>
"Your enthusiasm really surprised me. This is probably the most energetic crowd I've made a speech to."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Seeing Jiang Chen waving at them, the cheers of the people below the podium erupted like a flood.</br>
</br>
"Look! He's waving at me!" A tall, beautiful woman pulled her best friend and shouted in excitement.</br>
</br>
"Ah! He looked over here~"</br>
</br>
"Long live Jiang Chen! Long live Xin! Long live Future Group!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Looking at the pairs of eager eyes below the stage, Jiang Chen was smiling. Although it wasn't the first time he stood in front of tens of thousands of people, no matter how many times he stood in place, he still felt an endless wave of emotions.Â The young people below the stage were the future elites of Xin. They came from Xin and the whole world. Earning the praise of these proud intellectuals brought him a great sense of accomplishment.</br>
</br>
With the atmosphere almost at its climax, he cleared his throat and spoke his opening remarks.</br>
</br>
"I'm extremely honored to be here. As the first principal of Coro University, I will give an opening speech to our first freshman."</br>
</br>
Applause resounded then gradually stopped.</br>
</br>
The noise gradually subsided, and the audience's eyes focused on him. In response to their eager gazes, Jiang Chen continued.</br>
</br>
"I don't have much to say. I assume you don't want to hear me read a list of school regulations. Here, I'll talk about why Coro University was founded."</br>
</br>
"I've always stressed the importance of science and technology. Technology is changing our lives, changing the earth under our feet, and will change the solar system and even the milky way."</br>
</br>
"And it won't be banknotes, nor sophisticated experimental equipment, nor a principal who brags in front of you... that achieves all of this."</br>
</br>
After a pause, Jiang Chen's eyes glanced over every student below the stage.</br>
</br>
</br>
"It is you who will make the change."</br>
</br>
"I believe this is also the reason why you have entrusted us with your futures."</br>
</br>
Thunderous applause resounded. There were faces full of passion and ambition. Jiang Chen recalled himself from seven years ago. At that time, he was also in a similar mentality and entered the big melting pot known as society. He was prepared to demonstrate some ambition in the field of mechanical automation...</br>
</br>
In the end, he became a salesman and was let go.</br>
</br>
He never thought it was due to his own abilities. At most, he chose the wrong road or chose a road that wasn't suitable for him. He always believed that no one was a genius, and mediocrity was simply a result of a person not being on the right path.</br>
</br>
Under the flashes of the media and thunderous applause, Jiang Chen strode forward and pulled off the red silk covering the school monument, exposing the two gold-encrusted words "Coro University" before the eyes of the world. There was also the school motto engraved on the monument.</br>
</br>
"Discovery, attempt, change."</br>
</br>
This was also the purpose of Coro University.</br>
</br>
To discover, not to instill. Discover the merits of each student and guide them to find the right path for themselves. Their seemingly small forces would eventually breed the power to change the entire world.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Education is a strong foundation for a country's development. When he first started building Coro Island, Jiang Chen was already planning to build a world-class academic institution, freeing Xin from dependence on foreign talent and truly start nurturing Xin's own talents.</br>
</br>
And now, he finally fulfilled his original idea.</br>
</br>
Coro University had six colleges for the time being - the School of Economics and Management, the School of Information Technology, the School of Engineering and Technology, the School of Life Science, the School of Science, and the School of Aerospace Technology. When the teaching team was adequate, the School of Law and School of Culture and Media would also open, as well as the School of Marine Resources Development and so on.</br>
</br>
The educational background of Xin was weak; it wasn't enough to support the faculty resources of a university.</br>
</br>
However, the beautiful capital was here. Although it was just a pile of green money, it had the magic to change the world.</br>
</br>
Future Group announced the establishment of the Xin Education Foundation and injected a billion US Dollar to Coro University in the name of a foundation, while promising to invest more than 100 million US Dollar each year. This 1 billion would be used to pay for professors' salaries, purchase advanced experimental equipment, improve the teaching environment, and most importantly, headhunt people.</br>
</br>
If Xin didn't have professors who could teach, then they would go to a foreign university to buy them!</br>
</br>
Harvard, Imperial College, MIT ... as long as the professors met their requirements, then they would try to secure them at all costs! With high salaries and the most advanced experimental equipment, Jiang Chen didn't believe those professors and scholars who received invitations would be unmoved.</br>
</br>
As for the cost? That wasn't what he was worried about at all.</br>
</br>
Money put in the bank was merely a pile of waste paper. People would also think too much when the number was too high. It was only when money was spent that its value could be appreciated. Education was the only investment that would never lose money and Jiang Chen firmly believed this!</br>
</br>
While expanding the academic abilities of Coro University, Jiang Chen didn't lessen his support of the supportive element of the university.</br>
</br>
Each year, Future Group would provide 5,000 internship jobs to Coro University and recruit at least 3,000 people from the graduates to work in each subsidiary of the group.</br>
</br>
For those students who had outstanding performance in certain areas, Future Group would also sign contracts directly with them and waive their tuition fees and living expenses during their schooling. After graduation, they would assume employment at Future Group. At the same time, Xin Education Foundation would set up a total of 1,000 scholarship awards and award a total of 10 million US Dollar a year to students who demonstrated excellence or required financial assistance.</br>
</br>
This was undoubtedly great news for foreign students in Hua and even in the world.</br>
</br>
The former resolved concerns related to graduation and the latter resolved the urgent problem at hand. For the young people who were deeply influenced by the Internet, what was more attractive than working at Future Group? As for tuition and living expenses, as long as students could get a scholarship, they didn't even need to spend a single penny for four years.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 730: Hiring M.I.Tâs Dean</br>
</div></br>
</br>
There were a total of 6,217 freshmen that year. After half a year of prep courses, they would begin their first school year in early September that year.</br>
</br>
Raphael Leif was the seventeenth dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who started in 2012. After his retirement, he was recruited by the headhunting company hired by Jiang Chen, paying 4 million US Dollar in annual salary. This was almost twice his previous annual salary. Even compared to the University of Chicago, which gave the highest salary, Jiang Chen's offer was higher by 1 million.</br>
</br>
In fact, the proportion of Han in Coro University was 65%. The school board recommended that Jiang Chen headhunt professors from Hua universities. However, after some thoughtful consideration, Jiang Chen vetoed this proposal. Not accounting for identity and ability, the bureaucratized management model of Hua universities wasn't something he wanted to replicate in Xin.</br>
</br>
As the first university in Xin, Coro University would serve as a model for future education in Xin. Academic bureaucratization was, by no means, a good phenomenon. After exchanging opinions with scientists such as Lu Yuan and Amos, Jiang Chen ultimately made this decision.</br>
</br>
Compared to training a group of highly skilled technicians, Jiang Chen hoped to foster a group of highly innovative scientists.</br>
</br>
After Raphael Leif arrived in Xin, Jiang Chen personally greeted him at the airport. Mr. Leif was also flattered by Jiang Chen's attentiveness. Although he had a strong influence in academia, his experience was no way as fabled as the president of Future Group.</br>
</br>
The grey-haired old man, dressed in a suit, looked healthier than Jiang Chen imagined.</br>
</br>
"I watched your speech at the University of Mun."</br>
</br>
"Did you laugh?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
"Please don't be so humble. No one in the field of artificial intelligence has more to say than you. Now there's graphene too - I think the guys at University of Mun were very grateful." Mr. Leif smiled and shook hands with Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
He paused then continued.</br>
</br>
"To be honest, I was ready to retire, but after hearing about potentially leading Coro University, I suddenly felt I could still do it for a few more years. But before I start working, I have one condition - I don't want the school board to interfere too much with my concept of education."</br>
</br>
"Rest reassured. The school board won't interfere with your teaching principles. After you take the position, I'll give you the dean position, and I'll only take the name of the honorary dean. We're only responsible for providing funds, and you're responsible for helping us build an MIT on the Pacific Ocean," Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Mr. Leif nodded, reassured.</br>
</br>
Operating a university was different from operating a business; historical heritage and cultural accumulation couldn't be accomplished overnight. It would be a while before Coro University really became a famous university known throughout the world - it would be at least four years until the first graduates left the campus.</br>
</br>
</br>
The two talked for a long time, discussing the model of Coro University.</br>
</br>
Before they bid farewell, Leif half-jokingly said:</br>
</br>
"Oh right, are you interested in teaching at Coro University? I can only give you 100,000 US Dollar in annual salary."</br>
</br>
"Me? I'm afraid I don't have much to teach." Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
His academic credentials were only completing an undergraduate degree. He knew himself well - he could talk nonsense, but you could forget about asking him to teach lectures. It would be like running the next generation of students.</br>
</br>
"No, I think you have a lot of qualities that students can learn from, but you haven't even realized it yourself." Leif looked at Jiang Chen with a smile. "Coro University's motto: discover, attempt, change."</br>
</br>
After a brief silence, Jiang Chen said:</br>
</br>
"...I'll consider your opinion. But just to be clear, I'll only teach one elective course at most."</br>
</br>
"I bet it'll be the most popular elective," Leif said in a joking tone.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
As Coro University gradually got on track, Jiang Chen shifted his focus to Future Group.</br>
</br>
The completion of the city of Penglai, the Global Merchandise Exposition, VRcity, and the forthcoming mobile phone launched by Future Technology... When Jiang Chen personally got involved in these tasks, he truly realized how humongous his own company was. He also realized how tired Xia Shiyu, who picked up the weight of the entire group, must be.</br>
</br>
According to Jean's statistics, she always maintained an average of two meetings per day and had a 30 document approval rate. Fortunately, Jean could help now. Before, Xia Shiyu had to manually review these documents.</br>
</br>
In the evening, Jiang Chen sat in the office of the president, held the coffee his assistant made, looked at the night view of the city from the windows, and thought about the future.</br>
</br>
Tanaka had been sealed in the basement of New Moon Island. The Kurofune only existed in name.Â With Mitsui's list, the Ghost agents arrested half the members of the Kurofune's Asia Division, leaving only scattered sporadic parties to flee.</br>
</br>
In the capture and assassination of these people, the Ghost Agents sent by Jiang Chen discovered some strange phenomena.</br>
</br>
Many of Kurofune's members showed incredible ability in dealing with the Ghost Agents... almost like they had superpowers?</br>
</br>
According to the intelligence gathered by the agents, Ayesha summarized their capabilities. Among them, there were relatively normal skills such as strengthening of the five senses, enhancement of resilience, improvements in athletic ability, and so on. Unscientific ones were manipulative magnetization, discharge, mental oscillation, etc...</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's intuition told him that these abilities were likely related to the hidden genetic code. And these people... how could they unlock the power of genetic code without a genetic vaccine?</br>
</br>
Was the Kurofune transforming them or was it because they possessed these special abilities that they couldÂ become part of the Kurofune?</br>
</br>
How could Tanaka gather these people together?</br>
</br>
With a long sigh, Jiang Chen drank the remaining coffee in the cup. Originally, he was thinking about future development. However, he didn't know why his mind drifted elsewhere.</br>
</br>
"Forget it; these little pawns will be handled by the Ghost Agents. As for their superpowers... capture some and study them slowly."</br>
</br>
As he put his coffee cup on the table, Jiang Chen was about to call his assistant to make another cup, but he heard knocking on his door.</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu pushed the door open and entered with documents.</br>
</br>
Looking at her working so late, Jiang Chen's face looked apologetic.</br>
</br>
"Thank you for working so hard."</br>
</br>
"Not at all, this is my job." She combed her hair behind her ears and said lightly: "...This is a plan for a merchandise exhibition. Here is a project overview for VRcity. Although I've already reviewed it, it's better for you to read it before signing."</br>
</br>
After receiving the documents, Jiang Chen started to review them under her guidance.</br>
</br>
A touch of her fragrance lingered over the tip of his nose. Perhaps he was too close, but he could even feel her breath and her nervous heartbeat.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 731: Whoâs the boss here</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It took an incredible amount of effort for Jiang Chen to suppress his pounding heartbeat and put all his attention back on the document on the table. By that time, he was surprised to find that the documents were all reviewed without his notice.</br>
</br>
Putting the stack of papers aside, he suddenly felt relieved. As if the huge pile of work had finally been completed, it seemed to have made up for some of his unfulfilled promises.</br>
</br>
Looking at Xia Shiyu, who was collecting the documents, Jiang Chen suddenly said with a grin.</br>
</br>
"Are you free?"</br>
</br>
"Hmmm?" Xia Shiyu stopped moving her hand and looked up with confusion.</br>
</br>
"If you are free after work, let's go for a drink together. I heard that there is a good bar nearby."</br>
</br>
Perhaps she was surprised by why Jiang Chen suddenly made such an invitation, Xia Shiyu took several seconds to think.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen hesitated whether he should add "If you are too busy, then it is fine", she unexpectedly nodded her head and quietly responded.</br>
</br>
"Okay."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It was already ten o'clock in the evening.</br>
</br>
Natasha raised her left hand to check her watch, and then she looked at the dark mansion.</br>
</br>
All the lights were off, and it looked like the people inside were all sleeping.</br>
</br>
With that in mind, she hesitated for a moment, but in the end she made a decision and reached for the bell.</br>
</br>
But before her finger reached the bell, the door opened itself.</br>
</br>
When she was puzzled at what happened, she looked in the direction of the mansion and saw an open window. A young girl stood there watching her quietly.</br>
</br>
Without the need to think, it was obviously Natasha. Only she would stand at the window every day like a rock, waiting for that guy to come back.</br>
</br>
Inside the yard, through the path on the lawn, Natasha walked to the front and opened the door.</br>
</br>
Since she often drank there, she was familiar with this place. The front door of his mansion was never locked.</br>
</br>
As for why, ask the hundreds of Hummingbird drones lurking in the garden.</br>
</br>
No one could approach the mansion without taking the main entrance. Even if someone could, it must be a dead person. Therefore, he didn't need to lock the front door. Within that wall, it was an absolutely safe area.</br>
</br>
Pushing open the door, Natasha complained and opened the lamp in the living room.</br>
</br>
"It's quite dark in the room, why didn't you have a light on?"</br>
</br>
The lights illuminated the dark room and Ayesha's presence was revealed.</br>
</br>
Natasha didn't know when she came downstairs and stood by the sofa in the living room, but it seemed as if she was there from the beginning.</br>
</br>
"Because I don't need to," Ayesha said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
Night is no different than day to her. This has been especially evident since the awakening of the "Cold Blooded" ability. The genetic code not only strengthened her hiding ability, but also strengthened her perception in the dark. Although she didn't acquire night vision, it was almost equivalent.</br>
</br>
</br>
She was a natural assassin.</br>
</br>
"Are you a cat?" Natasha scorned.</br>
</br>
Ayesha did not answer, but responded coldly as always.</br>
</br>
"Jiang Chen is not there. You can go back now."</br>
</br>
"No rush to get rid of me," Natasha rolled her eyes. "Where is he?"</br>
</br>
"Working overtime today," Ayesha said quietly.</br>
</br>
"That's rare."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"You didn't come back with him?"</br>
</br>
"He told me to come back first."</br>
</br>
The topic was interrupted there.Â Ayesha's conversation ending ability made Natasha feel speechless. Although she has always tried to get on good terms with this girl, it was uncertain if their relationship has already improved.</br>
</br>
Silence continued for a moment. Natasha went directly to the subject and put on a serious expression.</br>
</br>
"Based on KGB's intelligence, some people are plotting an assassination against him."</br>
</br>
Ayesha blinked and did not speak.</br>
</br>
Seeing her unresponsiveness, Natasha looked at her in disbelief.</br>
</br>
"You don't seem worried?"</br>
</br>
"As long as I'm still alive, no one can hurt him," Ayesha said softly.</br>
</br>
"Aren't you too confident?" Natasha rolled her eyes again.</br>
</br>
Ayesha shook her head.</br>
</br>
Not because of self-confidence, but because the security work in place was perfectly safe. Even if she wasn't there, there were other sisters of Ghost Agents accompanying him. And the most crucial thing was that, even if one set aside all these failsafes, Jiang Chen's own strength was no match for the average person.</br>
</br>
What's more, this was his new world.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The flickering lights swayed with the rhythm of the drums, youthful bodies filled the dance floor, wriggling and dancing with the beat of the music. Crisp clinking sounds of cups continued throughout the night; accompanied by laughter and ridicules.</br>
</br>
The clock just struck 10. Nightlife had only just begun for Coro City.</br>
</br>
It's funny to say that this was Jiang Chen's first time coming to the club... if the time in the Sixth Street doesn't count.</br>
</br>
Looking at the figures dancing, Jiang Chen felt a sense of distance where he couldn't fuse into it. Looking at Xia Shiyu, her expression seems to be uncomfortable too.</br>
</br>
But disregarding the gap for now, just as Natasha said, the cocktails there were really good. The titled bangs covered the feminine face and the bartender with unidentifiable sex shook the shaker in hands, skillfully mixing a glass of blue Marguerite for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was already his fifth cup.</br>
</br>
The alcohol concentration of the cocktail was not high, it was more like juice than alcohol.</br>
</br>
With the urge to pee, Jiang Chen put down the glass and told Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
"I'm going to the bathroom."</br>
</br>
"Mhmm."</br>
</br>
After Jiang Chen walked away, the restrained Xia Shiyu finally felt relieved.</br>
</br>
Somehow, she accepted Jiang Chen's invitation.</br>
</br>
There was still work to be done and she was not good at drinking...</br>
</br>
However, it is also true that it is time to relax after working so hard for so long.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu shook her head and tried to convince herself.</br>
</br>
At this moment, a man dressed in a plaid shirt came to sit beside her and whistled disrespectfully.</br>
</br>
"Beauty, what's your name?"</br>
</br>
Looking at him with a blank expression, Xia Shiyu ignored him, but took a sip of her wine.</br>
</br>
That cold attitude made Wang Biao feel embarrassed as he slightly narrowed his eyes. In front of his boss, he patted his chest and promised that he could bring back any woman his boss is interested in.</br>
</br>
"Our boss wants to invite you for a drink. Can you give him the opportunity?"</br>
</br>
Following Wang Biao's sight, Xiao Shiyu saw the man sitting on the sofa in the corner. The man, who had girls on his left and right, raised his glass to her in what he thought was a cool move. That unconcealed smile made Xia Shiyu feel nauseous.</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu felt comical at this point. Why are there so many people who feel so good about themselves?</br>
</br>
"It's not necessary."</br>
</br>
"I advise you to think carefully," Wang Biao said with a grin. There was a glimmer of mischief in his narrowed eyes. "Do you know who our boss is?"</br>
</br>
The bright red liquor reflected an impatient face, and Xia Shiyu gently shook the wine glass, and coldly responded</br>
</br>
"Who is he?"</br>
</br>
"Have you heard of the Green Dragon Clan?" Wang Biao said in a tone that was certain she would know him. "People on the streets know that nobody ever dares to say no to me, Biao Zi. I advise you to be obedient. Don't blame me for not warning you if something happens to you."</br>
</br>
"Is that true? But I haven't heard of you before."</br>
</br>
The voice of dissonance came from his back, Wang Biao frowned and turned his head.</br>
</br>
The dimmed lights made the man's face undistinguishable. But from the outline, he seemed familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen him before.</br>
</br>
"Who are you?"</br>
</br>
[Is this the aftereffect of the proliferation of immigrants?]</br>
</br>
Looking at the little pawn in front of him, Jiang Chen sighed.</br>
</br>
Xin was just like the United States in the 19th century. It was not just immigrants who longed for a good life, but also criminals who have crossed the ocean. If this hidden danger was not solved as soon as possible, it would surely ferment into serious public security problems in the future.</br>
</br>
It seemed imminent to do something.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the person in front of him did not answer, Wang Biao who was ignored twice was completely irritated. It was the first him being so humiliated and insulted since gaining his reputation.</br>
</br>
"You dare to be distracted while talking to me? Are you bored of living?"</br>
</br>
Wang Biao licked his lips and reached for Jiang Chen's neck while the other hand pulled out a bottle.</br>
</br>
He made up his mind that he must press him in the toilet and teach him how to be humble.</br>
</br>
However, his wish didn't come true.</br>
</br>
Wang Qian's outstretched hand seemed to be embedded in a transparent wall. He couldn't swing down to react back as he face gradually became bloated.</br>
</br>
The change took place in an instant so that everyone didn't respond in time. The onlookers first saw the scene and then moved back to avoid being injured accidentally. The bartender still wiped the glass in a calm manner. While she was mixing the drink, she already recognized Jiang Chen, but she didn't say anything. The heart of Xia Shiyu was about to jump out but it quickly settled back in its place.</br>
</br>
Because she suddenly realized that being protected by the Ghost Agent, how could Jiang Chen be hurt by this little thug?</br>
</br>
Optical invisibility gradually dispersed, and Zhu Yu, who was standing in front of Jiang Chen's body, held the man's hand calmly. The power of genetic vaccines was not something a thug could test.</br>
</br>
The light here was dim. There were only a few that saw Zhu Yu appear out of thin air.</br>
</br>
Facing the woman who appeared "out of thin air", Wang Biao;s eyes widened quickly. [Did I just see a ghost or am I drunk?]</br>
</br>
Seeing the unrest on this side, crowds of onlookers gathered around and shrieked.</br>
</br>
"Beat her!"</br>
</br>
"Don't be a pus*y, fight her."</br>
</br>
"Fu*k, you can't even beat a woman, are you still a man?"</br>
</br>
However, Wang Biao didn't dare to start something. He had gradually realized that he has picked on the wrong person</br>
</br>
Zhu Yu was indifferent to the cries of the crowd, but she whispered to Jiang Chen in the communication channel, asking what to do.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen did not answer, but went around Zhu Yu and stood in front of Wang Biao.</br>
</br>
"I don't care if you are a green dragon or a white tiger, or whether you are a Biao Zi or a b*tch (homophone)," Jiang Chen said smilingly, and then finished the sentence with what made Wang Biao look like he fell into ice. "If you have heard of Future Group, then you should know who the real 'boss' is."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 732: The Serene Moonligh</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Who is the real boss?</br>
</br>
This question seemed to be simply nonsense.</br>
</br>
After recognizing Jiang Chen's identity, Wang Biao's face instantly turned as white as ash. The beer bottle in his hand also dropped to the ground.</br>
</br>
The dim light was flickering, and Li Qiangsheng, the head of the Green Dragon Clan, who was not far away, saw one of his thugs was being held by a female bodyguard. He frowned.</br>
</br>
They really don't want to live anymore. Who on the street doesn't know that this street was Green Dragon's turf?</br>
</br>
"Qiangsheng, Biao Zi seemed to have messed up," the beautiful woman lying in his arms coyly complained.</br>
</br>
"You little devil, don't make trouble. When I fu*k those two, I'll fu*k you again."</br>
</br>
After licking his dry lips, Li Qiangsheng's eyes glanced between the two stunning beauties beside Jiang Chen. Although one has an indifferent attitude, that gorgeous face was simply irresistible. The female bodyguard also didn't look bad, but her face was still young and adolescent.</br>
</br>
And after so many years of "examining beauty", intuition told him that they were still virgins.</br>
</br>
He couldn't help but feel annoyed just at the thought.</br>
</br>
As the saying goes, comparisons are odious. Look at the garbage in his hands.</br>
</br>
Releasing the girl wearing heavy makeup from his arm, Li Qiangsheng stood up and gestured to the thugs next to him and slowly strolled over.</br>
</br>
People wearing Green Dragon black T-shirts came out of the crowd and a group of young people with buzz cuts approached Jiang Chen. From the posture of these peopleÂ and the items in their hands, they were obviously part of a gang, a professional organized crime.</br>
</br>
A few steps behind Jiang Chen, Li Qiangsheng twisted his neck and grinned.</br>
</br>
"Gentleman, you dare to touch my brother on my turf. Are you tired of living, tired of living, or tired of living?"</br>
</br>
"Boss..." Wang Biao looked at Li Qiangsheng. He could barely finish a proper sentence.</br>
</br>
"Don't be afraid, leave this to me," Li Qiangsheng said. Seeing that his thug was so "touched" that he was about to cry, he acted even more recklessly. Looking at the back of Jiang Chen, the fierceness of his speech intensified. "You dared to touch my people, today if you can get out of this bar perfectly fine, I will write my name Li Qiangshengbackwards!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned his head slightly and intriguingly said.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Then why don't you tell me how to fix this?"</br>
</br>
"Hehe, either you leave two fingers here, or lend your chick and your bodyguard to me for two days."</br>
</br>
[Chick? What is a chick?]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu suddenly blushed, but her expression quickly turned into fury.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen suddenly burst out laughed.</br>
</br>
"Qiang Sheng Li, the name doesn't seem to be very great. What about She Qiang ShangÂ (C*m on the wall)?"</br>
</br>
"Youâ"</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen ridiculing him, Li Qiangsheng was instantly ignited.</br>
</br>
</br>
Just as he was preparing to get the thugs to fight, a dozen muscular figures wearing sunglasses pushed their way into the crowd. Li Qiangsheng frowned slightly, but when he saw the symbol of Celestial Trade, his face turned green instantly.</br>
</br>
At this time, Wang Biao who had been quivering for a long time, finally said the words stuck in his mouth</br>
</br>
"Boss... run... fast!"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen turned around.</br>
</br>
At this moment, Li Qiangsheng finally saw his face.</br>
</br>
It was at that moment when the last bit of life finally left him. This street was the turf of the Green Dragon Gang, but the entirety of Xin was Jiang Chen's turf.</br>
</br>
A bodyguard stepped forward and stood next to Jiang Chen. He bowed his head respectfully, waiting for his instructions.</br>
</br>
He smiled and looked at the now pale Li Qiangsheng and said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Throw all of them into the police station. If you miss one of them, don't come back to see me."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
The bodyguard nodded and then turned around to look at Li Qiangsheng with a smirk on his face.</br>
</br>
A dozen bodyguards walked toward the thugs. The obedient ones were handcuffed while the disobedient ones received a fist to the face. These street thugs were no opponents to these quasi-military soldiers, they were crying in despair.</br>
</br>
The screaming and howling in the club filled the dance floor. It was completely one-sided. The onlookers were completely stunned as a one-sided beat down was not entertaining at all. The bouncers of the bar stood afar and didn't dare to step forward.</br>
</br>
Wang Biao was tossed away by Zhu Yu with one hand. Jiang Chen sat back down at the bar and looked at the bewildered bartender.</br>
</br>
"Give me a Pina Colada, add more ice."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Cleaning up the thugs that ruined the mood didn't take a long time. The bodyguards of Celestial Trade easily pinned all those people down to the ground. The police finally arrived at the scene. When Jiang Chen revealed his identity, the police officers did not ask who started the conflict and immediately handcuffed Li Qiangsheng and the others with bruised faces and got them into the police cars.</br>
</br>
Despite how strong their background was, not even the president could save them.</br>
</br>
Although the problem was solved, the mood was completely ruined. Especially when they know he was here, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that the DJs in the bar lowered the volume by two decibels.</br>
</br>
After ordering a few more cocktails, Jiang Chen left a few notes on the table and then left with Xia Shiyu.</br>
</br>
A fresh cool breeze blew across his face, slightly wafting away the alcoholic smell.</br>
</br>
In front of the converted Lamborghini, Jiang Chen opened the door and sat in the driver's seat. He looked apologetically at Xia Shiyu, who sat next to him.</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry. I wanted to bring you here so you could relax, but it ended up making you unhappy."</br>
</br>
"It's okay." Xia Shiyu shook her head. The cold face suddenly turned into a rare smile. "Thinking about this, I'm really reminiscent."</br>
</br>
"Reminiscent?"</br>
</br>
"Mhmm, do you remember that day?"</br>
</br>
"Are you talking about three years ago?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"Mhmmâ¦" Xia Shiyu nodded, the watery pupils was dyed with the color of memories.</br>
</br>
That same night, Jiang Chen saved her from thugs collecting debt from her. The only difference may be merely that he had nothing at that time and now there were many people working for him...including herself.</br>
</br>
The moonlight was shining, the palm tree leaves swayed. It wasn't just the tree's shadows that swayed, but the hearts of the two people in the car.</br>
</br>
Perhaps because of the alcohol, she had a faint red blush on her face. The fragrance of her body's scent was mixed with a hint of intoxicating red wine. Her soft hair rested against her cheek and was extremely attractive under the pristine moonlight.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was intoxicated.</br>
</br>
The narrow space was always the catalyst for intimacy. Feeling the temperature in his eyes, the red blush seemed have climbed up from her white neck to her earlobes. Their heartbeats gradually amplified, and it gradually became unclear who it belonged to.</br>
</br>
Bathed in that avid sight, Xia Shiyu awkwardly moved her body and pretended not to see it.</br>
</br>
The atmosphere inside the car made her very uncomfortable, but she didn't dislike it.</br>
</br>
Her suppressed feelings uncontrollably erupted from the bottom of her heart.</br>
</br>
The car parked slowly next to an empty road.</br>
</br>
Their breathing turned louder. Who was the aggressor? Inside the tinted windows, the lips of the two people gradually approached and finally pressed together.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 733: Five Senses Blocked</br>
</div></br>
</br>
After driving Xia Shiyu home, Jiang Chen drove alone on the road in the suburbs of Coro City.</br>
</br>
Recalling the scene that had just happened, he couldn't stop smiling.</br>
</br>
Or giggling.</br>
</br>
Subconsciously touched his lips, he could still feel a trace of temperature there.</br>
</br>
He clearly felt Xia Shiyu's feelings for him and he had long decided to be true to his feeling. However, too much happened during this period, so neither of them took a step forward, but instead, they maintained an intimate but indirect relationship.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was because of the pristine moonlight, perhaps it was because of the atmosphere, but when he kissed Xia Shiyu's lips, he didn't feel any repulsion, but he felt the warmth from the thin lips and the gradual hunger and thirstâ¦</br>
</br>
However, unfortunately, the two didn't go to the last step.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen's hands were around her waist, Xia Shiyu became rational again. With the slightest sense of rationality remaining, she told him that she didn't want to go to the last step before marriage. When he learned this point, he didn't force anything and stopped himself.</br>
</br>
However, although she rejected him, she didn't push him away.</br>
</br>
Replaced by...</br>
</br>
"I'm sorry...I can't give it to you."</br>
</br>
"It's okay." Staring at the intoxicated but apologetic pupils, Jiang Chen smiled. "It's me who should apologize. I can't give you the promise you want but I kissed you."</br>
</br>
There was a flash of hesitation in her eyes; she bit her lower lip and whispered.</br>
</br>
"Is It... uncomfortable?"</br>
</br>
"Uncomfortable?"</br>
</br>
"I... I heard that when men, you know, if they can't relieve it, it wouldâ¦ be uncomfortable."</br>
</br>
"Perhaps ... a little bit." When Jiang Chen said this, his face turned red for lying.</br>
</br>
However, Xia Shiyu, who never experienced before, took his lie for the truth and thought he really endured for her.</br>
</br>
"Then... I'll help you to get it out. It won't be uncomfortable then."</br>
</br>
"Well... wait, what did you say?"</br>
</br>
[Don't let me say it once more! Bastard!]</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu gritted her teeth and punched Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
Then she reached out to the water bottle that was placed on the side of the driver's seat...</br>
</br>
â¦</br>
</br>
Recalling what happened in the car, Jiang Chen's lips formed a curvature subconsciously again; it almost went all the way to his ears. He turned on the radio, switched off the air conditioner, and lowered the window. The night breeze blew on his face, dispersing the intimate emotion in the wind and it drifted afar with the melody.</br>
</br>
The roadside lights disappeared and reappeared to form a gorgeous ray. The palm trees on both sides gradually turned sparse and the scenery turned into the open sea.</br>
</br>
The southern end of the island was not far. Follow this straight road, and then turning and driving for another two blocks, the mansions on the southernmost side could be seen.</br>
</br>
</br>
However, just then, Jiang Chen suddenly saw a person in the middle of the road.</br>
</br>
To be precise, it was a girl.</br>
</br>
A white dress swayed with the sea breeze. Her face didn't look too lively, but a sweet smile could be seen. She stood there, standing in front of the curve, looking directly at Jiang Chen driving towards her.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned slightly and pressed on the horn.</br>
</br>
The horn sounded, but the girl remained still.</br>
</br>
If she was not a lunatic, then she must be suicidal!</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen was about to break when all of a sudden, he seemed to see a ray of piercing light aimed directly at him.</br>
</br>
The eyes were blinded with glaring lights, like an incandescent light, flashlight, or a lighthouse on the coast. The light magnified in his field of vision and gradually turned everything white.</br>
</br>
It was not just his sight, but also his hearing, touch, and even taste and smell were affected. The five senses were covered by the glaring white light.</br>
</br>
At that moment, he was driving at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour!</br>
</br>
It was too late to brake!</br>
</br>
"Fu*kâ¦"</br>
</br>
With a low groan, Jiang Chen instantly activated Fury, and Unparalleled immediately.</br>
</br>
The five senses that were covered did not return, but in the whiteness, his hands and feet moved. The tools in his hands were harnessed to the extreme, using his instincts to avoid and react. Even if he couldn't see or hear, simply based on the memory of the road conditions, he lifted the hand brake and spun the steering wheel.</br>
</br>
The modified Lamborghini created a beautiful mirage of light on the road. The tail wing was able to pass over the highway guardrail and stop on the road behind the curve.</br>
</br>
His five senses returned.</br>
</br>
The road on the coast was pitch dark, as if was never illuminated.</br>
</br>
Ending this Unparalleled state, Jiang Chen unbuckled his seat belt and stepped out of the vehicle with a rifle from his storage dimension.</br>
</br>
There was no doubt that the woman standing in the middle of the road wasÂ one of the people with superpowers. And just then, she used a mind oscillation to attack him while he was driving 100 kilometers per hour.</br>
</br>
"Stand up there and don't move. Put your hands on your hand and kneel down! I swear I won't pity you."</br>
</br>
The two were 50 meters apart. Jiang Chen was not sure of the distance of her attack, so he was careful not to approach. He just held the rifle in his hand and locked the crosshair on her</br>
</br>
If anything odd happened, he would pull the trigger and kill her.</br>
</br>
After hearing Jiang Chen's warning, the girl not only didn't show the slightest fear but actually started to laugh.</br>
</br>
"Certainly worthy of the name Mr Jiang Chen. I thought you were dead for sure."</br>
</br>
"Who are you? Did the Kurofune send you?" Jiang Chen furrowed.</br>
</br>
From the face, the girl should be Asian. However, according to the list provided to him by Mitsui, there shouldn't be anymore Kurofune members in Asia.</br>
</br>
Is it a fish that escaped the net?</br>
</br>
However, contrary to Jiang Chen's surprise, the girl shook her head and smiled.</br>
</br>
"No, I just wanted to take revenge for my parents. This is really unfortunate; it seems that I have failed."</br>
</br>
Like murmurs in a dream, the sea breeze continued to blow.</br>
</br>
"Parents? Wait! Stop!"</br>
</br>
The girl didn't give Jiang Chen an opportunity to explain. She took out a dagger and stabbed it into her heart...</br>
</br>
Blood flooded out of the young girl's mouth and dripped down her lips. Before her death, her eyes kept staring at Jiang Chen. The lips seemed to be mourning something.</br>
</br>
Or, cursing something.</br>
</br>
Gunfire echoed in the night sky.</br>
</br>
A bullet penetrated her head and the girl silently fell on the icy highway.</br>
</br>
He put the rifle back into his storage dimension and slowly closed his eyes.</br>
</br>
He did not know why she hated him, and why she was even willing to die for it.</br>
</br>
The only thing he could do was end her misery.</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The sunshine outside the window was dazzling, and Coro Island was particularly hot today.</br>
</br>
The air conditioner was turned up high. Jiang Chen was sitting in the study room, quietly reading a novel. He seldom read books. Thanks to Ayesha, this elegantly decorated study room was never covered by dust.</br>
</br>
Today he was in no mood to go out, nor did he feel like wearing the Phantom to play games, so he simply came to read. While waiting for the news of the Ghost Agents, he quietly read this novel he had read half a year ago, but never picked back up.</br>
</br>
"Cabbages and Kings"</br>
</br>
He did not try to guess the ending of the story, because O. Henry's endings had always been unexpected.</br>
</br>
A gust of wind blew by and Jiang Chen looked up. Ayesha, dressed in a maid uniform, appeared at the door and walked beside him in gentle steps.</br>
</br>
"The identity of the assassin was found. Her parents were Kurofune members and killed by Ghost Agents."</br>
</br>
At the request of Jiang Chen, Ayesha did not tell him the name of the girl.</br>
</br>
He closed the book, put the book aside, and gently said.</br>
</br>
"What about her?"</br>
</br>
"She had nothing to do with the Kurofune... but we do not rule out that Kurofune members later found her and simply trained and instilled in her... the concept of hatred." Ayesha adjusted the wording to be as brief as possible.</br>
</br>
"Is that so..." Jiang Chen was in deep thought</br>
</br>
Hatred fueled by hatred, this was what he had expected. However, he didn't intend to change his mind. The Kurofune must be wiped out and any excuse was not sufficient to argue against their crime against society.</br>
</br>
What's more, they were on their last breaths.</br>
</br>
"We can add an examination to the medical checkup during immigration inspection to monitor the presence of the genetic code," Ayesha suggested.</br>
</br>
"There are too many people who carry hidden genetic codes, even more than those who do not carry them. The difference between superpowers and ordinary people is whether the genetic code is explicitly expressed or not." Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
Ghost agents penetrated into every area of Xin and monitored every incoming and outgoing phone call, text, byte of data in Xin's artificial intelligence. However, to ensure the security status of each incoming passenger, it was almost impossible to complete the work for a tourist country with a traffic of several hundred thousand or more.</br>
</br>
Compared to the mercenaries using weapons, attacks by unarmed people were sometimes more dangerous and even more difficult to prevent. For example, the girl last night used a mental oscillation at a crucial moment.</br>
</br>
Fortunately, although these so-called superpowers were inconceivable, they are all within the realm of nature. For example, the superheroes that could destroy everything would only exist in Marvel.</br>
</br>
Biting her lower lip, Ayesha lowered her beautiful face.</br>
</br>
"I'm very sorry. It was my dereliction of duty that you were almost assassinated last nightâ"</br>
</br>
</br>
"No need to apologize. Raise your head." Jiang Chen smiled. "Nobody can predict what will happen. All we can do is prevent it before it happens."</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen's words gave Ayesha some comfort, the young girl still did not completely forgive her dereliction of duty. If there weren't any of them, there would at least be a Ghost Agent that would accompany Jiang Chen. However, unfortunately, the atmosphere with Xia Shiyu was too great last night. Zhu Yu, who was standing next to him, protecting him, did not dare to look at the "live show" of the two, and quietly left.</br>
</br>
No one thought it would be such a coincidence. If Zhu Yu was nearby, she would certainly not hesitate to execute the girl immediately. The person with superpowers was still a person, no matter what kind of superpower, as long as the person was dead, there would be no problems.</br>
</br>
For this matter, Ayesha lectured Zhu Yu for a long time.</br>
</br>
If it were her instead, she would certainly not shy away from watching Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu doing naughty things, perhaps she would have joined themâ¦ Ahem.</br>
</br>
Since Ayesha didn't respond, Jiang Chen paused for a moment but then continued.</br>
</br>
"What happened last night was nothing. My car was modified. Even if I didn't stop the car and drove into the sea, I would at most suffer some small injuries. So, don't feel too guilty. In that world, I have seen people with even more terrifying superpowers."</br>
</br>
"More terrifying?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.</br>
</br>
"His superpower had been unlocked to the third level, and he could wipe a whole province from the map... but in the end, he still died under my Light Sword."</br>
</br>
Also, he had to thank those crystals detonated by the guy named Bo Yu. Otherwise, his storage dimension would not have changed to the real universe.</br>
</br>
After listening to Jiang Chen's words, Ayesha asked in concern.</br>
</br>
"Over there... Is that world so terrifying?"</br>
</br>
"Not necessarily. Although in every sense the situation there is very confusing and chaotic, but fortunately, there is a group of people who are still pretty good, and now slowly establishing order. So, don't worry about me too much. If there is the opportunity, I'll take you over there for a tour...though it is not a good place."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and rubbed Ayesha's head.</br>
</br>
"Mhmm." Aisha murmured.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
To avoid unnecessary trouble, Jiang Chen did not disclose the assassination to the public. The body of the girl was also taken to the apocalypse for burial. The traces of her existence were erased from the world forever.</br>
</br>
After a day of rest at home, he arrived at the Future Group building the next day.</br>
</br>
With some contrast to what he had imagined, he originally thought that with Xia Shiyu's thin skin, after experiencing such an embarrassing thing, she would surely avoid him for several days. However, the reality was out of his expectations. Not only did Xia Shiyu not hide from him, she also sat across from him at lunchtime.</br>
</br>
Perhaps it was Jiang Chen's illusion, but the relationship between them got a lot closer.</br>
</br>
However, when the two people were eating, they mostly talked about work.</br>
</br>
"Is Future Technology prepared?"</br>
</br>
"What are you referring to?" Xia Shiyu mixed the salad dressing with the vegetables and fruits, and then picked up a tomato with her fork before sending it into her cherry mouth. However, for some reason, Jiang Chen felt the moment when the red lips bit onto the tomato, it was extremely sensual. Maybe because the salad dressing was white.</br>
</br>
"The phone."</br>
</br>
He cut off a piece of steak and chewed to hide his embarrassment.</br>
</br>
"Future Heavy Inudstries already delivered the sample. From product quality, it is absolutely worthy of the concept 'next generation'. In addition, I have seen Ning Huajian's plan, and the promotion and sales channels of Future Technology are ready to go. All the work is ready and only one last thing remains."</br>
</br>
"What?"</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu smiled and used a joking tone she rarely used.</br>
</br>
"Mr. President, please give the phone a name."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
Downstairs of the Future Group building, major newspapers and media reporters clashed around. The security personnel gestured to each other, pulled up the yellow line, and guided these excited people to the right positions to prevent accidents from pushing and shoving.</br>
</br>
Future Technology was holding a product launch conference and Jiang Chen would be present in person.</br>
</br>
Outside the venue, one could see heavily-armed star ring trade soldiers, helicopters hovering in the air, and snipers deployed on distant buildings. Hummingbird drones were also hidden in unseen places. As far as the security level, the specification of this conference was absolutely above that of the president's speech.</br>
</br>
They had started to plan the conference since the beginning of the year.</br>
</br>
From the earliest announcement that the company would enter the mobile device manufacturing industry, then to the breakthrough of graphene technology and the subsequent acquisition of the Nippon technology companies. For this day, Future Technology was long-prepared. The media and the public were having unprecendent high hope for the reveal.</br>
</br>
What kind of groundbreaking product would they come up with? As early as the first three days before the conference began, major social media platforms and forums had already started to debate.</br>
</br>
At the same time, to really stir things up, Future Technology revealed the frame of a black cell phone on their official website. On the face of the phone were welcoming words and under that was a clock, counting down the time till the conference. Also, Future Technology agreed to cooperate with Xin Radio and Television Station and broadcast the conference live on their official website and TV station. Finally, 100 lucky viewers would be drawn and given the price of the new phone.</br>
</br>
Future Technology was preparing for this highly anticipated event for a very long time!</br>
</br>
The live broadcast did not start yet, but the chat was already filled with comments.</br>
</br>
"Hurry! My brother, I have been waiting for a week!"</br>
</br>
"One week is nothing. I've been waiting since last year."</br>
</br>
"Like you knew anything about it the year before! Future Technology first announced this event at the beginning of last year when they decided to enter the mobile industry. If you didn't know about it , you must be dumb!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Behind the scene of the conference venue, Jiang Chen was in a chair, crossed his legs and looked at the official website of Future Technology through the holographic screen on his watch. He could not hide his grin. The live broadcast had not yet begun, but the number of online viewers had already jumped to 11 million and was constantly refreshing to new highs.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the official website of Future Technology had suffered no less than 100,000 hacker attacks starting this morning. However, under the combination of artificial intelligence firewalls and quantum computing, hackers who could break the group's defense system were yet to be born.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Ning Huajian's skill is really something else. The chief designer is looking forward to it."</br>
</br>
Xia Shiyu stood by the curtain with her arms folded and watched Jiang Chen without any nervousness, then she coughed to catch hi sattention.</br>
</br>
"Are you ready?"</br>
</br>
"Relax, it's not my first time." Jiang Chen smiled, turned off the watch's holographic screen, stood up and looked at Xia Shiyu. "How long do I have?"</br>
</br>
"Thirty-five minutes."</br>
</br>
"It seems there are still a few minutes for me to go to the bathroom."</br>
</br>
Waving his hand, Jiang Chen walked toward the bathroom.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Thirty minutes before the start of the conference, journalists and special guests were allowed to enter the venue. Thousands of square meters of the venue were suddenly crowded with the continuous flow of people. Already drilled numerous times, the staff skillfully maintained the order at the scene.</br>
</br>
The crowd in the venue were buzzing. Before they could start, reporters did not check their speeches and instead, whispered to their peers. Looking at the bustling venue, people who unaware would have thought it was a rock concert.</br>
</br>
Suddenly, the lights in the stands were lit and the entire venue became silent. Reporters focuesd the lenses in the center of the stage.Â The curtainly slowly opening made everyone held their breathe.</br>
</br>
The lights gathered toward the center. Jiang Chen stepped out from behind the curtains and stood in front of the stage with thunderous applause and cheers.</br>
</br>
Behind, Future Technology's giant logo flashed on the screen. With his opening speech, numerous light particles spread out on the screen and staggered into the twelve languages.</br>
</br>
Real-time translation!</br>
</br>
One of the Future Technology's hidden technology!</br>
</br>
"I would like to extend my gratitude for all the reporters and special guests making the visit, and for the viewers watching the live broadcast on through the livestream and on TV. Thank you for your continued support and expectations for Future Technology. Please believe me, I will live up to your expectations." Jiang Chen said the opening remarks with a smile.</br>
</br>
Standing in the background, Xia Shiyu was holding her breath.</br>
</br>
Just a short span of two minutes, the number of online viewers on the official website exceeded 100 million!</br>
</br>
Looking at the pairs of eager eyes below the stage, and their gazes full of anticipation, Jiang Chen intentionally paused for two seconds and immediately extended his hand, with a bright smile, he said, "Future."</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen saidthis word, the reporters were obviously surprised. He did not understand what he meant. It wasn't until the beam of light gathered in Jiang Chen's hands did they see the piece of paper.</br>
</br>
Yes, it was like a piece of paper.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen said the word, the phone named "Future" also revealed on the screen. Its parameters such as thickness, length, width, pixel, CPU, etc., surprised everyone so much that their eyeballs almost popped out.</br>
</br>
0.1mm!</br>
</br>
Almost only the thickness of one piece of paper!</br>
</br>
This really is a cell phone? !</br>
</br>
Everyone's minds circled around the same idea.</br>
</br>
This is unscientific!</br>
</br>
However, in the following moment, Jiang Chen proved to them with practical actions the real science.</br>
</br>
After most people saw this scene, they all came up with the same question in their minds, no matter if they were at the venue or watching the conference live from Future's official website.</br>
</br>
However, the audience did not ponder too long on this issue. Jiang Chen soon answered their question.</br>
</br>
"I know what you are worried about. Such as if you would lose this cell phone forever if you dropped it on the ground. Next I will tell you that your concern is completely redundant."</br>
</br>
Saying this, Jiang Chen bent down and picked up the "paper" from the ground and shook it in front of the audience.</br>
</br>
"When the phone enters standby mode, the fluorescent material built into the graphene material will outline the phone screen with lines and display the time in the center of the screen. Of course, if you don't like it displaying the time, you can also change this function in the settings."</br>
</br>
Holding up "Future" phone, in the incredible exclamation of everyone, Jiang Chen folded it into a circular arc to show people its powerful shaping function.</br>
</br>
"The graphene material is very soft. You can bend it into a circle and put it on your wrist like a watch. You can also fold it into a purse, roll it up and pack it into a cigarette box, or even fold it into a paper plane and throw it. If you have neighbors... Of course, I don't recommend you do this."</br>
</br>
Friendly laughter came from the audience.</br>
</br>
At this point, everyone thought that the function of this first graphene cell phone had already been introduced. Some reporters was already taking notes, and they were also contemplating what questions to ask later. Based on the arbitrary folding function, this mobile phone could already be worthy of the title of "Future", and was also worthy of the expectations of countless people that waited for almost a year.</br>
</br>
However, when everyone thought that was it, Jiang Chen smiled and opened his mouth again.</br>
</br>
"However, these functions are not the focus I intend to introduce today."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen mysteriously smiled, then rolled the Future phone onto his wrist like a bracelet.</br>
</br>
His demeanor was like that of a magician.</br>
</br>
"Next, we will witness miracles!"</br>
</br>
</br>

</br>
Catherine couldn't believe her eyes. She has been a reporter for many years and attended countless Silicon Valley's product launch conferences, but it was the first time she had been genuinely amazed by a product.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen on the stage rolled the phone into a watch and put it around his wrist, a spectrum of light formed an entity on his palm.</br>
</br>
Everyone held their breath.</br>
</br>
Hologram!</br>
</br>
No, not just holograms! She personally watched Jiang Chen touch the hologram and operate the phone by touching the holographic screen. The screen suspending in the air was like a physical screen, and the transparent operating interface was simple but aesthetic.</br>
</br>
Holographic interaction technology! And it was a holographic interaction that had completely separated from the physical interface!</br>
</br>
She didn't know what words she could use to describe the shock in her heart at the moment. She peeked at her peers' notes and saw the chief reporter of the Daily Mail's pen tremble before he jot down one word.</br>
</br>
Incredible.</br>
</br>
Yeah... maybe only the word incredible could depict the shock of the audience.</br>
</br>
As it was too shocking to see, Catherine's chin was in a jaw-dropping state during the rest of the conference.</br>
</br>
Fully charged, the phone could operate for 24 hours. It adopted the Deep Blue M1 processor chip designed by Future Technology with a performance equivalent to twice to the phone with the same price.</br>
</br>
Because the mobile phone itself was already thinner than the USB interface, for this purpose, Future Heavy Industrial had specially designed a wireless charger for charging. In addition, Future Technology completely abandoned wired headsets and directly configured a Bluetooth headset. The headset or the phone could be used to change into speaker or headset mode.</br>
</br>
Abandoning the original sim card design, Future phone adopted a similar concept proposed by Apple and Samsung as early as 2015. However, due to the impact on the wireless carriers, this feature was temporarily unavailable in some countries. Instead, Future Technology had added a sim card scanning function.</br>
</br>
In addition to these unbelievable functions, Future was also introducing different colors, such as Deep Space Gray, Snowflake Silver, Rose Gold, and Gay Violet to provide the most distinguished services to the most distinguished customers.</br>
</br>
Well, in fact, there was no difference between the different colors. Graphene was transparent, and the only difference between these different colors was the fluorescent material that was incorporated into them, that is, the color of the screen frame and the clock... and the price.</br>
</br>
Among them, the basic colors such as orange and blue were the cheapest. The direct selling price was 950 dollars before tax, and the selling price of Rich Gold was as high as 1,100 dollars, which was more than 150 dollars higher!</br>
</br>
By the way, these tricks of making money were learned from Apple.</br>
</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen, named chief designer, was unclear about the difference between light pink and Rose Gold. However, the comments on the official website broadcast had already exploded. According to Jean's data analysis and statistics, 70% of users had a strong preference for Rose Gold.</br>
</br>
"Future, let us welcome the future together!"</br>
</br>
As Jiang Chen concluded the presentation with a pun, the presentation of this product launch came to an end. The reporters stepped forward and directed the cameras and microphones at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, will Future be positioned as a high-end phone? Did your designer consider that the $950 price, for most middle-income people, especially those in developing countries, is difficult to accept?"</br>
</br>
"Future is positioned as a high-tech product. We don't want to label it with a low-end or high-end label. Buying an iPhone 8 for $950 may pain you for a while, but I promise you, if you buy a Future, you will only feel that it is a great purchase," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
The reporters' eyes lit up, and their pens furiously jotted notes down.</br>
</br>
[Future Group Chairman Jiang Chen at the press conference criticized Apple's iPhone 8 price for being too expensive to match its poor functionality.]</br>
</br>
Controversy and gossip were always easier to sell than the product itself. Jiang Chen didn't care about his exaggerated facts.</br>
</br>
After all, it was hype.</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, when will Future be on sale?"</br>
</br>
"Mr. Jiang, there is rumor online about you and Emma Watson..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
The two-hour questioning session quickly passed, but the enthusiasm of the journalists at the venue did not diminish at all. When Jiang Chen walked out from the siege of reporters, the body injected with genetic vaccine even felt a little weariness.</br>
</br>
Pushing the door into the backstage room, Jiang Chen sunk into a chair while letting out a long breath. Xia Shiyu walked over with a glass of water. Jiang Chen took the water and chugged it clean.</br>
</br>
"It's exhausting. I don't know how the reporters have so many questions."</br>
</br>
Although he was complaining, a smile hanged on his mouth.</br>
</br>
The explosion of Future had, to some extent, reflected the market's expectations for the product. It is foreseeable that on the day of the release, being out of stock would be the inevitable.</br>
</br>
"Did you know? The peak number of live viewers just exceeded one billion." Standing next to him with her arms folded Xia Shiyu smiled.</br>
</br>
One billion?!</br>
</br>
After hearing this figure, Jiang Chen was astonished. Even though he was full of confidence in the Future's popularity, he was startled by this figure. One billion online viewers, fortunately, the official website's server is a quantum computer, or just this ridiculous traffic would blow up the official website of Future Technology.</br>
</br>
"According to the online users' IP, we have identified a list of 200 lucky users and have now issued prizes based on the address they filled in. In addition, the official website sales link has been open for ten minutes, and the 200,000 phones on hand were sold out within a minute."</br>
</br>
With the current production efficiency of the New Malaysia Special District, the average profit of a Future phone was 600 US Dollar and 200,000 mobile phones were all sold. In other words, in just one minute, the Future Group made 120 million.</br>
</br>
This is ridiculous.</br>
</br>
The FED's printer cannot match this speed.</br>
</br>
"Let Future Heavy Industrial re-adjust their production capacity, and increase monthly production to 4 million pieces within two months, and increase it to 9 million before the end of this year!"</br>
</br>
"I have already delegated people to do that." Xia Shiyu nodded and pushed her glasses up. Then she added, "In addition, five companies including Samsung and Foxconn submitted a letter of intent to us and expressed their willingness to negotiate with us on Future to help us increase our production capacity."</br>
</br>
"What's their proposal?"</br>
</br>
"They are willing to be our OEM for the Dark Blue M1 chip, graphene screen, and battery for a total of 13 parts. It is estimated that this move can save costs of 79 US Dollar. And it will be able to increase our production capacity to 5 million per month in a short period of time," Xia Shiyu said.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen pondered this for half a minute; his index finger tapped gently on the table. Then he said.</br>
</br>
"The Future Group does not have the plan of OEM for the time being. You can just tell them that."</br>
</br>
"Okay, I'll draft the email later." Xia Shiyu nodded.</br>
</br>
For outsourcing, Xia Shiyu also held opposing views. However, she still needed to consult Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
In order to build a complete set of electronic production lines in New Malaysia Special District, Future had already invested 2 billion US Dollar. Although OEMs could allow for large-scale production, minimize product costs in a short period of time, and increase production, the side effects were also obvious; it'd lead to an outflow of technology.</br>
</br>
Although the 21 components including the Deep Blue M1 chip have been registered for patents in all countries, Future Heavy Industrial's electronic production processes were still business secrets.</br>
</br>
If made public, it meant that the OEMs would possess the same production technologies. Companies that did not have their own products were fine, but for Samsung that was both in the OEM and the phone production business, they could easily develop their own graphene mobile phones and at most pay a patent fee to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
For Future Group, it would be a lost cause.</br>
</br>
Patent barriers and technical barriers. Under the protection of these two strongholds, could Future Group maintain their monopoly in the market and ensure its hegemony?!</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 737: The Monopoly on Future</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Apple Spaceship headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. This 2.8 million-square-foot building is like a castle that signified the Apple Empire. In the words of Steve Jobs, this new building is like a "spacecraft that landed," and the UA media likened it to "a giant glass donut."</br>
</br>
At this moment, 48 hours has passed since the Future Technology product launch. Apple CEO Tim Cook sat in his office and leaned back against the office chair. After Steve Jobs' death, he was worried about the company's prospects for the first time.</br>
</br>
By the way, in the two days' time, Apple's market value evaporated by 20 billion US Dollar. Wall Street analysts believed that Future Technology's announcement to enter the mobile phone manufacturing industry would change Apple's dominant position in the high-end smartphone market.</br>
</br>
Against Future, Cook pessimistically discovered that the Apple 8 did not have any advantage beyond price.</br>
</br>
For the Apple 8 positioned in the high-end market, it was undoubtedly very ironic.</br>
</br>
Looking at the Future in his hand, Tim Cook sighed.</br>
</br>
Even as a competitor, he had to admit that the design of the Future was perfect, especially the function of the holographic screen; it was addictive to play with. If it were not for the fact that he was concerned about the media taking advantage of this opportunity, the thought of changing his own phone came into mind.</br>
</br>
There was a knock on the door.</br>
</br>
Putting the Future aside, Cook said listlessly.</br>
</br>
"Please come in."</br>
</br>
The door was pushed open, and his assistant Bernard Bermen came in. As soon as he stepped in, the assistant said.</br>
</br>
"Two news, one good and one bad, which one do you want to hear first?"</br>
</br>
"Too old of a saying, what do you think makes me feel better?" Cook waved his hand.</br>
</br>
Berman's expression was a little embarrassed, he hesitated for a moment and said.</br>
</br>
"The product development department reverse engineered the Future phone. Combining the documents we obtained from the UA Intellectual Property Office, we have already deciphered their technology."</br>
</br>
"Oh?" Cook said with his eyes lighting up. He sat up and crossed his fingers on the table. "How long will it take to apply it to our iPhone 9... No, it can't be called iPhone 9. The ground-breaking product line must be renamed. Call it iPhone-N1..."</br>
</br>
"Sir..." Berman awkwardly whispered and shattered Cook's illusion.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter? Is there still a bad news?" Cook said. "It doesn't matter how much they're going to charge for patents. If prices are too high, we can sue them."</br>
</br>
"It's not a question of royalties." Berman gritted his teeth, and finally decided to be truthful, "Although we have analyzed the technology, but in regards to how to mass produce their parts ... none of our OEMs can do it."</br>
</br>
Cook took a minute to process the information and then leaned back in his chair while revealing a wry smile.</br>
</br>
</br>
"I knew it."</br>
</br>
Why did Future Heavy Industrial start to invest in the electronics industry and make big acquisitions from the screen design to the camera and a series of electronic equipment manufacturing companies at the start of the year? The graphene technology was integrated and a complete production line was built from scratch. From the very beginning, their plans were not small.</br>
</br>
It was not just a move to dominate the smart phone industry, they were trying to monopolize the entire graphene industry from the source.</br>
</br>
Future? Together to welcome the future?</br>
</br>
It's better to say something more appropriate.</br>
</br>
Monopolize the future.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Because of their limited production capacity, Future was even selling ten times more expensive in some countries on the black market. However, even if this were the case, the Future phones were still without a market. The intents to purchase Future phones could be seen on all the major forums, just like when the Phantom helmets were sold.</br>
</br>
Whether it was from its innovation or practicality, the phone that could be held in a wallet, around a wrist, and project holographic images could be said to occupy the limelight. In combination with the marketing of Future Technology, and the massive marketing campaign, it was adding oil to the fire,</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that the Future has been favoured by young men and women since its release.</br>
</br>
"Ten thousand to purchase a Future, private message me! Contact information XXXX..."</br>
</br>
"OP, if you're talking about US Dollar, I'd probably consider it."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
Some odd people even directly messaged Jiang Chen on Weibo with their selfies, seeking for a Future phone, which even made the scandalous Jiang Chen speechless.</br>
</br>
Not only the Future phone sales were booming, but the mobile processor designed by future heavy industry, the Deep Blue M1 chip, had also been favoured by major mobile phone manufacturers. Within a month, Future Heavy Industrial received 2 million chip orders. If it were not for the priority to meet the needs of the Future phone, the dark blue M1 chip alone could make Future Group rich.</br>
</br>
There was also a graphene screen.</br>
</br>
With features such as light weight, resistance to dropping and strong durability, the graphene screen can be said to have already surpassed the current state-of-the-art OLED screen and has become the most promising display material in the future. More than a dozen companies, including rivals such as Apple, Samsung, and other smart phone giants, have reached out to Future Technology. They were even brazen enough to place orders at Future Heavy Industrial in hopes of upgrading their screens.</br>
</br>
For these competitors, Jiang Chen did not make it difficult for them.</br>
</br>
Under the premise of satisfying the Future phone production capacity, he didn't mind letting these competitors help him absorb excess production capacity. After all, the more he produced, the lower the cost would be. Is was even more pleasant to use this money earned from the competition to expand and improve the production line and grow his own strength?</br>
</br>
More critically, they must swallow this!</br>
</br>
The patents were in Jiang Chen's hands. You want to research and develop? OK, every production of a screen, batteries, chips, the patents cost to your cell phone will make your cost ridiculous! And the self-developed product with a spending of more than 1 billion US Dollar may not necessarily be comparable to the more mature graphene technology of Future Heavy Industries.</br>
</br>
In the end, they still must buy screens, chips, and batteries from Future Heavy Industries!</br>
</br>
And the most critical interactive holographic projection elements, as the main selling point of the Future phone, Jiang Chen would not sell to the competition at any cost.</br>
</br>
Monopoly? Unfair competition? Oh, why don't you sue me in Xin.</br>
</br>
Electronic parts with advanced technology were completed in the high-tech park on Ange Island. It would not enter the market unless it was supplied to Future Technology. If anyone wanted to use interactive holographic projection technology, take the patent file and research it.</br>
</br>
It wouldn't be possible to understand the production process in five years. And five years later, Jiang Chen would have no need to keep the technology in his pocket. There would be more advanced technology. These outdated technologies could be packaged and sold directly.</br>
</br>
The benefit of having an advantage in science and technology was precisely this point. Other people not only have to eat your leftovers, but they also have to swallow it. With the technical guarantees from the apocalypse, at least in a hundred years, Jiang Chen wouldn't have to worry about his technology becoming outdated.</br>
</br>
As for one hundred years later...</br>
</br>
Too far away. Jiang Chen didn't want to think about it now. If he couldn't defeat the crisis of 20.5 light years away, the continuation of the earth civilization on this timeline would be in jeopardy, let alone his Future Group.</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 738: Penglai City Completion</br>
</div></br>
</br>
On February 1, 2018, Walmart and Future Technology jointly organized the first VR product exhibition in the world.</br>
</br>
During the four months duration, hundreds of thousands of products were exhibited on stage, covering small crafts, large-scale electromechanics, clothing, food, and housing with more than 76,000 exhibitors participating.</br>
</br>
One of the most eye-catching items was the Mercedes-Benz S750e launched by the Daimler Group. The vehicle used a wireless rechargeable solid-state lithium-air battery designed by Future Heavy Industries with a powerful and aesthetically pleasing design. Although not specifically an auto show, the advanced technology was always eye-catching. Many ordinary tourists who could not afford to buy cars experienced it in the virtual world. Therefore, the Daimler Group's Mercedes-Benz S750e has successfully set a record for the highest number of visits.</br>
</br>
In addition, the exhibition with the highest technological content would undoubtedly be the products from Future Heavy Industrial such as the improvement of housework robots, Dragon Calvary X1 supercomputing chips, Dark Blue M1... In the first day of the exhibition, Future Heavy Industrial received a value of 5 billion US dollars in orders.</br>
</br>
According to data released by Future Group after the incident, in the first month of the global product exhibition, the total turnover easily exceeded $20 billion. With this trend continuing, this year's Global Merchandise Exhibition would easily break their turnover record.</br>
</br>
After attending the opening ceremony of this grand event, Jiang Chen took off his helmet.</br>
</br>
Although he was the "founder" of the virtual reality network, he himself enjoyed the feeling of living in reality. As the president of the group, he just needed to read the opening speech written by the secretary and shake hands with representatives of major companies at the opening ceremony.</br>
</br>
Ayesha shaved for him and then Jiang Chen put on a casual outfit before heading out.</br>
</br>
Today was an important day, not only the opening ceremony of the VR Global Merchandise Exhibition, but also the completion ceremony of Penglai City.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
On the sea north of Coro Island, two Guardian-class frigates that have been upgraded with electromagnetic pulse cannons have been patrolling the target sea area accompanied by Kilo-class submarines. A dozen large engineering ships lined up along the edge of the construction seas, forming a loose circle.</br>
</br>
Countless large and small yachts lined up. Some of them were wealthy tourists coming to Coro Island, some were investors or immigrants who have purchased real estate in Penglai City, and some were reporters invited by Future Group.</br>
</br>
The Black Eagle helicopters belonged to Celestial Trade. The hovered above the sea and carried staff to perform the final inspection of the construction site. Aurora-20 suddenly broke through the clouds and whistled past, attracting the cheers and whistles of tourists and reporters.</br>
</br>
</br>
The weather was lovely with no signs of a storm in the radius of a hundred miles, a good day to hold the completion ceremony.</br>
</br>
On a cruise ship, tourists in beachwears and bikinis leaned against the railing and looked out at the calm sea.</br>
</br>
"Sh*t, that fighter is so cool!"</br>
</br>
"I heard it is called Aurora-20. I don't know, is it better than the F35."</br>
</br>
"I'm more concerned about Penglai City. If I haven't got the wrong date, it should be today."</br>
</br>
"A city on the sea, Atlantis of the East sounds really romantic. Dear, can we live there later?"</br>
</br>
"Okay, baby, whatever you say... if Future Group doesn't bounce on us."</br>
</br>
"Look! The sea is moving!"</br>
</br>
With a loud exclamation, everyone stopped their chitchatting and looked intently in the direction of the sea.</br>
</br>
Yes, the sea was moving!</br>
</br>
Large bubbles emerged from the bottom of the ocean, the turbid air bubbles covered dozens of miles of the sea, defeating even the rolling waves. After two minutes, the tumbling air bubbles stopped. The sea level suddenly rose, and a hill that was hundreds of meters in radius emerged.</br>
</br>
Afterwards, the seawater spread around, and the ships and yachts in the outer ring were like leaves in a storm, pushed away by the sea waves that rose suddenly! Ships closer were even tilted at a 45Â° angle!</br>
</br>
"That boat! The boat is going to fall!" A tourist shrank to the edge of the cabin and shouted.</br>
</br>
"Why are you shouting?! There is no leak and no rollover. Shut up!"</br>
</br>
"Look! Look over there! The city of Penglai is coming out!"</br>
</br>
"God, what do I see..."</br>
</br>
"Dear Virgin Mary!"</br>
</br>
"Buddha!"</br>
</br>
"Fu*k!"</br>
</br>
Like a sharp steel blade, a steep octave tower pierced through the sea.</br>
</br>
Then, a metal building with a radius of several hundred meters lifted up as the water rose. A block of high-rise buildings sprang up from the surface of the water like spring bamboo shoots. The seawater fell from the top of the building and formed countless natural waterfalls, covering the face of Penglai City like a veil.</br>
</br>
The seawater crashed down and white mist soon formed around the vicinity.</br>
</br>
The wind blew gently, and the white fog wave moved with the wind, dancing flirtatiously on the ocean surface.</br>
</br>
Steel broke the waves and layers of ripples scattered around.</br>
</br>
The waves clashed against the side of the ship and created muffled sounds that resembled the sound of a heavy hammer smashing onto steel. Standing on this unmoving guardian frigate, Jiang Chen narrowed his eyes and looked up at the rise of the city with his binocular.</br>
</br>
"The main structure has risen!"</br>
</br>
"Unlock the stability lock. Initiate the rising of the second-level structure!"</br>
</br>
"Rising is complete, the graphene pipe is connected!"</br>
</br>
"Drainage gate..."</br>
</br>
Like a gyro, the circular main building became stable on the surface. Then the ring of aluminium foam structure rose, the graphene pipe protruded from the hole, and accurately penetrated into the side of the centre island, forming a giant, circular, artificial island!</br>
</br>
The sea water injected into the building flowed into the streets, flushing the shells, conch, and algae on the streets into the sea and formed a waterfall on the edge of the island. After completing the island floating operation, the crew immediately opened the pressure valve at the bottom of the island and discharged the seawater that was injected into the drainage and water supply system.</br>
</br>
"Is this Penglai City? Although it is not as beautiful as it is in the virtual reality, it seems more astonishing than what I have seen in the virtual reality." Standing beside Jiang Chen, Xia Shiyu exclaimed.</br>
</br>
Ayesha didn't speak, but from her sapphire eyes, Jiang Chen could still read her astonishment.</br>
</br>
As for Natasha, as a Russian diplomat, her head was lowered and no one knew what she was thinking.</br>
</br>
"Rest assured, I bet it will be as beautiful as the one in the virtual reality." Looking farther into the city, Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
The most critical main structure floating work has been completed. Jiang Chen's clenched hands could finally relax. Drainage work will take two full days, followed by the filling of other structures between the outer ring and the centre island.</br>
</br>
These structures were just like blocks, and they were all already built on the sea floor. They just need to be pieced together.</br>
</br>
That will take about five days.</br>
</br>
After all the work has been done, what was left was the clean-up. Workers wearing protective clothing would be the first to board the island and drive rubbish trucks to clean seaweeds, shells, and jellyfishes.</br>
</br>
In the process of floating, Penglai City brought a lot of "specialties" from the seabed. Now the entire artificial island was surrounded by a pungent smell. Without cleaning it up, no one would be willing to live on this island.</br>
</br>
This seemingly simple clean-up was the most time-consuming and laborious part of the entire floatation work. It was expected that the Future Group will use 1,000 "Xiao Lin" and 2,000 cleaning personnels, 6,000 sweeping drones, 50 garbage trucks and water tankers to complete the clean-up.</br>
</br>
It was expected to take one month.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 739: The Construction of the Century</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The footage of Penglai's completion was captured on video and went viral on sites like YouTube. People's initial reaction was to suspect that this was a special effect in a movie, and it was not until people watched other onlookers upload videos of themselves did people realize.</br>
</br>
It was not a movie, it was true!</br>
</br>
Back then, how many experts stated that it was impossible for this to be built. Even if it were built, it would not float to the surface of the sea. Even if it really did, several waves would have torn the island apart. Even on the day before the completion ceremony of Penglai City, a professor in ship science still commented to make this point known.</br>
</br>
"I'm telling you, this thing won't float! How do we make islands? Although this is knowledge in the field of construction, as a professor, I still know some elements. In general, we have to surround an area first, then fill it with sand, build an island directly on the sea floor, and then float it! This is completely ridiculous! I'm willing to bet, if this island doesn't sink, I will eat a pound of sh*t!"</br>
</br>
However, the next day, Penglai City successfully floated. So many experts' face was slapped hard.</br>
</br>
When everyone singled the professor out and asked him when he was going to eat, he suddenly stopped talking.</br>
</br>
Material science breakthroughs would bring a series of chain reactions, and changes to the construction industry and manufacturing would be disruptive. The tidal forces that ordinary steel cannot withstand were not difficult in front of tougher graphene materials.</br>
</br>
At the same time, the advantage of replacing metal material with graphene as a stabilizing structure was that there was no need to worry about seawater rust. As long as it was not built on the Pacific Ring of Fire, and happened to encounter the volcanic eruption at the bottom of the sea, there was no need to worry about broken graphene cables.</br>
</br>
With the completion of Penglai City, the number of people on Coro Island suddenly surged. Many hotels and rental rooms were completely booked out, so some people simply bought a tent and set it up on the roadside. The Xin National Congress had to introduce a city management bill urgently and regulate the phenomenon of sheds everywhere to contain it.</br>
</br>
At present, flights between Penglai City and Coro City had been established, and a dedicated line had been set up beside the passenger port to provide pick-up and drop-off services for tourists on the outlying islands. At the same time, the island itself also had a yacht pool and a berth at the edge where visitors could dock their own yachts and even sailboats and cruise ships.</br>
</br>
However, these access channels were temporarily closed. As for the reason, it was naturally because the cleaning work has not yet been completed.</br>
</br>
Although Future Group explained the reasons, people's curiosity and enthusiasm for Penglai City still caused crowds to gather in front of the passenger port.</br>
</br>
</br>
"Let me on the island! I bought a house on it. Why are you not letting me on!" A man in a designer suit shouted and questioned.</br>
</br>
"Sir, please wait patiently for Penglai City to officially open. Now we are working on the final stages of cleaning out the seaweed and desalination. Compared to a semi-finished product, we would like to show you the most beautiful city in front of you." The front desk lady with a perfect smile explained to the tourists what she repeated countless times.</br>
</br>
Whether or not this kind of rhetoric will satisfy these eager tourists, before the month-long clean-up is complete, Future Group would not let anyone in. In addition to the cleaning work, there would be simultaneous safety inspections.</br>
</br>
For example, is there any leakage? Is there seaweed in the power component? Is the graphene cable cracked? These were major events that could affect the lives and safety of millions of people and thus they could not tolerate any sloppy behaviour. If everyone boarded and the island sank, then Future Group would have completely played itself.</br>
</br>
According to the statistics provided by Xia Shiyu, in order to build this city, Future Group spent a total of 31.7 billion US Dollar, which was almost equivalent to the total amount of funds invested by Hua real estate investors in 2015 internationally!</br>
</br>
From this figure alone, it was demonstrative of how much liquidity this century project occupied. If Penglai City was unsuccessful, it was possible that Jiang Chen must really seek help from the Rothschild Bank, or send more subsidiaries public to ease the financial pressure.</br>
</br>
High risk goes hand in hand with high reward. The return on investment from the completion of Penglai would also be shocking.</br>
</br>
As early as the end of last year, Wall Street analysts conducted a valuation on Penglai City, and the final valuation was as high as 400 billion US Dollar!</br>
</br>
What was the concept of 400 billion US Dollar?</br>
</br>
The world-famous investor, Buffett, known as the stock god, said directly.</br>
</br>
"I can't estimate the market value of Penglai, just like I can't set a price for Los Angeles or Chicago, because that's not what money can measure. It's a city, as long as it is always there, it will always be generating value. Compared to Penglai City, I would rather value the founder of this spectacle, Future Heavy Industrial.Â If the spectacle could not be replicated, there is no doubt that it will be the most profitable company in this century. The biggest regret of this century will be Jiang Chen's unwillingness to go public.</br>
</br>
It seems that he felt his statement was not powerful enough. Buffett paused and added a sentence.</br>
</br>
"Yes, I mean, it will make money faster than the Fed can print money."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
When everyone couldn't wait to step onto Penglai City and start exploring it, apart from the staff of the Future Group, only Jiang Chen and a few others have experienced the city.</br>
</br>
However, as Future Group explained to the public, there was nothing to see in Penglai at this time.</br>
</br>
Streets full of jellyfish, and thickened salt blocks were everywhere on the pavement. The salts were not simply sodium chloride, but contain ionized elements such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. When the sun shone on it, these elements crystallized out of the sea.</br>
</br>
In order to flush these aesthetically-stricken residues, Jiang Chen had also drawn a desalination platform with a daily processing capacity of 4 million tons from Future Heavy Industrial. At the same time, the company deployed two tidal power generator sets on the seabed to power the desalination platform.</br>
</br>
It had now been a full ten days since the island's rise. During the Lunar New Year, Jiang Chen intended to return to the apocalypse. The expeditionary force seemed to have encountered some problems on Yizhou Island. He planned to go personally. After all, it had to do with the space elevator, and the trade routes south of the NAC.</br>
</br>
It could take as little as a few days or as many as two months. If he didn't take advantage of this time on the island to look around, once Penglai opened in March, he would not be the first to step onto the platform.</br>
</br>
Therefore, Jiang Chen took Ayesha, Xia Shiyu, and Natasha, who forced her way there with her thick skin. They boarded a helicopter and landed in the square in front of the architecture in the middle of the island â the Central of Penglai.</br>
</br>
"I think if these things are sun-dried into salted fish, they must be another huge sum of money." Standing in the doorway of the Central, Jiang Chen looked at the dead fish on the steps and sighed.</br>
</br>
He didn't know when these salted fish would be cleaned up.</br>
</br>
"I heard that the World Environmental Protection Organization is preparing trouble for you?" Standing beside Jiang Chen, Natasha mocked.</br>
</br>
"From Blue Seagull, our troubles have not stopped. We can only say that they inadvertently started a trend, and now those defenders of the Earth are looking for us. But do I care?" Jiang Chen laughed and kicked the salted fish aside.</br>
</br>
"Just like this salted fish."</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<hr id="Chapter 740"/>
<div class="totop" >
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 740: The Central</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The Central of Penglai stood at a height of 432 meters as the tallest building in the center of the island. It was similar to an obelisk in a steel forest. The surface of the building was covered with graphene material, and the steel skeleton was a made out of graphene tubes, which ensured the strength of the building. At the same time, the opening of the building's surface rotated from the bottom to the top. This design could effectively reduce the lateral force of the airflow in all directions to the building.</br>
</br>
After all, the wind on the sea was quite strong, and these were all carefully considered by the designers.</br>
</br>
The building would serve as a comprehensive super high-rise building, with a focus on municipal offices, and would also include services such as convention and exhibition centers, hotels, sightseeing and entertainment, commerce and catering. The top room of the building, as the tallest building on the Pacific, could easily overlook the entire Penglai.</br>
</br>
Of course, as Jiang Chen's private property, this room was not accessible to ordinary people.</br>
</br>
With Ayesha, Xia Shiyu, and Natasha, Jiang Chen took the sightseeing elevator to reach the highest floor, Jiang Chen's private room.</br>
</br>
Surrounded by transparent graphene floor-to-ceiling windows, from the inside, it looked like the windows were nonexistent From the outside, you could only see the black glass window.</br>
</br>
Stepping out of the elevator, Xia Shiyu carefully walked to the edge, reached out and touched the cold graphene floor-to-ceiling window and gently knocked on it before she sincerely exclaimed.</br>
</br>
"It's absolutely breathtaking. Although I don't know the world's wonder assessment criteria, this city... can absolutely be nominated to be the world's ninth wonder."</br>
</br>
After listening to Xia Shiyu's words, Jiang Chen smiled and did not speak.</br>
</br>
Penglai City could be regarded as the ninth wonder. If he can manufacture the space elevator, "the first heavenly tower in human history", what will that be then?</br>
</br>
"Only the miracles precipitated by history could be nominated. And as far as I know, six of the eight wonders of the world have been destroyed," Natasha murmured.</br>
</br>
Ayesha has been standing beside Jiang Chen without speaking, but from her blue pupil, Jiang Chen could see the reflection of the entire city and the color known as shock.</br>
</br>
After taking photos, Jiang Chen uploaded them to Weibo and Twitter. He took the three girls around for a tour in The Central before taking off on a helicopter and leaving the artificial island and returning to Coro Island.</br>
</br>
At present, the entire island was still in the clearing stage, and sea urchins and algae growth still existed below the sea level. One month later, the Pearl of the Pacific would present to the world her true appearance.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Just as Jiang Chen was landing on the island, at least five spy satellites from around the world aimed at the island on the western Pacific Ocean and observed the "artificial island".</br>
</br>
</br>
As early as the first day of the completion of Penglai City, all countries in the world turned their attention to this giant city on the sea.</br>
</br>
What does it mean to build a city on the sea?</br>
</br>
It means that the congested living space on land would be completely freed to the ocean, and those countries with extensive territorial waters but scarce land resources would hopefully obtain opportunities to develop resources on the sea through Future Heavy Industrial.</br>
</br>
At present, 27 countries have listed the marine city plan as a state-level key scientific research project. 97 of the 150 coastal countries have started to strengthen diplomatic relations with Xin and have thrown olive branches at Future Group.</br>
</br>
Although Future Heavy Industries had not announced plans to sell marine cities, for the time being, there was bound to be a second city. While there was no such plan now, it didn't mean that there would be no plan in the future. In short, there was no reason not to have a good relationship!</br>
</br>
Affected by the expected coverage of the marine city, the share price of High Tech Freshwater once again spiked. Desalination platforms play an irreplaceable role as supporting facilities for offshore cities. If Penglai City would open up the prelude to the development of marine resources, the desalination market would expand more than two times.</br>
</br>
In the future, the marine cities built by Future Heavy Industries would naturally be equipped with their own seawater desalination plants. This would be undoubtedly true.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, as Jiang Chen's photographs taken on the top floor of the Central were uploaded to Weibo and Twitter, his fans immediately ruptured and retweeted fanatically as the photos began to spread to other social media platforms.</br>
</br>
"It's so cool! I've already decided that after Penglai opens, I must go to this city! I'll buy my ticket now!"</br>
</br>
"Sh*t! The ticket to Coro Island in March has already been sold out! Fortunately, there are still several cruise tickets..."</br>
</br>
"The feeling of living on a floating city must be awesome! Oh, damn, why didn't I buy the suite on it? It wasn't very expensive at first..."</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
While the photos were going viral, the major media also reprinted this set of photos and had various eye-catching headlines to carry out extended coverage. Exclusive news, insider information, and all sorts of leads flowed out.</br>
</br>
According to Google Trends data, in just 12 hours, the global search of the word Penglai had exploded 17.5 times! It was ranked first in search ranking.</br>
</br>
From just this stat, it was easy to see people's enthusiasm for Penglai City.</br>
</br>
From a business point of view, this was undoubtedly a successful marketing campaign. Even those who had no interest in the city being in the sea or on land would be more than happy to take out their wallets and buy a ticket to go to Coro Island...</br>
</br>
If there were any tickets left.</br>
</br>
Of course, some experts and scholars expressed concern about the establishment of Penglai City.</br>
</br>
"I recognize that the establishment of Penglai City is disruptive to the construction, shipping, and other fields. But I also have to point out that the impact on the Pacific eco-environment will also be disruptive. With our encroachment on the living space of marine life, one day we will push these human friends to a dead end. As for whether or not Future Group exploit marine resources is reasonable, I would question on behalf of Greenpeace..."</br>
</br>
"The completion of Penglai City will undoubtedly exacerbate the maritime territorial disputes, especially in the South China Sea..."</br>
</br>
"Tsunami, typhoon, submarine volcanic eruption... For a marine city, these disasters are absolutely deadly. Before Penglai proves that it has enough crisis response capabilities, I doubt the safety of living in this maritime city. "</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
However, these opposing voices were eventually submerged in the wave of one-sided public opinion. The data released by the New World Tourism Administration and Future Tourism were sufficient to support this. Many hotels in Xin were booked full in March. Even some relatively unsophisticated hostels were in short supply.</br>
</br>
As a response, InterContinental, Marriott, Hilton and other international hotel groups announced plans to add hotels in Xin in the next quarter to cope with the current short supply of rooms.</br>
</br>
How long can this tourism festival last?</br>
</br>
At least before the official opening of Penglai in March, the tourists on Pannu Island would not decrease.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen may not be able to witness the grand opening. NAC's Expeditionary Force in Yizhou Island encountered a little trouble. For the space elevator base parts waiting to be delivered, he must make a trip, personallyâ¦</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 741: The Month of Disaster</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Lunar New Year in 2018 happened to be on the day after Valentine's Day. Jiang Chen returned to the apocalypse on Valentine's Day and enjoyed a wonderful Valentine's Day with Sun Jiao. Then they spent Lunar New Year and Lunar New Year's Eve together with the girls and the others at Fishbone base.</br>
</br>
On the 17th, the second day of Lunar New Year, Jiang Chen took the airship to transport supplies to Yizhou Island at the agreed-upon time with White Beluga Station. Lin Lin also went with him. There were rumors about a helium refining plant in Taipei and a small nuclear fusion power station with a high degree of retention.</br>
</br>
Because of long-distance power transmission and the Helium-3 mining base on the moon, the nuclear fusion power plants from before the war had basically all been moved to the moon, and the only remaining large nuclear power plants were battered by the nuclear attack. Finding an intact nuclear fusion power station in the wasteland was harder than climbing the sky.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen heard about a nuclear power plant in Yizhou, he immediately became interested in it. In particular, this wasn't the time to be a picky eater, although the use of plutonium as nuclear fuel wasn't as environmentally friendly as Helium-3.</br>
</br>
The nuclear power plant didn't seem particularly attractive to the Sixth Street with crystal energy as its source of energy, but nuclear power stations would have extraordinary value for Xin and especially for new countries, whose energy sources depend on imports.</br>
</br>
Especially for Penglai, which was about to open.</br>
</br>
If cold fusion technology could be used, everything else could be discarded. The 100,000-acre power generation seaweed project that was originally scheduled to be added in the nearby sea could be canceled. The twelve large tidal power generator sets and 150 wind turbine generators could also be eliminated. Not to mention that the cost of electricity could be reduced tremendously.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Of course, this technology would be kept secret and revealed only when the space elevator was available.</br>
</br>
There were only a few nuclear experts in Wanghai, and only Lin Lin knew Jiang Chen's secret, so he took her with him. The Project Garden of Eden was almost finished, and after the last stage to be completed in the spring, the Garden of Eden, which had taken more than a year, could be declared complete.</br>
</br>
The purpose of Jiang Chen's visit was to transport the space elevator base, reclaim nuclear technology, and, incidentally, to solve the minor roadblocks encountered by the expeditionary force.</br>
</br>
It had been a month since the expeditionary force landed.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen arrived in Yizhou, Li Wang, the captain of the airship, immediately arranged a clean and comfortable room for him. He presented the intelligence and mission logs collected that month and handed over temporary command rights.</br>
</br>
Immediately after landing, Li Wang dispatched expeditionary soldiers to explore Taipei and its suburbs and build simple cement fortresses and lighthouses on the sea cliffs at the northern tip of the island of Yizhou, as well as lifts that could be used by airships.</br>
</br>
</br>
Compared to the mainland plagued by war, while Yizhou Island also had signs of war, it didn't look as tragic. Due to a lack of direct nuclear strikes, most of the high-rise buildings in the urban area were intact. The radiation from the island was mostly due to radiation dust blown from Southeast Asia.</br>
</br>
However, there were a couple of things that were almost the same as on the mainland, which were plants that grew abnormally, as well as despicable mutants and zombies.</br>
</br>
Vines and dry branches covered the high-rise buildings. On the ragged roads, there were rows of craters. In the shadows, there were wolf-like creatures with sharp claws; expeditionary soldiers called them "ghouls." Not even your bones would remain once attacked by these creatures.</br>
</br>
However, this wasn't the most terrible thing.</br>
</br>
Although these ghouls were terrible, two rounds of bullets could kill them. However, for Mud Crabs which were agile and had thick shells not inferior to steel, even rifles couldn't make people feel any safer.</br>
</br>
In particular, these Mud Crabs always moved in groups; it was simply a nightmare.</br>
</br>
And the problem facing the expeditionary forces was related to these Mud Crabs...</br>
</br>
The next day, the patrols on the exploration islands were present as usual and returned to camp before dark.</br>
</br>
Unlike usual, they brought back a native back this time.</br>
</br>
The private forces searched him and placed his bow and arrows under possession before taking him to Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
It was still snowing on the wasteland in February. Even Yizhou Island in the south still had visible traces of snow. This man was wearing an old grey jacket with some mud stains on his body. His tanned skin and shaved head gave him an honest farmer vibe, but it was his small eyes scanning the area that exposed his cunningness.</br>
</br>
"Your name is?" Jiang Chen looked at him.</br>
</br>
"Chen Guangning. I'm doing business in Taipei and along the southern coast of the mainland. If you need guidance, I will be the most suitable person." Chen Guangning smiled humbly and respectfully.</br>
</br>
Other locals might not have heard of NAC's name, but as a businessman who often traveled to southern Anhui, he was slightly acquainted with this name that arose in Wanghai. Within two years with thunderous momentum, the major forces in Wanghai City were wiped out and the survivors of all of Wanghai City and even the Suzhou-Hangzhou Province were brought under their own control.</br>
</br>
The man in front of him was the leader of NAC.</br>
</br>
If he could establish a relationship with NAC, that would definitely greatly benefit his business. So when NAC's expeditionary forces arrived at the survival camps in Taipei to find people and the other survivors all expressed their distrust, he took the initiative and went to the fortress of the expeditionary forces.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen smiled and asked directly:</br>
</br>
"I'll consider your suggestion. Before that, I have a question for you."</br>
</br>
"Please," Chen Guangning said respectfully.</br>
</br>
"Tell me more about the Month of Disaster." Jiang Chen asked the question he was most concerned about.</br>
</br>
The so-called the Month of Disaster referred to the landing of the Mud Crabs. However, the NAC Expeditionary Force knew little about this disaster that would last for a few months. The locals were very repellent to these outsiders who suddenly entered their homes. Although the two parties were in peace and occasionally traded, the dialogue was still kept to a limit.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing Jiang's question, Chen Guangning answered immediately.</br>
</br>
"Every March, the Mud Crabs that lurk in shallow water will lay eggs on the northeast bank of Yizhou. At this time, the survivors of Taipei will hide in the air defense shelter in central Taipei and wait until the Mud Crabs leave before coming out. There are similar practices in other regions. The sheer number of Mud Crabs isn't something humanly forces can fight against, so it's called the Month of Disaster."</br>
</br>
As powerful scavengers, these Mud Crabs were particularly fond of survivor-inhabited areas. Whenever they arrived, they would invade the territory just like locusts, looting the survivors while leaving behind a large pile of slimy follicles.</br>
</br>
Clearing these follicles was very dangerous. One mishap would lead to the hatching and release of small Mud Crabs. Although they weren't as frightening as mature Mud Crabs, small Mud Crabs could still cause serious casualties to survivors.</br>
</br>
"When does the Month of Disaster end?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Generally speaking, by summer solstice," Chen Guangning replied.</br>
</br>
[Summer Solstice?]</br>
</br>
It would be more than three months, and the materials for the first batch of space elevator bases were about to be delivered. Jiang Chen couldn't wait for such a long time. On the other hand, the exploration of nuclear power plants would also have to be delayed due to the impact of the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
If possible, he wanted to resolve the two issues as soon as possible.</br>
</br>
Frowning slightly, Jiang Chen asked again.</br>
</br>
"What solutions do you have for these Mud Crabs?"</br>
</br>
Chen Guangning smiled helplessly.</br>
</br>
"If I have a solution, I would've been the leader of these survivors."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 742: Constructing Line of Defense</br>
</div></br>
</br>
"The best way to deal with the Month of Disaster is to wait it out. It's better to clean up the eggs of the Mud Crabs than to fight against the Mud Crabs. There are tens of thousands of Mud Crabs around and even tanks can't do anything. Since you flew in on an airship, get on the airship at the beginning of March or just wait until the summer solstice comes again."</br>
</br>
"We need to do something on the island; we can't wait for that long." Jiang Chen paused then asked, "What about you? What's your plan for the Month of Disaster?"</br>
</br>
"My original plan was to go where survivors live in the province of Minnan until the summer solstice, but my ship is out of shape this year. If there's nobody willing to give me a ride, I might choose to go to Taipei Fallout Shelter No. 79. Only 50 crystals are needed to stay until the summer solstice; the price is relatively fair," Chen Guangning replied.</br>
</br>
"Okay Mr. Chen, we happen to need a guide. Are you interested in staying with us?" Jiang Chen asked with a smile.</br>
</br>
Upon hearing this invitation from Jiang Chen, Chen Guangning was rejoiced and immediately said, "I am very interested. If there's anything I can do, I'm more than happy to help!"</br>
</br>
"Just be a good guide; there is nothing more you need to do. Go out and talk to the guards. They will arrange a place for you. I will pay you 10 crystals a day. If you have nothing else to add, you can go now."</br>
</br>
"Thank you, General!"</br>
</br>
Chen Guangning changed the manner he addressed Jiang Chen immediately, but Jiang Chen himself wasn't very strict with formalities.</br>
</br>
"Go ahead."</br>
</br>
After Chen Guangning left, Jiang Chen thought for a moment, tilted his head slightly and looked at Wang Li, who was standing by his side.</br>
</br>
"What do you think?"</br>
</br>
"According to the intelligence collected by our reconnaissance team, we can use cement to build defence lines on the northern Desperate Beach and block the Mud Crabs in shallow water," said Li Wang.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
This was indeed a viable plan. The only flaw was that if they wanted to build a line of defense that enclosed the entire Desperate Beach, they would need an enormous amount of cement and ammunition. Sand could be sourced locally, and the graphene tubes used as skeletons and cement could be transported by supply airships. The only troublesome aspect was that it was February 18, and there was less than a week until the arrival of the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
There wasn't much time left for the expeditionary forces.</br>
</br>
"The ammunition and cement needed will be delivered as soon as possible. Immediately start construction and do everything possible to build the line of defense before the Month of Disaster."</br>
</br>
"Yes!" Li Wangli saluted and headed out.</br>
</br>
After Li Wang departed, Jiang Chen activated his watch and entered the communication channel and channel code left by the Beluga Whale Submarine Inspection Station. He hosted a holographic video conference with them.</br>
</br>
</br>
Their contact for him was still Wu Yue. Judging by the background behind him, he was probably on a warship.</br>
</br>
After contact was established, Jiang Chen was direct.</br>
</br>
"Can the sonar on your ship drive away Mud Crabs?"</br>
</br>
Wu Yue seemed to anticipate Jiang Chen would ask this question, but he still shook his head regretfully.</br>
</br>
"Unfortunately, our sonar can't do this. It's a real headache to run into Mud Crabs in the shallow sea - they'll try to climb onto the boat... Do you want to delay the delivery of space elevator parts?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"Go with the originally planned date. You are responsible for sending our transport vessels to the shallow seas. I'll try to resolve the problem of the Mud Crabs."</br>
</br>
"As you wish." Wu Yue bowed slightly.</br>
</br>
Desperate Beach was located on the northernmost tip of Yizhou and lowest point in the northern part of the island.</br>
</br>
Before the war, there used to be a water park with a total area of several thousand acres. It stretched from the beach along the shallow sea to the edge of the deep ocean. However, now it had been bombed to ruins, and a freighter's ruin was left on the beach.</br>
</br>
Staggered steel skeletons and debris formed a wetland-like environment within the shallow beach. The uncontrolled growth of algae and seaweed in the wet shadows was a paradise for scavengers and a breeding ground for mutated organisms.</br>
</br>
Even experienced adventurers didn't dare to enter this dangerous territory. Even if people had power armor on, it would still be difficult to gain an advantage against sharp Mud Crab claws and teeth, not to mention the other mutants hiding in the shallow seas. With the complex terrain, the means of attack were unpredictable.</br>
</br>
This was why this place was known as Desperate Beach - it made everyone who entered this place desperate.</br>
</br>
Li Wang's execution efficiency was high. The day he received the order, he started construction of the defense line. One hundred engineering robots drove around Desperate Beach and laid the foundation for the walls. At the same time, the local survivors employed by the Expeditionary Force worked at the frontlines, earning 5 crystals per day.</br>
</br>
Not all people had the money to live in a fallout shelter, not to mention the limited capacity of the fallout shelters. When the Month of Disaster arrived, most people still chose to hide in the temporary bunkers they made themselves and anxiously live in terror with their family for months.</br>
</br>
In the beginning, the arrival of the expeditionary forces made them feel wary. After all, these people didn't seem to be lawful at all, judging from their excellent armed forces, but when these survivors saw them starting to build fortifications along Desperate Beach, they changed their minds completely.</br>
</br>
Even if they didn't think these people could block the tens of thousands of Mud Crabs that came ashore to lay eggs, they still had a faint hope in their hearts.</br>
</br>
In the unlikely event that these people would repel the Mud Crabs on Desperate Beach, the Month of Disaster that had plagued the island for more than a decade would be completely eradicated. Hopefully, if the Mud Crabs were beaten up by the NAC and failed to lay eggs in Yizhou, they might be forced to change their living habits in the coming year and start migrating to other places.</br>
</br>
As a result, there would be one less season these survivors had to suffer through.</br>
</br>
Therefore, when the expeditionary forces recruited people from survival camps near Taipei, the survivors were also very cooperative or at least didn't cause any trouble.</br>
</br>
On the other hand, Jiang Chen had already made contact with Fishbone Base and had drawn 1,000 troops from the Third Corps into the ranks of the expeditionary forces.</br>
</br>
At present, there were only five hundred expeditionary soldiers stationed in Taipei. It would obviously be unrealistic to fill a battle line several kilometers long with so few people. If they couldn't recruit many soldiers from the locals, they had to draw forces from Wanghai as reinforcements.</br>
</br>
According to the plan proposed by the Expeditionary Army's engineering soldiers, the battlefield would have a total length of 5.1 kilometers with 52 five-meter-high defense towers first built along the edge of the battlefield then three-meter tall and half-a-meter wide cement walls would connect the towers. Sandbags would be placed behind the cement walls, and trenches and stakes would be placed in front of the cement walls to prevent Mud Crabs from entering.</br>
</br>
A total of more than 1,400 laborers would be involved in the building of the defense line. With the assistance of construction robots, this defense line should be completed without any problems.</br>
</br>
With the arrival of a new batch of supplies, heavy machine guns were put on the wall, and orange-yellow ammo chains filled the armory, dazzling like gold. Missiles were placed in the open space of the expeditionary fortress. The artillery skilfully installed launchers and completed the deployment of the "Fireball-1" system.</br>
</br>
When the survivors working at the frontlines saw this scene, that immediately eliminated their last remaining doubts and worked even harder.</br>
</br>
With such powerful arms, perhaps these people could really do it...</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 743: The Mole Agency</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Unfortunately, on the 25th, there was a storm in Taipei.</br>
</br>
Heavy rain made sand and soil into mud, and several construction robots stalled as the rain poured into the unfilled foundation. Because the construction conditions were too crude, the project didn't progress and it even got to the point where it had to be stopped...</br>
</br>
"If this rain continues, we have to fight with the Mud Crabs on the beach." Standing on the lookout tower of the expeditionary fortress, looking at the construction site on Desperate Beach, Li Wang furrowed his eyebrowsâ¦</br>
</br>
No one expected a downpour.</br>
</br>
At the time of the Water Plant in Hongcheng, Jiang Chen recalled some memories about the troublesome Mud Crabs. Their shells were impenetrable by bullets, but pliers could crush steel and get to that delicious crab roe...</br>
</br>
However, listening to what Chen Guangning said, Mud Crabs were also divided into river crabs and sea crabs. Crabs that lived in the marine environment has a deeper shell color, larger body size, and more aggressive habits. Any creature smaller than its size would become its prey.</br>
</br>
Without the protection of the wall, it would be unrealistic to fight these monsters out in the open.</br>
</br>
Heavy rain slowed down the progress of the project and Jiang Chen had no better solutions. If there were no chances at winning, he would have to order the withdrawal and wait until the summer solstice to transport the space elevator. Jiang Chen couldn't let his soldiers die while trying to accomplish an impossible task.</br>
</br>
After taking a deep breath, Jiang Chen said:</br>
</br>
"If 80% of the project isn't completed by the first of March, then we will withdraw our people from the front lines, retreat to the fortress, and withdraw in batches."</br>
</br>
"What about those survivors?" asked Li Wang.</br>
</br>
"You don't need to ask about them."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen looked at him and left the tower.</br>
</br>
If the expeditionary forces evacuated, the fate of these survivors would be obvious.</br>
</br>
However, even if the survivors had no time to hide and would suffer tragic deaths, he would still make this choice.</br>
</br>
After all, over the lives of these strangers, he was responsible for the lives of his own people.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
The rain smashed onto the concrete pavement, and Taipei's sky was shrouded in a dense haze. The fear brought about by the Month of Disaster lingered in the hearts of every survivor in Yizhou like a ghost.</br>
</br>
Entering the city along the north, through two streets and a station, there was a survival camp that looked almost like a ghetto. The town had no name and was named as town 79 because of the fallout shelter. People used bricks and billboards to build houses and crowded together to try to extract meager warmth from the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
However, this warmth was so thin at the onset of danger.</br>
</br>
The people who had enough crystals were already hiding inside the fallout shelter and those who did not could only watch the numb guards with pleading gazes. Some people would survive while others would only survive on luck. Even the island that stood independent of the world wouldn't escape this principle that was universal in the apocalypse.</br>
</br>
</br>
The guards at the entrance leaned against the shelter with their dirty assault rifles beside them. Their eyes shifted in slight annoyance.</br>
</br>
For the pedestrians, they just glanced at them in a hurry and were too lazy to ask in detail. The lack of resources on the island and the closed economy meant there were almost no visible raiders in Yizhou, but some survivors were occasionally part-time bandits.</br>
</br>
As they inherited the arsenal of Fallout Shelter No. 79, the township of 79 had 500 fully armed soldiers. They could be regarded as the largest survivor force in Taipei; no bandits would dare to cause trouble in this area.</br>
</br>
In heavy rain, a group of people dressed in raincoats headed to the town. Their raincoat hoods concealed the three men's faces and they looked suspicious. However, the guards glanced at the trio and looked away.</br>
</br>
After they passed through the town's gate smoothly, Lin Lin shrunk her arms into the raincoat a bit more and murmured:</br>
</br>
"Can't these dirty guys clean up their own house?"</br>
</br>
"There's no use in making it look nice. When the Month of Disaster is over, the only thing left in perfect condition will be the Mud Crab eggs." Chen Guangning fully immersed himself in his role as a guide as he explained to Lin Lin and Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The scavengers were very sensitive to the smell of humans. When the Month of Disaster arrive, the Mud Crabs would spontaneously move closer to human settlements.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen examined the buildings around him and didn't comment too much on the living conditions of the survivors. Judging by the size, the town should be able to accommodate five or six thousand people. At the moment, however, there were no people to be seen on the crooked streets. As Chen Guangning said, most people had already fled to the fallout shelter or left town by this time.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen came to Town No. 79 this time to investigate the whereabouts of the nuclear power plant and to examine the appearance of this town on the island. Li Wang opposed Jiang Chen acting alone at first, but Jiang Chen insisted on doing so.</br>
</br>
With too many people next to him, it wouldn't be convenient for him to move nuclear devices to the modern world.</br>
</br>
As for whether Chen Guangning was reliable, that was an unnecessary concern.</br>
</br>
Whether people had intentions of lying or not, the slavery chip would not lie.</br>
</br>
The three of them turned into two alleys and arrived at the door of a bar. Chen Guangning walked to a door covered in moss, reached out and gently knocked three times. It didn't take long before the door opened.</br>
</br>
Under the shadows, a blank expression appeared behind the door. It was a common face that couldn't be distinguished in a crowd. What was on this face left a deep impression; it was probably his sharp eyes.</br>
</br>
When he saw Chen Guangning, he was obviously surprised.</br>
</br>
"Old Chen?" His eyes lingered on Chen Guangning for a moment then he looked at the two people behind him. The man grinned and smiled. "You brought guests over?"</br>
</br>
Feeling uncomfortable by the gaze, Lin Lin moved closer to Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen gently squeezed her hand and motioned her not to be nervous.</br>
</br>
"Yes, I brought business for you, five days before the Month of Disaster. Do you think you can give me a discount price?" Chen Guangning asked.</br>
</br>
"You know, I always have a set price." Then, the man turned and walked into the dark house. "Welcome to my office. If the price is right, there's nothing on the island I can't do. I guarantee with my credibility."</br>
</br>
Looking inside, Jiang Chen examined the layout of the house. His initial impression was that it was dark and damp. His second thought was: Could this place really be used for human habitation?</br>
</br>
"Feel free to sit anywhere. I don't provide tea here."Â The man grinned and looked straight at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
His instincts told him he was the hirer.</br>
</br>
Without taking off his raincoat, Jiang Chen sat on an old couch casually and asked:</br>
</br>
"How should I address you?"</br>
</br>
"You can call me Mole," Mole said with a smile.</br>
</br>
From his expression, he didn't seem to care that Jiang Chen made his sofa wet.</br>
</br>
"I need you to help me find a place. Can you do it?"</br>
</br>
"That's easy, as long as you can afford it."</br>
</br>
[Afford it?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen laughed. No one had asked him such a funny question in a long time.</br>
</br>
Without asking for a specific price, he paused and said:</br>
</br>
"Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant - I want you to help me find the specific location for it, and the password to get admin control. Can you do it?"</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
"Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant?" Mole's eyes narrowed.</br>
</br>
"Is there a problem?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Of course not." Upon hiring his employer's problems, Mole immediately shook his head and smiled slyly. "Respecting the privacy of customers is the foundation of our industry, but I have to remind you that it isn't an interesting place."</br>
</br>
Mole's statement made Jiang Chen grin.</br>
</br>
"What's there?"</br>
</br>
"Rumors, just rumors." He paused for a moment. Mole built enough suspense and pointed up with one finger. "10 crystals."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyebrows furrowed and Chen Guangning stood up immediately while slamming on the table.</br>
</br>
"You're ripping him offâ"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised his hand and stopped Chen Guangning, who was about to argue. He threw out a thumb-sized crystal and tossed it on the table. The pupils of Mole immediately dilated then contracted. He didn't see where the crystal came from.</br>
</br>
Looking at Jiang Chen's eyes again, he couldn't help but feel cautious.</br>
</br>
"Thank you, boss." With a sly laugh, Mole took his hands out from his sleeve and picked up the dark green crystal on the table.</br>
</br>
Being in a shady business for so long, he didn't need a detector. As soon as he rubbed the crystal, he could estimate the energy inside the crystal.</br>
</br>
Since he received payment, it was natural to do business. The mole turned and walked into the darkened apartment. It didn't take long before he took out a map that looked quite similar to a tourist brochure.</br>
</br>
Spreading the map on the tabletop, his withered fingers crossed several streets along the main road in the center of the city, eventually stopping in the middle of the forest between Taipei and the Northern Expeditionary Fortress. He tapped on a spot that read Datun Mountain.</br>
</br>
"It's here."</br>
</br>
"Datun Natural Park?" Jiang Chen gently raised his eyebrows and looked at the mole.</br>
</br>
After reading the mistrust in Jiang Chen's eyes, Mole smiled. He wrinkles on his face squeezed together. "I know you may have questions such as how a natural park and nuclear power plant is linked. You can think about why Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant survived the nuclear war."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen leaned on the couch and glanced out the window at the rain. With no indication of stopping,Â he casually said:</br>
</br>
"I didn't spend this much time with you to play riddles. You might as well tell me directly."</br>
</br>
The mole shrugged his shoulders and stopped being indirect. He met his hirer's request.</br>
</br>
"The Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant is equipped with a plutonium-refining plant and about 100 tons of solid-state plutonium used as a strategic reserve for PAC, and their specific coordinates are kept as confidential Class A. It's precisely because of this that the brand new nuclear power plant survived NATO's nuclear missiles, but for me, this isn't a secret. The administrator password is written on the back of this map, and the entrance is at Datun Natural Park."</br>
</br>
</br>
"You haven't told me what's there," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"I almost forgot." The mole slapped his head and smiled. Then he said, "Hundreds of tons of plutonium and an undamaged nuclear power plant - it's not just you guys who paid attention to these things. Two years ago, the ruler of this town also got the idea to restart Clearwater. After all, it was hundreds of tons of plutonium. It would be enough to last this town hundreds of years. However, the result was that none of the 100 people who went ended up coming back."</br>
</br>
While Mole explained, he smile was sly, and his smile was full of indescribable cruelty.</br>
</br>
"What exactly is there?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"Perhaps Mud Crabs, perhaps a guardian machine used at the nuclear power station, maybe something else. No one came back alive, nor did anyone collect the bodies of those unlucky bastards. If you're curious, you might as well ask the mayor of Town No. 79, but he's probably already hiding in the fallout shelter," said the mole.</br>
</br>
Mole had already provided all the information he had.</br>
</br>
Putting the map in his pocket, Jiang Chen stood up from the couch.</br>
</br>
But before leaving, he looked at the mole and asked one last question.</br>
</br>
"My last question is how do you know all of this?"</br>
</br>
"Me?" Mole laughed. "Inquiring about privacy isn't a good habit."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen raised an eyebrow and said with a smile:</br>
</br>
"As long as the price is right - that's what you said."</br>
</br>
Mole still held up a finger.</br>
</br>
"Ten crystals?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"One hundred," Mole said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
As soon as his voice faded, a baby fist-sized crystal was thrown on the table. Mole's pupils contracted. This time, he still didn't notice Jiang Chen's movements, but he wasn't too bothered anymore. All his attention was captured by that crystal.</br>
</br>
The dark green sheen was like a pearl in a darkened room; even Chen Guangning, who was standing by the side, gulped.</br>
</br>
Greed gradually faded from his pupils, and the mole shifted his gaze back without reaching for the crystal. Instead, he focused on Jiang Chen. His intention had been to make the problematic employer back off, but he didn't expect that the rich employer would really offer up one hundred crystals.</br>
</br>
He now knew why Chen Guangning didn't hide in the fallout shelter or board the ship but worked for the man in the raincoat instead. One hundred crystals thrown like a rock without the blink of an eye - this man definitely wasn't just rich.</br>
</br>
"What's the matter? Are you talking about 100 blood crystals?" As his fingers tapped on the sofa armrests, Jiang Chen grinned.</br>
</br>
Mole shook his head and remained silent for a long time before slowly opening his mouth.</br>
</br>
"This isn't a secret for a former PAC Class A intelligence personnel."</br>
</br>
Pan Asia Cooperation Class A intelligence personnel? Jiang Chen's pupil enlarged slightly, intrigued by his response.</br>
</br>
[If he was a PAC intelligence personnel, then Yizhou Island has no secrets for him.]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took a look at Chen Guangning and read similar surprise from his pupils from the remaining scattered light. Obviously, he didn't associate "Mole" with the former intelligence personnel - he just used him as a simple intelligence dealer.</br>
</br>
"Then, former Pan-Asian Cooperation intelligence personnel, are you interested in working for me?" Jiang Chen said with a smile.</br>
</br>
Mole glanced at Jiang Chen and didn't immediately answer, but he said cautiously.</br>
</br>
"I will consider it."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen wasn't too surprised at Mole's answer. NAC might not be better-known than the distant Northern Alliance Area to the local people living on Yizhou, Chen Guangning aside.</br>
</br>
It would be good for NAC if the former regime's intelligence personnel worked for him. But if not, there would be no loss.</br>
</br>
So Jiang Chen also just smiled and said casually:</br>
</br>
"If you agree, you can come to Expedition Fortress to see me."</br>
</br>
Leaving the mole with this sentence, Jiang Chen left this dark room with Chen Guangning and Lin Lin, who had long wanted to leave.</br>
</br>
Standing in the doorway of the broken shack, Mole watched the three people disappearing in the rainy alley. It wasn't until long after they left that he turned around and went into the dark house.</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
The construction speed had been squeezed to the limit. However, whether at least 80% of the project could be completed by March was still unknown. In particular, the rain didn't show any signs of stopping, which cast a shadow over this unstarted battle.</br>
</br>
Fifty construction robots had just walked down the production line of the factory at Sixth Street and were dispatched to Yizhou Island by the airship as an emergency. More expeditionary soldiers and employed survivors were also assigned to the project.</br>
</br>
Li Wang personally stood at the front lines and supervised the construction. Although he knew that this was more for psychological comfort than any practical purpose, he still did it.</br>
</br>
At that point, a deputy officer came to his side.</br>
</br>
"There are survivors in the west construction sector protesting. They are demanding salary payment."</br>
</br>
Li Wang didn't move his eyes and said emotionlessly:</br>
</br>
"In the beginning, we said the salary would be paid after completion."</br>
</br>
The deputy officer hesitated but still truthfully reported.</br>
</br>
"They are afraid that the project will never be completed."</br>
</br>
After a long silence, he said:</br>
</br>
"Salary will be paid out on March 2. I don't care what method you use to suppress their attitude."</br>
</br>
"Roger!" The deputy officer saluted.</br>
</br>
Li Wang clearly knew about how they absolutely could not pay the workers' salaries. As for why, it was not because the NAC lacked the funds, but it was because once the money had been paid out, these people would not stay here to work. Instead, they would take the crystals and go hide in the fallout shelter.</br>
</br>
Their pay had to wait until March 2nd, after the door of Fallout Shelter 79 was closed...</br>
</br>
At the moment, inside Fallout Shelter 79.</br>
</br>
A man dressed in a PAC military uniform was standing in the doorway, staring at the feeble and weak survivors lining up to enter the fallout shelter with his eyes narrowed. He enjoyed the feeling of watchingÂ poor people bowing their heads, praying for his protection, and handing him their meager crystals with both hands.</br>
</br>
Yuan Yi, mayor of Town No. 79, was also the director of Fallout Shelter 79. Constrained by the understanding of the apocalypse, in the "history of rises and falls" of many fallout shelters, very few blueskins managed to conquer the chaotic wasteland "refugees" and succeed in establishing stable order.</br>
</br>
Town No. 79 was undoubtedly an exception.</br>
</br>
Long before opening the door, the director of the fallout shelter completed the transformation from democracy to totalitarianism. With sufficient reserves of arms, almost all men in the group of 2,000 were enlisted as soldiers.</br>
</br>
When the fallout shelter opened, his attitude toward these wasteland refugees wasn't to aid them - he wanted to conquer them.</br>
</br>
Obviously, he succeeded.</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether or not the means were extreme, Fallout Shelter 79 successfully survived the first year of its opening and had existed until now.</br>
</br>
</br>
While Yuan Yi was admiring the expressions of those survivors, his men came over and saluted in a PAC gesture and spoke.</br>
</br>
"Director, there's still has no sign of evacuation of the NAC Expeditionary Force from Desperate Beach."</br>
</br>
After hearing this news, Yuan Yi narrowed his eyes slightly.</br>
</br>
Every Month of Disaster, he could harvest tens of thousands of crystals from these poor worms who came to seek refuge. The size of Town No. 79 developed to today's scale was based on people's fear of the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
Unlike most survivors, he was unwilling for this disaster to disappear as a vested person in the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
However, at the moment, he couldn't blatantly act.</br>
</br>
The strength demonstrated by NAC made him deeply wary. Disregarding everything aside from the steel airship, he knew very well that the strength on both sides wasn't at the same level.</br>
</br>
Yuan Yi thought with his arms folded for a moment before a sinister smile suddenly appeared.</br>
</br>
"Let the survivors, who are lurking in the labor forces, make preparations. Before February 28, call for a strike in the name of demanding payment."</br>
</br>
The subordinate's eyes lit up and he immediately said:</br>
</br>
"The director is brilliant!"</br>
</br>
Yuan Yi waved his hand and laughed.</br>
</br>
"Make the order for me. If this can be done, there will be great benefits."</br>
</br>
"Yes!"</br>
</br>
The subordinate nodded but didn't leave immediately.</br>
</br>
"Why aren't you leaving?" Yuan Yi asked, frowning.</br>
</br>
"There's one more thing to report." The man lowered his head as he spoke.</br>
</br>
"What's wrong?"</br>
</br>
"The Datun Nature Park scout discovered someone attempting to enter the park..."</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Today was the 26th, only two days away from the start of the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
The heavy rain in Yizhou showed signs of easing, but the dark clouds hovering above them made the weather turn into continuous drips.</br>
</br>
Muddy water was washed off the road, and due to the lack of maintenance, the cracked country road became a dirt road. Two centimeters of mud later, the concrete road underneath could be seen.</br>
</br>
In raincoats, three people stood at the entrance of Datun Natural Park.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen took off his hood and scanned everything in a circle. The dark forests on both sides were disturbing, but after turning on the radio life detection device, they didn't catch any traces of mutant activities. From this point of view, this forest couldn't be safer.</br>
</br>
However, it was abnormal.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned slightly.</br>
</br>
"It's not just humans who choose to seek refuge in the Month of Disaster. Many mutants will also hide in the caves or rubble of the buildings and avoid the crabs that will eat everything." Seeing the confusion in Jiang Chen's eyes, Chen Guangning explained to him.</br>
</br>
"So that's the case." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"I'm saying... Do we really have to go up?" Looking at the road leading to Datun Natural Park, Lin Lin's face was filled with intimidation.</br>
</br>
Seeing her frightened appearance, Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
This little girl was a digitalized human, but she was even more timid than humans.</br>
</br>
Chen Guangning hesitated but also offered his perspective, "I have the same point of view as Miss Lin. The mole said there may be something bad here, so it's better for us to be cautious. In addition, do we really not need the assistance of the expeditionary forces? More than 100 people sent by Fallout Shelter 79 were lost here. We have only three people. What's more..."</br>
</br>
[Not to mention you are still NAC's general.]</br>
</br>
How could he transport nuclear devices and materials with such a large number of people? As for the danger, Jiang Chen didn't worry too much. As long as he was wearing power armor, there was no possibility of being "killed instantly." No matter what kind of danger he was in, he could quickly disengage.</br>
</br>
What's more, the pile of technology hidden in the storage dimension could freely be used, and he would possess the fighting power equivalent to one hundred people.</br>
</br>
"You can wait here. And you, Lin Lin, wait until you see my signal."</br>
</br>
Leaving these words, Jiang Chen, disregarding how Chen Guangning and Lin Ling would react, revealed a Ripper Assault Rifle under his raincoat and walked alone onto the misty mountain road.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 746: Ghostly</br>
</div></br>
</br>
The more he moved forward, the denser the fog. When he reached the mountainside, the visibility was less than two meters.</br>
</br>
Stepping into the uphill muddy road, Jiang Chen threw away his raincoat and exposed the black kinetic skeleton concealed beneath it.</br>
</br>
With his tactical helmet wielded, a light blue light spread across the screen, and everything in his field of vision gradually became clear. Although there was a slight difference from daylight, it was not much of hindrance . Jiang Chen opened the safety and loaded the rifle, his movement was much more catuious.</br>
</br>
Everything here was strange.</br>
</br>
Logically speaking, it was difficult for rain and fog to appear at the same time, especially in heavy rain.</br>
</br>
Through the dense and heavy fog, Jiang Chen arrived at the end of the road. It was a resort, but from the size, it wouldn't be wrong to say it was a small town. The roadside sign dangled and rust stained its emerald green surface.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen could still catch a glimpse of the remaining white paint.</br>
</br>
Terminal Station: Datun Resort</br>
</br>
"Is it here?"</br>
</br>
Murmuring, Jiang Chen opened the holographic map and confirmed the coordinates. The map Mole gave him had been scanned into an electronic file, including the password for entering the underground nuclear power station.</br>
</br>
Directly in front of him, the misty resort looked terrifying, just like a ghostly town in typical horror films.</br>
</br>
Two words suddenly popped into Jiang Chen's head.</br>
</br>
[Silent Hill?]</br>
</br>
A closer look made him realize it was indeed similar, but that was all.</br>
</br>
As a determined "non-spiritual warrior", Jiang Chen did not believe in ghosts and demons from a very young age. Despite the clearly abnormal town gave him an ominous feeling, he still moved forward along the dirt path.</br>
</br>
But at that moment, he suddenly felt like he was being watched.</br>
</br>
He immediately turned back and lifted the muzzle, but there was nothing but thick mist.</br>
</br>
"An illusion?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen whispered, slowly lowering the rifle.</br>
</br>
The resort's billboards had broken down on the side of the road, and the windows were all pitch black. If it was not for the life signal detection device revealing that no one is there, he would not have dared to step onto this path.</br>
</br>
Without investigating the suspicious houses, Jiang Chen directly went to an abandoned hospital, following the path on the map.</br>
</br>
As he crossed the courtyard, he noticed there were many luxury cars parked in the parking lot.</br>
</br>
It was evident that this resort in the natural park was very popular among the rich before the war.</br>
</br>
According to the information given to him by Mole, the entrance to the nuclear power plant was here.</br>
</br>
At the hospital's main building entrance, he hesitated for a moment before he took out the drone terminal from the storage dimension, then deployed it at the door of the hospital. From the time he entered the resort until now, he did not even see a trace of danger, but this strange atmosphere made him unusually cautious.</br>
</br>
</br>
A dozen Hummingbird drones flew out of the drone terminal and explored the corners of the hospital. The orange light in the fog turned into a beige glow. Although it still was not pleasing to the eye, it was much better than the previous darkness.</br>
</br>
Holding a rifle and stepping through the door of the hospital, accompanied by his drones, Jiang Chen's eyes carefully examined every corner.</br>
</br>
The hall was very messy, the chairs were sideways on the ground, and documents were scattered everywhere. However, in a scene typical on the wasteland, Jiang Chen still found a hint of unusualness.</br>
</br>
It was too clean. He did not even see any corpses!</br>
</br>
It was abnormal.</br>
</br>
The outbreak of the war was very sudden. If the coast of Yizhou Island, which was on the front lines, had not been specifically targeted by NATO's missiles, the locals certainly would not have much time to evacuate. And he suddenly remembered there were many cars parked in the hospital garage.</br>
</br>
This also indirectly showed that when the war happened, people did not leave the hospital at all.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen frowned at the thought.</br>
</br>
[Where did they go?]</br>
</br>
Passing through a dark corridor, the damp air was mixed with a moldy smell. After opening the air filter on the tactical helmet, his nose felt slightly better.</br>
</br>
The entrance to the nuclear power plant was in the basement.</br>
</br>
However, as Jiang Chen's target drew closer, his heart became even tenser. So far, he had not encountered any so-called danger. Of course, he would not optimistically think there are no differences between today and five years ago. If that was the case, why did the people from Fallout Shelter 79 never return?</br>
</br>
Nothing was more disturbing than the unknown.</br>
</br>
He pushed the door of the basement open and threw in a flare, raised his rifle, dashed through the door, and cautiously pointed at his surroundings.</br>
</br>
The old medical equipment was cluttered and stacked in the corner of the basement. It looked like no one had been there for a long time.</br>
</br>
After lowering the muzzle slightly, Jiang Chen opened the holographic map and confirmed the specific location of the entrance to the refuge. He then carefully approached the left wall of the basement, reached for the tiles above the floor and stopped at the seventh tile on the left. He pressed it down.</br>
</br>
As Mole indicated on the back of the map, there was a hidden device on the back of the tile.</br>
</br>
A pale orange holographic screen emerged from the wall and stopped in front of Jiang Chen. After he entered the password, the floor gently shook and the stack of medical devices buzzed to form a narrow trail.</br>
</br>
Did he finally find it?</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen felt relieved and tapped on his wristwatch, ready to bring Lin Lin up the mountain. Transporting nuclear power facilities would require Lin Lin, an expert in this field, to guide him. Tampering with the equipment inside could create special situations, which was why he brought her to Yizhou.</br>
</br>
The holographic screen unfolded, but at that moment, his fingers were fixed in the air.</br>
</br>
On the wall, he saw a shadow.</br>
</br>
An axe was raised...</br>
</br>
Without the slightest hesitation, Jiang Chen slammed his body to the side and rolled on the ground while taking out a nitrogen shield and laser pistol from the storage dimension.</br>
</br>
The short axe smashed into the wall and shattered the tiles.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's pupils contracted.</br>
</br>
The figure was as hazy as smoke. The only thing truly visible was the axe.</br>
</br>
"Buzz-"</br>
</br>
The sound of an electric current entered his ear, Without landing the hit, the figure moved rapidly and flung the short axe in his hand at Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
The high-pressure air current expanded instantly to push the axe aside. At the same time, faint blue laser bullets burst out, displaying the short-range firepower advantage of laser pistols! Laser rain instantly covered the dark shadows and all the spaces it could dodge.</br>
</br>
The bullets hit the target at least ten times.</br>
</br>
The shadow howled in pain but still didn't lose its mobility.</br>
</br>
Taking advantage of the short gap between bullets, it leaped back. The smoke-like figure immediately merged into the fog in the corridor.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen chased it out. At the same time, the Hummingbird drones followed suit.</br>
</br>
However, when he stood in the hallway and turned on the life signal detection device, he unexpectedly discovered something odd...</br>
</br>
Light blue ripples swept across the screen and there was only blankness on the screen. There was no trace of mutants or human activity at all...</br>
</br>
There was a faint chill in his heart and Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
What kind of thing was that dark shadow?</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

</div>
<div class="caption">Chapter 747: Clearwater Nuclear Power Plan</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Leaning against the wall of the elevator, Jiang Chen quietly waited to descend to the bottom.</br>
</br>
The backup power system was still in operation, and that elevator might be the only electrical system in the resort that was still operational. The "black shadow" he previously saw in the basement still lingered in his mind.</br>
</br>
He didn't callÂ Lin Lin to come up the mountain, but he chose to enter the nuclear power plant to first explore the area. The black shadow's attack was simply impossible to counter. Even the life detection device could not find its trace of it. Jiang Chen really didn't have the confidence to take care of a person who had no fighting power while protecting himself.</br>
</br>
Since it could be wounded by laser bullets, he could already rule out ghosts and other things. However, Jiang Chen ultimately still didn't believe that ghosts and demons existed in the world, but he still couldn't understand what he saw.</br>
</br>
"Dingâ"</br>
</br>
His thoughts were interrupted by the bell of the elevator. Jiang Chen stood still and raised the rifle in his hand.</br>
</br>
The elevator slowly opened.</br>
</br>
However, to his surprise, this nuclear power plant wasn't empty.</br>
</br>
"This is the Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant. Put down your weapon, buddy."</br>
</br>
After the elevator opened, six riflemen stood in the doorway and their muzzles pointed straight at him. Jiang Chen responded immediately and aimed his rifle. Although a gun looked laughable compared to six guns, there were ten Hummingbird drones behind him.</br>
</br>
"Give me a reason to put down my weapon." Jiang Chen didn't have any intentions of putting his weapon down.</br>
</br>
The signal underground was poor, and the drone terminal deployed on the ground couldn't get in touch with the underground drone. However, there were drone backpacks that could be used as a temporary terminal for drones.</br>
</br>
Looking at the ten squeaky drones, Zhao Tianyu, who stood in front of Jiang Chen, felt a chill down his spine. Disregarding how many bullets the kinetic skeleton would be able to resist, he didn't know how to deal with the drones.</br>
</br>
"Okay... You can hold your weapon, but if you're not looking for trouble, please state your intentions."</br>
</br>
After weighing the pros and cons, Zhao Tianyu made a compromise. After all, being able to come here alive meant he wasn't a simple character.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen's eyes focused on their hands for a moment.</br>
</br>
They were all PK2000s, although they looked old. Since they were using this type of PAC automatic rifle, commonly found in fallout shelters or pre-war military facilities, Jiang Chen immediately knew their identities. It seemed that what Mole said wasn't necessarily completely true; the one hundred plus people who entered the resort to explore five years ago hadn't all died.</br>
</br>
At least, the six people standing in front of him hadn't died.</br>
</br>
"I'm a mercenary and I'm employed by the director of Fallout Shelter 079 and came to investigate your... cause of death. I just didn't expect that you are all still alive." To gain their trust, Jiang Chen made up a lie.</br>
</br>
</br>
The six people looked at each other before a bitter smile formed on their faces.</br>
</br>
"Still alive? About twenty are left."</br>
</br>
Zhao Tianyu lowered his rifle and the five subordinates who stood next to him also followed suit. Since their visitor was friendly, there was no point in aiming their guns at each other. Jiang Chen also did the same, however, he didn't retract the drones he was with.</br>
</br>
"So...may I come in?" Jiang Chen pointed to the outside of the elevator.</br>
</br>
"Of course, we can go to our station. Please come with me." Zhao Tianyu welcomed him.</br>
</br>
After the elevator was a hall with the characters "Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant." After passing through the hall, in front of an arch, Zhao Tianyu pressed his fingerprint on a scanner and opened the nuclear power plant buried under several hundred meters.</br>
</br>
Finally, as he entered the interior of the Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant, Jiang Chen shockingly discovered something.</br>
</br>
It wasn't a nuclear power plant; it was a small fallout shelter!</br>
</br>
Large and small tents were set up inside in the empty halls, and in the back were the living quarters of the workers. Although Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant was designed to operate on its own for at least 50 years without maintenance, it was designed with a living space for 500 people.</br>
</br>
There were more than 500 people crowded there - at least a thousand people.</br>
</br>
"These are the aboriginals of the nuclear power plant... There should be no problems referring to them by this name." Zhao Tianyu walked forward with Jiang Chen and introduced him.</br>
</br>
From Zhao Tianyu, Jiang Chen immediately understood why he didn't see any corpses at the resort and the owners of the luxury cars in the garage didn't show any signs of leaving. Originally, those people didn't flee to fallout shelters several kilometers away when the nuclear war broke out. Instead, they directly hid in the nuclear power plant.</br>
</br>
When the nuclear war broke out, people with a conscience didn't keep the strategic reserve secret; they hid inside with a large group of despairing survivors.</br>
</br>
"Originally, these workers' dormitories were occupied by Mud Crabs. We cleared the area after we came."</br>
</br>
"Even the most optimistic will become depressed after living underground for a long time. These people aren't the easiest to get along with, but they also need us to maintain order, and they share their extra food with us."</br>
</br>
"Food? Where do they get food from?" Jiang Chen confused.</br>
</br>
"Mushrooms, algae, and seaweed are all suitable for growth here." Zhao Tianyu grinned. "The nuclear power plant's deuterium refinery has a pipeline that connects with the sea. Not only can it obtain seaweed, but there are a few small fish occasionally."</br>
</br>
Planting mushrooms at a nuclear power plant was certainly a different taste of life.</br>
</br>
However, Jiang Chen didn't mock their food and remained silent along the way. Avoiding speaking was the best way to disguise himself.</br>
</br>
At the end of the workers' dormitories, two guards stood at the entrance in the corner. This place was Fallout Shelter 079 Exploration Team's station. After entering the so-called command room, Zhao Tianyu moved a chair over for Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Let's sit."</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen sat in the chair and leaned on the rifle next to him.</br>
</br>
Zhao Tianyu sat across from him, fingers crossed on the table, and asked Jiang Chen seriously:</br>
</br>
"Does the Fog Demon still exist?"</br>
</br>
"If you're referring to that shadow with an axe, I think he's still here," Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
A bitter smile appeared on Zhao Tianyu's face.</br>
</br>
"Sure enough... can you tell me how you escaped it?"</br>
</br>
"He sneaked from behind. I noticed then I shot him."</br>
</br>
Although Jiang Chen said that in an understatement, Zhao Tianyu still felt the danger in his words.</br>
</br>
"Good lord, you certainly have a few moves. We had 117 brothers at one time, but only twenty of them made it in here. If I'm not mistaken, those brothers running down the hill must've all died."</br>
</br>
"How are you so certain?" Jiang Chen asked.</br>
</br>
"It's easy to guess. If they returned to the town alive, the director wouldn't have waited for so many years to collect our bodies," Zhao Tianyu said, "What's your plan now?"</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, Jiang Chen said.</br>
</br>
"Take you back and bring these people along the way."</br>
</br>
It was inconvenient for him to transfer these nuclear fusion generators and nuclear fuel, and those who depended on nuclear energy would certainly not allow him to move those generators. However, if he could bring them to the outside, he believe they would be happy to give up this nuclear power plant.</br>
</br>
"We can't get there." Zhao Tianyu shook his head. "With the Fog Demon guarding outside, people are going to die. The thick fog is his territory. In his territory, we'll die."</br>
</br>
"What's this so-called Fog Demon?" Jiang Chen frowned.</br>
</br>
When he heard Jiang Chen asking this question, Zhao Tianyu let out a long sigh.</br>
</br>
"It's said that he used to be a person who belonged to Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant."</br>
</br>
After a short pause, he then continued.</br>
</br>
"And he was the one who opened the door and brought these poor people into the nuclear power plant..."</br>
</br>
</br>

</div></br>
</br>
More than two decades ago, the war broke out.</br>
</br>
The first nuclear bomb exploded in Europe, followed by Wanghai. NATO declared war on Pan-Asia Cooperation. All this happened suddenly, although both the economic crisis and the energy crisis were foreseeable problems, no one had ever thought the two would lead to a war.</br>
</br>
Human civilization had been peaceful for too long since the Cold War.</br>
</br>
Like other parts of the Pan-Asia Cooperation, this resort in Datun received war alarms within an hour after the collapse of the Holy Shield in Wanghai. However, it was almost impossible for people at a resort far away from an urban area to go to an urban fallout shelter within an hour.</br>
</br>
A feeling of despair overshadowed everyone.</br>
</br>
Faced with inevitable death, everyone was helpless. They couldn't do anything except cry and pray.</br>
</br>
At that point, one person stood up.</br>
</br>
He claimed to be an intelligence officer of the Pan-Asia Cooperation and guarded the secrets of the underground nuclear power plant. As one of the strategic reserves, the design of Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant was a quasi-fallout-shelter. Although there were no reserves of living necessities, it wouldn't be difficult to resist nuclear strikes.</br>
</br>
"... Then, under his leadership, people moved the entire resort's food, medicine, tents, and other living supplies into Clearwater Nuclear Power Plant." Zhao Tianyu told them.</br>
</br>
"What does this have to do with that Fog Demon?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"After that, something unbelievable happened." Zhao Tianyu shrugged then said, "You must've heard of genetic vaccines."</br>
</br>
"Yes."</br>
</br>
"The lucky ones can unlock special abilities through genetic vaccines; more common ones are fury, rapid healing, visual enhancement, etc., There are some more special abilities that even cannot be explained by science..."</br>
</br>
"Such as that Fog Demon?" Jiang Chen scowled. "...I thought it was a different species.'s</br>
</br>
"No, he's a person, and he was once a great man. Between his responsibilities and human nature, he made the right choice, but in the end, people weren't able to forgive him for some reason and he was forced out by the survivors." Zhao Tianyu laughed.</br>
</br>
"What unforgivable thing did he do?" asked Jiang Chen.</br>
</br>
"Thirteen years ago, the seawater pipeline that provided food for the survivors of the nuclear power plant was invaded by Mud Crabs. The survivors, who had never seen these creatures, were beaten by hungry Mud Crabs and fled. Not only did they lose the deuterium refinery, but they also lost the workers' dormitories. In order to drive away these Mud Crabs, he injected illicit drugs that didn't pass clinical trials, forcibly unlocked the hidden genetic code, drove away the Mud Crabs occupying the pipeline, and destroyed their nests."</br>
</br>
"What was unforgivable about this?" Jiang Chen laughed.</br>
</br>
"The unforgivable thing is what happened after. The illicit drug wasn't without its side effects. While unraveling the genetic code, that drug also caused a mutation in his V127 gene." After a pause, Zhao Tianyu smiled, lowered his voice and said, "The V127 mutation, also known as a cannibalism gene."</br>
</br>
</br>
"He ate people?" Jiang Chen was slightly caught off-guard.</br>
</br>
"No, but do you think a group of weak and pathetic people would allow a potential cannibal to live next door to them? What's more, the sneak ability he unlocked made him a natural killer. And in day to day life, he did show a desire for human flesh and blood." Zhao Tianyu smiled, but his smile was brutal.</br>
</br>
At that point, Jiang Chen could've guessed what happened next.</br>
</br>
The hero who originally saved everyone was expelled by the people he saved. He was expelled from the nuclear power station, disheartened by what happened, and faced the empty ruins outside. He exiled himself in the dust of radiation and became a true cannibal, hunting everyone who broke into this place or humans who intended to escape from there.</br>
</br>
"I know that much. If you want to find out more about him, you can go to Doctor Mike at the clinic. The illicit drug that was injected by the Fog Demon was made by him. He's a Portuguese foreigner, but his Chinese is quite good. He is also very easy to get along with," Zhao Tianyu said with a smile.</br>
</br>
"I will." Jiang Chen nodded.</br>
</br>
"It's getting late. I'll arrange a room for you."</br>
</br>
"I have to go back as soon as possible. There are still people waiting for me under the mountain." Jiang Chen shook his head.</br>
</br>
"It's very dangerous at night. During the day, the Fog Demon is just a ghost, but at night, he's the devil reincarnated," Zhao Tianyu said seriously.</br>
</br>
After weighing all the pros and cons, Jiang Chen eventually accepted his offer. Although he was unable to communicate with the outside world through radio in the underground facility, he and Lin Lin didn't need radio; they could use the Klein particle wave that could even transmit between timelines.</br>
</br>
When Jiang Chen entered the room provided by Zhao Tianyu, he checked all corners of the room and confirmed there was nothing spying on him. He immediately contacted Lin Lin. As soon as the call was connected, Lin Lin's anxious face appeared as a holographic image.</br>
</br>
"Where are you now? Why have you not come down yet?"</br>
</br>
"I've already entered the nuclear power plant... The situation on the mountain is a bit strange. I won't be able to explain it to you in a short time. In short, it's dangerous here. You shouldn't come up."</br>
</br>
When Lin Lin heard the mountains were dangerous, her face immediately turned pale.</br>
</br>
"Wait, are you in danger?"</br>
</br>
"No, I'm more worried about you... Well, you and Chen Guangning should return to the base first, and when I solve this issue, I'll come looking for you."</br>
</br>
After explaining the situation to her, Jiang Chen turned off the hologram and ended communication before heading outside the room.</br>
</br>
The people who lived there were very pale as they lived in the ground all year round without any sunlight exposure. This kind of paleness didn't look aesthetically pleasing, but rather, it was an unhealthy, morbid state. Walking in the hallway of this underground residence, Jiang Chen noticed that the people around him were watching him with vigilant eyes.</br>
</br>
There was curiosity and temptation, but there was almost more distrust.</br>
</br>
There was only one clinic in the entire Clearwater Nuclear Power Station. Jiang Chen found it without much effort and met Mike.</br>
</br>
When Mike saw Jiang Chen, he immediately recognized he was from the outside and he certainly looked surprised.</br>
</br>
"I guess you're not coming to see the doctor. But before you ask me any questions, I want to ask you first - how did you get in here?"</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen repeated the previous remarks he made to Zhao Tianyu.</br>
</br>
After listening to him, Mike nodded, dropped the pen he had been spinning in his hands, and sighed.</br>
</br>
"I see ... looks like not all hatred fades with time."</br>
</br>
"Compared to hatred, I think it's more like a beast's instinct that's driving him."</br>
</br>
Upon hearing Jiang Chen's words, Mike looked genuinely surprised for a moment before his expression was replaced by intrigue.</br>
</br>
"Oh? Can you explain in detail?"</br>
</br>
Upon hearing Mike's words, Jiang Chen smiled helplessly.</br>
</br>
[It was me who came to inquire about intelligence. How did I eventually become the person being questioned?]</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen selectively repeated his encounter with the Dog Demon. After listening to his story, the expression on Mike's face also gradually turned stern.</br>
</br>
After a moment of silence, he said slowly:</br>
</br>
"If my guesses are correct, he should've unlocked the third stage of the genetic code."</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 749: Suppress</br>
</div></br>
</br>
It was already February 27th and it was drawing closer and closer to the Month of Disaster.</br>
</br>
The Mud Crabs near the beach had begun to rattle, and some even ended their hibernation early and began to move ashore. After discovering the situation, Li Wang immediately organized troops to attack Mud Crabs and finish them before they could land.</br>
</br>
However, unlike the expeditionary forces who had seen stormy weather, the survivors working at the wall immediately collapsed emotionally.</br>
</br>
On the evening of the same day, under the instigation of moles of Town No. 79 in the labor force, all the survivors dropped their tools and gathered in the open space in front of Desperate Beach. A large crowd gathered of more than two thousand people.</br>
</br>
"Give us our wages! If you don't give us crystals, we won't work!"</br>
</br>
"Yes! We won't work!"</br>
</br>
"We're not free labor!"</br>
</br>
"Give me my hard-earned crystals!"</br>
</br>
"..."</br>
</br>
NAC soldiers temporarily surrounded the demonstrators, but there was no order and nobody knew what to do at the moment. After the deputy commander ordered his troops to control the situation, he immediately ran back to the command post and looked for Li Wang. The General wasn't there, so at the moment, he was the one with the decision-making power.</br>
</br>
"How many people are there after the strike?" After listening to the situation, Li Wang only asked one question.</br>
</br>
"Almost all," The deputy commander said while sweating profusely.</br>
</br>
Li Wang didn't say anything. He nodded and headed straight for the door.</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
It had been ten days since construction on the wall started. For all laborers involved in the project, NAC had generously provided food and shelter, so for these survivors, all the crystals they earned were theirs to keep.</br>
</br>
One day's wages were five crystals, so ten days would be fifty! The entrance to the fallout shelter was also exactly fifty crystals!</br>
</br>
With these fifty crystals, everyone had the opportunity to pay for admission to the fallout shelter. There was no need to join NAC's people in betting on this impossible-to-finish wall.</br>
</br>
It was precisely because of this that the survivors protested so loudly.</br>
</br>
Standing in front of these survivors and looking at the countless faces, Li Wang was lost in thought.</br>
</br>
If they gave them the crystals now, they would, without a doubt, run to the fallout shelter. Everyone knew the fallout shelter couldn't possibly hold everyone and would hold 1,000 more at maximum.</br>
</br>
Whoever ran the fastest could live.</br>
</br>
The rest could only die.</br>
</br>
Interestingly, Li Wang could detect the desire for survival from each of his pupils. When a person had a strong desire for survival, it would undoubtedly become a force to help him. However, when everyone collectively had a strong desire for survival, it would only speed up their collective destruction.</br>
</br>
"The project is only 75% completed, according to the order of the General..." The deputy commander whispered.</br>
</br>
</br>
If they failed to complete 80% of the project before March 1st, they would temporarily evacuate from the island. However, the deputy commander didn't finish his sentence because he wasn't sure what the captain meant.</br>
</br>
"The general hasn't returned yet," Li Wang said, "And there are eight hours before March 1st."</br>
</br>
The deputy commander smiled bitterly and said nothing. He just turned to look at those protesting.</br>
</br>
Only eight hours. Even if they were given two more days, he was afraid the wall still wouldn't be completed.</br>
</br>
"Your crystals are here!"</br>
</br>
Li Wang's roar interrupted the survivors' protests.</br>
</br>
Or rather, the keywords of his sentence attracted the attention of all survivors.</br>
</br>
The voices of the protest ceased. Li Wang gestured the deputy commander next to him and whispered two sentences.</br>
</br>
After listening to Li Wang, the deputy commander had somewhat of a bizarre expression, but he still nodded and left.</br>
</br>
Soon, a full, tall box half-person in height was carried up by two soldiers.</br>
</br>
The box fell heavily on the ground and a hole was formed in the sand. Li Wang only glanced at it before he said emotionlessly.</br>
</br>
"Open it."</br>
</br>
"Roger that!"</br>
</br>
The soldiers who brought the box saluted. In front of everyone, they opened the box.</br>
</br>
For a brief moment, the dark green light made all the survivors hold their breaths. A pair of black pupils were painted green!</br>
</br>
A box full of crystals!</br>
</br>
They had never seen so many crystals!</br>
</br>
Looking at the greedy sight, Li Wang sneered and said emotionlessly, "I heard... Someone doubted our ability to pay?"</br>
</br>
The protesting survivors looked at each other blankly and didn't know what to say.</br>
</br>
Seeing that the situation was about to be controlled, those with ulterior motives naturally couldn't stand it. At this time, someone hid in the crowd and shrieked.</br>
</br>
"Since you have money, why don't you pay us!?"</br>
</br>
Soon, people in the crowd began to echo the same sentiment.</br>
</br>
"That's right! Since you actually have the crystals, why don't you give us our wages?!"</br>
</br>
The momentum of the protest once again heated up.</br>
</br>
Li Wang stood there and looked indifferently at the furious faces. From the crowd, he suddenly saw a gloating face. In a flash, he seemed to understand something, and he sneered.</br>
</br>
Quietly waiting for all the frustrations to be unloaded, he raised his pistol and pressed the trigger at the sky.</br>
</br>
"Boomâ"</br>
</br>
When the gun was shot, the crowd was instantly silenced.</br>
</br>
Li Wang glanced at these survivors and slowly said:</br>
</br>
"The first person who started the commotion, the second person to agree with him, and the third person to respond, please come out."</br>
</br>
No one moved; obviously, no one would move.</br>
</br>
Li Wang sneered then said:</br>
</br>
"The whistleblower will be rewarded with ten crystals per person."</br>
</br>
After that, Li Wang didn't waste a word. He grabbed a handful of crystals and tossed them on the ground.</br>
</br>
"No need to wait for a few days."</br>
</br>
In an instant, everyone held their breaths then their gazes focused on the crystals of the ground and involuntarily flitted to the one who shrieked. Their eyes were like swords, pointing out the mole causing a mess.</br>
</br>
As he was stared at by the people around him, the short man shook his head in a panic.</br>
</br>
"You - why are you looking at me? No, I didn't shout first..."</br>
</br>
"Ten crystals." Li repeated emotionlessly then added another sentence: "Only ten whistleblowers will be chosen. If you push him up, you get the crystals."</br>
</br>
When that was said, no one hesitated anymore.</br>
</br>
Many pairs of hands were pressed against the little man. It wasn't the will of a certain person, but the greed of a group who pushed him out of the crowd.</br>
</br>
"No, not me. Fu*k, don't push me!"</br>
</br>
Nobody cared how he screamed. Along with him, the first two people to agree were immediately shoved to the front of the crowd. People rushed to the crystals on the ground and even started fighting. Li Wang ignored them but looked at the short man.</br>
</br>
With a chill down his spine, the short man gritted his teeth and met Li Wang's eyes as he said wickedly:</br>
</br>
"What's wrong with that? You owe people crystals, and you don't want anyone to say it?"</br>
</br>
He was betting that if NAC still wanted this project to go on, they wouldn't do anything to him. As long as he escaped this, he could return to Fallout Shelter 79 and claim his reward. Although he firmly believed that NAC wouldn't do anything to him, Li Wang's stare made him feel nervous.</br>
</br>
His stare was just like staring at a dead person.</br>
</br>
"I don't know who the master is behind you, and I'm not interested in finding out," said Li Wang in a voice everyone could hear.</br>
</br>
He wasn't speaking to a certain person but to the moles still hidden in the crowd who hadn't yet been caught.</br>
</br>
"What do you want?" the short man asked anxiously.</br>
</br>
Li Wang grinned.</br>
</br>
"What's your name?"</br>
</br>
"Lin-Lin Zhengyang," the short man said in a trembling voice.</br>
</br>
"Excellent. I will write that on the grave for you."</br>
</br>
As soon as his voice faded, before anyone could respond, Li Wang pointed the pistol at Lin Zhengyang's forehead and pressed the trigger.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<div class="caption">Chapter 750: The True Form of the Fog Demon</br>
</div></br>
</br>
Bang!</br>
</br>
The sound of a gunshot pierced the silence on the beach and the survivors who were fighting for the crystals stopped and looked slyly in the direction of the gunshot. When they pushed out the man named Lin Zhengyang, they never thought the NAC would shoot him...</br>
</br>
"Ahhhh!"</br>
</br>
Seeing as their accomplice was killed, the remaining two people screamed and ran away. However, they had yet to take two steps before the soldiers standing on the edge of the beach lifted their rifles and without hesitation, turned the two into sieves.</br>
</br>
The gun smoke dissipated. Looking at the three people fallen in pools of blood, the beach was dead silent.</br>
</br>
No one thought that NAC, who had always been "nice," would suddenly execute the three people who caused the protest. Looking at Li Wang's cold eyes, a chill went down all the survivors' spines.</br>
</br>
"We have the option to leave this place." Li Wang pointed at his own feet then pointed to the sky.</br>
</br>
"We have airships. Just like when we arrived, if we can't defend this place, we could withdraw from here first and wait until the Month of Disaster has passed and come back. Losses? Do you think those crabs could destroy our fortress? Even if they can, we can build another one. What about you guys.? You can wait for your deaths here and feed the crabs."</br>
</br>
The survivors held their breaths.</br>
</br>
It wasn't that they hadn't considered this option, but they all had the same fluke mentality.</br>
</br>
The fallout shelter could hold around 1,000 more people. They had a fifty percent chance of getting in; no matter how unlucky they were, they felt that the person who died shouldn't be themselves.</br>
</br>
Li Wang scanned the survivors.</br>
</br>
He knew that as the entity with the greatest to gain in the Month of Disaster, Fallout Shelter 79 had the most motivation to do these things. At the same time, he also knew there were more than three survivors disrupting everything.</br>
</br>
But no matter how many moles were left, what he wanted to say wouldn't change.</br>
</br>
"We said from the beginning that the crystals will be paid after the project is completed. Now, I will add that if the project isn't completed, we will still give you these shiny things before our evacuation. But I promise that by then, even if you have the money, you won't have the life to spend them."</br>
</br>
"Our troops will fight for time for you, and whether you survive will depend on you.Â Don't expect me to give you crystals in advance and let you fight to get into the fallout shelter. I'll be clear with you - you must be dreaming to think that will happen!"</br>
</br>
"You only have two choices now."</br>
</br>
"Either finish the project and live, or throw away the tools in your hands and get the hell back to your kennel to wait for your death!"</br>
</br>
...</br>
</br>
Turning into a mist wasn't the same as sneak, but the integration of the body into the fog was in the true sense, disappearing</br>
</br>
</br>
Compared to fury and other self-enhancing capabilities, this ability to Mystify was undoubtedly somewhat supernatural. After all, neither thermal imaging nor heartbeat sensing could capture the user's tracks. However, unlike other undiscovered abilities, the data on the mystify capability was documented in the Pan-Asian Cooperation hidden genetic code research archive.</br>
</br>
The so-called mystify couldn't turn the body into water vapor, but when the air humidity broke through a certain critical value, it allowed the entire body's particles to hide between the gaps the third and fourth dimensions, resulting in the ability to disappear.</br>
</br>
Fog wasn't the cause of the phenomenon but rather, an enabler of the phenomenon.</br>
</br>
In simple terms, he could hide his form only in the presence of fog. However, with the current state of technology, the inevitable link between "fog" and this ability couldn't be explained for the time being. Even the scientists in the twenty-second century had little knowledge in the study of fourth dimensions.</br>
</br>
When he heard this, Jiang Chen's face suddenly appeared quirky.</br>
</br>
[It seems that any ability to evolve to the third level is related to the four-dimensional Klein particle.]</br>
</br>
However, this wasn't the focus.</br>
</br>
Since he knew the weakness of the Fog Demon, he had already thought about how to deal with that guy.</br>
</br>
The next day at noon.</br>
</br>
After he bid farewell to Zhao Tianyu, Jiang Chen embarked on the elevator back to the basement.</br>
</br>
The door to the elevator opened. Jiang Chen didn't release the drones from his backpack. He immediately threw out the lighting in his hand and walked outside the door.</br>
</br>
The murderous air was filled with thick fog. The fog was thick in a vicious form that was touchable. The moist air was like the hand of the Slim Reaper. Under the thin illumination of the flares, everything looked like shadows.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen breathed the vicious air and said softly:</br>
</br>
"I guess you're nearby although I don't know where you are, am I right?"</br>
</br>
He wasn't sure whether the Fog Demon heard him, nor was he certain whether it was possessed any human consciousness to understand what he said.</br>
</br>
With the rifle in his hand, Jiang Chen looked around the empty room before he sneered.</br>
</br>
For the Fog Demon with close-ranged weapons, if he made up his mind to prevent anyone from escaping from here, then this hospital was definitely his last chance. Once the battlefield changed into open space, his chances of winning would be reduced by at least half.</br>
</br>
Jiang Chen could feel he was waiting for an opportunity, but Jiang Cheng didn't show anxiety. He headed for the basement doorway.</br>
</br>
A raised foot hung over the basement door. Jiang Chen didn't step out of the door but slammed the door to the basement and locked himself and the Fog Demon in the basement.</br>
</br>
Although he could hide his body between the third and fourth dimensions, this didn't mean he could teleport through a wall! This was his weakness. After entering this kind of "mist state," the ability to rely on fog was only possible inside the fog, and there was obviously no fog in the walls.</br>
</br>
Almost at the same moment when he closed the door, a strong wind blew at him.</br>
</br>
However, this strike failed to hit Jiang Chen. It slashed into empty air.</br>
</br>
The Fog Demon that showed its figure paused for a split second. His ugly beastlike face was filled with disbelief. His prey just disappeared in front of him. This strange hunting experience was something he never experienced before.</br>
</br>
But then, he suddenly noticed the prey's backpack was on the ground.</br>
</br>
A strong uneasiness entered his heart. The beast's instincts drove him to respond and immediately started to mystify. Almost at the same time, the backpack suddenly exploded.</br>
</br>
The explosion wasn't particularly powerful, but the scene was spectacular.</br>
</br>
In the enchanted white fog, a string of powders sprinkled every corner of the room. The coldness instantly filled the room in a split second, big water drops began to crystallize and the air humidity dropped at a visibly noticeable rate!</br>
</br>
It was dry ice!</br>
</br>
A whole backpack of dry ice!</br>
</br>
With an agonizing shout, the Fog Demon, who just suffered frostbite, stumbled out from the fading mist, and the illusory shadow began to fade from his body. The ugly face started to gradually return to a human-like appearance.</br>
</br>
Just like a werewolf after the full moon, he returned to his weak figure.</br>
</br>
"It's really surprising... Although I heard the Fog Demon was once an intelligence officer, I thought you might be connected to the Fog Demon somehow. But I really didn't think you would be the Fog Demon himself."</br>
</br>
When the fog dispersed, Jiang Chen returned to the room and held the hilt of the laser sword in his hand. With a perplexed expression, he gazed at the man curled up on the ground.</br>
</br>
It was no one other than the intelligence trafficker in Town No. 79, the man named Mole...</br>
</br>
</br>
